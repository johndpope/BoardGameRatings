			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing up is weird. Every time you think you understand where you are and what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, it all changes. Get used to middle school, suddenly you&amp;rsquo;re in high school. Figure out your place in high school, then you get sent off to college. And college, well, college is the deep end. Until you finally push through it and have to find a job. Along the way, you have to choose what &amp;ndash; and, more importantly, who &amp;ndash; matters most to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die For You is a roleplaying game about all of that, and also monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
