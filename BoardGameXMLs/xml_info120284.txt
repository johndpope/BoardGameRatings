							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Striker</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The baron&amp;rsquo;s yearly feast was in full swing. A stage set along the eastern wall sported an entire troop of performers creating the lively tunes to which the nobles of the kingdom danced. The food sat heaped high on silver trays, enough to feed an entire village. The king sat at the head of the massive table, goblet in hand, in preparation of a toast. Amidst the noise and celebration, the group of well-trained guards stood at attention, all oblivious to the cloaked figure scaling the outside walls. Like a shadow, still and silent, the Striker slipped into the palace and waited. The baron, his mark, would not live to see the rising sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strikers are a select class of rogue who specialize in the art of focused killing. These individuals have the uncanny ability to move into well-protected organizations, controlled territories, and guarded strongholds undetected, all with the intent of recovering stolen items (or some other mission) typically assigned to them by their superiors. Sometimes the Strikers are there because of personal grudges or age-old vendettas against their people. Some use their talents to become professional thieves. Whatever their motivations, many that cross these dangerous individuals never live to tell the&lt;br/&gt;tales of their exploits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
