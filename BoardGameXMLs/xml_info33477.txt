			<description>A simple abstract strategy game, suitable for adults and children alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In head to head player, players take turns to place their shapes, until one player can no longer play. The game is rather simplem, although an experienced player will defeat a newcomer, as it must be taken into account what shapes both you and your opponent have remaining to play well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the solitaire game, the game instructions come with 19 puzzles to try and recreate. Some of them are suprisingly challenging to do. You can also create your own challenges by placing the king (and optionally one or two blocks) on the board and trying to fill in the remaining space with the remaining shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submit a better description and contact Admin Skelebone for a GeekGold reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
