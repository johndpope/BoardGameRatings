			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High up in the hills, just outside of town, there lies a hidden cave. Members of the cult make their way there in secret, at night. Hooded, disguised, they move furtively, in fear of their discovery. For if they were found out, they could be tried in a court of law or &amp;mdash; even worse! &amp;mdash; forced to share the fruits of their worship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town has a wizard, you see, and he lords it over everyone. The wealthy flock to his mansion, eager to sample the food he grows inside his own private greenhouse. Beneath the magical stones that emit health-inducing sunlight, the wizard has all manner of exotic herbs and tubers growing. But those in the cult have grown weary of his arrogance, his favouritism, his insidious mind control, and they want him gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And all the strange, glowing god they go to meet inside the caves wants are the wizards lights. It hands out useful and magical wonders, exhorting them to take careful action. It whispers that one, irresistible promise to them: &amp;ldquo;I will plunge your enemies into eternal darkness in exchange for their light.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
