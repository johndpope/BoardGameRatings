			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick and Fun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you just want to play a roleplaying game without the hassle of learning a mountain of rules. Unbelievably Simple Roleplaying has the answer. This streamlined ruleset will get you and your friends around the table and on an adventure in no time. With quick and easy mechanics that both new players and veterans will love, USR opens up a gateway to infinite worlds, whether you want to play as detectives in Victorian England, witch hunters in a dark city or warriors in a magical realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play it Your Way&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USR is an easy game to learn but there are optional rules throughout if you fancy making it a bit more advanced. Feel free to add your own rules or change current ones to match your preferences. The most important thing is that you and your group have fun with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's New?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's New In USR Version 2.0? This is the second version of the USR system, and while the game hasn't changed much there have been a couple of alterations. For one, the layout has had a lick of fresh paint. Hope you like it. The second is that using Specialisms during combat has changed to make it even more streamlined. Thirdly, narrative points have been adjusted to offer a more structured way of using them. Finally, after lots of feedback the book now includes more advice for new players starting out with roleplaying games. Other than that, it's all the same, unbelievably simple game you love!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USR 2.0 features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Super fast character creation&lt;br/&gt;     Generic system covering a multitude of genres&lt;br/&gt;     Rules-lite gameplay that encourages roleplay&lt;br/&gt;     Role-play centric advancement&lt;br/&gt;     Quick, modular combat&lt;br/&gt;     Simple one-die task resolution&lt;br/&gt;     Dynamic rules for any weapon imaginable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
