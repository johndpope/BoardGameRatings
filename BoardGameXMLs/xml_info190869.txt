							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Adventure Module RG1: Into the Mound of the Reptile God</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terror has returned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mound of the Lizard King. Once that dreadful mound of muddy earth and stone had risen from the murky waters of a foul and deadly marsh, its inhabitants spreading terror throughout the surrounding lands. The Lizard King is gone now, slain by brave adventurers a decade ago. The murky waters have receded, leaving the tunnel-riddled edifice of evil to tower over a barren, lifeless land. Some claim the mound is empty. Others believe that creatures still creep through the darkened tunnels, waiting to prey on unsuspecting travelers. Then there are the rumors of hidden treasure, strange lights and sounds and signs that the cold-blooded creatures that once gathered there have returned. Are you brave enough, skilled enough, to discover what lurks within the Mound of the Reptile God?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the Mound of the Reptile God is the first in a new series of adventures from New Realms Publishing. Hinted at in previous adventures, including Tombs of Terror and The Tomb of Mergal Thar, Into the Mound of the Reptile God begins to unveil a dark and deadly plot that has been developing behind the scenes for many adventures. The adventure takes the characters into the depths of the infamous Mound of the Lizard King. But beware, for who knows what now lurks within the abandoned lizardman lair. And what of the rumors that the reptile men are returning? Delve into the dark depths, battle the deadly inhabitants, overcome the dangerous traps and seek the lost treasures of The Mound of the Reptile God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Module includes a new Adventure Record, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards and 18 Treasure cards. In addition, you can expand the adventure with decks from Custom Encounters and Custom Encounters II. The adventure can also be tied into Expedition to Erathor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, Into the Mound of the Reptile God can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM. The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
