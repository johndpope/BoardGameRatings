							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creature Weekly Volume 7</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Octavirate Games presents Creature Weekly, a pack of new monsters available for download each Wednesday. Need new challenges, adversaries and allies? We have you covered. Each entry is illustrated and features variant rules support and genre adjustment information so you can easily fit the creatures into your campaign, whether it is set in the wilds of a medieval empire, the streets of a modern metropolis or the depths of far-flung space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume Six features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Aufnac is a horrible crocodilian beast of mysterious origins. It is a creature with appetites as unusual as its appearance and is a formidable opponent for players of any genre.&lt;br/&gt;     The Balefire Drake. Based on the legend of Saint George of Cappadocia these serpentine beasts breathe venomous flame and hunger for innocent life rather than gold and gems.&lt;br/&gt;     The Inquisitor Devils are the regulating force of the war of Demons and Devils. They patrol the ranks of the damned, promoting and devoting the fiends of law in a manner befitting their service. They do not limit their patrols to the worlds of swords and sorcery, however, and these literal devil's advocates find the modern world quite to their liking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
