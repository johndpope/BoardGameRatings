			<description>Investor is a game about owning and investing in companies. Each player starts of with a private fortune, a company and a company fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn order is decided by the company you start with and every time you pass start you will be able to buy more companies - and thereby get more turns each round. Passing start also adds more money to your fortune and allows you to pay out dividend from your company if you have qualified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is decided by rolling either one or two dice - the player decides - but if you roll 2 and get two of the same you will receive a bonus. Where you land you will have to pay rent but that will also allow you to place your company logo on the square. From then on all players that land on the square will have to pay you rent as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get your logo on 5 different types of squares or a lot of players land on the same squares this makes the companies on them worth more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you can pay to get helpers in the form of lawyers and accountants that makes it possible to buy and sell more companies and negate consequences of special squares and event cards such as tax and a visit from the Fraud Squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts it is decided when to end the game: At a certain time, at a certain fortune, at a certain number of companies owned or so on. The game should have a length of minimum an hour though. When the game ends your fortune is tallied up and the one with the largest one wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
