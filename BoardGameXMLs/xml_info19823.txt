			<description>Abstract tile-laying maze game where players try to be the first to get 4 pawns to the opposite end of the board by placing &amp;quot;walled&amp;quot; corridor tiles across and empty grid. Movement across tiles of your own colour is easy, but there are special rules for crossing other players' corridors or dealing with situations where pawns find themselves blocked by other pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 60 tiles each, equally split between the 3 different types of corridor. The backside of the tiles show 3 dice results that come into play when players attempt cross other people's corridors. Players pick the tile of their choice, add it to the board, then move one of their pawns as far as they are allowed. The next player does likewise. This continuous until someone succesfully crossed the 10 square gap to the other side of the board with all their pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Austrian game was self-published and appeared in a large, lavish, tailormade plastic wallet that offered space for the folded cardboard board and had a seperate compartment to hold the wooden pawns, the tiles and the tiny die. The designer later founded his own imprint, Leobener Spiele.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
