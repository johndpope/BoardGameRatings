							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blockade Runner</name>
									
			<description>Blockade Runner was inspired by an actual Yankee civil war game.  The chance of the Runner getting into port is about the same as in 1864.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the USA began the blockage, merchant ships became runners.  The Rewards were worth the risk.  Blockade Runners were leaving England hoping for a big payday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two, three or four people play this fast acting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Ages 10 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
