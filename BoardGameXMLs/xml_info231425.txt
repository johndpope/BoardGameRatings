			<description>Four individuals wake up in a run down room in an abandoned apartment building.  Their memories have been wiped clean, with not even a recollection of their own identity.  They do however possess a strange ability to sense each others thoughts.  It quickly becomes clear that they have been deposited in that particular place, and time, to accomplish a task on behalf of a mysterious controller.  They must now venture out into an unfamiliar world with no choice but to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MyStory is a 1-4 player, co-operative board game.  Built as a living-novel, game operators will progress through an immersive, custom story deck that will reward success by directing them to specific chapters in the story book.  As the experience progresses questions will be answered, but even more will be presented, until everything comes into focus in the final episode.&lt;br/&gt;Determine your objectives and solve them on the game board by strategically placing location tiles, encountering the stories characters and manipulating assets you discover along the way.  Everything will have to come together perfectly for those objectives to be accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;Space and time, this world and beyond, faith and creation, and finally, reality.  Join in My Story, help solve the Mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
