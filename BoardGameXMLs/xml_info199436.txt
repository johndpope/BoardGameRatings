			<description>Are you ready for a pop-culture trivia game where you have to think up the questions, your opponent provides the answer, and we rely on the Internet to settle the bet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handheld 69-card deck features the question prompts from popular categories like movies, TV, sports, corporations, famous people, places, and things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You versus me, let's go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I played the card &amp;quot;US Politicians, current age,&amp;quot; and said to you, &amp;quot;Donald Trump, 67 and a half,&amp;quot; would you say &amp;quot;Over&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Under&amp;quot;?  Once answered, use your phone to look it up and settle the bet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Switch roles, play to 9.  That simple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
