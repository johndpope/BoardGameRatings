			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Sceptre will take you beyond your wildest imagination to a land of infinite possibilities and limitless adventure. 4 channel sound. 4000 locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Islands Of The Western Sea the king orders the creation of the Dark Sceptre, to defeat the Northlanders. He is, however, defeated and his enemies grabbed the very instrument he thought to destroy them with. This sceptre must be found and destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do so, the player commands a band of warriors. Each warrior reacts to commands like kill, protect, defend, seek, bewitch and petrify. Several orders can be given at once, and carried out in sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's one other group of warriors which are your adversaries. Another 5 groups can be your enemies or allies, depending on your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
