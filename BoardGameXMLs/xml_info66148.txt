			<description>(User summary, distilled from Introduction and various chapters):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Guardians of Sol, players take the role of high-tech law enforcement officers serving the governing bodies of the Tetra-League as well as MACE (the league&amp;rsquo;s &amp;quot;Military Assault and Combat Expeditionary&amp;quot; forces). G/Sol agents are professionals, experts in their fields who undertake the highest priority assignments (such as hunting terrorists, pirates, cyber-hackers, and even rogue Battle Born troopers). Since most humans are tainted by the Pacification Virus, billions of citizens rely on G/Sol for protection. It is a heavy burden, but the skills and equipment available to G/Sol are superior to those of the Battle Born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G/Sol&amp;rsquo;s duties are many and varied. Agents collect military intelligence and serve as troops, judicial enforcers, and system governors. They are the only squads entrusted with the defense grids and matrix records on Terra. They also monitor worm hole traffic and oversee the transport of restricted purified substances for use in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In times of war, G/Sol handles POWs, and plans and implements psychological warfare operations. They control the Tetra-League's &amp;quot;Bridging Unit,&amp;quot; which operates and defends specialized worm-hole junctions used for rapid troop deployments. They also handle combat engineering and all large scale anti-armor and orbital defense platforms not otherwise assigned to the Fusiliers. For the most part, though, G/Sol are the cops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guardians of Sol expansion for Era Ten introduces new investigative and combat skills, new power armor and weapons, new starship guidelines, and new combat and progression tables. The game also includes new Quick-and-Dirty systems and valuable tips for planning and running exciting police-style adventures, to make the referee&amp;rsquo;s job easier and more enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guardians of Sol is a stand-alone game that includes all rules needed for play. It meshes seamlessly with the Battle Born RPG, the Era Ten RPG, and other sci-fi role-play products by Better Games, but is easily adaptable to any Sci-Fi role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guardians of Sol first appeared in print in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer Vol 2, Issue 5(the ISBN number refers to this printing). Supplements were published in subsequent issues of Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer and on Better Games' Web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
