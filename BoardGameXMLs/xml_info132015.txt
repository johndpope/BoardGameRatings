			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full Creative Commons SRD text of the Dungeon World game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon World is a world of fantastic adventure. A world of magic, gods and demons, of good and evil, law and chaos. Brave heroes venture into the most dangerous corners of the land in search of gold and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers take many shapes in Dungeon World. The races of elves, men, dwarves and halflings all have their heroes. Sometimes, they&amp;rsquo;re the Fighter, like Walton or Olive, near-invincible beasts of battle encased in iron armor. Others are more mysterious&amp;mdash;Rath or Lilliastre, for example &amp;mdash; a Wizard busy conjuring up and wielding the wicked forces of magic. Treasure and glory is sought by the holy Cleric, a tricky Thief, a mighty Paladin and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t all easy heroics and noble bravery, though. Every time the Ranger guides his friends through the ancient woods, there are a hundred things waiting to bite his head off. Slavering hordes of goblin troops, maybe. Or is this the Cursed Wood, where dwells the Gray Witch? Maybe this time through it&amp;rsquo;ll be the throngs of hateful dead, looking to drag a meaty corpse back to their lair. Scary, sure, but there&amp;rsquo;s treasure, too. More gold and jewels and magic lost to man have fallen between the cracks in the world than you can imagine. Who better to retrieve it than a band of stalwart heroes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are those heroes. You go where others can&amp;rsquo;t or won&amp;rsquo;t. There are monstrous things lurking in the world. Are you ready to face them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
