			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NFL Tour is a spinoff sequel to EA&amp;rsquo;s NFL Street series. The game takes NFL players and puts them in a simplified, arcade-style, match in an outdoor arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of game modes to choose from: Exhibition, Smash &amp;amp; Dash, Redzone Rush, Online Play, and Tour mode. Smash &amp;amp; Dash and Redzone Rush are mini-games where players aim to hold onto the ball or score from the 20 yard line, respectively. Tour mode is the campaign where players can build a team and hit the road to climb to the top of a ladder-style tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose from a simplified playbook of a few running and passing plays on offense, as well as a couple of trick plays. Gamers also have the option of competing against opponents online in either ranked or unranked matchups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
