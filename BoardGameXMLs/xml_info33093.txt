							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Hog</name>
									
			<description>Children's game rated Ages 7 and up that has nice wooden vehicle playing pieces and board representing a road map. Has unique feature where a train travels across the map and can block vehicle movement.  From box bottom:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A wild race and chase.  ROAD HOG... You won't get hauled before a judge for playing it - but you'll definitely have some uproarious fun in your scramble down the highways to reach New City, and to see that the other drivers don't get there first!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
