			<description>Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marvel: Future Fight has been described as a dungeon crawler. Players have the option to use either virtual joystick and button controls or tap-based controls. During a level, players have the option to use normal attacks as well as more powerful skills unique to each hero. Some skills have cooldowns lasting as long as 30 seconds. Players travel in a three-hero team, with the player able to switch between heroes at any time during a game, although if you switch from Hero 1 to Hero 2, you will have to wait a bit before being able to switch back to Hero 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are multiple kinds of missions: Villain Siege, in which players form a 3-man team to battle a boss, Daily Missions, mini-stories that change every day, Story Missions, which are part of the main storyline, Special Missions, side missions with stories based on the Guardians of the Galaxy and Marvel's Ant-Man, and World Boss, in which players form a 3-man team and 5-man support team to battle one of multiple special bosses. Story Missions allow the use of clear tickets, which instantly gives the players the rewards for completing the mission without having to play through it. Each type of mission provides a mixed pool of rewards. Special Missions, World Boss, and Story Missions provide level-exclusive Biometrics, Daily Missions provide ISO-8, and Villain Siege provides a mixed pool. There are four types of Arena Battles: Timeline Battles are 3-man team PvP battles; Team-Up Play, a co-op battle with up to 3 online players on a team. Battleworld, a once-daily event usually limited to teams with 4*-6* heroes; Alliance Battle, available once you have joined an alliance, a once-daily event that rewards xp for the alliance as well as rewards for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mission uses energy to play. Energy is gained by leveling up your SHIELD base, or through in game rewards and achievements. There are over 60 different playable heroes, each with unique skills and attacks. The player can have a maximum of 5 teams set up. There are also team bonuses, which, if the player has certain members on the team give buffs to the team members. Heroes are unlocked and ranked up by obtaining Biometrics, which can be found in certain missions as well as the shop. Heroes can also be leveled up through the use of EXP chips. Players are able to customize heroes to their playstyle, such as upgrading skills, gear, and equipping ISO-8 gems. Upgrading skills makes them do more damage, upgrading gear improves a specific part of the hero, like HP or Attack Speed, and equipping ISO-8 provides varying buffs. In the shop, in addition to Biometrics, players can also buy chests, energy, clear tickets, ISO-8, Biometric packages, and other supplies. There is a separate store for uniforms. Uniforms typically grant buffs to the hero, like extra damage to a class. There is also a SHIELD Lab, which has four possible buildings that can be built: an Antimatter generator, a Warping device. Biometric Converter, and a mini-store. The Antimatter generator generates Antimatter used to build, upgrade, and use the other devices. The Warping device allows players to warp three heroes on missions, and the heroes eventually return with rewards. All heroes used are still playable in missions. The mini-store stocks frequently changing items, such as upgrading items, ISO-8, and sometimes even Biometrics. The Biometric converter converts two already owned biometrics to a biometric of a random hero in a set of heroes that is also frequently rotated.[2]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features a Journey tab, in which players complete certain objectives or missions to gain a reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%3A_Future_Fight Marvel: Future Fight]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
