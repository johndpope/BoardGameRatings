			<description>Democracy was published in the year of the first democratic elections in South Africa - 1994.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Democracy you are the leader of a political party. All players try to increase their influence with partymembers and their assets such as business, news papers, TV etc. (75 influence cards). Some of the character- and asset-cards show guaranteed votes. The assets must be assigned to a character.&lt;br/&gt;Players can trade their influence cards (assets) freely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 120 event cards with positive and negative effects - so there is a lot of luck. These generate income, which is needed to pay some bad events or the travel-costs from region to region by car or plane, or have direct effects to your political reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partymembers travel throughout the country canvassing in the regions. Each region has a base resistance of 7. The influence of the canvassing partymember(s) + their assets + D6 must be greater to win the region. Players mark their regions with vote counters - each region is worth 1 vote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An election is called - 2 ways:&lt;br/&gt;- Automatically after all 50 regions are won, or&lt;br/&gt;- A player can call for an election if he has one of 3 election-card (and only after a minimum of rounds are over, depending on number of players).&lt;br/&gt;Than the last 5 rounds are played. In this &amp;quot;window period&amp;quot; nearly everything is allowed. Players can play special influence cards such as muckrakers, callgirls, third forces or assassins to &amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot; the political reputation or even kill the party leader. Hopefully he has (and can pay) bodyguards ...&lt;br/&gt;Only in this period a player can take a region from another party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning of the game - 2 ways:&lt;br/&gt;- When all other party leaders are killed you win&lt;br/&gt;- After the election, the player with the most votes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
