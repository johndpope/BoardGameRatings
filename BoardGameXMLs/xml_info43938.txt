			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing epitomizes the pulp era like the zeppelin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world of economic depression, totalitarianism, war, and a creeping sense of wider conflict to come, the hulls of the rigid airships seemed to reflect everything good and noble in mankind. They were human potential realized. Simply put, they were just damned cool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zeppelin Adventures brings the majesty and glamour of airships to your d20 pulp campaign. This 60-page PDF, written by Jackson Kuhl, features three pulse-pounding adventures:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Operation Zephyr, a straight-forward action adventure mixed with light intrigue;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Ghouls of the Gasbags, a brief horror/suspense adventure meant to be played in a single gaming session; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Where Zeppelins Dare, an espionage adventure in the spirit of spy-novelist Alistair MacLean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, we present game information on airships, including full D20 System stats on five different zeppelins, cut-away diagrams, full deckplans and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to add airships to your pulp D20 game can be found in this book. Take to the skies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
