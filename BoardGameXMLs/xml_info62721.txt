			<description>The game board is a city map on which the players try to deliver mail cards. The cards are designed as letters, packages, postcards etc., and the players hold various ones of these. By rolling dice, the players move across the board, trying to get rid of their mail; helped or obstructed by event cards. The first player to get rid of all cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
