			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Plug-In system for the Fuzion game system, based on a magic system I had in a home-brew game system I cooked up many years ago (the early 1980s). The system was called Fantastic Adventure, but I initially decided to call this the Tran Magic Plug-In, after the world in which that game was set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tra (pronounced TEE-rah) was a world vaguely similar to Earth, though it was decidedly different in many ways. Somewhere in the distant past, some 3000 years ago, an Occurrence had taken place that had altered certain geographical features, destroyed much of the high-tech civilization that existed at the time, and unleashed magic on the world. Those are, in fact, the only details of the Occurrence which survived to the time of the PCs. Elves, Dwarves, and similar people lived among men, as did a number of sentient species that would look to use like anthropomorphized animals. This was a rough-and-tumble world, with as much post-Apocalypse and Wild West to its atmosphere as high fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it had its own method for doing magic &amp;mdash; one which cried out for its own system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time, the only way I could see to use such a unique magic system was to create my own game system from the ground up. As it turned out, most of that game&amp;rsquo;s systems stank; only the action-management system (which used an extension of the concepts behind Hero&amp;rsquo;s SPD chart) and the magic system were smooth enough to warrant continued survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, with Fuzion, one can build sub-systems (aka Plug-Ins) as needed. This, at last, was an opportunity for the Fantastic Adventure magic system to be resurrected without re-launching (not to mention re-creating) the entire system. Of course, some of the specifics needed to be drawn from existing Fuzion plug-ins; where they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t disrupt the &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; of Tran magic, rules have been adapted from existing magic and powers Plug-Ins (such as the Power Plug-In from Champions New Millennium, Jason Dour's Heroic Abilities Plug-In, Mark Chase's Atomik Magick, or even the HERO System Rulesbook Fourth Edition!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its origin (and its posting in Beta Format), this Plug-In has been adapted for use in other fantasy worlds, and so a new name has been called for. Part of the original concept was that a &amp;quot;spell&amp;quot; is referred to as a &amp;quot;matrix&amp;quot; (even though in this text it's still called a &amp;quot;spell&amp;quot;), and so this Plug-In is called the Matrix Magic Plug-In.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
