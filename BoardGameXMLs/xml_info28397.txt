			<description>The idea of the game is to create the family tree of a family together. Players get help from pictures of the members of family that have differing borders and background colors. With this information you are able to see how the genes transfer from generation to generation. In each family there are five generations and the player that first gets rid of his cards is the winner. The Finnish name of the game, Potretti, is an older word for a photo and refers to the pictures of the family members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
