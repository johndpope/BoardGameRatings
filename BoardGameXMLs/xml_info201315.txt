			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are supposed to go crazy and have fun, because after all a big part of the scenario is a party &amp;ndash; but the party has a tragic outcome, so the humor shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overshadow the seriousness, intrigues, personal problems or the death. The characters and the players&amp;rsquo; interpretation of them are the primary focal points of the scenario and there are many potential outcomes. It is a short story scenario (around two hours) for four players and one gamemaster. The form of the scenario is semi-live with some narration elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is divided into two acts divided by the blackout of the characters. The first act is about the past &amp;ndash; it is their arrival to the beach house and the part of the party they remember &amp;ndash; but at some point they blackout, they can&amp;rsquo;t remember what happens next. In the second act they wake up to the graveness of the situation in the form of the death of one of the other characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
