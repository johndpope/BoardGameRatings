			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chester is platform game from Brilliant Blue-G. In Chester the player guides one of 10 unlockable characters through 38 stages to win the game. Characters may be switched at will. Most characters have a basic run and jump style, a double jump, a special attack, and a basic projectile attack with a standard shots on screen limit. There are variations in speed and jumping ability between characters, and characters are randomly assigned an elemental type (this can be changed). Many of the non-titular characters are references to classical platform games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player may also switch between several available art styles for each level, different art styles come bundled together with special in game effects such as &amp;quot;platforms move slower&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;special abilities use less ammo.&amp;quot; The game also features a primitive leveling system to power up characters, as well as a lot of optional item collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
