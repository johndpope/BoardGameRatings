Then you desperately wait for your tank to appear and tip the balance of power in your favor. A real battle in an on-going war? No, one of 15 realistic combat scenarios found in COUP de GR&amp;acirc;CE, a fast-paced, two-player combat board game designed to put your gaming skills to the test, time and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COUP de GR&amp;acirc;CE is a 2-player combat board game designed to simulate a modern battle between two equal forces.
