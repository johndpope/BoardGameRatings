			<description>Pareidolix is an independently published role-playing game written by Andrew Morris and published by Plague Monkey Games. It was originally titled Unistat, but the name was changed in 2009 to avoid confusion with the Unisystem RPG, as well as the Unistat computer software. It is mechanically simple and encourages a cinematic arc with power shifting from the GM to the players over the course of the game. No setting is provided for Pareidolix, and the game can be used for any setting the GM and/or the players desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has only four rules: the Rule of Consensus, the Rule of Conflicts, the Rule of Concept, and the Rule of Cool. The Rule of Consensus states that as long as the players (including the GM) agree on something; it happens, and there is no need to roll dice. The Rule of Conflicts explains the procedures for handling disputes about the fictional events. The Rule of Concept shows how a player mechanically benefits in conflicts that connect to his or her character. The Rule of Cool provides a way for players to reward each other for enhancing their experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pareidolix&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
