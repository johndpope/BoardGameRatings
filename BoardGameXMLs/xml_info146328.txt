			<description>A Dutch game about the occupation of the Netherlands during World War II. The game is based on the Game of Goose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with four chips.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to roll the dice and move their tokens according to the total of the dice. Landing on certain spaces could mean advancing the token further up the path, losing turns, or going back to the starting point. Along their way players can earn or lose chips.&lt;br/&gt;The first player arriving on space with the dates 10 may 1940 - 05 may 1945 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
