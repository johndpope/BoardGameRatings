			<description>Reel Fishing (known as Fish Eyes in Japan) is the first in the Reel Fishing series. It was released on the PlayStation. It was published by Natsume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To catch a fish on Reel Fishing you must do two things, hook the fish and reel it in. When hooking a fish wait until its mouth has completely covered the hook then hit the reel button to set the hook. Once the hook is set then you must reel it in. Do not reel if the fish is resisting because you have a greater chance of the line snapping or you losing the fish. When the fish is speeding away and then slows that is the best time to reel it in because the fish will have a lesser chance of resisting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Reel Fishing (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
