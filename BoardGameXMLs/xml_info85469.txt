			<description>Players are bath attendants in ancient Rome that are vying for the title Balneator. Whoever wins will rule the baths of the Roman Empire and earn riches. In this decisive duel, the players must adjust the baths in the municipal therme to the correct temperature before their opponent does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also required to play:&lt;br/&gt;6 dice, 3 each in 2 colours&lt;br/&gt;7 tokens, as awards for correctly heating a bath&lt;br/&gt;2 pawns, one red and one blue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to perform both of the following actions in this order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. a) Move a Therminator (red or blue pawn) OR b) change the value of one of your dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Move one of your dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. a) Move a Therminator in one direction vertically, horizonatally or diagonally as far as you want to an empty space. If it moves directly over a die or ends its move next to one, the value of that die is changed by +1 for the red and -1 for the blue Therminator. However, dice in the central bath are never affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. b) Increase the value of one of your dice up or down by 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Move one of your own dice vertically or horizontally exactly the number of squares as the value of the die. You may change direction while moving, but may not step on the same space twice during your turn. You may only move over empty spaces. If any entered space is adjecent to a Therminator, adjust the value of the die as above after completing the move.&lt;br/&gt;If you can reach a die of your opponent exactly with your move, you may displace it. You choose the new location, your opponent chooses the new value.&lt;br/&gt;If your die shares the value with a bath and can move there in that exact number of spaces, you may end your move there and you receive the corresponding token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 4 of the 7 tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
