			<description>A mixture of driving simulator and an arcade game, Taxi! pits you with the responsibility of running your very own taxi cab business. Starting out with an under powered and dated vehicle you&amp;rsquo;ll strive towards upgrading your current vehicles specs by improving its speed and handling. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve managed to secure a good source of revenue it&amp;rsquo;s time to expand your business by purchasing new vehicles and hiring drivers. Be cautious of who you select to offer a job as each taxi driver will excel in a particular area but may under perform in others. If you&amp;rsquo;re concerned about paying to repair your car do not choose a driver that is reckless for the sake of earning extra cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taxi! includes three cities for you to set up your company. You can take to the U.S where the city will feature traditional American apartments or you can travel to the United Kingdom with consistent roundabouts. There&amp;rsquo;s also a beautiful European style city that will need to be explored. All of these cities are rendered with stylised cartoon graphics with each of the maps recreating the driving conditions for its country. Whether you want left hand or right hand drive, Taxi! lets you choose where and how you want to drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only will you be behind the wheel to complete fares, you&amp;rsquo;ll also need to work on the management of your company at all levels. This will include assigning drivers to vehicles, repairing your cabs, upgrading engine parts and locating secret packages on the map to unlock new vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The missions are incredibly varied, ranging from simple dispatch missions, following other drivers and perilously balancing luggage atop your car while taking corners carefully to make sure none of your passengers valuables fall victim to the bustling traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features of Taxi!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 cities based on the United Kingdom, the U.S. and Europe&lt;br/&gt;     Cartoon-style visuals&lt;br/&gt;     Manage a taxi cab company and expand your taxi fleet&lt;br/&gt;     Repair, clean and upgrade your taxi cabs&lt;br/&gt;     Several missions ranging from traditional dispatch to balancing luggage atop your cab&lt;br/&gt;     Unlock vehicles by collecting car parts scattered across the cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
