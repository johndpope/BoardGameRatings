			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Raven was a rules light role-playing game developed to be easy for beginners.  This Demo Scenario includes introductory (&amp;quot;quick start&amp;quot;) rules that allow character creation and advancement.  Characters have six Attributes:  Strength, Prowess, Endurance, Wits, Charisma, and Awareness.  Attributes have Ratings running from 1 to 40, though typically an adult will have about a 5 and an experienced, gifted hero will have about 25.  Characters also have Skills with Ratings from 1-5 and &amp;quot;Advanced&amp;quot;.  The Skill Rating determines how many D10 are used in a dice pool, the Attribute determines the modifier applied to the highest result in the pool.  This is compared against a target difficulty.  A result of &amp;quot;10&amp;quot; explodes into a subsequent result.  Combat works essentially the same way but the target number is the opponent's defensive roll.  Hits result in Hit Point damage.  Experience can be gained and spent to increase Attribute or Skill Ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghosts of Wrecker Cover, the scenario included in the demo book, takes place on the Isle of Korak which is riven by violence between rival factions.  The scenario includes four (optional) pre-generated characters, maps, tables, and a brief bestiary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
