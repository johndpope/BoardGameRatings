			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got a Pathfinder game to run this weekend but are too busy to get something together for your players? Looking for a way to challenge your power gamer players? If so, then you're ready for a One Night Stand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forgotten Tomb of Felgar the Goblin King, an adventure for characters of 2nd&amp;ndash;5th level, contains everything you'll need for an evening of fun using the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure: The following pages detail the background and action that will constitute the adventure itself. We've provided all of the NPC details needed in a new stat block format that makes it easy to print and use at the table. Let us know what you think by emailing hyrum@supergeniusgames.com with your comments.&lt;br/&gt;    Map Tiles: Following the adventure write-up are 16 map tiles that, when cut out and assembled, create a battlemat with a one-inch square grid. There are also alternative tiles to use in order to keep the secret parts of the map hidden until the heroes make the appropriate discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;    Tactical Maps: After the map tiles are a series of tactical maps and notes to make running the adventure easier for the Game Master. Also, starting on page 4 we include stat block cards that can be printed out and used at the table, speeding up play by having all game-related information at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;    Standees: With the tactical maps are a collection of cut-and-tape standees representing all the creatures and monsters encountered in this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
