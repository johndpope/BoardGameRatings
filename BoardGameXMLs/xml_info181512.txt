							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Albatros D.II</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Albatros D.II was a German fighter produced in response to pilot complaints about poor upward vision in the Albatros D.I. The forward view was improved with changes on wings and cabane struts, and this aircraft was appreciated for its impressive climb rate and for its frontal twin machine gun. It was flown by a number of famous German aces such as Oswald Boelcke and Manfred von Richthofen and the Hungarian Rudolf Von Szepessy. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. This is not a complete game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
