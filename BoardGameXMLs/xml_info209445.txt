							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kobayashi Maru: A Test of Character</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kobayashi Maru - A Test of Character is a fan production inspired by Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed digitally and it is 100% free. No one is allowed to profit from it in any way. &lt;br/&gt;Players only need to print 3 sheets of paper and add some basic game components like dice and cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you play the role of the captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise. You just received a distress call from the freighter Kobayashi Maru. Will you respond? If so, will you dare enter the Neutral Zone and face a confrontation with the Klingons?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is divided in 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An action phase, in which you can perform actions such as move, fire, repair shields, or use the tractor beam.&lt;br/&gt;     A bridge phase, in which you determine events taking place inside the Enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;     An enemy phase, in which the Klingons attack.&lt;br/&gt;     A reinforcement phase, in which the Klingons replace their lost battle cruisers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until you rescue the Kobayashi Maru, or the Enterprise is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, this is more than a game: it is a test of character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
