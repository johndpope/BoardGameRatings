			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is what is happening at this moment: we are playing this game but have not been told the rules, everyone knows this game except for those who do not. If you do not know the rules, un-crumple this paper and read the top-most rule. That rule applies to our situation now and forever into the future. Make a note of what that rule is now used for and either cross it off, make a note next to it, or rip it out of this sheet. It is no longer the top-most rule. Sometimes the rules make sense &amp;amp; help us understand how the game works. Other times the rules are confusing and we have to interpret them ourselves, or make clever interpretations. This game is about to begin. Now Crumple This Paper and hand it down to the next person in line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This intriguing game was created for the Golden Cobra Challenge 2016 but was not submitted prior to the deadline and was not considered in the evaluation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
