			<description>The game where you drive your friends crazy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premise:&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are patients in a Asylum with nothing better to do then drive each other crazy! Every turn use different tactics to force your opponents to go insane!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;Divide the deck evenly among the players, and each turn play a card to force the other patients to discard cards from their hand or discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is one player left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 100 cards that can change the momentum of the game at the drop of a hat. Losing terribly? Play an unstoppable card that switches your deck with the discard pile! That will show them! Or are you tired of everyone ganging up on you? Force them to play with their hand face up! Now whose laughing!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
