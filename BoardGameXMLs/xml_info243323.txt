			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confrontation between star ships and alien attack ships test wits and physical skills as intergalactic leeches invade the territory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead star ship must destroy the alien attack ships as they materialize, while eliminating intergalactic leeches that invade the territory.  The star ship must also replenish its force field energy, periodically, by diving between mountains into the hydrogen laden lakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;K-Star Patrol offers ten sectors of play, each subsequent sector requires a greater degree of hand/mind coordination, as the alien forces rise and attack at increased speed and frequency, and the low-level avoidance system goes into effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
