							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bulwark: Miksa&#039;s Redoubt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Co-operative Deck-Building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone once called Baron Miksa a 'slimy, double-crossing swineherd'. That man disappeared in mysterious circumstances, at around the same time as the foundations were laid for the Baron's new castle. The Redoubt is a stronghold built to be secure on a budget. Alas, the Baron seems to have underestimated the forces it needs to hold against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miksa's Redoubt is a location with plenty of fortification cards, requiring forward-planning to defend effectively. With little on offer to get rid of unwanted cards, you have to take every potential wound seriously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
