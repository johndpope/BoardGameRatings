			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fehr's Ehtnology: Dhosari profiles the dhosari race for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dhosari (singular and plural) are a bizarre, ancient race that are the original inhabitants of the island of Erkusaa. They have been enslaved for millennia by the erkunae, a near-human race that has gained power through arcane pacts with extra dimensional beings. Dhosari are a large, strong race, but have little magical power and have been used as house slaves and shock troops by their masters; in the recent past they have established a few, small, independent communities on nearby islands and on the mainland. They have four arms that enable them to do tasks unheard of for normal bipeds. If the dhosari gain their freedom, and the acceptance of the core races, they might achieve a golden age of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     ecology of the dhosari&lt;br/&gt;     racial characteristics for dhosari characters (including alternate racial characteristics)&lt;br/&gt;     a selection of racial feats&lt;br/&gt;     traits for the dhosari race (if you use traits)&lt;br/&gt;     sample dhosari 1st level character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
