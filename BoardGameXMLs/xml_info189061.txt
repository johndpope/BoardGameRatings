			<description>Granny is preparing to make jam - but the fruit is still on the tree. In this fun board game kids collect cherry tokens cooperatively. They are not competing each other but the worms that want to get to the fruits faster. If the basket is full, the kids win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play: the active player draws 3 cards. If a worm is shown, spin the worm spinner first to know which worm needs to be moved one step closer to the cherries. After this, move the pawns on neighbouring fields - of the color shown on the cards showing leaves. There are cherry tokens showing 1, 2 or 3 cherries. If any worm reaches a cherry token the players lose. If a pawn arrives on a '1' cherry token it can be taken. For a '2' cherry token 2 pawns have to be present on the given token and a '3' cherry token can be taken only if there are 3 pawns on the same space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
