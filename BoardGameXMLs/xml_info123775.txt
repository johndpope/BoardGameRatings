							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deflation Game</name>
									
			<description>A Monopoly-inspired game in which players roll and move round a track buying and selling assets; as in Monopoly, the object is to be the last player not bankrupt, or to be the richest player after a designated period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can purchase two kinds of assets, tangible and financial.  Whenever a player lands on a &amp;quot;Price Change&amp;quot; space, every player's tangible assets become either more or less valuable:  usually less, because deflation occurs on a roll of 1 through 4, inflation only on 5 or 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Financial assets are not affected by inflation and deflation, and thus holding them is more advantageous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may also land on a &amp;quot;Sound Advice from Shilling &amp;amp; Co.&amp;quot; square, in which case he or she may take one of five special actions, such as selling an asset of his/her choice at market value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
