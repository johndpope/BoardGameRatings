One player plays the Dark Lord and the remaining players each one hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Lord powers have been sealed off and he's weak. However, he is recovering slowly in his Dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aware of the coming crisis, the brave heroes enter the Dungeon and start their quest to defeat the Dark Lord in his Dungeon before he can recover his powers.&lt;br/&gt;If they manage to do so they win. Otherwise the Dark Lord kills them and reign over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes' goal is to reach the Dark Lord to defeat him for good. From the entrance, they need to reach the Dark Lord's throne: if any Hero player can move to the same room as him, the Heroes wins.&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Lord's goal is to recover enough power or kill off all the Hero players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game plays roughly as the following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0) Setup&lt;br/&gt;First one player gets choosen to be the Dark Lord for the game. He picks up the black character.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all the Hazard cards together, return 3 cards to the box and deal 3 to the Dark Lord.&lt;br/&gt;Then, each hero player chooses a colored character and gets assigned randomly a Job card.&lt;br/&gt;Last but not least, the Dungeon tile cards are shuffled layed out as a grid, face down, except for the Dark Lord's throne, in the top left corner, and the dungeon's entrace, in the bottom right corner. Place the Dark Lord character on his throne and the Hero characters all at the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Heroes' Turn&lt;br/&gt;Each heroes choose secretly one of the following action: Move, Heal or Ability.&lt;br/&gt;When all decided, all the Heroes reveal their action at once and proceed to resolution. The play order doesn't matter here.&lt;br/&gt;Each dungeon tile  card represents two rooms. Heroes can only enter a room if there is no wall blocking access. Players will reveal dungeon tile cards as needed when exploring new areas of the dungeon. Be careful of traps!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Dark Lord's Turn&lt;br/&gt;During he can play choose on of the following action: accumulate power, play an Hazard card to attack/delay the Heroes, or renew his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repeat 1) and 2) until either:&lt;br/&gt;- any hero reaches the same room as the Dark Love -&amp;gt; the Heroes win&lt;br/&gt;- the Dark Lord has killed all the Heroes or has exhausted the Hazard cards deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;『ダンジョニング』は協力型ダンジョン探索ゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;プレイヤーは勇者（２～４人）と魔王（１人）に分かれて戦います。&lt;br/&gt;魔王は完全復活するまで、勇者が近づけないよう邪魔をしてください。&lt;br/&gt;勇者は完全復活する前に魔王に近づき封印してください。&lt;br/&gt;勇者達の意思疎通が勝利の鍵です！&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
