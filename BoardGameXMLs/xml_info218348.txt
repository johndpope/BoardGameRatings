							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Too Many Deer? A Public Hearing</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This case recreates a public hearing to consider what to do about a deer overpopulation problem in an urban oldgrowth forest. This forest, over 200 acres, has more than 40 deer, and the deer are impacting the vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are assigned different roles, representing different viewpoints that were expressed at the public hearing. Other students act as meeting moderators or as expert witnesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By reenacting the public hearing students experience the reality of multiple perspectives and opinions, some of which have more merit than others. All of the perspectives except one were really expressed at the actual public hearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
