							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eagle&#039;s Nest Campaign</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following sections outline a campaign that the adept group Axe, Bow and Song undertook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is presented to provide to those of you who wish to know more about the campaign, its premise and concepts. Then again some of you may have just wanted to steal a few ideas or even the whole outline for a ready made campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which ever it is this is how it breaks down: the campaign can be divided into six parts. Each part will be summarized in a similar fashion to how the adventures are summarized in Prelude to War and other excellent Earthdawn products written by FASA. In reality the campaign sections are highly flexible and could be played in any order so long as Parts 1, 5 and 6 are played in sequential order for the obvious reasons that Part 1 introduces the campaign and outlines the challenge ahead for the PCs and Parts 5 and 6 conclude the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the main adventure summaries there are a number of associate documents which detail important items, planned encounters and other information that can be used in the campaign at various times. The adventure text will indicate where they were originally used. There is a floating event that may be played at any time it will be noted as such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Campaign created for 1st and 2nd editions of Earthdawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
