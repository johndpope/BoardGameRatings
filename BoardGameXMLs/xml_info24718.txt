			<description>The theme of this game is smuggling cigars, wine, rum, watches, cigarettes and money between Germany, Austria and Switzerland on skis! Thus, an unusual theme for the alps...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 home bases, where the players can buy up to 3 smuggling goods and start their way to deliver them to another base. Movements are not done by a dice roll, but the more goods a player is carrying, the slower will be his speed. this can be dangerous, because their is a fast moving frontier-guard, who will confiscate the goods, when he catches a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before starting, the players should know, which smuggling goods give the best profit - watches are cheap to buy in Switzerland and give the most in Germany for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has double sided playing money, which comes in the (old) currencies of the 3 countries: Deutsche Mark, Schilling and Schweizer Franken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
