			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood and Gold is a short adventure involving crime, drugs and vampires. The quest takes place in an urban area and can be played in any (low) fantasy campaign setting. This scenario features a new captivating and deadly drug as well as new weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The storyline is hardboiled and probably better fitting for characters of low morality, who won&amp;rsquo;t take to heart when it comes down to beating people in order to extract information and working for thugs and criminals. Still, the party can be kindhearted and their reasons for meddling with a shady crowd can be for a just cause. But by the end of the day, they themselves will be tempted with the pleasures of sinister life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;Vampire Aris is a self-proclaimed prince of thieves and murderers. He is a ruler of the underground and a demon of night. Aris rose to power through gold and a drug he created from his own blood. Red Sinew is highly addictive, but gives pleasure mortals can&amp;rsquo;t resist. Aris is a sole vampire who knows how to create this potent toxin, or at least that&amp;rsquo;s what he thinks. Couple of months ago, his business got stale. There is a new dealer on the street who did not only steal Aris&amp;rsquo; local customers but also his exporters. The ancient Vampire is furious as his dominion is shaken. He is set on revenge and blood will be shed, mortal and immortal alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-This d20, 3.5e adventure scenario is best suited for a group of four 6th level character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
