							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sine Requie Anno XIII: Sanctum Imperium</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;On June 6, 1944, the world sank in the darkest of hells. On Doomsday the Dead started their hunt against the human specie.&lt;br/&gt;Now it's 1957, and from the dusts of what once was called Italy has raised a strict theocracy leaded by Pope Leone XIV, which sank the nation in a sort of medieval anachronism.&lt;br/&gt;The fumes of new Inquisition's stakes raise to the sky, in the hope of eliminating with violence every possible menace to Rome's power. Armored Templars and brave Dead Hunters, on their military vehicles, try to preserve population from the Dead's menace.&lt;br/&gt;Heretical groups, schismatic sects and real bands of bandits try to undermine the Pope's rule, while north the threat of IV Reich and his genetic horrors is every day nearer.&lt;br/&gt;This handbook contains all the necessary to set your adventures in the Sanctum Imperium. There are descriptions of the lands, of the most important characters, of the power groups in the ecclesiastic hierarchy and of the worst Church's enemies. You'll also find new Jobs, new character sheet and a ready to be played adventure: &amp;quot;Mysteries of Croce's Peek&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
