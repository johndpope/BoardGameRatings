							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Appian Way Cafe</name>
									
			<description>The Empire lives and works on its stomach, and when it's lunchtime in Ancient Rome, hungry patrons come to the Appian Way Cafe.  As waitstaff, you are working hard to fill your orders before the other players so that you can score the most tips. The kitchen is too busy cooking to pay attention so you have to be lucky and clever to get your orders filled!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast paced and fun, Appian Way Cafe is beautifully illustrated and designed to be quick to learn and play. Lighthearted fun for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appian Way Cafe is a matching game based on the theme of Roman Fast Food. Game play is simple but fun. Each player is dealt three orders they are trying to fill by matching them to cards in their hand. Each turn you draw and try to play something. Every round, tips for filled orders are given and at the end, the player with the most tips wins. Various special cards spice up gameplay and competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
