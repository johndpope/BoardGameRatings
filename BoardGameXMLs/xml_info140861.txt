			<description>This game (the theme of which is viewed as controversial by some) combines elements of wargames, dexterity games and resource gathering games. While set somewhere Nazi-occupied in Europe at the end of World War II, the theme is not actually historical. Players take the role of factions associated with Allied Powers, each of which controls a team of commandos which have associated special powers in the game. Each player starts from a different starting position and then they race to reach concentration camps where they use a dreidel to knock over and kill Nazi guards and so free prisoners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dreidel is also used in lieu of a d4 to allot movement points at the start of the turn; the amount of points allotted by a given spin corresponds to the traditional value of a spin in the game Dreidel. Different types of terrain on the movement board (covered by a grid of hexagons) require different amount of movement points. Some spaces also involve either aid and resources to be gathered or German patrols to be avoided. When a player lands on a concentration camp, his commandos raid the camp and kill guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box lid serves as a second board where figures representing guards are placed. A player who is raiding a concentration camp then uses the dreidel to knock over and kill guards. This leads to freeing prisoners from the camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have freed the most prisoners when all concentration camps have been raided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
