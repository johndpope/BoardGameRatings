							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pasha: The Satraps of Wonder</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pasha is an old country founded soon after the rise of Ersa. Its cities are old and decadent, life is beautiful but cheap. There are three great cities, Babyon, Boomkok and Rombay, the latter a port in the northeast of the island, Boomkok on the road to Babyon in the interior. It is semi-arid in climate and watered by the massive Itroo River. It is a land of a few privileged and many slaves. Drug dens, hustlers, whores, who don&amp;rsquo;t walk the streets and bravoes who do walk the streets, dominate the cities. The addicts want bliss, the harlots and hustlers want money and the bravoes want to fight for pride. Satraps rule in each city, Milk Giri Baal Hammon rules in Babyon, Milkat Heshequemit rules in Boomkok and Milk Abaduna holds court in Rombay. A kepala or chief rules a tribe in the hinterlands and there are many. The tribesmen ride camels but elephants are used in the armies of each city in addition to camels. Pashans are dark complexioned, range in stature to huge to diminutive and are fine featured with long digits and uniformly black hair. And you won&amp;rsquo;t find ale or any grain fermented beverages in Pasha. They prefer wines or spirits, examples include Beras Anggur, Flacair White, Kalap Deep Red, Norri Fruity, White Fire, Aromatic Liqueur, Amber Slippery and of course, Anise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
