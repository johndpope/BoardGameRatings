							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naruil Airfoil Championship</name>
									
			<description>Naruil Airfoil Championship is a steampunk airship racing game where players compete in a race of skill and madness. Each year a grand championship is held where teams from all over the realms come to put their skills to the test.  The race begins with each team (player) receiving an old airfoil frame that will form the basis for their airship in the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teams get four hours (turns) to fix up and prepare their ship for the race.  When the time is up the teams must roll out their ship no matter the condition.. The race is on!  The teams will race around the designated track, trying to stay ahead of the pack as they face challenges along the way.  The airfoil that is the first to successfully cross the finish line, after the designated number of laps, wins.  This is a rough race and you never know which racer, if any, will pull through in the end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
