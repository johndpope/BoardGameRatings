							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Options: Core Mythic Class Features</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being Mythic is Cool as Hell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are numerous mythic spells and a long list of mythic feats to help mythic characters develop their amazing powers, the actual class features of each class do not have mythic upgrades available. There are heroic path abilities that tie into some class abilities and common skills, but no upgrades for the classes&amp;rsquo; main abilities and talents themselves. This is unfortunate, because many characters focus much more on their core class abilities and powers than on feats. To alleviate this lack, in this section, we offer mythic upgrades for every class feature and talent for all the official core classes from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Core Rulebook. This allows characters to focus on classic abilities, such as armor mastery, evasion, uncanny dodge, and even bloodlines, domains, and arcane schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
