							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Elves: Winds of Intrigue (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maglyd cast her sword into the darkness, where it became the sun. Her cloak formed the mantle of the sky; Taglyd&amp;rsquo;s robe, the green forests. They lay together across the face of Loerem, and where they touched, life began. Their gentle words of love became the whispering of the winds. Still, Maglyd the All-Wise wept. She knew the Void had not been vanquished; it lurked yet, hidden beyond the darkness of the night. Maglyd&amp;rsquo;s tears became all the water in the world: rain, rivers, lakes, and oceans. Taglyd the strong comforted her. &amp;ldquo;We have done all we can,&amp;rdquo; he said, exhausted. &amp;ldquo;The rest remains to our children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind of Intrigue unravels the mystery that is the elves. From the Divine Parents and the Glydym to the Nine Sacred Cities and Glymrae, from the Great Houses to the Accursed outcast, this sourcebook unlocks the secrets of the Land of the Tromek previously whispered only among the elves. Featuring detailed, valuable glimpses into the elves&amp;rsquo; highly intricate society, customs, beliefs, and daily life, Wind of Intrigue is the comprehensive guide to navigate the complex elven web of politics and understand Loerem&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Oldest Race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
