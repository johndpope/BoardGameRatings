			<description>EyeToy: AntiGrav is a hoverboard game touted as the first &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; game for EyeToy for more seasoned gamers. The earlier games such as Play and Groove were geared towards younger kids for family or party fun. Unlike the earlier EyeToy games, the player's image is not shown inside the Antigrav game. Instead, the player's movement is reflected in the animated character in the game. The player moves his body to control the on-screen hoverboard rider to go through an obstacle course. The player needs to make turns and jump over or duck under obstacles by moving his body in front of the EyeToy. The game allows one player at a time, but supports up to four players taking turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 5 tracks:&lt;br/&gt;The Falls: The main city in the game, with a section passing through a series of waterfalls.&lt;br/&gt;Water Front: An industrial/Chinatown area, going through tunnels and ending up in a harbour&lt;br/&gt;Skyway: A race around, above and through a series of skyscrapers. One of the most highlights of the course is a section where the player races down a building into oncoming traffic.&lt;br/&gt;Aerodome: A lap based track with several &amp;quot;tiers&amp;quot; to work up. The higher the tier, the more &amp;quot;shortcuts&amp;quot; are available to the player.&lt;br/&gt;Black Rock Ridge: The longest and most difficult course. It starts at the top of a snow-capped mountain remnicent of typical snowboarding games. As the player descends the mountain, the temperature gets milder into a fall foliage atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a demo in EyeToy Play 2 for this game, but it only had one character and one stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;EyeToy: AntiGrav&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
