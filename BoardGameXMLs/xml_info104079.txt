							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Puerto Rico HD</name>
									
			<description>Ravensburger Digital today is pleased to introduce Puerto Rico HD 1.0 for iPad. Puerto Rico never looked more beautiful - Puerto Rico the game that is. Ranked as the #1 game on BoardGameGeek for eight years in a row, over 250,000 units of the board game sold, and winner of the International Gamers Award, it was no surprise when Ravensburger Digital decided to reinvent the company's classic strategy game. Unveiling their iPad app to a new generation of players, this advanced multi-player game will please Puerto Rico veterans and new gamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sailing to the shores of Puerto Rico, players put their entrepreneurial skills to the test, as they take on roles of Captain, Settler, Prospector, Builder, Mayor, Craftsmen or Trader in a multi-player, multi-task setting. But choose wisely! Your role may dictate your victory. How do you win? Well as they say, to the victor go the... victory points? Yes! In this game, wealth is measured in more than just doubloons. Conquer other players by accumulating the most victory points through the construction of the grandest buildings, harvesting the most fruitful crops and shipping the most bountiful harvest back to the Old World - all of which is only a finger tap away on the new application for iPad. Strategy, creativity and some luck may just make you governor of the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andreas Seyfarth, the creator of the original board game, commented, &amp;quot;this conversion was really successful. All the game play modes have been enhanced: Online mode, Solo mode, multiple difficulty levels - everything is there.&amp;quot; Noted for its complexity, Puerto Rico finds sweet simplicity as an app on the iPad. With a built-in tutorial for those new to the game (or anyone who needs a quick refresher course) the app brings to life the world of Puerto Rico and allows them to share their experience with fellow Puerto Rico fans all over world. Staying true to the original game the application version doesn't lose any of its lusters, which Seyfarth applauds, saying, &amp;quot;The conversion of the rules and the game play is impressive, the developer really did a great job. Now I have to get an iPad just for Puerto Rico.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Publisher's Press Release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
