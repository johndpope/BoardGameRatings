			<description>The board shows a series of concentric hex-gridded spaces, of varying colors. The two white rings (&amp;quot;lanes&amp;quot;) allow movement limited only by the presence of other pieces. The three blue rings (&amp;quot;moats&amp;quot;) cannot be crossed in one go; you must stop on them. The lone exceptions are the four blue hexes on your side of the board --you may cross them freely, but your opponent cannot. The thirteen red hexes (&amp;quot;gates&amp;quot;), finally, are the game goals; you win by occupying five of these in a straight line. To enter a gate, you must start adjacent to it (except for the two gates adjacent to your base). Entering a gate (other than the two base ones) gives you a bonus move. Occupied gates are the only occupied spaces that can be jumped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hex is &amp;quot;secured&amp;quot; (the opponent cannot enter it) if surrounded by three or more of your pieces. Securing a hex captures any piece that happens to lie there (it is removed from the game and you get a bonus move). Finally, the fifth gate of any triangular set is secured if you occupy the first four. This is called &amp;quot;triangulation&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook also supplies handicapping suggestions, optional rules for a more challenging game, and explains how to support team play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
