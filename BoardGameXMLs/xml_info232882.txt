							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Magic Items</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just because they're strange doesn't mean they can't make items! Strange Magic Items introduces magical equipment compatible with the ethermagic, truename magic, and musical composition systems laid out in Strange Magic 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modularity and freedom of choice that is the hallmark of Strange Magic makes its way into this item codex with crazy mechanics, such as the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - Create sequin vest shirts with over a dozen variants. Combine up to three variants in a single vest! Want more? Rings can have a variant applied to them, a new specific magic armor randomly gains variants each day, and a new armor special ability applies a variant to whatever armor you're making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 - Create a pair of gloves with a dozen variants. Variants marked with an asterisk (*) can be combined with each other and up to one non-asterisk variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 - The moor cowbell is a new spell trigger magic item that requires a Strength check to activate. It's all about clanging the bell as hard as you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 - Etherstaves are a complete reimagining of staves for use with ethermagic. As ethermages have limitless power, but limited spell selection, staves are a great way to sneak in specific manifestations once or twice a day. Variety, not power, is the name of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
