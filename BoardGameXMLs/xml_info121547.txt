							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Common Criminals: Series 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mean streets are full of criminals from all walks of life. Some have taken up crime as purely as a means of survival while others simply choose to get ahead in life by breaking the rules. Regardless of their situations in life, all these individuals have one thing in common. They have become outlaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first series of Common Criminals features background information for six different crooks and thugs. Nature of crimes range from drug dealing to prostitution to money laundering. Although much of the information presented in this modern gaming supplement is self explanatory, having a copy of [Common Criminals: Companion Guide] never hurts. This is especially true when using the attribute score points to convert characters over to the game system of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
