							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcanostatic Corruption</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power by the Gigawatt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corruptions, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures, give players a new way to indulge their dark fantasies and take the role of gothic monsters, infecting themselves with some taint or darkness, and presenting the tantalizing question of whether to struggle against the corruption, or embrace it, and allow themselves to bask, however briefly, in its dark power. While Horror Adventures presents 11 different corruptions to choose from, there are many more potential sources of corruption that could potentially be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the arcanostatic corruption, a brand new corruption for those whose bodies course with arcane energy far beyond their power to control, which causes spontaneous outbursts of raw magical might at unexpected times. The corruption includes 10 manifestations and its own unique progression rules, including innovative new rules governing the wild arcanostatic outbursts. Further, the book introduces three particularly powerful spells, each of which has the serious drawback of potentially inflicting the arcanostatic corruption on those who cast them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
