							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">$6000 Movie</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$6000 Dollar Movie is a story roleplaying game about a dreadful B-Movie that languished for years before finally being released to a limited number of screens. Portions of the film have been damaged from years of neglect and other parts are just unwatchable. Crippled with production problems, delays, illness, and actor changes, the final piece plays out like a glitter-stained collage of leftover jigsaw pieces, while the characters are random bits of nonsense drawn from the imagination of a confused screenwriter. Will the audience enjoy the premiere? Or will the flop prove what the producers knew all along?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
