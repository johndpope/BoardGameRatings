							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of Cows</name>
									
			<description>Tower of Cows is a Print'n'Play dexterity game available from the pbskids.org web site.  The players stack cows, which are constructed from cardstock folded tent style.  Each turn a player draws a card which tells them how many cows to stack and sometimes gives instructions like &amp;quot;Stack 1 cow while singing Happy Birthday to Moo.&amp;quot;  If a cow drops, the player gets a penalty point.  The game is based on a game mentioned in the PBS show Arthur, and is located in the Arthur section of the web site, but does not have any Arthur related art on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
