			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Carnival of Dreams one off adventure. A quick simple and fun romp. The setting is modern day with tongue in cheek super powers. The adventure has been developed as a sandbox; providing the background, main plot line, and as much information as we could cram in to support the GM. Feel free to use as much, or as little, of the provided information as suits your style of play. The information described in this document should at no point be taken as &amp;quot;law&amp;quot; especially if it would detract from the story you and your group are telling. If something else makes more sense, or would make more fun, then run with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Carnival of Dreams science has progressed to combat most illnesses using gene therapies. A tiny proportion of the population react to the therapies at a cellular level; mutating and developing super powers. The majority of mutants hide their abilities to avoid ridicule. Who wants to know you can make your nose hair grow on demand! However a small group banded together to form the Z list superheroes. If the world isn't at risk, or you can't afford a mainstream hero, maybe the Z List Heroes are in your budget! As their local paper ad says &amp;quot;If you can't afford the best, we are the rest!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
