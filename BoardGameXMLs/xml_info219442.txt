							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Galdr: A D&amp;D Viking Rune Mage</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crouched low, eyes flaring, the man begins drawing strange shapes in the air, and fiery runic effigies appear, floating.  The man rears back, and screams a single word in a forgotten language.  A blast emits from the rune, and after the dust settles, the Galdr is the only one left standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaving the house of a beloved sister, the Galdr carves a rune on her door.  That night, when raiders from the North come to her house to pillage, they are met with howling ethereal wolves, who fiercely protect the dwelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A man throws an axe at a vicious draugr, the axe flies  true, tumbling and as it does so, the runes etched into it flare up, and emit a blue burst of light, eviscerating the other nearby draugr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether carving runes in mid air to cast spells, or imbuing items and object with great power, the Galdr is the embodiment of the raw power of runic magic.  They heed what the runes tell them, and many are powerful seers, though all of them have devastating abilities that can change the course of a battle in an instant. Galdr are often great entertainers, and their stories are legendary, should you be lucky enough to meet one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
