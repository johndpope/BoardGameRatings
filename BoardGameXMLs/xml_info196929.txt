							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">7 Wonders: Metal Coins</name>
									
			<description>These high-quality metal coins replace the cardboard coins contained in the 7 Wonders core game and the 7 Wonders: Leaders expansion.&lt;br/&gt;The official version from Repos Production contains as many of each coin as there are cardboard coins with values 1 and 3 in the core game and with value 6 in the Leaders expansion:&lt;br/&gt;46 with value 1, 24 with value 3 and 17 with value 6.&lt;br/&gt;It also comes with a leather bag with a 7 Wonders logo to store the coins in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broken Token version includes fewer coins (and no bag): 30 with value 1, 17 with value 3 and 10 with value 6. They differ from the official coins. They have different backs particularly for the coin values 1 and 6. Coin value 6 shows a palm instead of the feather which the official coins (both cardboard and metal) feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
