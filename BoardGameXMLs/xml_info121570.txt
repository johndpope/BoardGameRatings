			<description>&amp;quot;fabulous entertainment for you and your friends, for free and with no hidden costs! Forget tokens, berries, and other virtual currencies &amp;ndash; download the game now, totally for free, and start having great fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charades is a game for many players and is a challenge to your knowledge, speed, richness of associations, and manual skills. Invite 1, 2, or 3 friends and acquaintances from all over the world to play with you. Each of you takes turns to draw a randomly selected phrase on the screen while the remaining players hurry to be the first person to guess that phrase. The players are able to see one another&amp;rsquo;s guesses. The sooner the correct phrase is guessed, the more points go to the drawer&amp;rsquo;s and the successful guesser&amp;rsquo;s accounts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application is fully translated into English, Spanish, French, German, and Polish. Each language version contains a few thousands ideally selected phrases: single words, phrases, sayings, and proverbs. We take care of our game and make it constantly attractive by regularly updating and improving the phrase base. Each user can also submit his or her own proposals and suggestions! The language of the phrase dictionary can be changed at any moment so that you can try your strength in other languages. The interface is in agreement with your local settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 500 points have been reached &amp;ndash; at that moment in the archive you will find a few tens of pictures, drawn by you and your friends. The pictures can be marked as favorite, sent by e-mail to your acquaintances, or published on Facebook.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
