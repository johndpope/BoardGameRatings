							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cardinal&#039;s Peril</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure pack for use with FLASHING BLADES. Included in this package are four complete adventures and a bonus section. Herein can be found:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MUSKETEERS: An overview of the formation and history of the Musketeers (both the King's Musketeers and the Cardinal's Guard), including notes on their uniforms and organization.&lt;br/&gt;     THE HAUNTED VILLA: A complete adventure filled with suspense as the characters explore a long-deserted villa in the countryside. None who had ventured there previously had ever returned - hence the reputation as 'haunted.'&lt;br/&gt;     THE CARDINAL'S PERIL: A complete adventure of disguise and intrigue set during the preparations for the siege of La Rochelle. The Cardinal has his share of political enemies; it stands to reason that they view him as a threat.&lt;br/&gt;     THE LADY OF LA ROCHELLE: A complete adventure of espionage, intrigue and of a diplomatic mission to La Rochelle during the siege of the city.&lt;br/&gt;     THE ROYAL HUMT: A adventurous outing to the King's hunting lodge at Fontainebleu where subplots abound and the formal activities run the gamut of sporting events and (of course) gambling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cardinal's Peril (and other tales) is designed for use with the FLASHING BLADES game system. FLASHING BLADES is required for the use of this package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
