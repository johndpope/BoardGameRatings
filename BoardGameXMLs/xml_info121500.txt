			<description>From the Introduction to v1.1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Not An Acronym D6. This is a roleplaying game system meant for, uh, roleplaying. Other games have cutesy acronyms for their names, but not NAA! It's got a downright horrible name. NAA began as a &amp;quot;Spirits of Eden&amp;quot; RPG system. I later realized I would rather make it a more generic system. I designed this system because I wanted to play it. I was feeling a bit dry of feeling for other RPG games so I thought I'd make my own. I thought I would also provide it for free to anyone on my site, so they could play it too if they wanted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What sets NAA apart from other games? Nothing in particular. This game does not have wiz-bang artwork, laser-guided exception-based design, &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; design principles that challenge players instead of characters, nor skills and rules for every possible situation, no revolutionary story-gaming design principles, advanced player input technology that allows story to develop throughout play, or quirky dice mechanics never before unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. It does, however, have six sided dice, so it delivers upon the one thing promised by the name. No other dice will ever into this relationship, and you will not have to buy any props in order to play the game. So at the very least, it is a very cheap game to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
