							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yavin and Bespin (WEG 2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The galactic civil war between the Empire and Rebel Alliance has moved on from the isolated Yavin system, but adventure, new civilizations and great danger can still be found around the gas giant and it's moons. Find out why the Empire has quietly established a new base near the ruins of the first Death Star and brave the mighty storms of mighty Yavin itself in search of untold wealth. Slog through the icy tundra of Yavin 8 in search of a downed imperial spy or cut through the thick tangle of Yavin 4's jungles to explore the ancient Massasi temples which tower over the forest canopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloud City is a booming trade town located in a little-traveled pocket of space just off the Correlian Trade Spine. The Imperial annexation of the city is still two years away and life is still fast and good for the traders, tourists, business executives, gamblers and rogues who call Bespin home. Sample the decadent delights of Cloud City's pleasure palaces or cut shady deals in the dark and gritty world of Port Town. Gamble away all your belongings or, if you're good enough, you just might win rulership of the city for life! Move beyond Cloud City to brave the dreaded sky sharks that haunt the wilds of Bespin's skies or discover the secret of the planer Miser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yavin and Bespin are two of the most important systems in the Star Wars movie trilogy. This comprehensive volume details the creatures, aliens, cultures and geography of both planets. Galaxy Guide 2: Yavin and Bespin provides newly-disclosed data that will fascinate movie fans and Star Wars game players alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
