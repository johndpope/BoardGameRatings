			<description>Geodeto Geodeto is an EASY-FAST-FUN card game with pyramids for 2-6 players (age 8+) that takes the best from Pyramideto game and increases the gaming experience for older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six Continent cards in six colors in the game representing Europe, Asia, America, Oceania, Antarctica and Africa.&lt;br/&gt;Every continent is connected to two neighboring continents and to the World Ocean in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players set for how many fulfilled goals they want to play to control the length of the game. (Publisher recommands 10-15 goals per game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the last game is fulfilled, players count their points. The one with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motto: Travelers, globetrotters, set the sails and sail the seven seas. Can you circumnavigate the world in 20 minutes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need one set of iGo pyramids (= 18 pyramids) and a deck of Geodeto cards to play Geodeto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
