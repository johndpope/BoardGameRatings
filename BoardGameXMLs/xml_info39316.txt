The person whose color is the same as the base that has been drawn begins. The drawn base is returned to the bag.&lt;br/&gt;2) Each player randomly draws one base from the bag and places it beside him, so that it is visible to both players.&lt;br/&gt;3) The first player places his base on the table and randomly draws a new base from the bag. It is now the other player&amp;rsquo;s turn, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;4) Each player, in his turn, can place a rider on a vacant base or place a new base next to an existing one, in accordance with the game rules. &lt;br/&gt;If a player chooses to place a base, he randomly draws a new base from the bag and places it beside him, so that it is visible to both players.  &lt;br/&gt; Winning the game:&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who manages to form a sequence of 6 riders of his own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
