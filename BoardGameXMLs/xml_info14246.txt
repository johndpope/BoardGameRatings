			<description>The game board is made up of colored squares winding around the board. The number of spaces a piece may move is determined by the color of the space. Landing next to the open end of a store space allows the player to take the product from that store, if it remains. Once all products have been taken, the players race back to their home squares. A player's score consists of the point total of their products (marked on the store spaces) plus bonus points awarded to the first three players to reach their home squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game included 24 product playing pieces representing contemporary packaged goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
