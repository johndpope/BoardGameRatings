			<description>Honeycomb Cavern is a fast roll and write game for one or more players set in the universe of our intrepid explorer and treasure hunter Sadie Cat. The game should take under 5 minutes to play and is presented in a book format so it is easy to take with you and store on a shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has players rolling dice, moving along a collapsing tiled room, collecting treasure, and avoiding fire from the dragon statues. From the first roll to the final roll, every decision is important to escaping with the most points or falling into the cavern below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
