			<description>Roar like a lion, waddle like a duck, draw an elephant on the table, explain what a dolphin eats, and tell where a bear lives: In Kikerikim&amp;auml;h!?, for two players or 3-6 players, whoever can do that the best, leading the other players more often than not in the right direction, will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game for 3-6 players, shuffle the 56 animal cards, then deal out cards as evenly as possible among all the players. If a player receives a matching pair of animal cards, remove these from the game as they are not needed. Shuffle the challenge cards and place them in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player draws the topmost challenge card &amp;ndash; with challenges being something that you draw or describe or imitate, e.g., &amp;quot;describe the animal's feet&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;using your fingers, mimic how the animal walks&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;describe or show how the animal eats&amp;quot;. This player draws the topmost animal card from her deck, then completes the challenge as best she can. Each other player then looks through their personal deck of animal cards, chooses one animal they think best matches the description or sounds given, then reveal these cards simultaneously. If someone has matched the active player, those two cards are removed from play; likewise, if any two players have revealed matching animals, those cards are removed from play. All other animals are returned to their owners' decks. The next player then undergoes a challenge, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one or more players have no animal cards remaining, the game ends and those players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the two-player game, each player takes a set of animal cards and they take turns doing the challenges. If the non-active player reveals the right animal card, those cards are removed from play; otherwise, the challenger's card and the matching card from the other player's deck are placed in the middle of the table as a penalty point. The goal is to score as few penalty points as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
