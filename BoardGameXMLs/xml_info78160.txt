These are desperate hours for Allied forces as the Nazi war machine rages across a devastated European landscape. You are US Army Lieutenant William Holt, hand-picked by William 'Wild Bill' Donovan to be the first field agent of the newly formed Office of Strategic Services: the OSS. Medal of Honor European Assault makes you the driving force in the struggle to liberate Europe.
