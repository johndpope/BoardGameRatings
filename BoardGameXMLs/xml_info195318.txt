							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gem Magic</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectacular Spells that Sparkle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gems have a special sort of magic all their own. Even mundane gems can be items of wondrous beauty, incredible value, and spectacular legend. They come in all shapes and sizes, in a rainbow of colors, and a wide range of clarities, from those as transparent as glass, that sparkle in the light, to ones that are completely opaque. Though they are dug from the ground, they are the domain of kings and queens, priceless works of art, and the greatest of treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book mines 11 brand new spells that explore these magical aspects of gems, and others. From first to ninth level, no magic is too small or too great for the magnificent gem. Inside this book you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A spell that turns a gem into a magical lens, revealing different things depending on what type of gem is used.&lt;br/&gt;    A spell that allows you to store your soul in a diamond upon your death, making it easier and safer to return yourself to life.&lt;br/&gt;    A spell that refracts light from a diamond to create eight beams of magical energy in different directions, each with a different color and effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
