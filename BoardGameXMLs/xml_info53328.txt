							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danse Macabre (2004)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danse Macabre is a relatively rules-light dark fantasy game with an emphasis on mood and horror. The game works around player characters of relatively insignificant power in a world full of cosmic horrors, monstrosities and dark things. Helplessness is not only potentially a part of the game, it is generally expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that Danse Macabre stands at quite a remove from traditional fantasy or epic fantasy games. The expectation is that players will have to tread carefully and slowly through a given game session. Problems will usually have to be solved through clever reasoning, not brute strength, and it's quite likely that player characters will have to simply make a run for it when dark creatures turn up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short Danse Macabre is a game of careful survival, not glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is recommended that Danse Macabre is suited for a mature gaming group. Some elements of the game have an adult, sometimes philosophical, sometimes horrific theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
