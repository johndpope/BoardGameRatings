			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bahama was a Spanish ship of the line, built in Havana in 1780. Originally designed as 64&amp;ndash;gun by Ignacio Mullan, she left Havana for Cadiz on 1785. Here she was rebuilt and completed as a 74&amp;ndash;gun, following the project of Francisco Gautier, the designer of Nepomuceno class. As a 74&amp;ndash;gun ship of the line, she was armed with 74 cannons and a designed crew of 640. They were armed with 28 32&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the lower deck, 30 18&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the upperdeck, 8 32&amp;ndash;Pounder guns and 6 12&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the quarterdeck, and 2 12&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the forecastle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship was part of the Spanish fleet that participated in the Battle of Trafalgar, where she was hit by the intense fire of British ships, with 75 killed and 65 wounded. Her commander, Commodore Galiano, died after being struck by a cannonball. After capture by the British fleet, Bahama became HMS Bahama, following repairs in Gibraltar. She sailed to England and was used as a prison ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish Nepomuceno class &amp;ldquo;HMS San Juan 1805.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
