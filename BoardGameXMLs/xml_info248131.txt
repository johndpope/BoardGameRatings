			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He stopped the horse at the crossroads.  Caked in mud, the horse shook with exhaustion, snorting clouds of white breath into the cold, clear night.  He looked at the crossroads and the road sign that proclaimed Thelgaard was one mile away.  He stared at the sign...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...the red blood forms an arc as the sword slices through the body. The warrior lifts his arm and prepares for another deadly blow as his intended victim lifts his hands in a smooth motion and moves his lips.  But instead of words, there is noiseless blood splashing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tale of great wickedness, treacherous deception, legendary struggle, and eternal love. A story about the temptation of evil, the last chance for greatness, the last chance to make a bad deed good, and the temptation to change destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published as three PDF documents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        18-page player's scenario orientation&lt;br/&gt;        68-page GM's scenario orientation&lt;br/&gt;        32-page characters (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
