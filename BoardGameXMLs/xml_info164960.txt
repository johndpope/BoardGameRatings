			<description>From instruction manual,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed&lt;br/&gt;test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a powerplant malfunction caused the&lt;br/&gt;craft to skip off the rim of a smmall, black hole.  After experiencing&lt;br/&gt;level 5 turbulence I became unconsciouss.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a&lt;br/&gt;time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought&lt;br/&gt;waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally&lt;br/&gt;insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body&lt;br/&gt;parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical&lt;br/&gt;parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire&lt;br/&gt;society composed of machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of&lt;br/&gt;the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the&lt;br/&gt;expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After&lt;br/&gt;the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began&lt;br/&gt;attacking the good creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot&lt;br/&gt;the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the&lt;br/&gt;best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should &lt;br/&gt;prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines &lt;br/&gt;programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be &lt;br/&gt;awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  &lt;br/&gt;To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the &lt;br/&gt;last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have &lt;br/&gt;warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is &lt;br/&gt;constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
