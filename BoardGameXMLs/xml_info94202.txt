			<description>subtitle: 'a game for parents and their children'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Be the first to reach the target with your 3 meeples&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roll-and-move game where players are trying to reach the end of the game with their tokens.  Players may take shortcuts on marked areas by looking for partners to 'bridge' the distance; the more you cooperate the higher the chance to win, as those who don't cooperate to cross areas must complete the full-path of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team is 'Snakes and Ladders' without snakes, but you may use ladders only if you allow someone else to use this shortcut, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative version: Collect additional chips for every cooperative action you are involved in; use those chips as a multiplier for your winning points according final ranking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
