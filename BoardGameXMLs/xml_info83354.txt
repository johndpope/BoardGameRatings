			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Contained within the leaves of this book is a wealth of knowledge which, though it may not seen to at first glance, provides us with a great deal of insight into the lives of various Human, Military, and Subhuman races. The reasons for some everyday sights (such as why do Dwarves wear their beards braided) are contained hereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be kept in mind that the information cataloged within is based on what is common practice. There are always exceptions to every rule.Out in the field, one should be prepared for everything. This report will provide a foundation from which to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;For too long, archaeological companies and their employees have had to rely on old wives' tales, superstition, and rumor for their information concerning intimate relations between members of these races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;As the quote from the back of the book implies, this supplement is all about the sexual proclivities of the various Fifth Cycle races. There are also sections on venereal diseases and sex-related potions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
