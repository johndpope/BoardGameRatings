The front door is located in the right corner of the building, where the road turns, and a large man even needs to bend down so as not to hit his head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement consist of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Inn&amp;rsquo;s and staff description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Adventure hook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Stats for key character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
