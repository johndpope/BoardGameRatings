			<description>Card game using some mechanisms from the game of Pit. There are 52 cards:&lt;br/&gt;42 cards representing the news stories, in 6 sets of seven colours.&lt;br/&gt;3 Penalty Cards (which are all black).&lt;br/&gt;7 Reminder Cards (used for reference only).&lt;br/&gt;The news stories are;&lt;br/&gt;1. Fire&lt;br/&gt;2. Arson&lt;br/&gt;3. Strike&lt;br/&gt;4. Riot&lt;br/&gt;5. Fog&lt;br/&gt;6. Crash&lt;br/&gt;7. Spies&lt;br/&gt;The Penalty cards are Fog, Riot and Strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object it to be the first to collect a set of seven cards in one colour and no penalty cards. That player then shouts &amp;quot;Stop Press&amp;quot; to win.&lt;br/&gt;Any number could play but the rules suggest a maximum of 4 to 6 players. All the cards are dealt out and play begins. There are no turns, you just announce take a card out of your hand and lay it face-down in front of you. This card should be one you don't want. Call the name of the card (not the colour), and some other player might want that card. If you both agree, his face-down card and yours are exchanged. Of course, you must be honest but the card received might not be the colour wanted or it could even be a penalty card with that name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
