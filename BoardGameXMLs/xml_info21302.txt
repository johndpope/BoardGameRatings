							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hearts Playing Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The version has two different games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game involves players moving playing pieces from start to finish.  Players attempt to take tricks of balloons, stars, and flowers while avoiding the hearts.  The player taking the highest numbered card in the leading suit takes the trick.  After all cards are played, players move their markers ahead 1 space for each non-heart and back 1 space for each heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game determines movement by using cards and a spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
