			<description>LOOPING is a simple card game with the theme of aerobatics.  Each card represents the side view of an aircraft completing a maneuver - climbing, diving, looping or some other similar action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start card shows an aircraft taking off and to this players add further cards in a sequence with the smoke trails on the cards indicating where two cards can be connected together.  The card also indicates the difficulty of the stunt - and the points gained if the maneuver is successfully completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then idea of the game is to attempt to add cards allowing the aircraft to gain and lose altitude undertaking a variety of tricks on the way.  Whether the trick is achieved or not is determined by a die roll (throwing higher than a given number shown on some of the cards). Points are earned for a successfully completed maneuver. If you fail any part of the sequence then you score nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the aircraft is brought in to land, through the laying of the appropriate card, at a level at the same altitude from which it took off.  The winner is the player who scored the most points during the flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three variants OVER THE CLOUDS (3-5 players)  DARE-DEVILS (2-4 players) and SKY-RIDER (3-6 players)which, though broadly similar, do make the game suitable for differing numbers of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
