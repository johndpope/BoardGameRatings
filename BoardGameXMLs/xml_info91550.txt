							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Energy Czar</name>
									
			<description>From rule book introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Energy Czar is an educational simulation of the energy situation in the United States. A simulation is a simplified representation or working model of a real-world system,process or problem. Energy Czar lets you try to solve the problems of increasing demand, decreasing supplies,and rising costs of energy. As you attempt to solve these and other energy problems, you will learn a great deal about energy, economics, and politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scenario&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1980. The President of the United States has just appointed you Energy Czar and given you full power to guide the nation through the energy crisis. You have practically unlimited power to regulate eight energy resources: coal, oil, natural gas, uranium,hydroelectric power, solar power, wind power and biomass (Biomass includes synthetic fuels such as gasahol and byproducts  such as methane gas from decomposition of organic matter). You can promote or restrict these energy resources, ration them, raise or lower taxes on them, regulate prices, and tighten or loosen environmental controls. Whatever legislation you propose will be enacted.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
