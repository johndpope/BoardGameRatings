							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trail of the Monolith</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's been a robbery at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. A priceless artifact recovered by a team of archeologists from Miskatonic University is missing and reports from a witness bring inti question the nature of the thieves and their motivation. Unraveling the clues sets the investigators on the path of a world-wide conspiracy leading them from the world's great cities to the densest of jungles and the coldest of frozen wastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trail of the Monolith is a 1920s-era Call of Cthulhu (7th Edition) globe-trotting campaign for three to five intrepid investigators that can be played over several sessions. Although it can be played alone, the campaign is prefaced by The Scales of Time, and is part of a collection of eldritch adventures written by Mike Nagel and collected across three volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
