			<description>In a world beyond imagination...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their immeasurable greed and constant thirst for power, the thirteen most powerful Mages of all time doomed the land, hurling it into an endless spiral of chaos and despair. Entire countries were wiped out in the blink of an eye when the devastating power of the Elements was unleashed &amp;ndash; Elements summoned by dark rituals. Continents shattered like glass, the pieces strewn about like leaves in the wind. Huge armies, bound by the the power of ancient runes, brought war and destruction to the lands that survived the initial onslaught. All that was left were a few islands, connected by magic portals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, only a few years after the end of the Convocation, evil is back &amp;ndash; stronger and more powerful than ever before &amp;ndash; to finish what was started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet there is still hope. The prophecies tell of a human. A human damned to immortality, bound forever by the power of the blood runes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon, the time will come when the power of one may change the destiny of many. For better or for worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
