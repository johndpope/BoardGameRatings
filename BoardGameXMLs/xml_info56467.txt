							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Techno-Mages Fact Book</name>
									
			<description>[From the back of the book]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are dreamers, shapers, singers and makers. We study the mysteries of laser and circuit, crystal and scanner, holographic demons and invocations of equations. These are the tools we employ and we know many things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysteries wrapped in enigmas, the Techno-Mages are a poorly understood force within the galaxy. Operating to their own agendas, with a rich and unique history, the Techno-Mages Fact Book allows players and Game Masters alike to bring these powerful and ancient scholars into their games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History: A complete history into the origins and development of the order of Techno-Mages, including their associations with the First Ones and the younger races.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Techno-Mage Characters: In-depth rules on creating Techno-Mage characters and Non-Player Characters for your campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Techno-Mage Feats and Prestige Classes: Techno-Mages use powers unknown to the younger races in the galaxy, they have their own rituals, specializations, and options for empowerment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells: The science of the Techno-Mages is so advanced as to appear magical to those of inferior technology.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Items: An array of Techno-Magical items, including the mysterious Pinnace.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Personalities: Descriptions, history, and statistics for the principal Techno-Mages within and without the galactic rim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
