							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Swordmage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warriors stand toe to claw with their enemies, hacking at them with heavy metal blades and counting on layers of steel to keep them safe. While it works, they&amp;rsquo;re still vulnerable to the immaterial forces of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizards are better suited to dealing with that sort of thing, whether it means unleashing elemental forces upon their foes, resisting it, or knowing what&amp;rsquo;s about to happen. Unfortunately their studies preclude physical activities, so they have to keep a safe distance, lest their flesh by flayed from their bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But why choose just one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than specialize, you weave both spell and sword into a deadly new art. You can hold your own against ferocious monsters in melee, strike from a distance with blasts of fire or bolts of lightning, and even slice through baleful magics should they be employed against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains four files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two are letter-sized character sheets that use our new character sheet layout. One has a completely blank gear section, while the other fills in the initial choices if you want to just check some boxes and start playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized books, one in color, the other in black and white (to make it easier to print off at home if you want). They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The swordmage class, complete with 25 advanced moves.&lt;br/&gt;    New armor, dungeon gear, and an artifact: the black blade.&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut with questions to ask yourself when rolling up a swordmage, explanations and suggestions for some of the moves, and some extra moves that didn't make the original cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
