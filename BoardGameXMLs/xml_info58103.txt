			<description>How many people fit into a phone booth? Well, try it out yourself. A phone booth is assembled. Then players take turns stuffing sponge men in through the &amp;quot;windows&amp;quot;. When the booth is too full, it bursts and the player who caused that has to take all the sponge men that spill out. The goal is to get rid of all one's sponge men first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
