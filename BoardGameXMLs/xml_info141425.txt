			<description>Thou Art But A Warrior - A Game of Tragedies based on Polaris, by Anna Kreider, with additional writing by Ben Lehman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the great Caliphate has been dissolved and the unity of Iberia's Muslims lost, their power has not failed entirely. The taifas have their armies, and at the heart of those armies are the noble orders of Muslim Knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Knights swear solemn oaths to revere Allah and his Prophet, to fight for the defense of the innocent, and to honour a strict code of ethics and morals in order to bring about peace and justice for their society. They are warriors and poets, and they are the last hope of a people who do not see their doom before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their inevitable failure is a thing to be mourned most deeply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second, revised edition (called &amp;quot;Complete Edition&amp;quot; in the colophon) was financed by a successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo in January 2013. This covered printing and some new art. Apart from several improvements, the second edition also includes the Polaris system (which was omitted from the first printing).&lt;br/&gt;The first edition from 2008 was the winner of the International Setting Design Contest hosted on the Forge in 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
