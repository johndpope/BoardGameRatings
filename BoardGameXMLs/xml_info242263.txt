			<description>The 18th century in Europe saw a massive development in weapons and tactics. The musket was refined into a flintlock, smoothbore with a socket bayonet. Although accuracy was low, which limited effective fire to very short ranges, volume of fire improved considerably and units were capable of firing three and sometimes four rounds a minute. The infantryman was now capable of combining the roles of musketeer and pikeman in one. And to maximise firepower, formations became wider. The aim was to move a formation to within range of the enemy and then overwhelm them with firepower. Only rarely was a bayonet charge needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units of 3 bases represent an infantry battalion or cavalry squadron. Suggested basing sizes are given for 6, 15, and 25/28mm figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns activating one brigade at a time. Each brigade commander is rated as Poor, Average, or Excellent, which allows the commander to activate 1-3 groups of brigade units. After all brigades have activated, combat occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes army lists for various 18th century wars: Great Norther War, American Indian Wars, War of Spanish Succession, Wars Against the Turks, Jacobite Risings, Seven Years War, American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
