			<description>Played with a standard deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-player rules:&lt;br/&gt;One player takes all the red cards; the other black cards. &lt;br/&gt;Jokers or the card box are laid to form the central tile of a 5x5 grid. Players each lay a card orthogonally adjacent to this central tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then players take turns either:&lt;br/&gt;  - laying any card in an empty space orthogonally adjacent to an existing friendly card.&lt;br/&gt;  - laying any card on top of a friendly card (to increase defence).&lt;br/&gt;  - laying a card on top of an enemy card. This can only be done if the enemy card is orthogonally adjacent to a friendly card AND the card being laid is higher in rank than the existing card.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one to occupy more spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 player game:&lt;br/&gt;Players 1 and 2 take a suit each. Player 3 takes 2 suits, giving them stronger card to make up for being wedged in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 player game:&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses one suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
