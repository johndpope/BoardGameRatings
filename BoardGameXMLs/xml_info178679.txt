			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Seiji Kanai's Love Letter and the Lost Legacy games, Hatsu Koi is a microgame that follows in such gameplay traditions with beautiful anime-style artwork. Rediscover the joy of puppy love in this simple and elegant card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 18-card &amp;quot;draw a card, play a card&amp;quot; microgame focuses on winning and losing. Are you lucky enough to win? Or will taking your chances lead to a broken heart?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Most of the 10 different abilities on the cards provide ways to win the round or cause players to be knocked out of the round. If there is no card to draw, the lowest number on the cards is the winner. Win two rounds, and you can win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
