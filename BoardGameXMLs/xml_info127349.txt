							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Game of Snake</name>
									
			<description>The game is a simple race game somewhat similar to the better known Chutes and Ladders game. To play you'd need two dice (or a tee totem according to the rules...), a distinct marker for each player,  and the game sheet. Presumably only the game sheet was sold and the player would have to supply the other components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 122 spaces on the game board are marked out along a snake. The start is &amp;quot;through&amp;quot; the snakes mouth which requires a 2 to pass. Space 122 is at the tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board directs forwards and backwards movements as in Chutes and ladders. However there are many differences to the standard Chutes and ladders game. The winner must get past 122 to win. Landing on some squares entitles the player to two throws, or causes him to lose a turn. A player unlucky enough to land on space 119 loses the whole game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
