							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fishermen&#039;s Village</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small village, rising on a rocky coast, is the perfect starting point for campaigns and sea-based adventures. It also provides a good location for horror-based adventures in Lovecraft style.&lt;br/&gt;This village features a small harbor protecting the fishermen&amp;rsquo;s boats from the fury of the elements. Most of the houses are small buildings made of stone and wood. The village features a small temple dedicated to a sea deity. The temple is a simple building with some columns on the front side. Many statues with small water pools are shown in the temple, while in the temple crypt a large burial pool occupies most of the space.&lt;br/&gt;The shipyard is located on a small hook on the coast. Inside the shipyard there is the construction room, the warehouses and, on the first floor, the master&amp;rsquo;s apartment.&lt;br/&gt;The warehouses house any type of sea-based goods such as fish and ship supplies, on the first floor there is a small fisherman&amp;rsquo;s home. Finally, we have the tavern, with the tavernkeeper&amp;rsquo;s home upstairs.&lt;br/&gt;Here are some hints to use the fishermen&amp;rsquo;s village:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     People begin to disappear in the village; During the night the villagers heard strange sounds and noise from the temple crypt.&lt;br/&gt;     Strange sea monsters begin to attack the shipyard of the village, they are led by a powerful man-fish.&lt;br/&gt;     The seafood stored in the warehouses of the village begins to rot at fast rate since a strange man, all dressed in black, took home in one of the village&amp;rsquo;s houses.&lt;br/&gt;     A group of pirates has decided to seize the village to make it their base. The pirates sunk all the fishermen&amp;rsquo;s boats and imprisoned all the men and children, keeping the women in the temple they desecrated. The PCs arrive in the village during the night while the pirate ship is out of the harbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
