			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the London district of Whitechapel in 1888, where a series of particularly horrible murders take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the remastered version of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper offers the ability to play in a third-person perspective in addition to the first-person perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time the industrial revolution was in full swing, the British Empire was at its peak. As the premiere world power, England's model of wealth and modernity radiated throughout the world. However, Whitechapel District, in the East End of London, hardly reflected this brilliant reality. Whitechapel was the capital's most squalid neighborhood. Within its boundaries lived England's worst rabble including alcoholics, beggars, prostitutes, as well as a large community of Jewish immigrants fleeing Eastern Europe's ever growing anti-Semitism. In this terrible hole of misery, tens of thousands of people lived crammed within a maze of narrow, sinister, stinky streets overshadowed by fog. To deal with the poverty, the government created Public Work Houses in an attempt to manage the masses. It is within this sinister set, faithfully rendered in all its details and similar to a macabre playground that the player, as Sherlock Holmes, will have to investigate and track Jack the Ripper and solve one of the greatest mysteries of crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
