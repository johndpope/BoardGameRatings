			<description>Serata in Giallo (Evening of Mystery) is the premier collection of murder mystery games to appear in Italy. The players are invited to an Evening of Mystery, during the course of which each player enacts the role of one of the protagonists of the event. The games unfold in &amp;ldquo;acts&amp;rdquo; with a theatrical flavor, and the game may or may not include an &amp;quot;investigation team.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luna di Miele sul Nilo (Honeymoon on the Nile)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Excelsa, a luxury boat carrying a couple on their wedding cruise, floats slowly down the Nile in the direction of Cairo. On board is the famous &amp;ldquo;Dogon Wizard,&amp;rdquo; an illusionist who has the assignment of entertaining the passengers. But just when the show is nearing the apex of tension, something terrible happens.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators must now perceive this situation as a typical &amp;quot;case&amp;quot; in the tradition of the &amp;quot;locked room&amp;quot;: Andr&amp;eacute; Tavernier and his girlfriend come to their deaths in their suite which is dead-bolted from the inside. Who killed them, and above, all how? This is a homicide that only two persons can apparently have committed: the Dogon Wizard with his extraordinary paranormal powers, or the devil in person!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place &lt;br/&gt;Egypt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time &lt;br/&gt;June 1990&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;Seven&amp;mdash;4 men and 3 women&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jean Giannetti (Dogon Wizard): 37 years old.
