			<description>Have you always wanted to own a dog of your own but you're just too busy to look after a real live animal. Well now you can enjoy the fun of owning and exercising your very own virtual dog with &amp;quot;Fetch!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your pick of the dogs at the kennels, all waiting eagerly and excitedly to see if you are going to choose them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fetch! uses superb 3d graphics to bring to life your pet and the environment he lives in. Enjoy the shade of the tree at the bottom of your garden or the sun through the window of your kitchen.
