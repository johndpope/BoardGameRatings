			<description>Each player dons a hat covered with Velcro strips marked with different points.  There are three sponge balls also covered in Velcro strips so that they will stick to the hats.  Several different games can be played with the equipment, rules being provided for six variations.  The basic game involves the players throwing the balls at each other until they have all stuck - whichever player has scored the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
