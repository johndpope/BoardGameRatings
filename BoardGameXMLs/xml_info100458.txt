			<description>Cave Girl takes the S&amp;amp;G combat system to prehistoric times. In this game, a cave girl named Sharr must compete for her existence with dinosaurs. each character in the game comes with several cards designating their fighting abilities which can be used in battle. There are several scenarios included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players activate a character which can take up to two actions, including fight, move, rest, climb, or stand/go prone. Characters can attack enemies that are one square away for melee attack or may use ranged attack for enemies further away. Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
