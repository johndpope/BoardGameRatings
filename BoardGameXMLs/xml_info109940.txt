			<description>The essence of ancient Alchemy, the Philosopher's Stone, has been hidden in the Philosopher's Tower until now, and for good reason. But now Duke Marduk is heading to the tower to take the stone and use it. But for what?  And why has he abducted Celty, the mysterious girl from Shining Dawn Village, who is somehow connected to it all? One thing is clear, terrible things are happening, and Duke Marduk must be stopped. Someone must be a hero in this world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aurum Blade is a fast-paced action RPG with thrilling attack weapons and spells, and truly enjoyable control. All of this and more is waiting to be discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
