			<description>An early football game. Each player has seven numbered pieces representing football players. The number on a piece represents the maximum number of squares the piece may move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A die roll decides which team starts with the ball. Each side alternates moving one player. The ball may be taken from the opposing ball carrier by landing on the same space by exact count. The ball may also be pitched between pieces in the same horizontal row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
