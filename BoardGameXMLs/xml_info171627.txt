							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arkhangel: The Great Nameless</name>
									
			<description>2-4 players work together to prevent the fabric of all reality from being torn asunder while competing against one another to further their own personal goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate Creator of all universes is also a mindless force of chaos and destruction. That which it has created it will eventually destroy. It is mindless, but all-powerful. The first of its creations to survive and assume intelligence consider themselves Its sons and daughters: the Excubiae. At the beginning of time, they worked together to seal away the Great Nameless, in order to protect the Realms they had created for their own progeny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In true Shakespearean fashion, these siblings developed alliances and rivalries, and began working with and against one another, all while their Creator attempted to work Its way through their ancient seals...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Great Nameless, each player assumes the identity of their very own god. They lord over their own Realm, create miracles, and force their worshippers to do their bidding.  They may even manifest in physical form, greatly affecting the battlefield before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of different decks, tailored to each god, and a central, autonomous deck that represents the unstoppable force that is The Great Nameless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race up and down a doom track to seal away their Realms from the center of the board, and work to help their allies and sabotage their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players accumulate victory points for placing seals, destroying the armies of The Great Nameless, destroying the forces of their foes, and playing valuable cards of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
