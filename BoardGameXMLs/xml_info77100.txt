			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathways Into Darkness is an early First Person Shooter/Adventure hybrid released for the mac by Bungie software.  It features sprite-based enemies and a simple 3-D engine for the walls and corridors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game tasks the player with exploring an ancient pyramid full of strange monsters, as well as the bodies of previous unlucky explorers.  The whole pyramid is supposedly the creation of a 'Dreaming God', an ancient malevolent entity which is stirring in its slumber and will soon destroy the world.  As a member of a special forces team, you have to reach the bottom level of the pyramid and plant a nuclear device before it awakens, but before the game begins you are separated from the other members of your team and lose most of your equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monsters in the game are handled in standard FPS fashion, with several guns, a limited amount of ammo, and a few special weapons.  Where Pathways differs from the norm is the time limit and adventure-game elements.  You are given 5 real-time days to complete your mission, and time also elapses when your character rests.  Also, you have an inventory for your ammo, as well as items such as potions and special crystals that are found in the pyramid.  These key items have to be used in several areas to progress with the game, and one of them allows you to converse with NPCs (all of whom are dead).  These conversations are carried out in a prompt-response format, and frequently are the only way to get information needed to proceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strict time limit, consumable inventory items, tough puzzles, and ease of missing something in the dark labyrinth all combine to give the game a high difficulty level.  It is advisable to create multiple save slots, since not having a particular item or using too much time could leave your game in an unrecoverable state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
