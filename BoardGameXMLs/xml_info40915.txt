			<description>The Battle of Piotrk&amp;oacute;w Trybunalski was a battle taking place during the invasion of Poland, 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the German breakthrough at Borowa Gora, the Germans headed for the Polish town of Piotrk&amp;oacute;w Trybunalski. German tanks attacked the town, but Polish 155 mm howitzers destroyed several tanks and the attackers fell back. Returning later that day, they managed to destroy 7 Polish tanks with artillery but lost just after five Panzers . After receiving several more direct hits and losing two more large Panzers, the German tank crews simply ran away. Polish 7TP tanks pursued and kept beating the rest of the tanks off. The German soldiers now met the Polish infantry and attacked, but they were repelled by the Polish tanks. &lt;br/&gt;Soon, all the Germans retreated and by the end of September 6, no hostile forces were in Piotrk&amp;oacute;w Trybunalski. On September 7, Marshal Rydz-Smigly orders the Polish forces to withdraw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wikipedia: Battle of Piotrków Trybunalski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
