							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Annapurna</name>
									
			<description>In Annapurna, players are set with climbing the titular mountain range by swapping and flipping cards over as they make their ascent. Randomly arranged in a triangle, players flip a card when attempting to move to it. Some cards will give or negate points and others will block your progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swapping cards from your hand into your mountain or your opponent's mountain will help you along or deter the progress of your opponents. Rounds end after one player has reached their summit. There are 3 rounds total, after which the player with the most points has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you really fall behind, playing cards from the chaos deck will drastically alter the mountain for the benefit or detriment of everyone or even just sometimes yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
