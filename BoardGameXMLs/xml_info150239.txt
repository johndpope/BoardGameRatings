							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vaporetto: Orbital Barge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vaporetto is a grav barge originally designed for use in and around the floating city of Tarazet. The grav barges also travel down to the planetary surface below, and up to orbiting space stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the Vaporetto saw its finest hour during a long-ago civil war. After a failed military coup 700 years ago, the popular government defended itself using militarized versions of the Vaporetto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most popular of these was the &amp;lsquo;Viper&amp;rsquo; which had two squad support weapons mounted at the doors, operated by a pair of door gunners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original door gunners at the start of the coup were government troopers. Later, as the coup turned to civil war, the door gunner position often used non-military volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains deck plans, artwork showing the four different variants, counters for use in space battles, and lots of background information. There are so many of these grav barges floating around the city that it's easy to flag one down and commandeer it. It is also easy to increase the armour and add door guns to make this design a formidable opponent in small skirmishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
