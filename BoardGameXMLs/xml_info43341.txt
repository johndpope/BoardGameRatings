			<description>&amp;quot;A game of adventure with Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest&amp;quot; - also known as &amp;quot;ROBIN HOOD GAME OF ADVENTURE&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple spin and move game produced in the UK in the 1950s by Bell Toys. The game is far too luck driven for repeated plays - but it has superb production values, including 3d features (the Target, Deer and Treasury) and a wonderfully illustrated board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 2-4 players. Each player chooses a corner of the board, which is used to hold the players pegs (&amp;quot;arrows&amp;quot;) and any money that the player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a member of Robin Hood's band (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck, Little John or Maid Marian) and places them at the &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; square. Each player then uses the spinner in centre of the board; instead of numbers, the spinner points to different coloured squares, Each players playing piece is then moved around the board to the next relevant coloured square,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a square with instructions on, they must be obeyed. Players crossing Treasury Road collect one coin from the Treasury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any player lands on a square with a target on it, all players proceed to the Archery ground for an Archery contest. Each player has 3 shots (spins of the central spinner) in succession, their pegs (&amp;quot;arrows&amp;quot;) are placed in the target according to the colour indicated by the spinner. The player with the highest score collects a coin from each of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on a square with an arrow then that player must pay one coin to the players nearest to them on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on a square marked &amp;quot;Golden Chance&amp;quot; they spin the central spinner to determine the result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- if spinner points at the Treasury collect 2 coins&lt;br/&gt;- if spinner points at a Name collect 1 coin&lt;br/&gt;- if spinner points at the Deer lose 2 coins to the Treasury&lt;br/&gt;- if spinner points at the Target an Archery contest takes place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player runs out of coins to pay a forfeit they miss a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands in &amp;quot;Go to London&amp;quot; they collect a coin from the Treasury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to collect 10 coins and reach the &amp;quot;Go to London&amp;quot; square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
