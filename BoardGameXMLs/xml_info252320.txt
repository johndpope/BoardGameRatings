							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The War of the Worlds: France</name>
									
			<description>The War of the Worlds is a solitaire board game that puts you in command of the Human forces in a desperate attempt to defend Earth against the invading Martian Tripods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you plan and carry out the Human side of the war, the game system commands the Martian forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War of the Worlds is a solitaire, low complexity board game. Each games takes only an hour or so to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While France enjoyed quality soldiers and equipment, it suffered from a lack of quality leadership. In the game, French forces are less expensive, but also less skilled. This will make their battles larger than English battles, but they will also suffer more casualties. They have the standard 4 PP cost to build Harbors, but must pay 3 PP instead of 2 PP to move Units during the Production step. Again, reflecting the lack of effective leadership. The Martians receive 4 Tripods in each Wave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
