			<description>The Druid Council has become weakened through in-fighting and years of drought. The leader of each Druidic chapter races to seize control of the council and assume power as Chief Druid. Upon establishing command he unleashes a team of assassins to eliminate his political enemies, and become the unopposed Supreme Grand Chief Druid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the ancient African (Baggara Arabs of the Sudan) game of Li&amp;rsquo;b el Merafib or Hyena, which may have been based upon an unknown ancient Druidic game, which may have been based upon actual events at Stonehenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Stonehenge Game System&lt;br/&gt;Players race around the board, the first to reach the council seizes power. They then unleash assassins to hunt down the other players. After all political rivals have been purged or exiled, the winner flaunts their status with a huge victory rally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
