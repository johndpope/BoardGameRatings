Along the road there are numerous free-cities, towns and villages ruled by prominent local families or councils. Waystations and outposts provide food and lodging for travelers along the trade routes. Farming, fishing and hunting provide for the prosperity of the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This quiet countryside is rocked one evening when a giant column of green flame erupts suddenly out of an old ruin near the small village of Fallmarch.
