							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Husband at Large</name>
									
			<description>Unusual chase game.  One player plays the part of the husband, and others are relatives and friends of his wife. An elusive spouse appears and disappears from the board as other players roll dice to move about and see if they can land on the space where the husband is hiding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is either the husband or everyone else.  Husband is also given a level depending on when (and if) caught:  Aimless Amateur, Deflated Don Juan, Fearless Fugitive, Rueful Romeo, Careless Casanova, or Playboy at Large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very 1960&amp;amp;#039;s, but still amusing today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
