			<description>This new Berlin-based publisher will be presenting Monstererbe &amp;ndash; Das Testament des Doktor F (Monster Inheritance &amp;ndash; the Will of Doctor F) by Michael Benkendorf. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to awaken a monster and keep him alive. Here an atmospheric description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overlooked, unsuccessful and completely-forgotten-by-the-underworld Doctor F, nephew of a certain Frankenstein, has fruitlessly tried his entire life to follow in the footsteps of his famous uncle. Lonesome and bitter, he writes his last will and testament out one stormy night. He demands from his inheritors that they solve the task that he himself couldn&amp;rsquo;t: the creation of an artificial human being, often labeled a monster by more ignorant folk. Only he who solves this puzzle will be considered worthy of being awarded the enormous castle and the lands surrounding it. To assist them in their quest, each potential inheritor gets a corpse, a laboratory and the help of Igor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting up the laboratory, finding organs, waking up the monster &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s as easy as that. You only need to keep a hairsbreadth in front of the competition. Whoever wants to be the inheritor of Doctor F needs skill with trading and auctioning, a little luck with digging, bad weather, and naturally a brain &amp;ndash; even better would be two or three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players try &amp;ndash; with the help of Igor &amp;ndash; to find the necessary vital organs as quickly as possible in the graveyard. But a lightning rod and a big switch are required. &lt;br/&gt;And naturally tons and tons of green goo. The most important part is the brain, though. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a selection: Beethoven, Newton, Marx or maybe Jack the Ripper? &lt;br/&gt;For protection, you can always hang a couple of shrunken heads and a stuffed crocodile in your lab. But what&amp;rsquo;s the use of all that if the weather&amp;rsquo;s sunny and devoid of lightning? &lt;br/&gt;Then only James Watt&amp;rsquo;s mysterious atmospheric steam machine will help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
