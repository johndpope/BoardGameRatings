			<description>You and up to 3 of your friends will have to utilize your stupid (STUPID!) minds to battle flying saucers over Hollywood who have resurrected a trio of ghouls in this deck building game based on Edward D. Wood Jr.'s infamous &amp;quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space: The Deckbuilding Game&amp;quot; is a co-operative deck builder for 1 to 4 players that lovingly adapts &amp;quot;the worst movie of all time&amp;quot; into the card game it was never meant to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must acquire cards featuring the film's heroes -- to battle the invading aliens who are bent on the destruction of humanity! Fight their trio of bizarre ghoul soldiers -- Inspector Clay, Vampira, and a guy who looks like Dracula -- but also kind of like a dentist in multiple locations from the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must defeat the alien onslaught before time runs out and they destroy humanity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
