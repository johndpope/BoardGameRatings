			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Right Tools For The Job&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A professional assassination leaves nothing to chance, with everything planned out in meticulous detail, dozens of contingencies, and a solution on hand for every possible problem. But in addition to a very particular set of skills, this also requires a very particular set of tools; tools that can be highly specialized to particular jobs, or far more general in nature. And while not every adventurer is an assassin, nearly every adventurer can find a use for the tools a dealer of death might have lying around in his or her toolbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains eight new magic items and ten new poisons, thematically appropriate for assassins and others of their ilk, including the following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Addlemind, a poison that makes it all but impossible to concentrate on spells, allowing enemy spellcasters to be negated.&lt;br/&gt;    The bone dart, a magic dart made from bone which, among other things, causes the victim&amp;rsquo;s corpse to instantly rot away leaving only a skeleton behind.&lt;br/&gt;    Nightlbinder, a poison that strips its victims of the ability to see in the dark, among other effects.&lt;br/&gt;    The gloves of entrance and exit, which allow the wearer to open doorways in nearly any surface.&lt;br/&gt;    Softskin, a poison that reduces a creature&amp;rsquo;s damage reduction and natural armor.&lt;br/&gt;    Poisoner&amp;rsquo;s gloves, which aid in both delivering poisons covertly, and poisoning weapons swiftly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
