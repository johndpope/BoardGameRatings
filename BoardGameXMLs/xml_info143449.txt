			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dicecapades! Dice-T is the fast-paced, dice-rolling, crossword game where spelling words and lots of luck=win! Try completing as many of your crosswords with your rolled dice. The more crosswords you can complete, the more points you will score! You might get lucky and get some bonus points and wild spaces, or you might have to swap cards with an opponent! Players of all skill levels can compete and win as you try to sell two- to five-letter words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn, challenging to win, Dicecapades! Dice-T is the ultimate friend and family word game that'll keep everyone on their toes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players will get 12 dice and 3 &amp;quot;Dice-T&amp;quot; cards. The cards have crosswords on them, bonus points, or game modifiers. Players try to complete the crosswords by rolling their dice and using the available letters. Play is simultaneous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete all their crosswords scores the points on their cards. After 10 rounds, the game is over and the player with the highest points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
