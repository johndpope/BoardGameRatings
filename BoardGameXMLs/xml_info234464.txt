			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FLESHLESS ONES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rookie patrolman Perry Mahoney was recently found dead in his apartment from unknown causes. Earlier in the week, he was acting strange, claiming he was being pursued by horrific living skeletons! Was Mahoney&amp;rsquo;s death caused by paranoia run rampant, or had he stumbled upon a grisly hidden conspiracy to subvert and control mankind!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Creepy Comic Conversion&amp;rdquo; series brings those classic horror comics of the &amp;lsquo;50s and &amp;lsquo;60s back to life for the CRYPTWORLD roleplaying game! The front half of each zine presents an original terrifying tale from a long-forgotten classic horror comic. Then, in the back, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the story fully fleshed out and statted into a horrific adventure ready for a frightening evening of gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Fleshless Ones&amp;rdquo; originally appeared in WORLDS OF FEAR, June 1953, Vol. 2, No. 10, by Fawcett Publications, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
