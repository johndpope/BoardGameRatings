							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemist&#039;s Quest</name>
									
			<description>Alchemist's Quest is a game about alchemists (players) competing to create compounds that will help them achieve one or all of the three great goals in life: Health, Wealth, and Power. Each player takes turn gathering elements (Rolling Dice) to create higher and higher order compounds (Buying table cards). Some of the cards have effects such as making a player an Apprentice (Giving the player an extra die to roll). Gathering elements is not without risk, however, as rolling the element death can cause negative consequences (such as losing a turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
