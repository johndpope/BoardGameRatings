							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Defenders of the Realm: Realm in Flames and Darkness Spreads</name>
									
			<description>A set of nine additional Darkness Spreads cards that can be added to the Darkness Spreads deck of the Defenders of the Realm base game for added variety and difficulty.  The Darkness Spreads deck is used to determine where new minions are placed on the board and which Generals move, as well as have additional effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four of the cards are Monarch City raid cards, with one card being used for each of the four minion types to have that minion enter Monarch City and two other locations.  None of the Generals are moved with these cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cards have a minion attack each of the inns, with the player immediately drawing another Darkness Spreads card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once card places three Dragonkin, and then the player gets to choose which general they would like to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final two cards will place fires in different locations and will include fire tokens to mark those locations as being on fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
