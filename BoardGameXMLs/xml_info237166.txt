			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown Armies Campaign Starter Kits help you get started running your Unknown Armies campaign quickly. Each kit features the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Five characters, broken and damaged and ready to go&lt;br/&gt;    One group objective for the cabal to pursue&lt;br/&gt;    A first session scenario to get things moving quickly&lt;br/&gt;    GM hooks, additional objective ideas, GMCs, and suggestions for the antagonist phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this campaign starter kit, you have all that you need to fuel your imagination and get things moving. The kit takes the place of the initial planning and collaborative character and setting creation system provided in Unknown Armies. Players select a character, choose one or two additional relationships with the other player characters, and make these obsessed individuals their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raiders of the Lost Mart is about the night shift employees at a bulk discount superstore whose shelves occasionally manifest dangerous occult artifacts. Their cabal is one of necessity and mutual employment, but as they dig further, the magickal truths of the superstore&amp;rsquo;s nature are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
