			<description>From the Press release at launch, Eezee Kricket is &amp;quot;The Teaching Learning Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a fairly simple roll-and-move game where the player moves his pawn around an 8x8 grid, following the instructions on the given square.  If the square shows that the batsman is out, then the player must answer a trivia question - if he fails to answer correctly, then he is out, but if he gets it right, he continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trivia questions are all cricket based, specifically pertaining to cricket in the West Indies and require at least an interest in West Indian cricket to be able to have a chance of getting them right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
