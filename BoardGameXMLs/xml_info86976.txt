			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very basic graphics and game-play in this Space Invaders variant (with no block houses). Various alien types bounce around above you very erratically, dropping laser bombs, while you sweep left and right, shooting up at them to try and hit them. Try being the operative word, since they move around so rapidly and randomly, it's pot luck if you hit them. Incredibly long on screen instructions for a very low grade game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programming by ADAM. Cover painting by Phil Gascoine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
