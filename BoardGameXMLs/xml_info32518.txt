			<description>A trivia game where the game host (called the impresario in the game) role rotates between the players.&lt;br/&gt;An impresario is first selected, and then picks a random picture from the deck of cards. &lt;br/&gt;Within a time limit, the other players have to write down the name of the star/celebrity. Only those who have the right answer can then get an extra trivia question on that celebrity for extra points. The specific question is determined by a 12-sided roll. &lt;br/&gt;All the wrong answers are giving points to the impresario.&lt;br/&gt;Once the impresario has done 4 cards/photographs (and possibly 4 trivia questions), the player to the left becomes the impresario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of an agreed number of impresario rounds, the player with the most points win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
