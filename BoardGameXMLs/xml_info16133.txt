			<description>One of Gerhard Kodys' better games, the game concerns moving in the right social circles and this gaining the best seats at a restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game rules description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Appearance and Reality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;400&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;glitterati&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;beautiful people&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;VIP&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to be part of their world of luxury, glamour and glitz&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, we can&amp;rsquo;t all belong to it. The road to the top leads through the best tables at the INSIDER! The super-luxury-IN-temple in the center of the city. &amp;ldquo;The&amp;rdquo; restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those seen there may rightfully count themselves among &amp;ldquo;High Society&amp;rdquo;. But in order to reach your goal must you keep your adversaries at bay. By use of &amp;quot;Scandals&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rumors&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Contacts&amp;quot; and many other actions you are trying to climb the social ladder while trying to put a spike in the wheel of your opponents. Lucky for you that having a &amp;quot;Bodyguard&amp;quot; handy just might save you from just about everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And don't despair. Those who are IN today may be &amp;quot;Total OUT&amp;quot; tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
