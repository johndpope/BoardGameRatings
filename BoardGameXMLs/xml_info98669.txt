			<description>cover blurb:&lt;br/&gt;This module has been created with the specific intent of introducing a new player to the ADVANCED  DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS rule system.  It is designed specifically for a single character and Dungeon Master,  however, if the Dungeon Master so wishes it may be expanded upon to provide a challenge for an entire party.   The module is intended to stand on it's own, or may be incorporated into an existing campaign.  It was  originally created to help an associate of the author's to learn how to play ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND  DRAGONS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes for the Dungeon Master:&lt;br/&gt; Like the first DELVER&amp;rsquo;S  DUNGEON Adventure Module (DD1: Swords Against  Chaos), this module has been designed with a one-on-one  session in mind for the a beginning player and Dungeon  Master to learn the mechanics of the ADVANCED  DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS role-playing game rules.  The  same admonishment is given here as was in the  introductory notes for that module:  first and foremost, have  fun!  Secondly, the module can be either played as a  stand-alone adventure or worked into an existing  campaign.  Finally, the module itself can be expanded on  for use with multiple characters and differentiating classes  as well.  Furthermore, it is imperative (again as noted in the  introduction to DD1: Swords Against Chaos) that if this  module is to be used as a tool for teaching a new player, it  is imperative that the Dungeon Master let the cards fall  where they may - death can come swiftly for the unwary in  a world inhabited by orcs, goblins, evil wizards and worse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
