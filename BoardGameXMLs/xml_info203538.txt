							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Count Orlok</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power behind the Vampire Throne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Orlok has sought dominion of the world through vampire slaves since the second century AD. In the 1400s, he turned hundreds by promising immune to the Black Death. When imprisoned by the power of the Church, he still managed to gain influence through an agent named Vlad. When Van Helsing foiled those plans, Orlok was forced to forge a new apprentice in the person of British nobleman Jonathan Howlett, who he eventually sent to curry favor as the Nazi super being &amp;ldquo;Nachtoter.&amp;rdquo; When that intermediary was struck down by Pendragon, Orlok simply faded back into the shadows, and began his next plan&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconic Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
