							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Christians, Pagans, and the Altar of Victory (384)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a member of the Roman Senate in 384 AD. Since the days of Constantine, Rome has been a deeply divided city.  Constantine rescinded the old laws prohibiting Christianity, openly favored Christians in staffing the imperial bureaucracy, and established Constantinople as a specifically Christian city. Nevertheless, many Romans &amp;mdash; perhaps most of them &amp;mdash; remain faithful to the traditional religion, which the Christians dismissively refer to as paganism (from the Latin term paganus, which roughly means &amp;ldquo;rustic&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;uneducated&amp;rdquo;). The result for much of the fourth century has been domestic turmoil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collegiate-level game is intended to be played in a single class session of about one hour.  It includes review (&amp;quot;grading&amp;quot;) criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
