			<description>Set firmly in Greek legend, Blood and Bronze mixes roleplaying and boardgaming aspects to make competitive and strategic 1-2 hour game. Each player acts as one of the cities of Greek legend using alliances, treachery, accusations and boasts all feature as the cities strive to be remembered as the greatest in all of Greece. To win the game strive to become dominate, called &amp;quot;Without Peer!&amp;quot; in 3 of four arenas: Army, Hero, King and God. If by the end of the agreed playing time no player has won, then the Game is said to have been won by those upstart Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is described by the publisher as &amp;quot;much more a boardgame kind of thing than a role-playing game.&amp;quot; Others have tried using the term &amp;quot;resource management game&amp;quot; to avoid both the board and RPG labels. It is available in both regular edition, with cardboard chits, and the Without Peer! edition that has bronze coins and a brass bowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version of the game was an entry in the 2005 Iron Game Chef RPG Game design competition This version is still a hybrid game but more towards the role-playing end of the spectrum than the final product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
