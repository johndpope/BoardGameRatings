			<description>Les Petits Pirates is a mini game played on a single, small game board.  In Les Petits Pirates, players are pirates, working to gather resources and gold while trying to prevent their opponents from doing the same.  Through action selection and dice manipulation, players will plunder, attack, and sail the seas in their quest to bury enough treasure and enjoy a decadent pirate retirement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les Petits Pirates is an easy game to expand for more players or larger games.  A single 5.5&amp;rdquo; x 8.5&amp;rdquo; game board can support 2-4 players with 3 ships each.  Multiple game boards can be combined, or a larger board used to easily expand the game for 5-6 players.  Special rules and map also allow for solo play.  More variety can be easily introduced by simply printing new maps that can be used alone or combined with other maps.  The game can easily be re-themed for a variety of genres, like Vikings, Space, High Fantasy, etc.  Les Petits Pirates can easily be played with just the game board and typical household items, like dice and coins, but the game lends itself to having a &amp;lsquo;deluxe&amp;rsquo; edition that includes nicer components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les Petits Pirates is played in two phases per round.  In the first phase all players roll Action dice for their pirate ships and then place them in turn order.  In the second phase each Action die is resolved from the lowest to the highest.  This means that the player order for the second phase changes every round.  Each die provides a choice of Actions, from attacking other pirates to plundering ports to burying gold.  However, players are able to manipulate their dice by spending gold and resources to take their desired action.  The first player to successfully bury twenty gold coins is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accolades:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les Petits Pirates has been tested at Protospiel and other game design meetups.  Les Petits Pirates won 2nd place in the 2015 MicroGame Print and Play Contest on Board Game Geek.  Les Petits Pirates was a finalist in the KBG Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print &amp;amp; Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print &amp;amp; Play files are available in the Web Links section at the official page (at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://georgejaros.com/LPP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://georgejaros.com/LPP&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
