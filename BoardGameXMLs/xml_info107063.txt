			<description>Blitzkrieg Met: The Battle of Stonne: May 15-16, 1940, is an introductory level game of the battle between the Allied Armed forces and Germany's Wehrmacht on May 21st and 22nd, 1940. he Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest and emerged at Sedan. Alarmed at the prospect of a German breakout here, and the collapsing defense at Sedan, the French ordered an immediate counter-attack. General Heinz Guderian, however, had already ordered the bulk of the German panzer formations to breakout from the Sedan bridgehead, and ordered the Gross Deutchland Regiment, with a supporting Kampfgruppe formed from the 8th Panzer Division to take and hold the high ground at Stonne, to guard the German's bridgehead over the Meuse River and expanding flank. For the first, and only, time during the 1940 campaign, Guderian's Panzers ran into the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, as the French counter attacked to reduce the Sedan bridgehead.  Over three days, the town of Stonne changed hands 17 times as German and French armored forces dueled for the strategic high-ground overlooking Sedan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fifth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series, covering the battle at an operational scale. The game is designed for 2 players, taking on the roles of the French and German commanders, but is suitable for solitaire play as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Flying Dice Games edition features all new graphics by Bruce Yearian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1/2 miles / 0.8 kilometer&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 11x17&amp;quot; full color map &lt;br/&gt;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (180 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&lt;br/&gt;One 6-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Two Player Aid Charts (TEC/CRT)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
