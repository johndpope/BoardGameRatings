			<description>From the intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Poleaxed wargames system is designed to represent, as far as possible, the type of warfare that was waged in Western Europe during the 15th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prime aim of the system has always been to wargame large battles, to get a clear cut result (pun intended) and to bring out the flavor of the period.  To do this, the rule mechanisms have been made as simple as possible.  Morale checks and book-keeping are kept to a minimum.  The need to remove figures has been eliminated and all movement can be carried out by contingents on movement trays.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
