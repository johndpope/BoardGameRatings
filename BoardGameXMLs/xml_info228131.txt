			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE FOUR TRAVELLERS were greeted by the early morning light, as the coach rumbled on over the ragged ground of a barely maintained roadway. As the sun gently rose to push away the mist, the remnants of the night slipped off into shadow. The landscape of England was still beautiful, regardless of the terrors that lurked beyond the rolling hills, forested undulating ground, and castle dominated skyline.&lt;br/&gt; Three men and one woman were the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s passengers, tucked in safely behind glass, wood, steel, and thick cloth curtains they were unaware of the change from night to day, save for the slight glimmer of light as it began to filter in. It was idyllic, peaceful, serene almost and the coachman pulled his coat&amp;rsquo;s lapel up to ward off the morning chill. He took a sip from a heady drink in a metal flask, adjusted his cocked hat, and took his eyes off the road for a bare second. He died almost instantly as a creature leapt from the raised roadside, followed by a dozen others, his throat torn out and the flesh ripped asunder...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Unexpected Meeting is the first of three parts of &amp;quot;Wayland's Secret&amp;quot;, a story set in the universe of &amp;ldquo;Ultima Forsan&amp;rdquo;, a game setting developed for the Savage Worlds rules.&lt;br/&gt;Attached to the novel there's a roundup of gaming information for those readers that would like to start playing straight away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
