							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NFL Playoff</name>
									
			<description>This game was available for all 28 NFL teams around at the time of its publication.  Each team had their own version with that team's helmet on the box, and the playing pieces were mini-helmets of that team and one of their rivals (such as Packers and Bears).  Beyond that, each team version of the game was identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a board very similar to a Monopoly board.  Each team has a square and there are several special squares (Interception, Touchdown, Super Bowl, Kickoff, and Penalty) that each have specific rules as to how they affect the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn in the game represents a football &amp;quot;play&amp;quot;  After the player rolls the dice and moves their helmet, they draw a play card (team space and super bowl space) or penalty card (penalty space) or they score (touchdown space).  There are also special rules for 4th downs, field goals, punts (and returns), kickoffs (and returns), fumbles, and safeties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game goes for 4 quarters, each consisting of 25 &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; cards.  After all of the &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; cards are exhausted, the game is over, and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
