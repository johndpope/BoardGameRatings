			<description>MNM the music battle is a Musical Trivia Game with an app, an internet connection is required to play, the app has sound effects, asks the questions and keeps the score. You get a wristband to identify your color and set your name in the app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your aim is to collect 1000 points, by answering questions about 4 categories of music. The big MNM 1000, 90 and nillies hits, sing your song and the big hits. You get 3 cards, one red, light blue and dark blue (which are the colors of the MNM logo) and those get recognized when pressing them on the screen. It's really easy, and works extremly well. At 300, 600 and 900 points you get to pick a new category out of the 4 aviable by showing a LP shaped cardboard to the camera. Which is always identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some are just questions, somtimes you need to find a cover hidden in a ton of images, or watch a clip and tell which music it is, or bleeped words out of the clip or audio clip, so it has a good diversity and also plenty of questions so you don't get them repeated often.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the theme is music, the aim of the game is to win and show your knowledge and the whole thing is an enjoying time with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
