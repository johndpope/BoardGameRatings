			<description>Super Slam Dunk - known in Japan as マジックジョンソンのスーパースラムダンク Magic Johnson's Super Slam Dunk) - is a game that features 28 fictional teams; 27 of them are based on real cities while the 28th is an all-star team. There is an exhibition and a playoffs mode. Exhibition is the usual team vs team game, while the playoff mode has eight teams competing to win the championship. Players can choose to turn fouls on or off and how many minutes that each quarter will be. A vertical basketball court is used; with only half of the court shown at any one time. When a player takes the ball from one side of the court to the other, the other half of the court is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earvin &amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; Johnson gives the pre-game commentary about the strengths of the teams, while broadcaster Chick Hearn gives the play-by-play during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Slam Dunk&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
