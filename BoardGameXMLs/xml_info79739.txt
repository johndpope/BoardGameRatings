			<description>Each player holds six cards containing famous quotes and the people who said them. One &amp;quot;narrator&amp;quot; holds only three. He/she chooses one of them and announces the person's name. Each other player now chooses one of his/her six cards and hands it to the narrator who shuffles them together with his/her own card. The cards are now put into a special stand so the person names can't be seen; then the narrator reads out the quotes and everyone tries to guess which of them was said by the person that was announced.&lt;br/&gt;The guessing is done by allocating five chips. Each correctly put chip counts 4 points, fooling someone counts one. Repeat this until all three of the narrator's cards have been used. Then the remaining cards are discarded and everyone draws new ones. This is repeated until everyone has been the narrator once. The player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
