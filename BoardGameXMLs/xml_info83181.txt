			<description>Subtitle: Open Road Adventure in the Long Haul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to feel the diesel power of an eighteen-wheeler at your fingertips? Have you ever wanted to be your own boss, hauling precious cargo from coast to coast? Have you ever wanted to be the master of your very own big rig? Well, this game won't give you any of that. But it will help you imagine doing all that and a whole lot more. Or, if you are a trucker, it will let you take a break from all that by playing a fun game of cards and dice. Trucker is meant to be a quick and easy game for road-weary travelers. It is a game of role-playing and of story-telling, of chance and of skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role-Playing&lt;br/&gt;Trucker is a game in which players imagine themselves in the roles of cross-country truckers hauling loads of cargo to their destinations. Along the way, truckers handle problems that jeopardize a safe and timely delivery, from the everyday snags typical of highway driving like reckless drivers, roadwork, and encounters with the law, to the more dangerous threats from horror movies, folklore, and urban legend. To fight these natural and supernatural challenges, truckers possess abilities, edges, and funds, which are represented by poker cards, chips, and coins. A game of Trucker might look like a poker match on the surface, but the materials used to play the game represent more than numbers and money: they measure the powers and fortunes of characters that players imagine themselves to be, as well as a host of troubles standing in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
