			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Department of Homeland Security shell game. Hand over your Rights and the DHS will protect you from the bad guys. Although the Department of Homeland Security cannot actually protect you from terrorists and random acts of violence, they sure can make it look like they&amp;rsquo;re doing something (or, in the face of hurricane Katrina, maybe not). A fa&amp;ccedil;ade of security so you can feel safe (without actually being safe).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel Safe, The Game of Homeland Security is a satirical board game in which players start off with ten Rights (as per the Bill of Rights) and must exchange those Rights for perceived security and safety, the first player to lose or give away all of their Rights (in the name of national security) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
