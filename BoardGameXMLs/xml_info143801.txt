Your character can evolve in any direction you want to take them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traits&lt;br/&gt;Create characters with addictions, acute senses, and even insanity or a rich family.

Modify your target numbers, add a bonus&lt;br/&gt;to your roll, beef up your overflow, and reduce the time it takes to do something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On The Fly Experience&lt;br/&gt;You get XP every time you do something, which allows your character to learn new skills on the fly. This means the&lt;br/&gt;proactive player will be rewarded, and you will advance naturally, as you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Power&lt;br/&gt;Earn points whenever you steal the scene.

They help you get things done, Period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;With multiple task resolution options, 1d10 is all you will ever need to cover the angles in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maneuvers&lt;br/&gt;Choose an attack style to fit your characters needs. Defensive and offensive moves aren&amp;rsquo;t a matter of just blocking and&lt;br/&gt;attacking. Strong characters can block while quick characters can sidestep. Choose between brutal smashing attacks or&lt;br/&gt;pinpoint accurate strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overflow Triggers&lt;br/&gt;One roll can evolve into many outcomes. What starts as a simple sidestep can become a parry, or even a counter attack!&lt;br/&gt;Damage becomes greater the higher you roll, so It's not about passing or failing, but how much you do it by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diverse Combinations&lt;br/&gt;Multiple stat and skill combinations help you play an adaptive and expansive character. In depth sub stats help further&lt;br/&gt;define your character based on your choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So dive in now for a fun fast paced RPG!
