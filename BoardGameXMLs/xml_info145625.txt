							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Politics Unusual</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a headstrong Azindralean politician seeks to launch a campaign to seize control of his district, his chief security officer hires the PCs to ensure his enemies cannot transform his opening speech into a riot. Emphasizing wit and subtlety; they must siphon through the crowd of followers and disperse potential troublemakers as peacefully as possible. Under no circumstances should they besmirch the campaign of hope with bloodshed. Yet even if they succeed, a final enemy plots their demise. He only waits for their victory to trick them into lowering their guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Politics Unusual is designed using the Pathfinder RPG System for 4th&amp;ndash;level Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
