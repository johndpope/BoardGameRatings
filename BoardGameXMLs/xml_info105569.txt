							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Keys of Acheron</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mage spoke in low tones: &amp;quot;Your first quest will take you to a world not far separated from your own. Once there, you must find the secret passage to the cave where The Dragon has secreted the key...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So begins your next adventure as a Hellfire Warrior. Four magical jewels, the keys, each in a different dimension, must be recovered from the rule of Kronus the Demon. One is guarded by The Dragon. Another by an evil cleric. Still another lies deep within a fiery volcano. The fourth is protected by Kronus himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your journey, you'll meet a friendly unicorn with a magical necklace to help you in your search. But to reach him, you must cross the dark and fearsome mandrake forest. Other monsters inhabit the dim and frightful places through which you must pass to reach the four keys. But time is short and fame and fortune drive you onward to the end of your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Keys of Acheron is an expansion dunjon for Hellfire Warrior. You must have Hellfire Warrior to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
