			<description>From the Score:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fires of Reason&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wizards of Mythic Europe dare to seek knowledge and wisdom in a perilous medieval world that wants them dead. The Church, the laity, the fay, and Hell itself seek to snuff out or abuse the magic of the Order of Hermes - the order of wizards to which you belong. For sanctuary against these threats, wizards gather together in castle-like covenants to study, experiment, and strive for a better world. Think of them as collegiate communities, castles of wisdom fortified against the world without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your covenant, Mistle Lake, failed at the wisdom part and burned down. Only one wizard survived - a young man called Veritius - and he lays dying in a nearby abbey. Now the local church&amp;rsquo;s Inquisitor has come calling for answers from that lone soul whose testimony might shed light on the affairs of the covenant. So Veritius tells the Inquisitor the tale - or, at least, a version of the tale - of the covenant's downfall. He may be delirious, vengeful, hopeful, seeking absolution, or looking to cover someone's tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hear Veritius' tale from his sickbed, safe in a monastery, as he relates it to the Inquisitor. See the next pages for ways this wrinkles play to create a unique fiasco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fiasco is all about hindsight, perspective, and the nature of truth in a sordid world of zealotry and heresy. Also, lies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
