			<description>Each player has to get his car to any destination space. If there are 4 or 6 players, 2-player-teams are formed. The Starting spacese and order of play are determined by the draw of numbered cards (1-6). The players take turns to place one disc each on any crossroads. When all discs are placed, the cars begin to move. Movement is 4 spaces per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a car gets on a space with a black dot, the player may turn one unoccupied disk of his choice to any position. A car may stop on any space with a black dot, even if it has to move less than 4 spaces to get there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a car gets on a space with a &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; the car has to turn around and the player may exchange 2 unoccupied discs with another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player gets to a destination space, he scores the corresponding amount of points and stars again at his starting point. The first player to score 100 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
