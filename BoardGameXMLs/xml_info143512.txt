							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Checkpoint</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road is nothing more than a thin band of tarmac running through the sheer endless desert as far as the eye can see. With a single lane for traffic in either direction it is barely worth mentioning, but at least it appears to be in good repair. A glance to either side of the road revealing nothing but sand, rocks and some cacti suggests that the drive would be even less pleasant otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under these circumstances the checkpoint ahead might even be a welcome sight for some. For others it most certainly is not. Heavy concrete dividers and a pair of simple barriers have been set up to regulate traffic. Even a pair of watchtowers and heavy steel tank traps have been strategically placed to either side of the road to make sure no vehicle can easily bypass inspection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
