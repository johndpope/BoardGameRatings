							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Velocipede Wedrennen</name>
									
			<description>A late Victorian game which looks a lot like an English game called Bikee from roughly the same vintage. In the Bikee game, the board is assembled by laying cards next to each other but here there is a more traditional board. The graphics are extremely similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Velocipede Wedrennen is a promotional game for Mado &amp;amp; Co Utrecht (still in business today but now Mado B.V. Utrecht). 1981 was the company's 50th anniversary so that would explain why they might like promotional game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple roll and move game. If you land on the illustrated spaces, you must follow the instructions (Miss a Go, Go Forward 3 spaces, that sort of thing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
