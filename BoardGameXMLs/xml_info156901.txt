			<description>Right Connections was one of Springbok's line of &amp;quot;Adult Puzzle-Games.&amp;quot; Like some of the others it can be played as a solitaire puzzle or a two-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are nine plastic disks which each have eight lines radiating from the center, two each in four colors, with the arrangement different on each disk. These are placed on a board with recesses for the disks and lines connecting various spots on the recess edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a puzzle, the object is to connect all the lines of any given color, starting with a random arrangement of disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a game, players take turns starting with a designated disk and line (the lines are designed by black dots on the disks) and turning other disks one by one to make as long a line of the given color as possible. Making a loop scores triple. The player getting to 100 points first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
