							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Standard Book of Spells</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book you will find listings of every spell in the Harry Potter universe. For the most part, preserving canon will not be this book's first priority, but rather to provide spells which enhance the game and your roleplaying experience by providing as many useful spells as possible. Every spell which it is felt should be accessible to players can be found in this book, canon or not. However, every non-canon spell will be marked with an asterisk so that if you wish you may exclude such spells from your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
