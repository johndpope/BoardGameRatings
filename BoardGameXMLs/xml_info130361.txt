			<description>Phytocats is a card game where players nurture and hatch eggs into adorable cat-plant hybrids. Depending how the player cares for their eggs, they will hatch into different breeds of Phytocat. These creatures assist their owners and hinder their rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phytocats focuses on interactive, but not destructive, gameplay. Each player&amp;rsquo;s decisions are constantly influenced by the players around them, and a &amp;ldquo;first to achieve&amp;rdquo; system encourages players to diversify their strategies. This leads to rich, dynamic play where each player is striving to succeed using a wide variety of Phytocats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While some game elements allow players to interfere with another player&amp;rsquo;s strategy, a player&amp;rsquo;s accomplishments cannot be taken away from them. The majority of play elements involve positive, helpful interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phytocats is looking for a publisher! If you are interested please contact phytocats@gmail.com!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
