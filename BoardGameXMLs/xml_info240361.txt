			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Drama Deck features three decks of cards designed to enhance your Torg Eternity campaigns.  Drama cards set initiative, add exciting conditions to encounters, and control pacing by rewarding certain types of actions.  Chases and Dramatic Task Resolution are moderated by the cards, including the appearance of deadly dilemmas.  Destiny cards are a powerful tool for players, allowing Storm Knights to perform amazing feats, transcend the laws of reality, or even introduce new story elements into the game.  Newly included are Cosm cards representing the seven invading worlds and Core Earth.  Each card reinforces the themes and elements of that cosm's reality, adding complications for an offered reward, or simply being helpful (or harmful) to the Storm Knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scheduled to ship January 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
