							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toshiba HX-10</name>
									
			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Toshiba HX-10 incorporates many exciting features such as built-in music and sound effects with a connection point for stereo or hi-fi, multi-window graphics for creating 'perspective' om graphic images, and, of course, sufficient connections allowing you to expand the system as your computing requirements grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HX-10, labeled &amp;quot;Pasopia IQ&amp;quot; in it's native Japan, was an MSX compatible computer released by Toshiba. The HX-10S and HX-10SA models had 16Kb of RAM, but all others had 64Kb, the first MSX model to do so. The computer also has 16Kb of video RAM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Connectivity includes a single MSX cartridge slot (though the optional HX-E600 slot expander provided an additional cartridge slot) along with ports for either RF or RGB output and either NTSC or PAL composite video (dependent on model and region) a Centronics parallel port (most models) a DIN connector for a tape recorder, an expansion bus and 2 joystick ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Audio was provided by a General Instruments AY-3-8910A chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all MSX compatibles, the HX-10 featured Microsoft Extended BASIC as the default built-in programming language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many versions were released for various worldwide markets, identified by different letters after the HX-10 designation. Unlike the other releases, the HX-10P did not include the letter designation on the box or on the computer itself, so it is often referred to simply as the HX-10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
