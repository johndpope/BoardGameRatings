							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dour Temple</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dour Temple is the second book (of seven) in The Uncommon Commoners campaign series. In this semi-epic campaign, the uncommon commoners will fulfill their destiny. Or die trying. Or both&amp;mdash;if their destiny is to die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bandits of wildly varying competence have begun accosting even old men and their old horses. Dour dwarf followers of the much-too-serious god Unjoi have taken over an abandoned temple of Baccarus, kicking out the semi-famous acting troupe of Caviolo &amp;amp; Son. A joyless druid has begun converting the joyous beasts of the woods into sober, hard-working dour beasts.  It is up to the uncommon commoners to face the perils of the MandaTory Bandits, to endure the acting of Caviolo &amp;amp; Son, to rescue the beasts from dour dullness, and return joy to the Dour Temple. Can the uncommon commoners save the day? Or will they fall victims of an uncommon dourness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Uncommon Commoners #2: The Dour Temple is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure. It is intended for a party of 2nd-4th level uncommon commoner characters. While the adventure is written to be humorous and fairly light, it is also designed to be suitable for serious game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the features of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed color maps.&lt;br/&gt;     Fully developed NPCs, complete with detailed descriptions, backstories and motivations. And loot.&lt;br/&gt;     Full statistics are included for all encounters&amp;mdash;no need to look up monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     New deities (Baccarus, Na-A-Nee, and Unjoi)&lt;br/&gt;     New domains &amp;amp; subdomains (Dour Domain, Revel Domain, and Wine Subdomain).&lt;br/&gt;     New Spells (censor, create wine, inebriation, and sobriety).&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items &amp;amp; Equipment (dour bar, rock water, acorn vest, The Mace of Vicious Mercy, and Vest of Devouring Squirrels).&lt;br/&gt;     44 pages of adventure (includes maps)!&lt;br/&gt;     MandaTory Bandits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
