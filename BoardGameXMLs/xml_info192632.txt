			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yandere Simulator (working title) is a stealth action video game in development and to be published by YandereDev (working name). Early development builds of the game were made available via its official website. The game's premise centers upon a jealous schoolgirl, Ayano Aishi, nicknamed Yandere-chan after the Japanese term &amp;quot;yandere&amp;quot;, who has decided to eliminate anyone she believes is monopolizing her crush's attention.Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will control Ayano Aishi (also known as &amp;quot;Yandere-chan&amp;quot;), a psychotic Japanese schoolgirl who has developed a crush on a fellow student currently named Taro Yamada, nicknamed &amp;quot;Senpai&amp;quot;. They are given 10 weeks. Every week, a new rival will appear and will get a crush on Senpai. (Note: currently, the player is only given 5 days, as this game is still being developed, therefore, you cannot win. 10 weeks will be in the final version of the game) You will have to eliminate her before she confesses her love to him. This can be accomplished by the player via several methods such as murdering the individual, kidnapping them, socially sabotaging them to the point where they commit suicide, or make them fall in love with another student by playing as Cupid. If a player chooses to murder someone they must clean up any evidence (such as the murder weapon and your bloody clothes) and/or dispose of the body via an incinerator or dumpster on the school's grounds, and mop up the blood. Otherwise, the crimes can be linked back to &amp;quot;Yandere-chan&amp;quot; and result in her being arrested. Players must also ensure that their crimes are not witnessed by Senpai, which will result in the loss of the game. The gameplay takes place only on the school's campus, a town, and the character's house, and players must ensure that they monitor several factors such as &amp;quot;Yandere-chan's&amp;quot; sanity level and reputation. If either becomes too low this can affect gameplay. The player also has the ability to change &amp;quot;Yandere-chan's&amp;quot; panties, each pair of panties will give them different abilities such as bonuses when gossiping or complimenting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Yandere Simulator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
