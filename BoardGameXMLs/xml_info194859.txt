			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a world overrun with vampires.  The vampires' overriding concern is keeping enough humans alive to preserve the vampire food supply.  Atypically for vampire style games, everybody - vampires and humans - is cognizant of the situation.  In fact, everybody participates in the system with an eye toward personal remuneration.  Characters in the game are humans, and the Precious Fluid is their blood.  Characters have Skills, selected from a list, with numeric values distributed from a point pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most notable aspect of the game involves the utilization of an atypical randomizer which must be crafted.  Basically, these randomizers are multi-colored spheres that are rolled in a pool.  The game gives clear instructions on how to build and use these randomizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note this was the winning game of the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
