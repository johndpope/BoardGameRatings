			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elementy is a simple, fast, &amp;amp; fun card game that has two exciting ways to play! Great for kids and adults. Elementy provides this type of exhileration with a minimal game. The game&amp;rsquo;s foundation is built around Rock-Paper-Scissors but the premise of the game eludes this mechanic with the cute, quirky, and almost comedic looking cards along with a few components to fortify this card game. Elementy is played over 1 game with a few rounds. Each player has a premade deck where they select cards from fire, water, or earth in order to beat their opponent. The twist is the wind which adds a few die and a couple Elementyrolles to come out victorious. At the end of the battle count your cards and come out victorious if you have more than your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play Elementy:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;START THE GAME: Two players divide the deck in half taking three of each element cards (Flame, Leaf, &amp;amp; Water) and two Wild Windy cards. Shuffle your deck not looking at the cards and place them face down. Next draw the top three cards to start the battle phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BATTLE: To start the battle both players choose one card (not showing anyone) and place it face down. Once both players cards are face down, flip the cards over to see who won the battle. Before battling again each player draws another card from the top of their deck so they have three cards total in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WILD CARD:  Wild Windy is extremely unpredictable. To stop her wrath the opposing player must roll a 5 or 6, if her opponent rolls a 5 or 6 they win the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE TIE: If 2 players put out the same card they must roll a dice, whoever rolls a larger number wins that round. This rule does not change with Wild Windy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WIN: The player that wins the battle takes their card and their opponents card and places them in a discard pile face up. The game ends when there are no cards left. Whoever has the most cards in their discard pile wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
