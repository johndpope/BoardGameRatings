			<description>Stavropol Bashni is a stacking game from the Checkers family. It features shared pieces. As in all Checkers games, the aim of the game is to leave the opponent without a legal move. It is played on a traditional 8x8 Checkers board with stones that are suitable for Bashni, i.e. stackable and with kings being turned men or pieces of a different color, as most traditional Russian sets are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules follow Bashni. In short, when a man or king is captured, it is not taken from the board, but put under the piece which captures the men. This way, stacks are formed. Generally, to topmost of piece of a stack decides which player the stack belongs to, how the stack moves, it is the piece that is promoted on reaching a back rank, and it is the piece that is captured. If the topmost piece of a stack is captured and the next piece at the top belongs to the opponent, the stack switches allegiance and belongs to the opponent then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference to Bashni is that pieyes are shared - as in Stavropol Checkers. A player may move stacks owned by the opponent, too, according to the rules for the topmost piece. The exact winning condition is therefor: a player loses when it is his turn and the stacks belonging to him have no  legal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     igGameCenter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
