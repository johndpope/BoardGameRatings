			<description>Each player has a set of 3 pawns that start on the starting spaces of his color. The goal is to move the pawns around the board along the spiral to the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; section. Movement is controlled by a die. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each other's pawns. Captured pawns are returned to their player's starting place and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all pawns &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the back of the game board is the game Nine Men's Morris (M&amp;uuml;hle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
