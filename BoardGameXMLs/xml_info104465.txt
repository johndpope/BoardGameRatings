							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Koboldly Where Gnome Has Gone Before</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A map falls into the players' hands revealing the location of a powerful artifact. It can't be this easy, can it? As a matter of fact, it can't. Filled with puns, adventure, and old-style roleplaying, Koboldly is a three-round Wildside Gaming System adventure for beginning or intermediate players. Players earn the possession of a map showing the location of the famed Dvaline Blade. Despite the legends of its dangers, the blade is a tremendous prize, well-worth traveling to a fallen fortress in the frozen north to to recover it. Watching over their every move&amp;mdash;and betraying them at the end&amp;mdash;is their turncoat benefactor. The adventure includes new monsters and mayhem, along with two dungeon crawl segments that should appear to old-time graph paper D&amp;amp;D players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KEY POINTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Old-style gaming with an emphasis on role-playing skills&lt;br/&gt;     Suitable for running a weekend tournament at a convention, or can be spread over 5-6 weeks of regular gaming sessions.&lt;br/&gt;     A great starting point for new Wildside Gaming System players looking for a pre-packaged adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     Includes new monsters not in the original game book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
