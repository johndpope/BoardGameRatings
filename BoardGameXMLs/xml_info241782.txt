			<description>The Bucentaure class ship Neptune was launched at the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars. After missions on the West Indies, she was used against the British in Mediterranean Sea. During the Battle of Trafalgar she was engaged by Nelson himself, and she dueled with several British ships, surviving the battle. She later became part of the Spanish fleet, named Neptuno, after Spain declared war to France, and spent most of her life under the Spanish flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the French Bucentaure class ship of the line &amp;ldquo;Ville de Varsovie 1808&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
