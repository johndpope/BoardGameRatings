			<description>Blood and Treasure is a dungeon crawling simulation for 1 or more players using a standard 52 card deck of cards (jokers optional).  The goal of the game is to kill/capture as many monsters as possible while collecting and keeping as much treasure as you can.  The dungeon is also filled with spike traps and locked doors that must be passed in order to complete the dungeon successfully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play/Card Designations:&lt;br/&gt;[Drawn cards]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When face cards (king, queen, jack) are drawn they become &amp;quot;monsters&amp;quot; and the next numbered card drawn becomes both the hit-point value and the treasure of the monster (for the player to keep if the monster is defeated).  Monsters can either be defeated using swords and shields or the player can defend/take a hit with shields and health points.&lt;br/&gt;     When clubs are drawn they become doors and must be unlocked with keys or smashed with swords.&lt;br/&gt;     When spades are drawn they become spike traps and must be disarmed or traversed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Played cards]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spades are used as swords to defeat a monster or smash doors.&lt;br/&gt;     Clubs are used as shields to defend from a monster attack or safely traverse a spike trap.&lt;br/&gt;     Diamonds are used as keys to unlock doors or disarm traps.  Diamonds also count as treasure when tallying points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Hearts are used as health points to take a hit from a monster or to take damage while getting through a spike trap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played until the deck has been depleted (dungeon run), until all face cards have been collected (monster hunt), or until the entire deck has been collected (hero's quest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When counting up points at the end of the game, face cards are worth 5 points each and diamonds are worth the number on the card.  (Aces are counted as 1 point.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
