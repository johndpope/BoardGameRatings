			<description>A card game for 2-4 players with a general Medieval historical theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck of 60 cards of 4 card types: Character, Holding, Group and Event.  Cards have a points value between 1 and 5 and 1 of 2 types of abilities (cards used in combination with each other or cards that initiate an event/activity).  Abilities activate as soon as the card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 2 cards and then take turns to draw 1 card from the deck and play 1 card from their hand.  When a card is played it is placed face up on the table in front of the player.  If the card has a non-combo ability (e.g. discard 1 group, steal character, draw 1 card etc.) this gets used immediately. All the cards in front of you are known as your Fief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last card is drawn the discard is shuffled and cards drawn from it (cards only ever go into the discard pile when another card sends them there).  When there is no deck or discard left, players continue taking turns, playing one card at a time from their hands until all cards are played.  At this point scoring is undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards score their basic points value but if they are combo cards may score extra points if the player holds the right combination of cards. The final scores are based on all the cards in your Fief and the combos they make. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
