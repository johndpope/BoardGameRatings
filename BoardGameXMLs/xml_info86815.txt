			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relief Action is a horror science-fiction game by Loriciels. It was one of the few Amstrad games that used realtime wireframe 3D for graphics, and included a stereographic 3D display mode for use with the 3D glasses which were packaged with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A xenobiology experiment goes wrong on the starship NMI, and a genetically-engineered creature breaks out of the lab and massacres the crew. Only one crew member escapes the slaughter by hiding in an hibernation chamber. Now, alone on a derelict spaceship and hunted by a deadly predator, you must find your way to the shuttle and flee the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a classic adventure game. The player must explore the ship, find ways to dodge the monster or temporarily incapacitate it, pick up various useful items and repair some ship subsystems before reaching the shuttle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other than the 3D graphics, another &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; of the game is the total lack of sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
