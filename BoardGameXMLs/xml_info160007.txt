			<description>Kamara is code-matching strategy game for two to eight players. You play the role of a spirit, or diwa, attempting to influence someone within the chamber of their mind. Each diwa has a different color that evokes a different emotion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to alter the game tiles to match the yellow kamara card you possess. Each time you do so, you gain that card. The first player to match three yellow kamara cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player draws a yellow card. Then, the elder takes the first turn. That player may choose any tile they&amp;rsquo;d like to place down, followed by the player on his or her left. Lay out the tiles one by one to form the chamber. All yellow border edges must form a square when the chamber is complete.&lt;br/&gt;2. After the last tile has been placed by a player, the player on his or her right chooses a  unique player pawn, or diwa, to represent themselves. After choosing a diwa, place the diwa in the chamber onto a square in any tile that possesses a paltik. A diwa may not be placed onto a paltik.&lt;br/&gt;3. Shuffle the two decks, then place them beside the chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;The player that placed the last diwa will take the first turn. Each turn has two parts:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Draw a yellow card if you do not have one.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Use up to five actions.&lt;br/&gt;1. Draw a yellow card if you do not have one. If no cards are available when you attempt to draw, the game ends. The players with the most yellow cards matched wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;2. Use up to five actions. You may do any of these actions multiple times in a turn, or use less than five actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACTIONS&lt;br/&gt;Exchange: If you possess a yellow card, once per turn you may recycle it and draw another yellow card.&lt;br/&gt;Flip: If you are on a paltik, you may flip the tile you are on. When you do so, draw a green card if you do not already possess one or have drawn one this turn. Players on the flipped tile remain in the same squares. The border stays intact.&lt;br/&gt;Match: If you are standing on the tapos, you may match your yellow card if the chamber&amp;rsquo;s paltiks match your card by setting it aside. The Kamara logo on the yellow card and center tile will be your reference.&lt;br/&gt;Move: Move from one square to another adjacent square. You may move diagonal only if the move occurs on the same tile. You may not move through thick lines or dark brown blocks. You may not end your movement on top of another player&amp;rsquo;s diwa.&lt;br/&gt;Play: If you possess a green card, you may recycle it. You may use its effect or ignore it.&lt;br/&gt;Poke: If you are adjacent to another diwa, you may move that diwa to another square adjacent to you without passing through thick lines or landing on another diwa.&lt;br/&gt;Port: If you are standing on a tapos, you may move your diwa to another tapos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
