			<description>The second installment of the series, released for the Family Computer on December 14, 1990. The sequel adds new features such as power-up items for the action scenes and special stages set on lakes and clouds. New mini-games includes &amp;quot;number searching&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;noise breakdown&amp;quot;, and a panel-based rock, paper, scissors. With the exception of the number searching game, none of the new mini-games introduced in this installment were brought back in the succeeding games. The story takes place several years after the other Wagan Land games (but before Wagan Paradise), in which the player takes control of Wagan II, the son of the original Wagan. The final battle theme in this game would later be used as the final battle theme in Super Wagan Land. The boss introduction theme would be used in Super Wagan Land as well. The boss battle theme was used in Super Wagan Land, as well as in the later DS sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like in the original game, some stages will have two different exits at the end, allowing the player to slightly alter their course. This was the last game in the series to retain this feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wagan Land&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
