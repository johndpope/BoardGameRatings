							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost City of the Ancients</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Cities of the Ancients is a Rocket Age episode designed for three to six players. Characters should be early in their careers with a maximum of 15 Story Points. A good mix of academic, rugged outdoorsmen, social, and combat characters will be useful, but the Gamemaster can adjust the scenes to suit their party as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our episode opens with the discovery of an apparently intact Ancient Martian ruin deep in the Western Highlands. Such a find would draw treasure seekers and archaeologists from across Mars, but this one is even more of an attraction. It lies in territory unclaimed by any faction or nation. This makes it free for the taking and, despite the harshness of the Western Highlands, the need to travel through territory held by the Blue Chanari and the stiff competition, three other expeditions are already kitting out in the French held city-state of Kolpith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
