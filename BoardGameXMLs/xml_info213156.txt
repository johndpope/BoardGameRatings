			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are a pack of stray dogs.  You are best buddies and even if you aren't, you look out for each other because you need to have friends to survive on the street.  Here's the best part: you're more or less normal dogs.  You don't have any special skills that dogs don't have; you can't really talk and you certainly don't have thumbs.  Still, you manage to get things done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strays is intended for 2-4 players and a Gamemaster.  The players will take on the roles of individual dogs while the GM will present the challenges of their world and also portray the other dogs, people, and creatures in that world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
