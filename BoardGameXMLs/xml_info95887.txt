							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thugee</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They strangle unsuspecting travelers on dark country roads. They glide though New York's glittering streets clinging to shadows, carrying fear and death in their yellow scarves. They are brutal thugs masking their villainy behind a fa?ade of ancient mysticism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the Thugee, a cult of murders whose history and myth stretch back thousands of years. By the end of the 19th century the terrible cult had vanished from India. In the fictional world of the pulps, though, the cult persisted into the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulp Villains: Thugee details the cult for use in Modern D20 games. This 51-page PDF, written by Shannon Kalvar, features details on the historical Thugee, as well as three pulp-era versions of the cult, depending on the focus of your particular campaign. New feats and F/X powers for the Thugee are also included, as well as sample NPCs, ready for use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulp Villains: Thugee has more than just the Indian stranglers, however. The PDF serves as a tool for Gamemasters who wish to include any sort of cult in their Modern D20 campaigns. The full Open Content rules for creating Organizations in Modern D20 are included in this PDF, expanded with a new rules system of Descriptors which allow Game Masters to customize cults using the adjectives used to describe them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare oppose the Thugee? Or will you too fall to a cunning smile and a swiftly applied yellow strangling cord?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
