			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood drenched, tense interrogations, battles of wills and wits between POW or elite espionage agents and torturer are a staple of military and espionage fiction. The variant rules for torture and interrogation presented in Tell Me Now can dramatically change the feel of your game. The creation of the Break Counter rules drag out torture scenes, altering the pace of the game, forcing players and GMs alike to focus their attention and large blocks of game time to a horrific part of modern combat. Instead of a brief scene before the inevitable prison break or rescue mission, where the hero has to roll a quick d20 Fortitude save to resist torture, using the rule presented in this book means that if a hero is tortured those around the table will feel it. This 11 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern espionage or military campaign world, including Haven: Full Metal Zero D20 Espionage setting, and gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
