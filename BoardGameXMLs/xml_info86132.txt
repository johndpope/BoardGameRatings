			<description>In the Monastery of Bierbrau, the monks brew their famous ales which are sold all year round to keep the church coffers full. The monks are normally forbidden to drink their own beer, except on their &amp;lsquo;night of madness&amp;rsquo; - Verr&amp;uuml;cktheitsnacht, where one special barrel is marked by the Abbot for consumption by the monks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this night all of the monks attempt to gain the barrel of beer from each other. They all claim not to want the beer for themselves, but merely to save their brothers from it. Once a monk reaches his cell, he may lock himself in and safely dispose of the beer. Whatever happens during the night of madness will never be spoken of ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll two dice to move themselves (one when carrying the barrel or being watched by the Abbot), plus an additional die to move the Abbot. The winner is the first monk who can carry the barrel into his cell after it has exited the cellar, brewery, kitchen and refectory. Monks can attempt to chastise and berate each other to help themselves gain the upper hand, or the Abbot can berate another monk on their behalf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
