			<description>Sharp centenarian Allan Karlsson embarks on an amazing adventure across the world, meeting various historical figures and playing a crucial role in many world events. The players act as narrators, moving Allan by playing cards and collecting points. Let your skills take over, earn points and travel around the world together with Allan! (Translation from the box back)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the best-selling book &amp;quot;Hundra&amp;aring;ringen som klev ut genom f&amp;ouml;nstret och f&amp;ouml;rsvann&amp;quot; (The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared) by the Swedish author Jonas Jonasson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play cards to move the common Allan figure on the world map and to trigger events (related to the book storyline). Events score points for the player and move the time marker forward on the time track. When the marker reaches the end, the game ends and the player with most points wins. The key to winning is to have Allan in the right locations in the right time, as most events can only be played in a certain city at a certain time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
