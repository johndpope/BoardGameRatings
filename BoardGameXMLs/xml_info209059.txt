			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, during the age of pestilence, the lands that now make up the great kingdom of Tanaska were divided.  The rulers of the land held their position not through law, but through strength of arms and war between the city-states was common.  It was during this age that the Pestula, Goddess of Decay reached the pinnacle of her power on the face of Haret as in the wake of the ever-present conflicts followed famine and plagues that devastated the people as much as the weapons of war.  But the fortunes of the gods are as fickle as those of mortals, and Pestula's power was challenged by other immortals.  As her power waned among the gods, so too did the grip of chaos upon the land and a young general arose who would unite the city-states and establish the rule of law.  During this war of unity, the cults dedicated to Pestula were destroyed wherever they could be found and those priests who escaped were forced to go into hiding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 7th - 9th level characters.  Typically distributed as a ZIP archive including the RTF scenario and two GIF images (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
