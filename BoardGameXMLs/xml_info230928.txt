			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcade Fighter is a 2-6 players tabletop game. Players select a fighter and corresponding data sheet. Players draw symbol cards from the same deck and place them onto their data sheets. Players progress the position of their cards to match combinations on their data sheets to perform attacks. Players can also hinder an opponent's strategy by striking away cards. Arcade Fighter is a versatile game. You can play one-on-one or play tag team matches. While the basic mechanics remain the same, the game also allows for arena cards to be used to add more attacks and effects that make the game unique every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
