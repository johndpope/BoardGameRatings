			<description>The publisher of KUSUKUMA is Lyc&amp;eacute;e Classique Echternach. Kusukuma is the result of a student game development class (main game idea by Charel Bintz) under the guidance of Dennis Kirps (teacher) and the help of Christian Kruchten (prototype development). The class itself was originated by professor Carmen Schares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to push the opponent off the board by cleverly pushing the Kusukuma discs, so that the final player keeps at least one Kusukuma disc of his own on the board. However, as the die determines the colour of the next move, a player might have to push his own disc(s) off the board. The question arises: &amp;ldquo;Who will be left?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;The active player throws the die and chooses exactly one of the following three moves:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    If one of the four colours is cast, the player has to move one of the discs corresponding to the cast colour by exactly one square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally), even if said colour does not correspond to his own! &lt;br/&gt;2.    If the joker is cast, the player can push any disc, his own, his opponent&amp;rsquo;s or even the joker.&lt;br/&gt;3.    If the blank side is cast, the player cannot make a move, and it is the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END OF GAME AND WINNER&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     there is only one disc or discs of the same colour left on the game-board. The player representing this colour wins.&lt;br/&gt;     there is only the joker left on the game-board. In this case everybody wins.&lt;br/&gt;     in a game of two or three players, there are only neutral discs left on the game-board. In this case there is no winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
