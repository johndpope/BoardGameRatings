			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take on the roles of former participants of an oppressive, totalitarian regime that now lies in pieces. The setting can be anything from real-life post-war society to a fantasy world after a dark wizard has been defeated. The setting should satisfy these points:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        ● The characters were complicit - if not active participants - in the horrible actions of the former regime.&lt;br/&gt;        ● The political winds have changed and each of characters are under suspicion for their role in the former regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not clear from the outset what each character knows or thinks about the others&amp;rsquo; actions. These are things which will be explored through gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
