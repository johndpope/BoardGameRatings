							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bar Room Berserker</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, you just spilled my #$%@* DRINK!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times the Vikings called upon the aid of the most fearless of warriors, clans of savage berserks. The Northern peoples were not the only ones to carry this madness in their blood and berserkers have appeared in other cultures as well. The passage of time has caused these bloodlines to mix with others, thinning the berserker&amp;rsquo;s inherent fury. In places like the United States, it can happen that two lines carrying the genes of ancient berserker clans will cross, laying the foundation for the birth of a modern Berserker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modern Berserker learns to harness the dark fury inside him. He embraces the violent emotions that over take him whenever trouble starts. The berserker uses the maelstrom of adrenaline unleashed by this state to push his body to incredible heights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than anything, the modern berserker needs an outlet for his fury. Often times, this leads to some very interesting career choices; from law enforcement to professional wrestling. Those with the rage flowing strong in their veins take to underground cage fighting or similar contests. But the most common place to find someone looking for an excuse to fight&amp;hellip;is a bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
