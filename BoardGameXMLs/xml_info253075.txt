							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tarzan Lord of the Jungle</name>
									
			<description>Lord of the Jungle is a cooperative game for 1 to 4 players that can be played in 60 to 90 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this thematic adventure game, you play as Tarzan, Jane, and their allies. Lay out cards to create a map of Africa, and then fight your way across the map to reach the lost city of Opar! Each map card that you choose in your journey reveals your next encounter. Each encounter pits you against a specific tile layout, and an assortment of enemies and interactive 3D trees. Fight enemies by using your equipment cards and rolling dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful to keep Tarzan and Jane out of danger. If either of them perish, the game is lost! If you're able to fight through the scenarios and make your way to Opar, all that's left in front of you is a final boss fight. Work together and take down the boss to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
