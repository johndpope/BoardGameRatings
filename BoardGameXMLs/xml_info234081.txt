			<description>The game is 120 cards depicting buildings, people, cars, trains, airport, river, and other city sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The [12] cards with the river are removed from the game [deck] and placed on against another, to form the right-hand edge.  The remaining cards are shuffled and each player is dealt 15 cards. Each player places his cards in front of himself openly. The rest of the cards are placed face down in a deck [draw pile] in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player on the left of the one who deals [the dealer] starts the game. The opening player places matching cards to the river cards already lying on the table. If he cannot join a card, he takes one from the covered deck [draw pile] and his left-hand neighbour continues. Each player may join all the matching cards he has [during his turn]. Cards can also be put in between the cards already lying on the table, if they match the others on both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The left side has no limit, so with each game a new colourful city can be built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who finishes first with his cards. He [or she] is the &amp;quot;greater builder&amp;quot;. You cannot always join all the cards. If at the end of the game there are still some cards left, the player with the fewest cards left wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was co-published by &amp;quot;Spil og Laer&amp;quot;, Danish for &amp;quot;Play and Learn&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
