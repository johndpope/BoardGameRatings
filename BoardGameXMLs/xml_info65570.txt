			<description>Goobles is a game to help students identify and learn the relational structure of knowledge in a particular domain. Students have difficulty in connecting concepts and creating a sequence of concepts. This game will help students forge ideas about relationships and to build critical thinking skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Category card: an umbrella concept (for example: Newton's Laws, Mechanics, Dynamics, Kinematics, etc.) that can be used to connect two sequences. There are two cards for each category.&lt;br/&gt;     Term card: representing a more atomic concept, such as length, mass, velocity, speed, etc. There are four cards for each term (to increase the possibility of chain building).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each subsequent player either chooses one of his or her five cards to build a sequence or starts a new sequence and scores following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      5 points for playing a card with a strongly related concept.&lt;br/&gt;     2 points for playing a category card.&lt;br/&gt;     -1 point for starting a new sequence.&lt;br/&gt;     2 bonus points for playing a card that joins two sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;50 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
