			<description>This entry is for the 2-6 player edition with 84 cards. The entry for the 2-4 player edition with 55 cards is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fast-paced card game based on Scrabble, each player is dealt a hand of two-sided cards: each one has a different letter on each side, and a pair of letters in the corners that note which letters are on each face. Players create a four-letter word to start the game, then replace one letter at a time with cards from their hands. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
