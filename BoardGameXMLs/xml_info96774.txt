			<description>Object of the game is to manipulate Your marbles into the scoring wheel and be the first player whose scoring wheel makes one complete revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places his marbles into the outside channel of his teeter board. A player's scoring wheel is the same color as his teeter board. &lt;br/&gt;At the word &amp;quot;GO&amp;quot; players work their teeter board in a teeter-totter motion manipulating their marbles up &amp;amp; down the teeter board and through the opening, attempting to manuever them into the scoring wheel. The first player whose scoring wheel makes one complete revolution wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
