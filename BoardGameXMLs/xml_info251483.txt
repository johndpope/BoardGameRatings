							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirates of Rook&#039;s Roost (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The southern seas of the Known Lands are perhaps the most heavily traveled of all the mapped oceans, and yet they are also the most dangerous. Piracy was a constant issue even before the Darkfall, when the nations of Western Aden could afford to devote their naval strength to addressing the issue. For the past ten years, the problem has spiraled out of control, and the pirate crews that plague the region are notorious across the continent for their ferocity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rook's Roost is the deadliest den of pirates in the entire Known Lands, home to the most treacherous, bloodthirsty monsters ever to sail the seven seas. But even among their own ranks, the pirate's of Rook's Roost are not united, and a schism among the captain's council that governs the city threatens to boil over into even more violence...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
