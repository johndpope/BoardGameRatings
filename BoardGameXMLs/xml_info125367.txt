			<description>Where would we be without the light bulb, telephones, the world wide web or even tea bags and sliced bread? BrainBox Inventions contains 54 beautifully-illustrated cards showing when, where and who invented these everyday items. BrainBox Inventions strikes a great balance between learning and fun as less serious inventions such as the Whoopee cushion and Lava Lamp have been included as well as the patently strange which never quite made it such as the weed cutting golf club and the lollistraw! The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner. This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game. Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
