							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Duchamps Mine Bounty</name>
									
			<description>Excerpt from the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;The players are about to take part in a rootin' tootin' adventure set not in the Wild West of America but in the Wild Western Gold Mines of Australia circa 1885. All the familiar Western tropes are in place but maybe with a slightly different point of view than the players are used to. For example like the Native Americans Australia had Aborigines but these guys are a lot weirder than the Sioux or the Apache.&lt;br/&gt;It seems like a pretty normal sort of day in the small town of Duchamps Ridge but normality in the untamed colonial provinces is full of outlaws, shootings and the ever present threat of disasters, both natural and unnatural.&lt;br/&gt;This adventure uses the standard No Dice Vanilla Rules which are outlined in the Core Book and is available as a free download from the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
