							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">International Game of Spy</name>
									
			<description>At first glance, this game appears to be a multi-player variant on earlier games in the vein of L'Attaque. Players set up pieces of hidden value, advance them, and capture opponents pieces by moving into occupied spaces and having the piece of greater rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there are other differences beyond the multi-player capability. Players do not seek a hidden flag; rather, they strive to reach visible target spaces in their opponents' territories that may only be occupied by a Spy piece. Challenging is optional; i.e., multiple players may have pieces co-exist on the same space as long as a player moving in declines to ask, &amp;quot;Who's there?&amp;quot; Finally, each player has a piece that cannot be captured called the Secret Police, which may only capture an opponent's Spy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move his Spy onto an opponent's Palace space or Coat of Arms space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
