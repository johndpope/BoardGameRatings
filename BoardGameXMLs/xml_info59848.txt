							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bounty Hunter</name>
									
			<description>Whether the characters decide to engage in a spot of bounty hunting or they just run in to some members of this profession - or maybe the price has been placed on their heads! - there is a wealth of information herein to bring bounty hunting to life in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb: &amp;quot;Bounty Hunter is a guide to the world of freelance agents trained to bring their targets back from the far reaches of the Babylon 5 galaxy. These brave souls take up contracts from all walks of life to make their living. Corporations and governments alike look to bounty hunters to bring in or eliminate white-collar criminals, terrorists, revolutionaries, troublemakers and sometimes even actual criminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The career of the bounty hunter can be dangerous, even deadly. Depending on the kind of assignments they choose, who is contracting them and where they must go to retrieve the target, their lives can be at risk everywhere they go. This sense of adventure and danger draws just as many souls into the life of the bounty hunter as the career path tends to end prematurely, creating a cycle of 'fresh meat' to fill the well-worn shoes of those who could not handle the pressure of the job.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
