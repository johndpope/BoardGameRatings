			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for runny eggs!&lt;br/&gt;Spin the spinner, pick an egg, and press it on your head! If you get splashed by an egg, you're out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Plastic egg carton&lt;br/&gt;10 refillable plastic eggs&lt;br/&gt;Spinner (with plastic arrow and base)&lt;br/&gt;Game rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;Before the game a number of the soft-plastic eggs are opened, half-filled with water, and re-closed. The number is the number of players minus one. The eggs are then wiped dry and randomly placed in the carton. The spinner has eight sections: two each of &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2 eggs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;egg another&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot;. A turn consists of spinning the spinner and doing what it says. For &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;2 eggs&amp;quot; the player selects an egg and presses it on their head, one at a time. For &amp;quot;egg another&amp;quot; the same is done TO another player of their choice. For &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; nothing happens. Play then passes clockwise. If a player has water on their head, they are immediately out of the game and the turn is over (even if it was the first egg of &amp;quot;2 eggs&amp;quot;). The last player left is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a variant involving filling only one egg no matter how many players there are, and whoever gets water on their head is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
