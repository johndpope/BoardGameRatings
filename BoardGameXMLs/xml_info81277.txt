			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were once innocent, like you and me. Precious children of Mother Nature, they romped, played, and killed and ate according to their natures without a care in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Resistance, their innocent days are sources of both nostalgia and anger. Before they knew torture and cruelty, they knew only bliss, existing as part and parcel of Nature&amp;rsquo;s design. That was before they were taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals in cages. Forced to endure heinous torture. Strapped into devices meant to test their limits in endurance, strength, and resistance to pain and poison. This is done in the interest of improving life for mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends take on the role of members of the Resistance, animals who&amp;rsquo;ve become cynical, jaded, and most importantly, sentient. They&amp;rsquo;ve traded their romping gaits for automatic weapons and their carefree attitudes with homicidal tendencies. They&amp;rsquo;ve been poked, prodded, and tortured all their aware lives, and now they&amp;rsquo;re fed-up and ready to party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free the lab animals. Kill the humans. Eff The Man. Do it all, because it&amp;rsquo;s you or them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
