			<description>A game with 11 cards, one per round. Each round is drawn a card. On the card, you see which combinations of dices are necessary to win the card. The starting player throws the specified number of dice and has to place at least one dice before each new throw. If he has achieved a combination, he takes the card and marks the combination achieved. If another player in this round achieves the same or a higher combination, he can pick up the card and mark the matched combination. When the round is over, the winners of the finished round will start in the next round.&lt;br/&gt;At the end, the winner is, who has the most points on his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
