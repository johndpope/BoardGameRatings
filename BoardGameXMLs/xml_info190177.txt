							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ysenthorp</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frozen lands north of the Wrackleaf Hills are a harsh place to call home. Snow storms, freezing cold and icy winds produce a difficult environment - but also hardy and resourceful people. Snorri Silverspine, an adventurer keen to retire, happened to make camp in the ruins of an old fort. Making a fire in the lee of a crumbling wall, he wished there was a tavern he could sit and warm up in. And then he decided - he'd come back and build a tavern. A few years later, and travellers in the bleak wilderness were grateful to come across a tavern and a warm welcome, with Snorri at the helm. Time passed, and a few more houses appeared beside the tavern and the road, and visitors started calling the settlement 'Ysenthorp'. As for Snorri, he was happy to call himself a tavernkeep - he'll be happy to call himself 'Mayor of Ysenthorp' soon too..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 30 map depiciting a small hamlet in a cold and wintery landscape. Evening is falling, and warm yellow light spills from the windows of the tavern and houses into the snowy streets. The hamlet is surrounded by a forest of evergreen trees, and built in the crumbling remnants of an ancient fort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
