			<description>In this co-op team versus team game, you are the heroes of a buddy cop movie. The captain has assigned you as partners, but you can't stand one another. By the end of the game, with luck, you will be best friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get all the glory in the department by taking down the crime kingpin. You do this by&lt;br/&gt;collecting 10 points of evidence before the other team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solving Crimes requires acquiring cards through draw actions, and special locations you can shape your hand of cards to aid you in the crimes to be solved all over town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city map has locations like The Docks, and The International District where crimes go down. The City Hall, and Police Station are where you can kiss up to the Police Chief, and Police Commissioner. And there are even a couple spots where you and your buddy can go for some entertainment to get to know one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
