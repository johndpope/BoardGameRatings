			<description>The Sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s Apprentice is an action-packed arcade video game that casts players in the role of Dave, the powerful sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s apprentice. In a world filled with fantastical quests and magical combat, Dave joins a mystical fight against the ultimate evil. Players will encounter evil sorcerers who have escaped from their centuries-old prison, the Grimhold, and have taken over New York City. Legendary master sorcerer Balthazar is trapped in the magical realm, so it is up to players to save New York. Guided by Balthazar, players travel throughout New York and the magical realm using special portals in order to defeat the enemy.  They must master the elements of sorcery using magical attacks and spells to defeat the six evil sorcerers and their army of minions in order to free Manhattan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
