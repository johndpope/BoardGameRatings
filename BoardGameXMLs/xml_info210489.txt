			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horror Feats J-P is the latest Mythic Mini devoted to exploring the terrible tricks that desperate heroes and vile villains alike might unleash in a horror-themed campaign using the new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Horror Adventures rulebook. Whether they deal in blood, pain, death, plagues, curses, corruption, sinister sorcery, or the mortal and immortal soul, these enhanced feats will dial up the horror in your campaign to a diabolical degree! Open up sinister secrets and skills aplenty in this PDF of 10 new feats from Kyton Cut to Profane Studies and all feats in between, including truly nasty tricks like Lifeless Gaze and Maddening Obliteration!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Minis are short, inexpensive products designed to take one rules concept or set of Pathfinder RPG rules and bring them to you in a new way for the mythic rules, including converting existing rules as well as introducing entirely new rule options. Created by the same designers that helped bring you the official mythic rules, Mythic Minis skip the fluff and give you all crunch, all the time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
