							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost Qether (d20)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;...Qether rests on the western edge of what the Arak call the Ter'savan'filin which, roughly translated, means &amp;quot;The Wood of the Outdwellers.&amp;quot; It is assumed that by 'Outdwellers', the Arak mean the other races; but in truth no one has ever thought to ask. The area is narrow strip of meadow and plain that is bounded on the south by the Highmoor hills. These hills are an odd mix of hill and lowland, so that the hills are rocky and are covered by various vines and moss-like plants, and the hollows are little better that midge-infested swamp. There are tales that the Zeredites used the hills for unnatural magical rituals, and that, somewhere, buried beneath one of the rounded hills, there is an abandoned Black Temple. Such tales are generally reserved for children who will not obey their parents, or foolish adventurers who set out from Erech with gold in their eyes and return weary, beaten, and disillusioned...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- from Outpost Qether&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost Qether is a settting guide to the westernmost Tirasim frontier. The outpost is home to all sorts; traders, criminals, and military men. It is a place where hope is fading fast, for the Judges in Arioch have decided that the fifty-year-old installation has outlived its usefulness. Unless someone finds a good reason for the outpost to remain, it will be shut down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, however, local scouts has returned with news...the Gadianti have set up a small post and are digging for...something. Perhaps it might just be the thing to give the outpost reason to exist. Perhaps if they send a party of adventurers to find out what's going on over there...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's inside?&lt;br/&gt;Within Outpost Qether's 28 pages, you'll find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete guide to the people and places in and around the outpost, &lt;br/&gt;A short adventure, where the party is sent to investigate the Gadianti actions on the coast, &lt;br/&gt;An appendix listing all the monsters from WoTC's Monster Manual that exist on Diomin, and how they came to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
