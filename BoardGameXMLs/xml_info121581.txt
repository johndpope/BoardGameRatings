			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puzzle game. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Solving the 300 different stages available to you requires a maximum of thought and strategy. The prupose of BOOLY makes it a simple game to play, but only the most relentless logic will make you win and progress in the championship. Let's take an example: in the first stage, every blue square must become grey. It appears to be easy, but if you remember that some of these objects are connected to each other and that you dispose of a limited time... You see things differently.&lt;br/&gt;Alone or with other players, plunge into this puzzle game that offers you a multitude of options like the integrated stage editor. Truly a captivating game, thanks to its simple rules and the great diversity of its levels: welcome to a world of long hours of entertainment!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
