			<description>Swipecart&amp;trade; is a physics based puzzle platformer that involves racing mine carts and collecting gems. The goal is to navigate through various obstacles to reach the exit of each track. It was inspired by games such as Happy Wheels, Trials,  and the mine cart sections in Donkey Kong Country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each track starts with swiping your fingers or mouse to accelerate your cart. After the starting line you can no longer swipe, but must use the brakes and special abilities provided to a stop at the exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An online server is used to track high scores, host custom user created tracks, interact with other drivers, and sync between multiple devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
