			<description>The object of the game is to be the first player to reach the finish space at the end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;As you race around the board, a roll of the dice will reveal a little bit more of a car hidden in the clever hide and reveal unit in the centre of the board. The sooner you guess, the higher the possible points; but beware, once a guess has been made, that's it. A wrong guess scores nothing at all. Players have to decide whether to gamble for an early guess, or to hold fire and try to score extra points for having the correct country, body and engine type cards in their hand.  This game includes over 70 large, beautifully photographed classic cars, old and modern. Launched by Top Gear, the hugely successful BBC TV programme.&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;1 x playing board&lt;br/&gt;1 x pack of 72 car cards in full colour&lt;br/&gt;2 x packs of 50 cards comprising;&lt;br/&gt;- Pit Stop, &lt;br/&gt;- Engine Type, Body Type and Country of Origin.&lt;br/&gt;6 x assorted coloured playing pawns&lt;br/&gt;1 x hide and reveal mechanism&lt;br/&gt;1 x 6-sided standard dice&lt;br/&gt;1 x 6-sided coloured spot dice&lt;br/&gt;1 x rules sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
