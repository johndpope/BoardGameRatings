			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMNI-Labs keeps its database of known meta-powered individuals in the middle of the Nevada desert, buried beneath a heavily fortified structure that has more in common with a military base than the research lab that's advertised at its front gate. The information in the database is the most complete and up to date data possible for the powers and background of every super-human known to mankind and alien species alike. Accessed by super-heroes, law enforcement personnel, international governments and even the occasional super-villain, OMNI provides a reliable resource for establishing who you're facing, how their powers work, and what they appear to be after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absorption details five new super-villains for your M&amp;amp;M campaign, from the volatile Agent 88 to the Russian mobster known only as Tunguska. Wanted for crimes as diverse as playing a modern day Robin Hood to attempting a coup d'etat in south-east Asia, these absorbing enemies are sure to give your heroes a fight to remember. Each villain comes with a one-page Omni-Database player hand-out that can be given to your heroes to familiarise themselves with their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
