			<description>Here's your chance to play America's favorite game show on DVD with the all-new Family Feud DVD game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the actual game show, you'll now be playing double and triple money rounds, with the chance to steal the money and the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the updated game play and hundreds of new questions, it's hours of fun for the whole family!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game deals with 2 players at home, trying to match all the Top 5 answers on the survey, with a twist. Both players must try to out score the opponent by scoring the most points on each question round. With a pair of duel question rounds where both must answer the same survey question, and the fast money question round where both are given seperate questions to answer, and match the surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
