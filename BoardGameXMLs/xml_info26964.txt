			<description>At first sight this &amp;quot;card tennis&amp;quot; game resembles the game Tennis ( &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/game/2841&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/game/2841&lt;/a&gt; ) a lot. On close examination, however, there are differences which will be discussed underneath.&lt;br/&gt;First of all it should be noted that the (c) from this game is 1973: two years before Tennis was released! Further, on the box it says (literal translation) &amp;quot;The first and only cardgame on the world based on tennis&amp;quot;. The box furthermore states that  the game was issued on occasion of the 75th year of the Dutch Tennis Association. However, a publisher cannot be found on box, or on rule sheets. Based on these data I do believe that this was the predecessor of Tennis.&lt;br/&gt;Differences with Tennis: a) In this game there is no 'ball' nor a pawn (you just move the stack of played cards to the correct position). b) Cards are strictly for either backhand or forehand strokes (indicated with either B or F). c) There are more rules of which card may be played on what card (eg. smash may only following a lob).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
