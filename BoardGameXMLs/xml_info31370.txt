							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Midway: Four Fatal Hours</name>
									
			<description>This is a solitaire simulation of the four fatal hours of June 4th 1942 that would decide the outcome of the Battle of Midway. It is set over 8 half hour turns between 07:00 which was the approximate time of the first American attack, and 11:00 which was the approximate time of the first Japanese counter strike at the American carriers. You represent Admiral Nagumo in command of Carrier Divisions one and two. The orders you were given before setting sail were two-fold, firstly strike the Midway Atoll so as to allow for a follow-up invasion, and secondly, strike any American carriers which sail out to challenge you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal throughout this game is to carry out these orders and to keep your carriers afloat. Victory points will be awarded according to the level of success you achieve in meeting these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
