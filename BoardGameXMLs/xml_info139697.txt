			<description>The game is played on a 8 x 8 grid. Players place hedgerows to mark enclosed areas. These are then marked for a player by a play-do figure which the players can form when they need them. Each square is worth one point. &lt;br/&gt;Bonus points are awarded for claiming golden coins found on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
