							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bable Terror</name>
									
			<description>Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tired knight, returning home from the crusades, you find your castle surrounded by a strange labyrinth. A peasant advises that your trusted staff has betrayed you and constructed the walls to prevent your return. With a sneer he ells you of the Bables and other creatures roaming the maze-like complex. Can you find your way through this maze where you can see but a few yards? In spite of danger lurking around nearly every corner, you are confident. Your travels have provided you with a flask of green liquid which allows you to become temporarily invisible. You are off to slay Bables and face other unknowns and reclaim what is rightfully yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search a maze for Bables and Stars to eat in this Pac Man style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts with a randomized 21x13 maze being drawn on the screen. When the maze is completed, several dots are placed to show the location of items. The full maze is then wiped off the screen and replaced with a top view presentation of a 9x5 portion where your character is located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves moving your character through the maze, which scrolls as you approach the edges of the screen. You must avoid Bables (monsters), which can kill you with one touch, until you eat a Star. After eating a Star, you can then run into the Bables to eat them and score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
