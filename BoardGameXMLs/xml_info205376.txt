			<description>Stacked! is a quick, co-op game set in a mystical vanishing library. Players must answer customer questions (using IRL library digital resources) while making sure the library doesn't fill up with unshelved books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was created as a tool to use during digital library workshops at Auckland Libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt; Stacked! is a cooperative game in which the players fight against the inevitable build-up of unshelved books while trying to answer as many customer questions as possible&lt;br/&gt; Stacked! is a magical vanishing library and, as such, the layout changes from day to day. During the game you're going to explore the library; answer reference questions from the customers; and prevent the returned books from piling up.&lt;br/&gt; In a turn, players have a choice of x actions. Move, Explore, Shelve (books), take a reference question, or use their special ability. If a player has a reference question they must attempt to find an answer between turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game&lt;br/&gt; The players win or lose together. The players win when each player has at least 2 answered questions.&lt;br/&gt; The players lose if the Library is too full of unshelved books (I.e. Trolley Tokens are all gone).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stacked! can be played using your local library's digital resources (i.e. as a training tool etc) or using google to find the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
