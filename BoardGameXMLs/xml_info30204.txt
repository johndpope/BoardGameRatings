			<description>(from publisher's website:)&lt;br/&gt;How does a Minor Deity get more glory than the Minor Deity living next door?  By sending Minions into battle of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funny folks at Cloud Kingdom games bring you a fantasy card game where each player becomes a Minor Deity.  The object of the game is to get the most Glory.  The trouble is that, ever since that &amp;ldquo;Atlantis Incident,&amp;rdquo; deities are no longer allowed to directly affect the material world.  The only way to get the glory is to send your adoring Minions out to do battle in your stead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls eight amusing minions who are sent out to strive against the minions of your opponents.  The battleground is defined and, based on your minions&amp;rsquo; attributes, you choose the best &amp;ldquo;ahem&amp;rdquo; man for the job.  You can then grant your minion a Boon to help him succeed.  At this point a combination of daring and luck may bring you the glory.  Dice are rolled.  Points are tallied.  Only one Minion will emerge to shower glory on their master.  Will it be you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game contains all the cards and components for a two player game and takes about 20 minutes to play, ages 10 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
