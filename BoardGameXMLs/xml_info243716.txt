			<description>It&amp;acute;s an snake and ladder kind of boardgame. &lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped or hindered by Bob the Builder. You can get a green light and go forward two steps. There is a square that tells you that you have forgotten your builderhelmet, so you have to go back three steps. There can be workers on the road that make you skip you turn. There are several ( I think 7) different types of squares that you can end up on, that makse you go forward och backwards. First up wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
