			<description>Kubbuteo is an indoor version of popular garden game, Kubb. Players take turns flicking 6 disks the length of a 4&amp;rsquo; by 2&amp;rsquo; board, trying to knock down their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Kubbs [upright disks]. The opponent flicks back the downed Kubbs and then have their turn at flicking the 6 disks at the Kubbs. Once a player has knocked down all Kubbs in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s half, they may attempt to knock down the centrally located King and thus win the game &amp;ndash; but doing this beforehand will result in losing the game, so care must be taken.&lt;br/&gt; Kubbuteo can be played by people of all ages and appeals to players of Crokinole and Carrom, requiring the same dexterity skills. Tactically it is identical to parent game Kubb, deciding where to return downed Kubbs to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
