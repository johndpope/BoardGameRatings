							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rituals of Blood</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock the Power In Your Veins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occult rituals, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, bring magic to the masses, with lengthy and difficult to perform magical rites which can be performed even by non-spellcasters, but which come with a cost, as well as the risk for terrible backlash to occur for those who meddle in things they do not understand. Unlike traditional spells, only a handful of occult rituals made it into that book however, which begs the question of what other strange and unknowable rituals might be lurking about in obscure tomes lost to history and memory. Tomes like this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a collection of 10 brand new occult rituals for use in your game, all of which are thematically linked to bloodlines, blood effigies, and blood sacrifice. Presented in the guise of a fictitious tome that player characters might stumble across, the book also includes a flavorful introductory section that can be read aloud or handed out to players, and suggestions for how to incorporate the book into your game. The rituals in this book allow players (or nefarious NPCs) to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Instill the power of a sorcerer bloodline in a character that lacks one, or empower the blood of a sorcerer or bloodrager to empower their abilities.&lt;br/&gt;    Wipe out entire bloodlines, slaying whole lineages with a single spell.&lt;br/&gt;    Create a murderous homunculus from the blood of another creature, which will stalk and slay the donor at all costs.&lt;br/&gt;    Create a literal rain of gore that attracts predators from miles away, and withers and blights crops in the area.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
