							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ice Breaker</name>
									
			<description>Ice Breaker is a party game designed to allow people to get to know one another by answering simple personal questions (i.e. 'How many times did you have to take your driver's test?' or 'Have you traveled outside the USA?').  The game comes equipped with four mugs, each with a different color handle, a game board, and four matching color pawns.  The mug handles each have a spinner built into them, dictating which question square on the game board your pawn moves to.  First pawn to reach the center of the board wins.  The game board doubles as a serving tray for the mugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box art:  &lt;br/&gt;Break the ice and liven up the party.  &amp;quot;Ice Breaker,&amp;quot; the fun game that opens the way to knowing everyone better.  Spin the pointer and move the color matched pawns to the revealing questions on the game tray.  Drink a toast to the winner and new-found friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4-18 oz. Game mugs with Spinner Handles&lt;br/&gt;     1 Serving/Game Tray&lt;br/&gt;     4 Pawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
