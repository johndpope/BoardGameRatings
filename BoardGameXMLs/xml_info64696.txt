							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack of the 50-Foot Girl Gang</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready to rumble and revved for a race! Attack of the 50-Foot Girl Gang returns the Victims of Circumstance to the Fabulous 1950s (or a town with a 1950s feel), or at least, the B-Movie Version of it, where mortal struggles like the Korean War take a backseat to more pressing concerns like finding coonskin caps and learning to use hula hoops. In this Misadventure, the Victims get to re-experience the awkward physical changes, the horribly scarring acne, crushing conformity, and other assorted joys of high school life. Along they way, they'll have to put together enough clues to figure out the threat posed to their beloved school by the worst Juvenile Delinquents ever-The 50-Foot Girl Gang!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
