			<description>Can you keep a straight face - even when you're lying? Can you tell the difference between a truth and a blatant bluff?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're the world's best blagger, or just a champion cheater, then this is the game for you. thinking on your feet and coming up with creative answers are what counts here - and you'll need to reel off some real-sounding suggestions if you want to win. Players must come up with - and pass off - plausible meanings for words and sayings in 4 different rounds including word definitions; sayings; world customs and moments in history, but only one of them will be genuine. Can you fish out the red herrings and spot which one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
