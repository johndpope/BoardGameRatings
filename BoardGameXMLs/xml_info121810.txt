			<description>The monks go to the gathering around the monastery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board represents a path consisting of multiple branches in boxes. For these cells will spread face down cards representing different plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player chooses how many spaces it will move. The other players will move the same number of squares in the direction of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;Once on a box, the player becomes aware of the nature of the plant in secret.&lt;br/&gt;- If it appears on his card objective (each player has different objective), he takes it in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;- If it appears on the card of opponent, he places it before him face down.&lt;br/&gt;- If the plant appears nowhere, it stays in place face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player return to the monastery with its five plants is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
