			<description>The Room is a role-playing / adventure game with a point-and-click interface. The player assumes the role of Johnny, a banker in San Francisco, as he goes about his daily life-- showering, going to work, and pleasing his fiance Lisa. The game is divided up into several levels, each of which takes the form of a new day. Each level begins with Johnny being required to bathe and ends with him going to bed; in between, Johnny is tasked with various missions, which usually involve him engaging in mundane activities such as meeting friends for coffee, buying new clothes, and playing catch. When not on a mission, the player is given free roam over a small area of San Francisco, which includes a park, several stores, and the homes of Johnny's friends Mark and Denny. There are several side quests that the player can engage in when not on missions, such as finding and reading Denny's daily diary entries; successfully completing a side quest involving finding ten unique spoons unlocks an extended ending to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Room (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
