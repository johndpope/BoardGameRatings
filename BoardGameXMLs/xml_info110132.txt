			<description>from the back cover&lt;br/&gt;Dragons and Dungeons and Weyrs, Oh My!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phil and Dixie take us on a light-headed look at role-playing games, one of the world's most fanatically pursued pasttimes. Each month for three years, they had readers of Dragon magazine laughing at their games and themselves. Now you can enjoy the fun. Here are over a dozen of the never-before collected installments o fthe series along with the long awaited last chapter,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sex and D&amp;amp;D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition also contains all of Phil Foglio's covers for Dragon magazine as well as the definitive lowdown on Dixie Null. What's New? 2 is the perfectaddition to any fantasy fan's or gamer's library, and certainly a good complement to the first What's New. It also serves as a fine introduction to the new series now appearing in The Duelist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
