			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the beginning, the interbreeding of the standard fantasy races has gone unmentioned or denied. The six races have stood unmixed: dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, humans, and orcs. Halfelves and half-orcs are the exception to this rule. The spectrum of other half-breeds, born of the crossbreeding between two (or even three!) other races, has been taboo, confined to creative GMs and their players. Until now&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Simply Bloodlines, a d20 sourcebook that brings seventeen new player races to the gaming table. This unique sourcebook combines the seven standard Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook races and presents a unique crossbreed for each racial combination. The core philosophies of this book are gaming balance and creative freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each new race is an ECL +0 race, following in the footsteps of the races presented in the 3.5 Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook. Simply Bloodlines includes nineteen new racial feats, six new racial prestige classes, six new deities and rules for the races found in this sourcebook. Featuring original art by Claudio Pozas, written by Chris and Christina McCoy.  Originally released as &amp;quot;Races of Consequence&amp;quot;, this book has been updated and re-edited for distribution under the original authors' own publishing company, Mad Scotsman Games.  Same gaming material with an all-new look!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
