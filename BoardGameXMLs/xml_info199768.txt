			<description>An ancient legend speaks of an evil known as Babusa, a 9-tailed demon Kat, that could raise the dead and had a penchant for inflicting unending plight on mankind. Eventually defeated by having his 9 tails cut off, Babusa was locked away for what many hoped would be an eternity. His nine tails, still oozing magical power, were given to a select few. The tails Imbued the owners with the ability to transform into magical warrior kats just in case Babusa were to ever rise again. That day has come, and with it so has total chaos! Choose your side and prepare to fight in 9DKP (9 Deadly Kat Points!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9DKP is a Trading Card Game (TCG), that takes place in the 9DKP universe created by Erick Scarecrow. The objective with the 9DKP TCG was to bring the fun and wacky flavor of the 9DKP universe to table top with a TCG that is light and easy to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TCGs can often be intimidating for payers to get invested in due to their complexity of rules, card sets, and time commitment, from playing to deck building. 9DKP is lighter than most TCGs. 9DKP is a great starting point for people who are developing an interest in TCGs, families with younger gamers, or for casual gamers looking for something a bit simpler than the other TCGs on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in 9DKP is very simple, consisting of 2 phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1 &amp;ndash; Draw: draw 1 new card into your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2 &amp;ndash; Active: During the active phase you do the follow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wake up any character cards that are in Katnap.&lt;br/&gt;Play 1 character card into your RANGE (with a max of 4 cards in your RANGE at one time). Generate or spend the corresponding DKP value of the card. That card enters in Katnap and cannot attack or defend during this turn unless otherwise stated.&lt;br/&gt;Play any number of skratch cards you wish as long as you can afford the associated DKP cost.&lt;br/&gt;Play passes to your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other TCGs, 9DKP&amp;rsquo;s 2 phases keep the turn lengths short and simple. Skratch cards, that work like spells or magical effects in other TCGS, can only be played on your turn and currently there are no interrupt or cancel cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
