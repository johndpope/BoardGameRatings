			<description>Uprising is a game for two players that depicts, in a very abstract way, the growth and development (or containment and suffocation) of a popular movement in revolt against an oppressive government. The Rebel player, who starts the game with little apparent power but a great deal of information, is in conflict with the Government player, who has power (with his assortment of Agents) but very little information on the Rebel&amp;rsquo;s resources and capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces represent small groups (Insurgents and Agents), support organizations (Sympathizers), and nonexistent things or misleading information (Dummies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map (a field of 91 hexes) is perhaps the most abstracted part of the design, in that it does not represent physical distance, but something more like organizational proximity. With the Rebel pieces starting on the outer perimeter, and the Agents starting in a tight group around the Nexus, it can be displayed how far the revolt must go and how much larger it must grow in order to challenge the government for ultimate power. However, being out in the margins allows time to organize and gather strength....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
