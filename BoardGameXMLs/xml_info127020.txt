							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sargon 4</name>
									
			<description>From the Game Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sargon was the warlord who ruled the ancient world. Patient, cunning, a master strategist...and the inspiration for the new standard in computer chess, SARGON 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can set SARGON's playing strength to any of sixteen levels, and then fine tune it to get the game that's right for you. If you're a little rusty, SARGON's many teaching features (such as on-line help, chess tutorial, hints, problems, and special novice mode) make improving your play both fun and easy. And even experts will be challenged by SARGON's chess algorithm, the most powerful available on a microcomputer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SARGON's spectacular graphics are unequaled in computer chess. Whether you play in vivid 2-D or stunning 3-D, you choose from a large collection of beautifully crafted chess sets. Each set was created by a professional artist and rendered using the latest in advanced image processing and computer graphics technology. Or use the Piece Sculptor to create your own.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
