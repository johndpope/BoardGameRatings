							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Johan&#039;s Lost Vault</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At one time the City of Tygos was a bustling metropolis located in the southeastern portion of the Plains of Dorack. Sitting in the shadow of the Dorack Mountains this city flourished as a trading metropolis. Decades ago the leaders of the city, the Serpentine Cultists, began a racially charged campaign against certain factions of the Plainsmen tribes. The resulting response of the Plainsmen was devastating to Tygos and the city was levelled for the most part and the water supply was poisoned. The city was also home to a group of adventurers called JOHAN and their fortress was said to contain powerful ancient magic that was never recovered. If these items can be located the resulting power can bring continued success to your party&amp;rsquo;s wealth and fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a mid to high level group of adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
