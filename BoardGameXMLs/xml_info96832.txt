			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An early morning mist covered much of the battlefield as a pale, springtime sun rose in the eastern sky. A single Allied RE8 two-seater reconnaissance aircraft slowly circled the German positions below. Bursting from the clouds, the sun at its back, machine guns blazing, a bright red Fokker DR I Triplane took aim at point-blank range on the lumbering reconnaissance plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it's your turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, from the cockpit of your own fighter, you can test yourself against the greatest air aces of World War I. Challenge the &amp;quot;Red Baron&amp;quot; von Richtohfen (sic) or go up against the &amp;quot;White Knight&amp;quot; Billy Bishop in a test of skill and daring, where the losers crash and burn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your own type of aircraft, from the sassy Sopwith Camel to the ominous Fokker Triplane. Learn the tactics and maneuvers that can spell the difference between glory and death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No heat seeking missiles or distant targets here. This type of combat is &amp;quot;up close and personal.&amp;quot; It's you versus &amp;quot;him&amp;quot;, and he's very, very, good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3-D Digitized Animation - No &amp;quot;dancing&amp;quot; polygon shaped objects in War Eagles. Each aerial object has been &amp;quot;digitized&amp;quot; from 37 different angles to provide added realism and authenticity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     10 Missions - Ten separate, distinct and constantly changing hazardous missions with varying speeds and skill levels from which to choose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Multiple Views - View forward, back or to either side, as well as follow your own action from a chase plane at close, medium or far range. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Scoring - Pilot rosters are maintained and updated with top &amp;quot;aces&amp;quot; listed, as well as medals and decorations awarded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic action - Individual aircraft performance authenticity reproduces actual flying conditions, and realistic wartime circumstances are maintained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
