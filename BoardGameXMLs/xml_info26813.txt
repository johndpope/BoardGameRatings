			<description>A long time ago Gods were disputing who would rule the world. Horus would claim power on Egypt and Seth on the desert. Seth wasn't content with this and would soon take revenge. This game is based upon a comic book and cartoon of Papyrus. It's aimed at children starting from age 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
