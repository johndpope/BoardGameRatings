			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a century after the Seraphs returned to Earth, fulfilling ancient scripture with fire and sword. Most of Earth's population died in the plague and resulting wars -- and then came the ice age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mankind has survived, but not without change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondrous new races were born following the Time of Plagues, some destined to fight alongside the Seraphs of the Light, while others simply want to survive in a harsh new world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And beneath the cities and in abandoned wastelands, the forces of evil continue their age-old war with the mortals and the seraphim. These dragons and the Dark minions won't stop fighting until the world is theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Rogue Mage Roleplaying Game you join with rogue mage Thorn St. Croix and the forces of Light to stop the fallen seraphs and their devil-spawn, adventuring in and beyond the world of Faith Hunter's apocalyptic fantasy trilogy: Bloodring, Seraphs, and Host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rogue Mage Roleplaying Game Player's Handbook features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete rules for all the mortal races of the Rogue mage novels.&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of skills, scores of Drawbacks, over 100 Conjures, and over 200 Talents for heroes to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;     A half-dozen pre-made characters so play can begin immediately.&lt;br/&gt;     A luck point system that encourages players to take chances and keep the action moving, and an allegiance system that turns a hero's choices in the war between Darkness and Light into something more than just words on a character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;     Player character gear from swords to shotguns to helicopter gunships, as well as magic weapons, energy-filled spell amulets, and demonic and seraphic artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;     Simple combat rules that resolve attacks and damage in a single roll and full-scale battles in only a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
