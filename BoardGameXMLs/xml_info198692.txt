			<description>The game comes with 15 stunt sticks in each of six colors, a deck of cards with one of eight activities displayed on each card, 16 tokens numbered one through 16, and, for each player (or team), a 4X4 board with spaces numbered one through 16.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, a token is flipped face-up, a card is drawn, and all players (or teams) then try to complete the activity shown on the card. Successful players place a marker on the space on their boards that corresponds to the number on the token. The first player to place four in a row wins.&lt;br/&gt;Activities involve the sticks in some way, usually by building structures that don't fall or that are produced from memory or instruction or that others try to guess. A few activities use the sticks differently, eg, to indicate answers to trivia questions or to prompt Liar's Dice-style guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
