			<description>Documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain!! The energy crystals that power our life-support systems are failing! We need to locate new ones before we all die! You'll have to count on your crew, now. Let's hope you chose them well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your favorite movie stars, historical figures, friends and relatives can become characters in this text adventure game if you choose them before you become captain. You must then deal with an assortment of monsters from the planet's surface before you can get those energy crystals you need so desperately. LANDING PARTY is menu-driven for ease of play. Individual games are short and different each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurry, Captain! The air...I...I can't breathe.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
