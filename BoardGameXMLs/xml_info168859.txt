			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: Move all the tees from the tee box to the green. Don't forget this is an exciting, strategy game with lakes, sand traps and obstacles.  So get your golfers together and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Description:&lt;br/&gt;Mulligan's Wild is a golf-themed roll-and-move game with a &amp;quot;send your opponent back to the start&amp;quot; mechanic similar to Backgammon or Sorry. Although this game claims to be &amp;quot;Golf game of the year,&amp;quot; the golf theme seems entirely pasted on. Players roll dice and try to move their pieces (or &amp;quot;tees&amp;quot;) out of their tee box, along the track, to their green and then into their hole.  There is a special &amp;quot;Mulligan's Wild&amp;quot; die included, which allows players to move a number of spaces of their choice. First player to move all tees onto the matching green and into the matching hole wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
