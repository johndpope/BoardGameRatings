							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creed</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The rules you now hold form the basis for Creed, the second part of the Testament, a game from the Late Gaming Company. You can take yourself and a group of friends into the world of Creed and there bear witness to the last days. You will be able to tell stories of triumph and defeat, retribution and redemption. If you have not played Testament then your GM must believe you are ready for further revelations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Narrator's section:&lt;br/&gt;Creed is an addition to the Testament game. Testament did not have rules for Credo or for demons and angels but the groundwork was laid in that game to support Creed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the &amp;quot;Credo&amp;quot; section:&lt;br/&gt;Credo is the &amp;ldquo;magic system&amp;rdquo; for Creed. Testament didn&amp;rsquo;t have any magic - but Creed characters can. Magic is the system of creating change according to your will. Technically lifting up a cup with your hand is a magical operation - but the real talent is doing the lifting without using your hand. Credo allows that to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
