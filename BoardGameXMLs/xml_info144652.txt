Located to trailing of Clement Sector, Dawn Subsector is the spearhead of colonization into this new sector.  The last stops before heading into the unknown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn - A world ruled by a self-declared royal family. Are they being aided from another world with designs on domination?

Whose side will your characters take?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tranquility - A world with a small population of disgruntled workers operating a robotic mine. Will the colony succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bicocca - The newest of the colonies.
