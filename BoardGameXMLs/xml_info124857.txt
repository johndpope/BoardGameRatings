			<description>Hot Wheels: Crash! is a computer game based on the Hot Wheels toy car brand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released in 2000 for the Microsoft Windows operating system. The object of the game is to crash cars into buildings and structures in each level in order to earn points, with 100 being the goal. The game includes a total of 12 different vehicles and 25 different levels. There are 3 difficulties, and on each difficulty, there are 6 levels. Once 100 points on each level on a difficulty have been scored, a 7th level for the difficulty is unlocked that, after completion with 100 points, unlocks a special level. Once every special level for each difficulty has been fully completed, a final level is unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came packaged with the Hot Wheel car Tow Jam which, for a while, was only available with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hot Wheels: Crash!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
