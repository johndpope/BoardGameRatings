							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Air Ballooning Game</name>
									
			<description>This game was published Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.  Players race their balloons through a series of obstacles.  Each turn they can attempt to change the wind direction and also spin for their movement total.  Event cards can give the player and edge or knock them out.  Evidently hitting the electrical wires is BAD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than pawns players move one of the 5 colored balloons which are mounted on 1-foot plastic rods, so that they actually hang above the board.  The balloons are meant to be painted so that players can personalize their balloons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1,000 copies of the game were printed for the Balloon Fiesta.  1983 marked the 200th anniversary of ballooning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
