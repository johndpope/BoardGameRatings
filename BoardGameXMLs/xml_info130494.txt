			<description>In his turn, the player draws a card and moves his pawn on the game board. Depending on the destination square, the player can buy in the bank at the last specified (or by negotiation with an opponent if there are no more stock for sale). If a player is lack of liquidity, it can borrow from the broker or sell some of its shares (5000F fine for negligence!). &lt;br/&gt;The best quarterback making his best fruition capital wins the game! Buy at the best price and sell at the best price, the same recipe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to 20 points total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
