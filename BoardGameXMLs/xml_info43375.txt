			<description>Translation: Little Raven as a Great Pirate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game in the &amp;quot;Little Raven&amp;quot; game series based on the children's book series by author Nele Moost and illustrator Annet Rudolph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Raven and his friends want to play pirates in the meadow and need a pirate boat. The boat is made up of 6 tiles with animals on them. The tiles are turned up, and whoever finds a pair of identical animals may take one of the tiles and put it down in front of him. Later in the game, if a player finds another pair of friends, he may only take a tile if it fits next to one already in front of him. If not, the player gives it to an adjacent player. The first player to find all six tiles wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is essentially a memory game with an added twist of puzzle manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
