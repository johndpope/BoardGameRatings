			<description>A simple worker placement game based on the conquest of fictional and humorously named territories using a deck of coins as a random agent. Players take turns placing coins from their hands onto the map based on a simple set of rules with the goal of capturing coins that have already been situated on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coins are never flipped in this game, and the random element is determined by the pool of coins used to play. Thus every game is different and strategy varies based on the coins available. The length of the game is also determined by the deck of coins - when the pool is exhausted, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the geographical suggestion of the art, the game is not about conquering territories from neighboring territories, but involves planning ahead and placing coins to capture the most coins for yourself, while not creating an advantageous position for your opponent(s). Coins are captured based on comparative sizes of the coins (sometimes smaller, sometimes larger) and simple rules that are written on the territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
