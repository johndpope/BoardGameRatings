			<description>Runes of Mayhem is a fast, competitive, historical tactical card game for two. Enter the Medieval world of the Vikings and the Anglo-Saxons! Rule the battlefield with powerful formations and lead your forces with mighty heroes. Overcome your opponent, destroy his fortress and reap the spoils of war! How will you earn victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players face each other on the battlefield, they create powerful formations and lead their forces to victory with the aid of mighty kings. The game features tokens and dice expanding it beyond the limits of a mere card game, creating an exciting combination of tactics and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runes of Mayhem is a game where choosing the right units, using the proper abilities and formations are vital, but luck matters too - after all, you cannot wholly control the mayhem of an epic battle. If you play your cards right and lead your units as a true tactician, you can render your opponent unable to roll, eliminating most of the luck factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runes of Mayhem is highly enjoyable from the very first play, and with experience, you will be able to make optimal tactical decisions. Take a defensive or an offensive approach, concentrate building momentum and speed or take your time and trade. Many paths lead to victory, but only if you pay close attention and grasp the pace of the game. In Runes of Mayhem, you decide what road to take!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
