			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of popular Pathfinder system? Neither can we&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s why D3 Adventures has started the Campaign Toybox&amp;hellip; monthly releases of new rules, classes, and creatures to enhance your gaming experience, all priced to be friendly to your wallet at a mere ninety-nine cents, so you can afford to stock up on munchies and more dice for your next gaming session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Druids have always had the distinction of being one of the most versatile classes in an adventuring party. From their powerful nature spells to their shapeshifting abilities, Druids often make a welcome addition to any group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their many advantages, Druids have struggled to fill the role of an effective healer and support for a group due to the majority of their abilities affecting only themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In nature, some animals are loners, and some work together in packs to support one another. Druids traditionally are the representatives and protectors of nature and should be able to reflect all aspects of it including that of being a member of a pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement introduces players and Gamemasters to new options for creating a more group-focused Druid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
