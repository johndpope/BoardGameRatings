			<description>Robots and Reptiles is a war game played on a checker board or other grid based map. Players build their forces around miniatures they provide, which could be anything from plastic army men to Godzilla figurines. This was a Cheap Ass style game from the age of mimeographs, before photocopies were plentiful and cheap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This stand alone product has sample units and rules for creating your own, and the rules book is small enough to fit in your pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many copies have incomplete or hard to read rules because they were all trimmed in bulk, by hand, so partial text clipping is common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
