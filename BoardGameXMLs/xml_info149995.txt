			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WarLight is a rather challenging, Risk type game in which conquering the world takes you to a different, more testing level, where you have to do it all over again - it is just harder! Three levels to play, three additional challenge levels will offer you many hours of strategic planning. Additionally, there are tons of fully customized maps such as Africa, the U.S.A. and even Imperium Romanum where you can opt to use any of six different types of fog as well as a wealth of other features! Real-time as well as asynchronous multiplayer is also available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
