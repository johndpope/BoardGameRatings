			<description>Enjoy fishing &amp;mdash; or card playing? Then you'll love playing Fish Stories &amp;mdash; an exciting and educational fishing card game. No need to tell a &amp;quot;fish story&amp;quot; about the one that got away &amp;mdash; get them all here. Ice fish for Northern Pike, Muskellunge..., fly-cast for Trout, Bass, Salmon..., dive for Oysters, Scallops or Abalone, surf cast for Bluefish, Striped Bass, troll for Tarpon, Marlin, Shark&amp;mdash;and drift-chum for the Great White Shark. But watch out for the Boot! 25 of the most sought after fish in the U.S.A. 64 cards in all &amp;mdash; beautifully illustrated by noted nature artist Ron Dilg. Hours of fun for 1-6 players, Ages 9 and up. A new 'real-life' fishing card game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
