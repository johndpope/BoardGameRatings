							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Country Club Golf</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to play a round of golf in an attempt to par the course, just as you would on any golf course around the world. The game is designed to bring to some degree, the same enjoyment received in actual play. Since luck and skill are a part of each round played at your favorite golf course, luck and skill (in rolling the dice) await you as you enter the Country Club course, with its water and sand hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
