			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sirena 1793 was a frigate of the Spanish Armada that had previously served in the French Navy under the name Elene. Captured in May 1793 by frigates Santa Casilda and Perla, it returned to active service with the fleet based in Havana, doing mostly escorting service. In 1807, it was wrecked on the coast of Campeche (Mexico). This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish Frigate &amp;quot;Ifigenia 1795&amp;quot;. Each Sails of Glory Ship Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other Sails of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the ship: a special base with gaming stats, a ship log and a specific deck of maneuver cards. The ship base, ship card and ship log are printed on two sides - The game data of a second ship is printed on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
