							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Donald Pop-Along ABC Letter Games</name>
									
			<description>This kids game, featuring Disney characters, is actually four games that teach children letter recognition. All the games deal with delivering post cards. For example, in the first game you pop the popper (like in Trouble) and see which letter shows up. Find the matching letter - highlighted in black - on one of the post cards (like the &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; in Mickey) and check the mailboxes to see which name needs the letter to complete it. &amp;quot;Deliver&amp;quot; the post card by putting it in the mailbox slot so that the letter shows through the window. If a letter has already been delivered your turn ends. The player who delivers the most post cards wins. Each post card also has a message from a Disney character that repeats the key missing vowel to help reinforce the players recognition of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
