							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whereabouts</name>
									
			<description>Whereabouts is a trivial knowledge game based around the towns and cities of Great Britain. (Great Britain being the name of the island containing England, Wales and Scotland.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn to roll a die, answer the appropriate numbered question and, if correct, move that number of spaces. A correctly answered 'six' allows you to take an additional turn immediately. The aim is to collect a token from the four corners of the map and return to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card contains questions in six categories, all with multiple choice answers - Rivers; Cities; Motorways; Counties; General Knowledge; Correct Place Names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Which river flows through a particular city? (3 options)&lt;br/&gt;2. Which co-ordinate on the map is the location of a particular city? (2 options)&lt;br/&gt;3. Which motorway connects two places? (3 options)&lt;br/&gt;4. Which county contains a particular landmark? (3 options)&lt;br/&gt;5. A general knowledge question associated with a particular place (3 options)&lt;br/&gt;6. Which unlikely sounding name is a real place in Great Britain? (2 options)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
