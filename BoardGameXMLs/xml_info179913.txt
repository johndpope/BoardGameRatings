							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of the Paragons</name>
									
			<description>Rise of the Paragons is a pure strategy game with no elements of luck. Each of your characters has a unique set of different abilities, but you must use these abilities wisely, as they can only be used once each before having to Rest. When a character Rests, it becomes vulnerable to critical hits, so you must Rest carefully and punish your opponent when they are at their weakest! Build a synergistic team of champions and predict your opponent&amp;rsquo;s moves to secure victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
