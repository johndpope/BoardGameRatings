							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Structure of the Scarlet Brotherhood</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Structure of the Scarlet Brotherhood is penned by Morrev Ironseeker, a dwur scholar now in exile in Irongate. It outlines the typical information a member of the Army of Rebellion knows about the Scarlet Brotherhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the hand of Morrev son of Jerrev son of Rogev son of Morrand of the Clan Ironseeker, sage and scholar formerly of Scant, in Patchwall of this, the Common Year 591.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structure of the Scarlet Brotherhood - even after three years of occupation and four years of rebellion and war remains obscure. It has become clear that the pre-war opinion that the Scarlet Brotherhood was no more than an isolated and fanatical sect was tragically incorrect. The bitter lesson which the last seven terrible years have taught is that the Brotherhood encompasses an entire social structure of its own centred around the central belief in the superiority of the Suel race and its divine right to rule all others. The sole purpose of this highly ordered structure appears to be to turn this belief into reality in the subjugation of the free peoples of the Flanaess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What we know of the Brotherhood comes from bitter and direct experience of their deeds. These lessons are written in the blood of those who suffered at their hands, both here and in the other lands which fell beneath their dominion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
