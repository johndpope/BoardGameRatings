			<description>&amp;quot;The learn a language game.&lt;br/&gt;Card game excitement while learning to speak Spanish/French.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;Phrase Book, Rules&lt;br/&gt;120 Ling-Whist playing cards with letters and pronunciations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven cards are dealt to each player, and a phrase is selected from the phrase book.  During a turn a player draws a card and either discards a card or plays one to his current word.  The word must be from the phrase chosen; it must be spelled in correct order, but the words themselves can be done in any order.  The game ends when someone completes the sentence or the deck runs out, and players score:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     for each player, 5 points for each completed word&lt;br/&gt;     for the player with the fewest points in hand, the difference between the opponent's hand and theirs&lt;br/&gt;     for winning, 25 points &lt;br/&gt;            plus the points on all the cards in the sentence&lt;br/&gt;            plus the points on incomplete words by the others&lt;br/&gt;            all doubled if the opponents did not complete a word, tripled if they didn't get a letter down&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;300 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Language practice comes in by reciting the chosen phrase, saying the letter's name when playing its card (e.g. 'HO-tah', not 'jay'), and reciting the phrase again when you repeat it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
