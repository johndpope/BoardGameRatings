			<description>This is an absorbing game where players strategically place their pawns upon a circular playing board where placing holes are joined by a web of lines.  Depending upon where pegs are placed,  depends much on where a player already has pegs in that line of direction,  because,  on their subsequent turn on placing another peg in that same line will then be able to 'expel'  the opponent's peg from the board!  The web of lines and number of pegs in play at any one time helps confuse issues that inevitably leads to increased concentration, and the players subsequently taking the game far more seriously!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
