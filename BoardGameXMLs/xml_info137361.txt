							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Differix Extrem</name>
									
			<description>Differix Extrem features the same gameplay as the earlier title Differix from the same designer, but with an added dimension of extremeness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes four playing boards, and each board features sixteen nearly identical images. In one of those multiplied images, for example, the dog might be wearing a pair of tiny goggles, while in another his tail is on the left side of his body instead of the right. Competing against both a timer and opponents, each player wants to find the correct matching image for a revealed tile before anyone else does, claiming that tile as a reward &amp;ndash; and whoever claims the most tiles wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Differix&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
