			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trail of the Apprentice is a 5-part mini-campaign, designed for beginners and younger players of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or 5th Edition. Each adventure takes your heroes through one character level, from 1st though 5th. Trail of the Apprentice is part of the Legendary Beginnings line, designed to create exciting adventures suitable for all ages. These modules use simplified stat blocks and other rules adjustments to keep gameplay fun for new players, and contains helpful sidebars that provide advice on how to run RPGs for younger gamers so your whole family can Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A local sage, Ithamar Ruggles, has asked the PCs to visit the Lord Mayor of Port Fairglade and warn him that someone might try to rob him of a statue, which he calls the White Serpent. Ithamar recently lost the statue&amp;rsquo;s twin, the Green Serpent, to bandits and believes there is a deeper plot involved. The PCs arrive to find that thieves have already taken the White Serpent from the Lord Mayor&amp;rsquo;s private family museum. He tasks the PCs with discretely investigating the robbery. But when the nobleman&amp;rsquo;s museum is robbed a second time, the loss of the statues becomes the least of their worries. The King&amp;rsquo;s Curse is an adventure for 2nd-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
