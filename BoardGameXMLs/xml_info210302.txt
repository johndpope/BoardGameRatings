			<description>The battle of Chantilly at the regimental level. Old School style of civil war regimental command games. This game will have written orders/Battle Plans for each army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Plans will play an important part in the games mechanics. The Focus here is on the command and control problems a commanding general would have. Fog of war and a lack of a Helicopter viewpoint for the commanding general are also present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit will have a fighting effectiveness rather than a casualties in terms of men lost. This allows us to combine the combat and morale mechanic into one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Ravensworth Press 60 Minutes to Victory series of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
