							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shades - A Game About Letting Go, After You Are Gone</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shades is a live action roleplaying game meant to be played in four to five hours over a single evening, with 3-5 players and a moderator. The characters are ghosts who are bound to their old lives by questions and unresolved business. Finding themselves in the company of other ghosts, they will learn more about their past and what is binding them to this world; and face what they have to confront or change to move on. They will be guided by Charon, the Ferryman, who will guide them through their discovery and confrontations. At the end, they will make a final choice as to their fate in the afterlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
