			<description>The game simulates a round of golf on a nine hole playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each have a set of seven clubs, each of which has a number. A player choses a club and then rolls three d6 and then moves the number of spaces equal to the dice total minus the club number. There are special rules for teeing off, pitching on and putting and also for hazards such as bunkers, water, rough/trees and out of bounds. There is also a pack of hazard cards  which are drawn and acted on in certain circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
