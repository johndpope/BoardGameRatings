							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Town that Time Forgot</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While traveling, the PCs come upon a small town nestled deep in the foothills near a large mountain range. There are no signs or visible means to identify the town, and very few people can be seen in the streets. The few people that are seen all seem to be quite pleasant, and smile warmly at the PCs. If the PCs ask any of the townsfolk about the name of the town, they appear to get nervous and won&amp;rsquo;t make eye contact. Not only that, but they refuse to give a sound answer. Most of them come up with ways to change the subject, or simply say things such as &amp;quot;just a small town&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;what&amp;rsquo;s in a name?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even without any kind of Insight checks, the PCs get a feeling that something is just not right about this town. Something&amp;rsquo;s strange, and to even hint at it gets the locals nervous. If the PCs persist in trying to get information about the town, the locals will eventually start intentionally avoiding them by going out of their way to walk around them, or simply head in a different direction when approached. Their smiles never fade, but their actions reflect what they really feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
