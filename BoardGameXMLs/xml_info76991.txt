			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine Software were notorious for putting more effort into their packaging and advertising than their game design, but Zzoom was one of the more playable. As you try to fly a fighter plane in a 3D view, you must protect refugees on the horizon by shooting down enemy planes. This theme sat well with the progressive politics of the early 80s, with Liverpool (home of the publisher Imagine) being a hard-left stronghold. The basic graphics didn't detract from the entertaining game-play, but a bug meant you scored more points by killing refugees instead of planes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
