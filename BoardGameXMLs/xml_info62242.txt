			<description>DOBBEL is a promotional die with smileys you receive when you try a game at the 999 Games booth on game expositions. The die comes with a &amp;quot;playing field&amp;quot; sheet randomly filled with the smileys of the die. On the back of this sheet you can find the rules of two games that can be played with the die. On the website of 999 Games you can find rules for two other games as well. Here follows a short description of the available games with the die:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gezichtje Zoeken (Find the Smiley)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player rolls the die. Now every player searches the thrown smiley on the playing field. The player that locates the smiley first gets a point. This game can be played until a certain amount of points is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bekken Trekken (Make Faces)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player rolls the die hidden from the other players. He / she now has to make the face shown on the die. When another player guesses the correct face he / she earns one point and the performer earns two points. At the end of the game the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dobbel 9 (Roll 9)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this game you have to know that the &amp;quot;playing field&amp;quot; is devided in two halfs by a red dotted line and that the faces of the die occur many times on the playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players use their own half of the &amp;quot;playing field&amp;quot; and throw the die in alternate turns. When a player throws the die, he / she has to mark the thrown smiley on the playing field. This way the players try to make a square of 3 * 3 marked smileys. The first player to reach this wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOBBEL Bingo (DOBBEL Bingo)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOBBEL Bingo works the same as Dobbel 9 but now you have to try to mark all smileys on your half of the playing field. (Only one smiley may be marked per throw.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.999games.nl/dobbel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.999games.nl/dobbel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
