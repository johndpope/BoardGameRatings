							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eidolon</name>
									
			<description>Eidolon is a game about exploring a mysterious landscape and uncovering the stories of the people who lived there once before. It is a game about history, curiosity, interconnectedness, and the slow and inevitable beauty of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be dropped into the dreary and mystical Western Washington circa 2400 c.e. with little to guide your way. Awaiting you is a vast landscape filled with wildlife, edible plants, and the memories of our now-dead culture&amp;mdash;stored in artefacts such as journals, sketchbooks, newspapers, zines, brochures, transcripts, blogs, and more. Collect these memories and piece together what happened to these people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES: &lt;br/&gt; - Over 150 documents telling the interconnected stories of dozens of characters across hundreds of years. &lt;br/&gt; - An enormous, hand-sculpted Western Washington that takes multiple hours to cross. &lt;br/&gt; - Day/night cycle and dynamic weather. &lt;br/&gt; - Varied flora and fauna (both predators and prey).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
