			<description>This game is based on my home town of Hexham, in the &lt;br/&gt;north-east of England:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game players get given a set &amp;quot;business cards&amp;quot; and write down the shop name on the card. the cards are placed back in the deck, the game commences. Players use three &amp;quot;shoppers&amp;quot; to get to the shops on their shopping list(moving 1,2 or 3 spaces in total, like 1 piece moves 1 square and anouther moves 2, in 1 go). If another player lands on your piece they get to move you anywhere on the board. once you have been to all your shops try to get all of your pieces to the stained glass window in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
