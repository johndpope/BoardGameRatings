			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It happens to each of us at some point. You're on holiday in Turkey with family, on break having lunch with colleagues, or in a pub with friends, when the conversation shifts to your hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the questions start: &amp;quot;So, what's this 'roleplaying' thing that you do?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Do you dress up?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Is it some kind of computer game?&amp;quot; Time and time again, you try to explain how what tabletop roleplaying is, but each time it somehow feels that you're not doing it justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For me personally, after being in this situation on countless occasions - and failing to satisfactorily explain how roleplaying works more times than I can count - I realised that the only way to successfully explain roleplaying, is to actually take up the reigns as Game Master (GM) and run curious parties through a short session on the spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so, I created Holiday Heroes. It does not break any new ground, nor does it intend to. The rules are also not exhaustive, meaning that there will be occasions during play where you need to improvise. But this is all fine - it is likely your players won't realise (or care)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course, any group of roleplayers can enjoy Holiday Heroes as a last minute, pick up and play game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
