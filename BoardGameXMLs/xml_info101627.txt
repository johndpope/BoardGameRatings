							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie High School Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The zombies are coming! Zombies are invading Zombie High (go figure) and it's up to you to save your fellow classmates. Run, fight and outsmart the zombies while trying to save the others. Take too many wounds and you'll become a zombie - then it's feasting time on your fellow students as you try to eat their brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Frantic Game of Survival in a school invaded by zombies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;The three decks (30 zombie, 30 victim, and 60 action cards) are shuffled and each player is given a random victim. A roll of a d6 determines where the zombies come from.&lt;br/&gt;Then the torture(fun) begins.&lt;br/&gt;A victim draws one card and then takes an action of fighting zombies, fleeing from zombies, or cause another to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if your victim takes too many wound cards, your player turns into a zombie then must attack other victims or heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If everyone becomes a zombie or the zombie and victim decks are dealt out the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 30 victim and zombie cards, 18 wound cards, 60 action cards, 2 six-sided dice and rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
