			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most often quoted idiom in Middelburg (after &amp;ldquo;Oh gods, why did it have to come to this?&amp;rdquo;) is &amp;ldquo;It is not what you know in life that matter, but who you know&amp;rdquo;. Seeing the success the Merchant League have had over their century of existence, it is hard to argue with this sentence, but there is always an exception to every rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nikolas Spiros, Doctor of Runology, is such an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This character pack presents a single pre-generated character for use with The Ruined City: A Runed Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
