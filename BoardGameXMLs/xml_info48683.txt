							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Collected Book of Experimental Might</name>
									
			<description>From the Malhovac Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monte took a break from his fiction work to compile this book, a collection of the house rules he currently uses in his own games. These include a spell progression system that ranks spells from levels 1 to 20, new rules for healing and curative magic, magical disciplines for spellcasters that always give them an active power and a way to contribute, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also includes a new base class, the runeblade, for players wanting a character that combines magic and martial skill without the use of spells. New rules for wizards, clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are provided, offering each class magical disciplines like Godhammer, Eldritch Bolt, and Nature's Senses. And, of course, the book also offers dozens of new spells, feats, and magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inherent within all the rule changes in this book is the idea that characters should be able to keep adventuring longer than the rules currently allow. Disciplines, more ample healing, and the other experiments in this supplement help bring down the barriers -- like casters running out of spells and characters running low on hit points -- that traditionally make parties stop to rest before they really want to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start your own experiment now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
