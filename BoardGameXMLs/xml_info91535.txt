			<description>Pok&amp;eacute;mon Channel, released in Japan as Pok&amp;eacute;mon Channel ~Together With Pikachu!~ (ポケモンチャンネル ～ピカチュウといっしょ!～ Pok&amp;eacute;mon Channeru ~Pikachū to Issho!~, lit. &amp;quot;Pok&amp;eacute;mon Channel ~Together With Pikachu!~&amp;quot;) is a virtual pet video game for the GameCube, developed by Ambrella. Its focus is the adventures the player has with Pikachu, most of them involving a new television network. The game can be considered the spiritual sequel to Hey You, Pikachu!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Oak is developing a network that can be enjoyed by both Pok&amp;eacute;mon and their Trainers. The player has been chosen as a beta tester for the network, and is given a TV to watch the programs on. A television-loving Pikachu, seeing the TV being delivered, takes an interest in the TV and follows the Magnemite delivering it to the player's in-game house. As the network is to be enjoyed by both Pok&amp;eacute;mon and humans alike, the Pikachu becomes a beta tester as well. As the game progresses, the Pikachu grows closer to the player, and can be nicknamed early on in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the GameCube's internal clock to count real time as game time. As days progress, more channels become available, including the serial Pichu Bros. show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pokémon Channel&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
