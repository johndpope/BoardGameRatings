							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Necrotic Verses</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first in our new line of Gothic Grimoires, The Necrotic Verses presents a study in artistic horror delving into the dark side of magical music, betwixt the macabre and madness. Penned by an impresario whose creative curiosity became his undoing, The Necrotic Verses is an ideal complement to a Gothic Adventure Path or any game where the tragedy of flawed genius and the corruption of artistic creation drives men and women to ruin. Featuring a detailed history and description, The Necrotic Verses breaks open heretofore unknowable secrets to the bardic oeuvre, including 9 new bardic masterpieces from the Dance of the Empty Moons to the Opus of the Golden King, each more disturbing than the last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Jason Nelson and Clark Peterson with the Legendary Games design team of Neil Spicer, Greg A. Vaughan, Clinton J. Boomer, Matt Goodall, Jim Groves, and Russ Taylor. Who better to provide you with alternate magical books, spells, and rules for your Adventure Path campaign than the very writers of those adventures themselves? Answer: no one. Legendary Games' Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail. Legendary Games combines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this 8-page gothic-themed magical accessory and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
