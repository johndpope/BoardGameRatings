			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a skyscraper is tough, but working together might be even tougher. Skyscrappers pits players against each other, only to force them to cooperate a few floors higher. Elevate your status when others fail to be the best person at NOT knocking down a tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game for 3-8 players, players will be picking cards simultaneously and stacking them on top of a tower, hopefully keeping it standing. Players could be placing cards on their own, or they could be working with the other players to stack a single card on the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is the best at keeping the tower standing wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
