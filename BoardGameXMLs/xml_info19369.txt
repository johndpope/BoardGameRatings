			<description>Skix is a &amp;quot;6 in 1 multiple board game&amp;quot;. All six games share in common the Skix Ball Wheel, a kind of reverse spinner in which a marble is launched and spins around the outside rim of the wheel until it lands in one of the many grooves along the inside &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; of the wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game has a circular paper disk that is placed over the hub in the center of the wheel; the disk gives a value or instruction to each groove on the inside hub. A two-sided gameboard is also included for four of the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six games are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) BADLANDS: Be the first to travel from St. Louis to Houston, watching for Indians and bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) HILL CHAMP: Get to the top of the hill by following a crisscrossing path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) SPORTS CAR RACE: Race against your opponents and be the first to cross the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) TUG OF WAR: Pull the other team onto your side. Only one marker is used in this game, to determine where the center of the &amp;quot;rope&amp;quot; currently is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) SPELL-N-SCORE: This is one of two games that is played with pencil-and-paper, rather than the gameboard. Each player spins for five letters -- each with its own point value -- and attempts to make a word worth as high a score as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) CARDS (Poker, Black Jack, War): This is the other paper-and-pencil game(s). Shoot the marble to determine which cards are &amp;quot;drawn&amp;quot; for each of these games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
