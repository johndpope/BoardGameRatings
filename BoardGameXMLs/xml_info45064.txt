			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don't show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pirate Ship Blueprint presents a detailed pirate ship you can easily use in any fantasy campaign setting. You can find al the main decks floor plans plus a side view and a cross section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The uppermost level of the ship shows two castles: the fore castle and the poop deck, where is placed the wheel. The main deck features two lifeboats and the main cabins. The captain's cabin along with the first officer's one are placed just under the poop deck. The captain's cabin is by fare the bigger and more luxurious cabin of the whole ship; it features a four posters bed, a table for dinner and a desk. Under the fore castle we find the crew bedroom, the kitchen, the cookhouse, the larder and the boatswain cabin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going further down we find the main hold level. In this hold are store the common tools of the ships such as sails, ropes, anchors, wood for repairing and a small workroom. Under this level there is the bilge, which usually is used for storage of food, wine and spirits and the like. The captain usually keeps the keys to this deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
