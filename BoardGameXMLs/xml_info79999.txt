			<description>Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War is a 1998 space combat simulation IBM PC compatible computer game developed by Volition, Inc. when it was split off from Parallax Software. Published by Interplay Entertainment, it is also known as Conflict: FreeSpace - The Great War in Europe. In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace - The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story places the player in the role of a human pilot in the Galactic Terran Alliance, as it engages in war with the alien Parliamentary Vasudan Empire. This war is interrupted by the appearance of the enigmatic and militant Shivans, who begin slaughtering Terrans and Vasudans alike. Putting aside their differences, the Terrans and Vasudans form an alliance, and the player is assigned to missions to stop the Shivans' genocidal advance. The player pilots a starfighter, and alongside competent AI wingmen, completes these missions to determine the fate of two races. Important battles in the story feature capital ships, which dwarf the fighters piloted by the player, and explode spectacularly on destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Descent: FreeSpace - The Great War , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
