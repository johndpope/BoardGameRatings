			<description>Italian cycling game. The board is divided in two halves, one of which is common and the other is different for each stage. You can run several Giro stages or a Milan-San Remo. Every player chooses his favorite cyclist that's available, each with his own individual features. Some of the options are Fausto Coppi, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault or Miguel Indurain. The game does not use a dice but instead an energy-keeping table and some chance cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
