							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Around the Farm</name>
									
			<description>Based on Eric Carle's best-selling book, players spend a fun-filled day Around the Farm helping baby animals find their way home. Help baby pigs locate the pigpen, baby ducks waddle to the pond, baby horses trot to the hayfield, and baby sheep back to their pasture. The game introduces children to counting and identifying baby and adult animals. Counting is especially fun as the players make animal sounds for each animal they move. Everyone wins in this cooperative game when each baby animal has been reunited with its adult animal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
