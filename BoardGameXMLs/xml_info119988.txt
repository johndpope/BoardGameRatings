			<description>A party game that tests your guests' trivia knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a score-card, to record their answers. On the left of the card their are categories and alongside that there are 5 blank boxes. Between these two things (the category and the answer boxes) is the word 'Swaffield', going from top to bottom. D. E. Swaffield was the founder of the publisher. He designed some of its games and wrote some of the books that it published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swaffield has 9 letters in its name and when written vertically, it provides the initial letter required to answer the category correctly. For example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first category is 'Names of noted men who have written books' and the first letter is an S (as in Swaffield). The second category is 'Things in or one the sea' and these must begin with W, the second letter of Swaffield. And so on down to the last category called 'Counties in England and Wales' which will need the initial letter of D (the last letter in the word Swaffield).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to write down five things that are indicated by the category and all five must begin with the associated letter. The host should set a time limit and the winner is the guest with the most valid answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
