			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting Falcon II had the tagline &amp;quot;the battle continues&amp;quot; and so it did. Virgin Games released this sequel a year after the first and it's not difficult to see why they didn't need that much time to build it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;This game too focusses 100% on the action, so no storyline, no campaign, just plain shooting. The left side of the map is still stitched to the right side, so since this is a scolling game, if you either fly left or right, eventually you'll reach your point of departure. &lt;br/&gt;The landscape resembles that of part I, with two slight differences: pyramids are added, pinpointing the game to Egypt, and your former city landscape now lays in ruins, suggesting this being the result of the part I bombings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, you'll have to fight helicopters, which are a lot more unpredictable in their flight behaviour than the jets of part I, due to their hoover capabilities. There are 3 sorts or helicopters:&lt;br/&gt;- attack helicopters that come after you,&lt;br/&gt;- unarmed transport helicopters that'll drop AAA guns and radar jammers randomly on the map and&lt;br/&gt;- support helicopters, that accompagny the transports.&lt;br/&gt;The flying and handling of your Harrier is exactly the same as in part I, with the addition of now being able to shoot diagonally, not only horizontally. This gives you the ability to shoot the AAA, radar jammers and low flying (or landed) helicopters, but it adds the risk of friendly fire by shooting (part of) one of your airbases in the heat of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
