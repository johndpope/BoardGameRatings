			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Restore a devastated tropical island by collecting resources and magical artifacts in match-3 game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a match-3 game, you move one tile at a time in a field of tiles to match 3 or more tiles, eliminating those tiles from the grid and scoring them. Paradise Quest spices up the standard match-3 gameplay with a moving field that is larger than the screen area; as you match tiles, you must in the direction of your last match. Paradise Quest also features powerups that you can use for special effects, like using Lightning to clear a 3x3 block of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes wifi/Bluetooth competitive or cooperative play. However, when playing cooperatively only the host of the game advances in the story mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
