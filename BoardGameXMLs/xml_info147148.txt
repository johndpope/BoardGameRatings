							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Book of Miscellaneous Spells</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement started life on June 19, 2011 as a spell posted in the Workshop Thread on the Dragonsfoot Forums. The first spell posted was Lighten Load (not my best work, but I've included it from a sense of sentimentality). I would probably never have taken the next step, pulling together a compilation, if winemaker81 (Bryan) hadn't put the concept in front of me. In many ways, he deserves a lot, if not most, of the credit for this. I had no idea at that time that a single spell was going to lead to the crafting of over 150 spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I tinkered with spell design, I got caught up in a few other projects, some of which led to the creation of new spells (such as the Juiblexian spells, the spells of the Thorn Queen, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not everything here has previously seen print or an audience; while a compilation is useful, I personally find that they lack the cachet that new work has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
