							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Children of Leviathan</name>
									
			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is set along the high southern coast of the Republic of Altheria, and deals with the brazen theft of the annual shipment of blastpowder destined for Naeraanth in the Kingdom of Milandir. The culprits are a mysterious conclave of degenerate pirates who worship a primal godlet called simply Leviathan, a heretical version of Yarris as Dark Master of the Depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For uncounted years, ships traversing the vaunted rocky coast of the Altherian headland have been plagued by many hazards. Unpredictable currents beset passing vessels, along with uncharted jungle islets, craggy reefs, and chaotic torrential weather that follows no set pattern. Rarely there are great aquatic beasts and piracy, but the small fleet of the Altherian Patrol along with Altherian gunships that safeguard passage through the Sea of Yarris fend off regular attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, one stretch of the Altherian coast in particular has always remained obscure and not yet fully explored - the Milguldihar Straits, giving the Patrol its fair share of troubles and surprises. Lying along Altheria&amp;rsquo;s southern border, this cliff-lined coast drops steadily in altitude as it ventures west, culminating in the Bay of Spines. The Straits are also entrenched behind the Ophidian Isles - a wall of interlocked archipelagoes covered in gnarled jungle forest and steaming mangrove marshes. To make matters worse, cold fronts rolling off the high Altherian plateau collide with the humid Bay of Spines, forming vast, long-lived fog banks that stretch for leagues. It is here that the most dreaded of sea reavers dwell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
