							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Life of the Party</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are hired by Gisbert Handel, a local guildmaster and former apothecary, to provide security at a party he is hosting at his estate. When they arrive, they find Handel is the head of the new Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Guild, which is meeting with resistance from a number of prominent citizens. As the party begins, Handel has the doors locked and announces that as a showcase of his Guild&amp;rsquo;s skill, a pre-determined guest will be murdered by midnight. It is therefore the job of the player characters to prevent it from happening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
