							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feats of Runic Might II</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runes are an ancient form of writing often linked to strange and magical powers. In history, runes are nearly two-thousand-year-old alphabets whose origins remain shrouded in mystery. In legend, wizards, shamans, and warriors use runes to imbue the places, items, and people on which they are inscribed with fantastic powers. Some say runes hold the power to foretell the future and even bring the dead back to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Genius Guide to Feats of Runic Might, Super Genius Games presented runes that took the form of magic powers for any character class and set them up so that you could add them easily to any campaign. The idea proved popular enough for us to produce this follow-up product, which provides new Runic feats that follow our first book's lead, as well as gives you new options in the form of Runebound feats. A subcategory of the rune feat, Runebound feats represent runes that a character has tied directly to his own life energy, and this allows him to use several of these feats simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this book works well with The Genius Guide to Feats of Runic Might, the two products are completely independent. All the rules needed for each are presented in their entirety in their respective volumes, and the one feat that any rune-drafter might crave (Rune Mastery) is reprinted here to ensure that those who have only The Genius Guide to Feats of Runic Might II: Runebinding aren't missing anything crucial to maximize this product. Every other feat we present here is new. They are fully compatible with those found in The Genius Guide to Feats of Runic Might, but they also stand alone as a complete set of new options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
