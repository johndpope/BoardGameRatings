							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baltur</name>
									
			<description>From deity &amp;quot;Description:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The god Baltur is depicted as a tall, muscular man, generally human, wearing golden full plate armor. He bears a shield emblazoned with the Balturic Cross and wields a finely crafted longsword known as Calhidorn. Baltur is the epitome of the heroic warrior, dedicated to truth, justice, and righteousness. His priests, a primarily martial order known as the Swords of Baltur, are dauntless crusaders, constantly striving to combat the evils and injustices of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The home of Baltur and his deceased followers is the Crystal City of Elysium on the outskirts of Vigilis. Baltur&amp;rsquo;s domain is a large kingdom surrounding a great citadel known as Caerbannic. Caerbannic is said to be home to &amp;ldquo;seven hundred times seven hundred&amp;rdquo; paladins, whom Baltur will lead against the city of Dis in a great, future battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
