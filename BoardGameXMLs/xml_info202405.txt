							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Comic Book Vigilante Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the Hero Your Game Deserves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vigilante from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Intrigue offers you the chance to play the sort of hero usually found only in comic books, and, in fact, many of the archetypes for the vigilante seem to be direct references to famous heroes from comic books. But while the existing options allow you to access a wide variety of power sets of existing super heroes, there are some major gaps in the vigilante&amp;rsquo;s offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents three new archetypes for vigilantes, each patterned off of one or more famous comic book superheroes. Astound friends and foes alike with masterful feats of archery and access to a wide variety of special trick arrows as an arrow of justice, including arrows that release sleeping gas, arrows that explode with fire, and arrows that release entangling goo! Run circles around your foes as a blitz, a high-speed archetype that lets you move faster than the eye can see, dash across the battlefield in the middle of a full-attack action, and push allies out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way as an immediate action. Finally, prove that justice is blind as a devil&amp;rsquo;s eye, gaining the ability to turn off your sight and hearing in order to gain incredible superhuman senses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
