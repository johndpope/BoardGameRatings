							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hexplora</name>
									
			<description>All players arrive to the Hexplora Isle named such a way because it has a hexagonal shape and is divided into hexagons.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts exploration of the isle collecting resources to manufacture new things and help their community progress.&lt;br/&gt;You can also attack other communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to create a &amp;quot;Municipium&amp;quot; to collect all founded gold.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who collect 36 pieces of gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was inspired playing Catan's Settlers, but the way the map is composed is completely different (even if it is based on hexagon too).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some rules should be tuned but the game mechanic is already defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information contact the author (dexhm2@hotmail.com)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
