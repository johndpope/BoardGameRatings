							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Poltergeist</name>
									
			<description>Totem unit for the Neverborn, specific to Pandora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;The Poltergeist is a totem specific to Pandora that is often overlooked for other options. It does bring a few tricks to the table though that make it worth considering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobility&lt;br/&gt;With a movement that some would call on the lower side of average the Poltergeist can have a hard time keeping up with Pandora once she begins her train of effects. It should be able to keep up with most other models okay though, or at the very least have little issue getting into a useful position when thought out a turn or two ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offense&lt;br/&gt;With no range attack some would quickly overlook the capabilities of this model, but it has a rather good severe damage for close combat. It's strength lies more so in the distraction abilities it brings to the table, however, in that it can make enemy models slow (and your own as well do not forget) and a few other shenanigans that suit a Pandora list quite well. Magical extension lets you use one of Pandora's spells another time each turn, and who doesn't want to cast Self-Loathing or Project Emotions another time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resilience&lt;br/&gt;This model is short and so can hide easily. It has a high defense, but low wounds, so can die fairly easily if the opponent focuses on it. Spirit will help reduce the damage too, though, so the model can be quite survivable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magical Extension&lt;br/&gt;Remember that any enemy model failing a WP duel within range of Pandora takes a wound, so casting spells that keep this going or give an opposing model negative flips while freeing up Pandora herself for other actions is always a plus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;br/&gt;One trick with this totem is to use its Persistent Distraction spell while your own models are clustered near it to force your opponent to activate and use all of his models before you use any more of yours effectively out activating their entire crew with all of yours. This can be very situational and is probably not a good idea later in the game as you can leave yourself very exposed to attack, but can give you an early game advantage to seeing what your opponent has planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Magical Extension to cast Project Emotions and give enemy models a negative flip can help out several of the models often found in a Pandora crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
