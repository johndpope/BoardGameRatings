			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Temple of the Frog, the latest version of the oldest published fantasy adventure. For 30 years, adventurers have lived in awe and fear of this mythical dungeon deep within the forbidding waters of the Great Dismal Swamp. Now, you have the opportunity to do the same. This product provides you with not only information on the Temple itself, but also on the small swamp town of Boggy Bottom, where the player characters can base their forays against the vicious Cult of the Frog. In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of new magic items, technology, and monsters, all of which will help make this adventure one that players and Game Masters alike should long remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This chapter has several sections, all designed to aid the DM in running the adventure. The first is an overview of the Cult of Brr&amp;rsquo;bb&amp;rsquo;t, more popularly known as the Cult of the Frog, and its nefarious plans. The second is a discussion of the Travelers, an enigmatic group of beings whose actions have been subtly influencing events in the North for some time. Next is a brief overview of ways to involve the PCs, providing the DM with several different ways that he could get the PCs involved. Finally, there is an extended description of Boggy Bottom and its inhabitants, as well as several events that can be used therein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
