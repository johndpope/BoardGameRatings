			<description>States Game is an educational dice game that teaches math skills and U.S. States. It is played with four six-sided dice, with the number one replaced by an outline of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;States are numbered 1 to 50 based on their date of entry into the union. Each player picks a state, and then each player picks one state for each other player. In turn, players roll four dice, declaring which of their assigned states they're aiming for before they roll. Any United States pictures rolled are wild, and may be used as any number from 1 to 6. The player who rolled must then use any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to achieve the target state's number. If the player is successful, he or she earns a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number or rounds is equal to the number of players, and players may not try for a state they've already scored. After each player has taken all his or her turns, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the game is tied, all non-tied players choose a state. Each tied player has one roll to get the state's number. This continues until one player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
