							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cities of Gold</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold will buy your freedom. Forget the cheap credos of false gods and foolish brawlers; they cling to ideals while their children starve. Whatever you desire, we can make real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold will buy your strength. Forget the petty threats of pauper magicians and idiot militia; their lifeblood flows through our coffers, and we sell the spears they shake. Whoever you detest, we can crush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold will buy your service. Forget the broken fallacies of selfless honour and noble intent; one man built this empire, and rules it with a fist of gilded iron. Whatever he decrees, we will do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cities of Gold tower over the fallen nations of the past&amp;hellip; and soon will tower over the fallen Corporations of the present. For in the end, we will buy them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, Agent, to Eurasian Incorporated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hoards of background information on the most ruthless, greedy and inhuman corporation ever to grace the Earth&lt;br/&gt;     New sects and perhaps the most obscene Rank bonuses in the corporate world&lt;br/&gt;     Stacks of new items including luxury goods, banned and restricted weapons and Anti-Plasma Core Armour&lt;br/&gt;     More information on running and expanding your own businesses&lt;br/&gt;     More cybernetics and how corporate culture views augmentation&lt;br/&gt;     Teleportation technology and new luxury vehicles&lt;br/&gt;     Medical procedures and the healthcare system&lt;br/&gt;     E.I.'s upper echelons including staff, management and methodology &lt;br/&gt;     New NPCs and locations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
