			<description>Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em is a pornographic video game developed for the Atari 2600 by Mystique. It was released in 1982. Although the game sold poorly upon release, its graphic nature has earned it a cult following and much infamy. It is often referenced as one of the worst video games ever made, a distinction it shares with other Mystique titles, like Custer's Revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the player controls a pair of nude women who scuttle back and forth underneath a building where a man with a notably large penis is constantly masturbating  from the roof top. The player's objective is to maneuver these women so that they consume the man's semen (which is colored yellow in the game) before it hits the ground. When all the semen is caught, the two women turn to the screen and lick their lips. These game-play mechanics closely mimic those of a large group of games (e.g. Kaboom!) in which the object is to catch objects thrown by an ever-faster moving character. A score of 69 points, and every 69 points thereafter (138, 207, 276, etc.) earns an extra life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beat 'Em &amp;amp; Eat 'Em,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
