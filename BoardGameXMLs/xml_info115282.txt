			<description>&amp;quot;Robots live up in the clouds. Sometimes they might miss a step and accidentally fall down from the sky. The player's goal is to rescue as many robots as possible and help them fly back home. Just tap a robot to open its parachute, then drag and launch it back out into the sky. Tap on a robot quickly to get an extra bonus points. But be careful not to let them collide with each other and make sure to keep their parachute safe from tear. You can also drag the robots to POWERIZONA for better speed and an even higher score.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
