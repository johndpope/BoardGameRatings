			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Past!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Low-Tech covers the basic tools used by historical adventurers from the Stone Age to the Age of Sail &amp;ndash; and still used by modern survivalists and post-apocalypse survivors when the high-tech toys fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons and armor from antlers and rawhide to warhammers and heavy mail; adventure and travel gear from simple stone knives to early submarines; everyday items and tools of every trade. Low-Tech starts with the basics that suit any setting . . . and adds lots of culturally specialized inventions to support your campaign's particular flavor. For game masters, the discussions of past technologies &amp;ndash; based on up-to-date historical and archaeological research &amp;ndash; will be valuable no matter what system is used. For GURPS players, this book also covers the skills and traits that let adventurers make the best use of their equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether the heroes are cavemen taking their first steps toward civilization, pirates on the Seven Seas, or anything in between, GURPS Low-Tech has the technology they need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Low-Tech replaces GURPS Low-Tech for Third Edition, the TL4 parts of GURPS High-Tech for Third Edition, and the rules for equipment from many historical sourcebooks for Third Edition, from the TL0 tools in GURPS Dinosaurs to to the TL4 gear in GURPS Swashbucklers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
