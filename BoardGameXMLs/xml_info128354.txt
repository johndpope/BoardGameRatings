			<description>Paths of Destiny takes players into the world of fantasy arena. In this turn based strategy game two players will command a team of 5 Pathwalkers, selected from a lineup of 8 different Pathwalkers with individual unique abilities and pit their tactical skills against one another in an intense battle of life and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns to maneuver their Pathwalkers on a hexagonal grid, and using cards that represent different body parts, players will engage in a game of chance and guesswork that simulates the exchanging of blows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points by injuring their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Pathwalkers, incapacitating their body parts and rendering them unconscious. The player that scores 20 points first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
