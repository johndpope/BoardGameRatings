			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;Death Is in the Cards&lt;br/&gt;The remnants of the Ebon Fold are cutting a deadly path through the Falkovian countryside, draining travelers of their life force and leaving withered corpses in their wake. Hot on their trail, you come across the sole survivor of one of these deadly attacks, a young vistani man with an extraordinary skills for fortune-telling. His tarokka deck helps close the gap between you and the assassins. Together you follow the trail through Darkon, the dark domain of the lich lord Azalin, to city of Nartok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With an Unholy Alliance&lt;br/&gt;Something very strange is happening in Nartok. The killers enter the Temple the Eternal Order and don't come out. It seems that the state religion of Darkon is giving succor to these assassins. To make matters more confusing, the Kargat, the domain's secret police, has put aside its feud with the Eternal Order and has a large contingent staying at the temple as well. These three organizations working together bodes ill for the residents of Nartok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...And Schemes Within Infernal Schemes&lt;br/&gt;Great amount of life energy are being collected for some foul purpose, although no one seems to know what exactly it is. The tarokka cards provide only mysterious glimpses of the future--a future in which a powerful evil sweeps the land and Death walks the world. Can you discover the truth of what is happening in the temple in time to avert the disaster predicted by the cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Ascendant is a full-length adventure that can be run as a stand-alone scenario or as the second part in the Grim Harvest series. It contains a 64-page adventure booklet plus a full-color poster map detailing the Temple of the Eternal Order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For three to six characters of levels 6-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
