			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fracas is a relatively straightforward dungeon crawler.  The character is represented by a small colored square and can move around a basic map shown in a top-down view.  Monsters are encountered and can be defeated to yield treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published as BASIC source code; players were encouraged to modify the game to suite their taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fantastic adventure game like no other!  Up to eight players can participate in FRACAS at the same time.  Journey in the land of FAROPH, searching for hidden treasure while warding off all sorts of unfriendly and dangerous creatures.  You and your friends can compete with each other or you can join forces and gang up on the monsters.  Your location is presented graphically and sound effects enliven the battles.  Save your adventures on diskette or cassette and continue it at some other time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
