			<description>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1 is the enhanced remake of the game for the PlayStation Vita, developed by Felistella. In addition to completely reworked visuals, improved framerate performance, new music and voice acting, various gameplay aspects and plot details have been modified. A new feature dubbed the &amp;quot;remake system&amp;quot; unlocks special game modifications such as new dungeons and in-battle perks. Some characters from the original game were removed, such as Gust, Nisa, 5pb and Red, whilst new characters were added, including the CPU candidates and a series of characters representing game developer companies; Plutia and Peashy from Hyperdimension Neptunia V, in addition to Histoire, are playable as DLC characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original continent travel system involving dungeons has been scrapped in favour of a world map system similar to that of Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2, and the dungeon and battle systems also based on a style reminiscent to that of Hyperdimension Neptunia V. During the development phase, the enhanced Vita version was intended to fill in what were identified as flaws and shortcomings of the original game. Developers aimed to address the concerns of fans, and features of the earlier PS3 version that were often subject to criticism, such as the music and game performance, were given improvements in the new version. The game's theme song is Miracle Portable Mission by nao and the ending song is Mirai Button by Afilia Saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A western localization published by Idea Factory International was released on August 26, 2014 in North America, while the European version came out the following day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hyperdimension Neptunia&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
