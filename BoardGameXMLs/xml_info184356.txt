							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toast of the Town</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The town looks peaceful enough, but there's a pillar of smoke from last night's fire, burned corpses from the wreckage, and a demon strung up against the church in the market square. Dolemon Drake, a local hero, gives the call to all brave souls to join him in eradicating the devilish creatures infesting the sewers. Will our heroes join in Drake's noble fight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toast of the Town is an adventure module for Risus: The Anything RPG in traditional-fantasy mode, designed for a single session of play. Toast of the Town runs well for as many as six Player Characters and a Game Master, but works best with small groups (2-4 PCs), or as a one-on-one adventure with a single Player CHaracter. Toast plays well with nearly any power-level: maxed-out clich&amp;eacute;s and magic toys will have their uses, but won't erase any of the adventure's core challenges, which are social, ethical, moral and logistical. The adventure's core delights are those of character interaction, environment-exploration, and creative problem-solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure's tone leans towards the pulpy and heroic. There is a villain with victims, and the PCs should be the sort motivated by a desire to help innocents in need. Purely mercenary delvers might be tempted by the potential for secondary rewards, or driven by curiosity, but the adventure's immediacy depends on a streak of empathy in the group, even if they tuck it under the surface in that scoundrel-with-a-heart-of-gold way. Toast of the Town is not specifically comedic; it's swashbuckly, where comedy elements will emerge from the eccentricity of the townsfolk or the general madness of Player Characters. The basic situation is, honestly, a bit grim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The events of Toast of the Town stand alone, but also provide the foundation for the Saint August series of modules, each set within reach of the same town, and the same mountain lake. These modules may be enjoyed independently, or linked to provide a campaign foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
