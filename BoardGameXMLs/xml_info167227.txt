							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Antipodist: Radiant Shadowsage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interjection Game's 12th base class, the antipodist is a full caster base class that specializes in the use of diametrically opposing forces, light and darkness, as two sides of the same coin. Fueled by a radiance pool and a shadow pool, the antipodist must carefully balance her expenditure of magic in each of these two halves, lest she lose access to half of her tricks halfway through the day. Those antipodists who scoff at such balancing acts can act contrary to their colleagues (thus becoming antipodists for a totally different reason!) and choose to throw their lot in with light or darkness, to the exclusion of the other side of the coin, thus ensuring that all of her power is concentrated in a single pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be a fun and fairly simple spellcasting experience, perfect for first-time spellcasters, but refreshingly different for veterans, the antipodist's design is predicated on fun combos, the ability to create wildly different characters based on limited spell selection, and some of the most wickedly difficult advancement decisions ever found in an Interjection Games product. Though no single advancement choice will cripple a character, every choice is tracked by the class itself, spitting out different opportunities and passive bonuses based on the road the antipodist has chosen to take. To get the full experience of this class, starting at level 1 and moving on up is recommended. As any wanderer will tell you, it's not the destination that matters. It's the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Antipodist&lt;br/&gt;    135 loci in 9 philosophies&lt;br/&gt;    3 new feats&lt;br/&gt;    A guide to roleplaying dramatic shifts in philosophical alignment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
