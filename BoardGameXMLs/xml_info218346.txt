							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">On Wild Lands and Wild Folk</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too long have pen-and-paper gamers gone without a worthy Nordic home wherein they may braid their beards (where applicable), sharpen their axes, and raise their horns to god-oath and ring-hoard. Too long have brave and lusty RPG&amp;rsquo;ers yearned without hope for a snow-hardened hall-land of gods and heroes, where bravery is measured in bloody deeds, and greatness immortalized in fame-song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So do we venture into the remote Wilds of Jorikk, a vast wilderness of towering mountains, buckling glaciers, endless seas and sweeping boreal forests. A dark land, cold and unforgiving, stirred up from the deep currents of the Old Norse. A place of trolls, dragons, sea-serpents, blood-feuds, ring-hoards, fierce gods, and indomitable wills expressed in lonely places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a place of desperate heroism and grim tales lost to time. The perfect canvas upon which to carve an epic campaign of pen-and-paper gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What remains is for us to go there and live out the tales and legends. Roam wide through the boreal, hunting elk for meat and wolf for fur. Feast with proud men in timbered halls by the lakeshore, and oar out upon the mist-covered waters, raising sword and spear alongside powerful warriors, chanting battle-song as the shield-wall clamors for slaughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages you&amp;rsquo;ll find what you need to begin such a journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an RPG campaign setting, this grim landscape provides a Nordic home all but limitless in its scope and possibility. While integrally part of the greater HackMaster world of Tellene, the remote expanse of the Lake Jorakk Wilderness makes it possible to run a purely Nordic story with whatever Tabletop Fantasy RPG system you might like to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
