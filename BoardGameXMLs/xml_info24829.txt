			<description>Wise Guys is a collection of 10 spelling games that utilize the same board and letter tiles.  The letters are divided into three groups: Blue tiles (vowels-A,E,I,O), Green tiles (common consonants &amp;amp; &amp;quot;U&amp;quot;), and Pink tiles (less common consonants &amp;amp; wild &amp;quot;infinity&amp;quot; tiles).  Certain spaces on the board have a color &amp;amp; symbol that might affect scoring or word placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the games are simple and suitable for young spellers, while other games are more complex.  The winning condition for most games is either (1) to score more points than opponents or (2) to use more letter tiles than opponents.  Players face their own letters in the upright position based on their seat at the table, and, in most games, your letters cannot contact opponents' words.  When scoring is based on points, the letter value is based on its color -- one point for blue, two for green and three for pink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
