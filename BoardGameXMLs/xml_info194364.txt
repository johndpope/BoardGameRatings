			<description>Is it really there.. and can you find it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is similar to Dobble in that there is a set of cards (of different shapes) with symbols, words and shapes on them. The difference is that there is a second set of cards which have descriptions of objects on them:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Something that has a tail&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against the timer each player has to determine if there is an item that matches the description or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make things even more complicated there are also 2 dice which determine which shaped cards you are using in the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
