			<description>Sea Ranger is a new type of game, where learning is entertaining and family fun.  The world's oceans our are largest single resource.  If they are abused, mis-managed or ignored; we on land will be worse off for our neglect of this wonderful planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Ranger can teach or remind us all of our place in this world; how we use the oceans and waterways; the balance of life and our needs; raise our awareness of how mankind neglects or abuses these incredible places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within, on and around our oceans and rivers, hide a multitude of life, living in a state of balance, growing and evolving.  Mankind is upsetting this balance to dangerous levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn, have fun with friends and family, share this knowledge and make a difference in this world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Sea Ranger?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Ranger is a board game designed to educate and entertain 2-6 players about the amazing and diverse wildlife that inhabits the oceans and waterways creating a giant circle of life.  We can also learn how mankind uses and abuses this incredible resource we all share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Ranger is a multi-facetted game.  Not only are the players learning about the aquatic environment, they are also learning about themselves.  Players learn many qualities of character that are required to either win or prevent collective loss among the players.  They share the responsibilities, successes and benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players learn:;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To share and care for resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collective and individual responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To maintain a balance of life and needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Value life in all forms as part of the wealth of this world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Respect each players participation and support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best part is that it is fun doing this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Can Play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is aimed at children from 8 years and over and adults.  Children will require guidance to assemble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children quickly master the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how does it all work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game gives players knowledge and choices.  Players can easily discern what feels right or is the right thing to do.  We all know within our hearts what is right and good, even if we don't know the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a special board and tokens.  You print out the board and pieces on your colour printer, then cut and assemble the components.  To make them last longer or be more durable you may mount them on card or laminate the pieces.  Teach the children skills as they read instructions and learn to cut out the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is directed by a special card deck which will present players with a series of events and choices.  The players must decide how they will resolve these, sometimes this may require teamwork and sharing.  There are many different strategies you can use to win, some can be very quick, others slower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the game revolves around maintaining the circle of life, ensuring a balance of species to enable life to continue.  Each creature is part of that circle and has a unique role to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must then try and balance mankind's intervention and damage to the seas and waterways.  It is a careful juggling act; players individually cannot hope to keep the balance so you need to play cooperatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Do I Get?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Ranger is 26-page colour PDF plus a small rules booklet.   The game requires you to print 16-pages to create the board, cards &amp;amp; tokens.  Included is the deluxe card set giving you the choice of finish.  Where possible we have tried to minimise the graphical content to save ink.  Ideally the major components are printed on card.  Some simple assembly is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Edutainment Games, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.edutainment-games.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.edutainment-games.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
