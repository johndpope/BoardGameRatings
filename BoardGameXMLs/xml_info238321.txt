			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calling All Explorers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a college student going to the movies, a brainwashed superninja, or off to explore known worlds for JumpCorp&amp;mdash;savage settings need intrepid explorers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Worlds of Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Worlds Explorer is a continuing series featuring Savage Tales from all our settings written by new authors and industry veterans. This installment features tales by Matthew Cutter, Ed Wetterman, Terry Whisenant, and an artist spotlight on Aaron Riley!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East Texas University: Movie Night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beloved film The Wizard of Oz was the first ever shown in the theater and now it is back for the grand reopening. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love Dorothy, Toto, Tin Man, Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion? What a great date night for a few college students&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powers Companion: The Black Claw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Claw wants to brainwash supers to turn them into SUPERNINJAS! Well, who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to do that? In the guise of Yakuza mobsters, they have infiltrated the heroes&amp;rsquo; city because of the concentration of supers there. The gang war is just the front page of the cover story&amp;mdash;a convenient way to draw supers out where they can be targeted by the Black Claw!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Parsec: Savage Tales of the Red Band (Part II)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Tales of the Red Band by Brand Manager Matthew Cutter is an ongoing serial for The Last Parsec, the parts of which can be assembled to form a loose Plot Point Campaign. This is part two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the early exploration of the Known Worlds, JumpCorp survey teams color-coded bands of expansion. For several decades, the &amp;ldquo;red band&amp;rdquo; proved the most dangerous&amp;mdash;and the most profitable. Eventually, several of these trailblazing charters joined together to form the &amp;ldquo;Red Band Conglomerate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Band is so large it defies any simple description, much like JumpCorp itself. Its charters participate in everything from galactic defense to the usual gamut of exploration, shipping, and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artist Spotlight: Aaron Riley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short interview and beautiful art by one of our favorite artists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
