			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you want to know the odds of her using that blaster on you? It&amp;rsquo;s high. It&amp;rsquo;s very high.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;   &amp;ndash;K-2SO, Rogue One&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If anything defines the Star Wars saga more than the lightsaber duels, blaster firefights, and epic space battles, it&amp;rsquo;s the friendships that emerge out of hardship and necessity. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi looking for a smuggler to take them offworld or ex-convict Jyn Erso forced to work with a ragtag group of Rebels, outcasts, and Imperial defectors, these alliances can determine the fate of the entire galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within Allies of Necessity and the new Alliances cycle for Star Wars: The Card Game, you gain plenty of incentives to bring multiple affiliations together. While multi-affiliation decks have always been a possibility, Allies of Necessity offers more tools to help you than ever before&amp;mdash;starting with new affiliation cards, which offer new deckbuilding requirements and special abilities. What&amp;rsquo;s more, you&amp;rsquo;ll find iconic characters from Rogue One, Star Wars Rebels, and the Darth Vader comics throughout the cycle: in fact, this first Force Pack includes Doctor Aphra, Director Krennic, Captain Cassian Andor, and Jyn Erso.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With eight new objective sets (two copies each of four distinct sets), and twelve brand-new affiliation cards (two for each affiliation), Allies of Necessity promises to change your games like never before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
