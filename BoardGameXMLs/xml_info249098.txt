							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: The Materials Edition</name>
									
			<description>Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Monopoly: The Materials Edition was developed by PhD students from the Advanced Metallic Systems Centre for Doctoral Training. The students developed the game as part of a public engagement project which aims to raise awareness of materials science and engineering and engage people with the world of metallurgy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rear of the box:&lt;br/&gt;The game is played just like traditional Monopoly but instead of purchasing property, players buy different materials as they travel around the board. Materials including metals, ceramics, polymers and composites all feature in the game. Investing in research and development enables you to buy labs and research centres to upgrade your material to a more advanced technology, for example turning steel from paperclips into skyscrapers!&lt;br/&gt;The property cards provide a brief description of the technology. Those with red backs are aimed at upper GCSE and A-Level students and the blue cards use simpler language for younger students (~KS3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPERTIES&lt;br/&gt;BROWN (naturals)&lt;br/&gt;Wood / Rubber&lt;br/&gt;LIGHT BLUE (polymers)&lt;br/&gt;Thermoplastic / Thermoset / Biodegradable&lt;br/&gt;PINK (ceramics)&lt;br/&gt;Chalk / Clay / Sand&lt;br/&gt;ORANGE (Steels)&lt;br/&gt;Plain Carbon / Stainless / Speciality&lt;br/&gt;RED (Light Metals)&lt;br/&gt;Aluminium / Magnesium / Titanium&lt;br/&gt;YELLOW (base Metals)&lt;br/&gt;Zinc / Copper / Nickel&lt;br/&gt;GREEN (composites)&lt;br/&gt;Ceramic / Polymer / Metal Matrix&lt;br/&gt;DARK BLUE (premium)&lt;br/&gt;Uranium / Platinum&lt;br/&gt;STATIONS&lt;br/&gt;Recycling Station / Manufacturing Station / Processing Station / Extraction Station&lt;br/&gt;UTILITIES&lt;br/&gt;Water Works / Electricity Company&lt;br/&gt;TAXES&lt;br/&gt;Income Tax / Super Tax&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
