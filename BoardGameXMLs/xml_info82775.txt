			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes 2 is a multiplayer online FPS game, with no single-player mode beyond a basic tutorial.  It is a sequel to Starsiege: Tribes, and expands upon the original's gameplay.  A variety of game modes are present, including Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, and the newly added Rabbit-Chase.  Tribes 2 is also highly customizable, allowing for player-made mods and maps to be created.  Many mods could be played without any additional download, and some became popular enough to have their own large communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most games are played in teams where players can use stations to change their equipment loadout between different armor sizes and change their armament at any time.  A variety of vehicles including tanks and bombers are also available, with several requiring teamwork to be useful.  Levels features wide, open landscapes and players have a constantly recharging jetpack allowing them to fly around the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In late 2008, the authentication servers for the game were shut down.  However, a fan-made alternative sprung up in early 2009 called Tribes Next, allowing for online play once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
