			<description>Author's decription&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cavalry's coming. Not today, necessarily, nor tomorrow -- but eventually, they'll be here, because the settlers are here -- and so is your tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I mean, in a sense, it's not really your tribe, because you're really just an outsider who decided to join them after some dramatic event in your life. Oh, sure, they didn't trust you at first, but after you proved yourself, they were happy enough to allow you into their homes, and you've become an invaluable asset -- a leader, even, when dealing with the hated outsiders trying to drive them away. It's up to you (and any other Caucasians who might have accidentally joined the tribe) to lead the braves to victory against their blue-coated nemeses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
