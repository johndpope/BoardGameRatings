			<description>Each of the players represents a Nuclear Power.  The aim of the game is to maintain world peace and avoid nuclear war.  An &amp;quot;Arms Spiral&amp;quot; is in the middle of the board, representing the arms race.  When the &amp;quot;BOMB&amp;quot; arrives at the end of the Arms Spiral, world peace is over and everyone has lost!  However, if all players work together in such a way that one reaches the &amp;quot;World Peace&amp;quot; space, then the arms race is over.  All players have won and the one who has contributed the most to maintaining world peace is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prevent destruction each player must simultaneously pursue his own goals as well co-operate with the other players to maintain peace.  Each one can pursue his personal selfish goal to come to a victory, but this promotes the arms race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American version of this game is called Star Peace: Anti Nuclear War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
