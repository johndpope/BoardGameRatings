							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coyote Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;You are a cunning spirit. The end times have come for your kind.&lt;br/&gt;If you survive the struggle, it will also be a time of rebirth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coyote is an eternal trickster spirit known throughout the world under many names. At times helpful and other times cruel, always creative and deceitful, Coyote is best known for giving fire to humans. Coyote's existence is cyclical, waxing and waning, splintering and reforming through the ages. His chaotic nature eventually rips him apart and turns his rival parts against himself. The sundering continues to weaken the various Coyote splinters until the edge of extinction yields a desperate strength to rejoin once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and the other players are Coyote spirits seeking to stave off destruction. Together, you must follow the call of the original Coyote skull. Once you retrieve it, you must merge to form a renewed Coyote. In addition to battling each other for dominance, you are opposed by Lantern, the avatar of the god of light and order. You might also have a turncoat Lantern follower within your midst. If you fail, Coyote will cease to exist forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
