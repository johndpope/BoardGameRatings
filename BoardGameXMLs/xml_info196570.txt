							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jumping Frog</name>
									
			<description>Can you guide your frog successfully across the big roaring river? Can you stop the other players doing the same? First across the river get the most flies, but the race last three heats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a frog, trying to get the frog safely across the river reaching the big pile of flies, while at the same time trying to prevent the other players reaching the same goal. The game is played over 3 heats, and whoever has done best overall wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t the frogs just jump into the river and swim across? Because the river has a strong and unpredictable current, and to this day no frog has ever managed to swim across, and they have all been washed back to the shore furthest from the flies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is build randomly for each game, with 25 out of 32 tiles. 5 of the remaining 7 tiles is placed by the players on the board, and thereby pushes out 5 other tiles, while at the same time the players tries to jump their frog across the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is therefore to optimize your own way across the river, and at the same time prevent the other players way across the river. Points can be used for extra power, and you have to judge whether to spend points in order to gain more points later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
