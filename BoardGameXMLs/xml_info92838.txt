							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pitch&#039;n Dunk</name>
									
			<description>Pitch'n Dunk uses the mechanisms of disc-flicking to simulate a basketball game with the game board representing a basketball field with two 2-point zones and two 3-point zones. Each coach (player of the game) directs wooden tokens; each wooden token represents a player (with five on each team) or the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coaches alternatively give their players a flick, and the goal is to score 11 points with a 2-point differential. There are different rules to simulate a basketball game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shot clock: In some situations, the defensive coach can trigger the shot clock; attacking players must score in a limited number of actions.&lt;br/&gt;     Dribble:: The player who holds the ball can advance by giving one flick before he passes/shoots.&lt;br/&gt;     3 offensive fouls:&lt;br/&gt;         Traveling: Dribble for too long of a distance.&lt;br/&gt;         Charging: The player who holds the ball touches a defensive player.&lt;br/&gt;         Backcourt violation: The ball carrying player is back in his team zone after going in the opponent's zone.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     3 defensive fouls:&lt;br/&gt;         Blocking: A defensive player touches an offensive player.&lt;br/&gt;         Blocking the player who holds the ball: A defensive player touches the player who holds the ball in the defensive zone.&lt;br/&gt;         Illegal defense: There's no attacking player in the defensive zone and at least one defensive player in the 2-point defensive zone.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
