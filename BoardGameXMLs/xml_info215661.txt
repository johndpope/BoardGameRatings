			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Korindia, Revealed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home of the elusive race of the M'adukar. Originally part elf, part human, this race has become completely separate from its parent races. These people are usually mistaken for very pretty humans or blunt featured elves. They've a culture all their own and they bow to no one. Kor wated until his parents died and then chose to take as many of his people as he could and leave the unhappy homes with both human and elf societies treating them as less than instead of something different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island is discussed and its history. You'll also find out about the cities, including the city that faces the rest of Shaintar, Kor'Davine. Once you're beyond the walls you'd better have no mettal on you or things will go badly, if you're lucky. In this book you'll find a history of Korindia, a bit about architecture, art, song and how in tune with Nature these people are.  There's some new edges, forms for the Kor-In martial art and a whole bunch of other stuff that will bring Korindia to life for you. It's also got some story seeds and other good stuff for those GM's who want to send a group there and any who want to explore being M'adukar with their next character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
