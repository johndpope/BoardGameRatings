			<description>The N.E.A.K. (Nautical Exploration and Alimentation Konstructum) was designed by a team of French and German  engineers (led by Benjamin B. Kaufmann) and was intended to be used as a multi-functional support submarine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when a small craft that could fit into the Dimension Processor was desperately needed, the NEAK became a Sub-vascular Nautical Exploration and Alimentation Konstruktum, and thus the S.N.E.A.K. became our last hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, one to four players take control of a crew and a submarine each, which are induced into the blood vessels of a patient, who is in the process of being assimilated by nanobots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round a new area of the vascular system is laid open, and new nanobots strive to destroy the intruder/ to destroy nerve cells of the patient/ to repair the damage to other bots or the body of the patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different special abilities of the crew members are applied to ease the tasks at hand, but having a too large crew on board can quickly result in a failure in the mission and black outs due to the near end of the air supply on board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game-card system from seven (and later nine) cards is the driving mechanic for most tests and tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for the Sneaky Sci Fi Game Design Contest, held by Rudolf Aligierski in May/June 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
