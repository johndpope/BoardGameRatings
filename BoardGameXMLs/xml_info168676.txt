							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caves of the Circind</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Merlin, the High Druid of Britain, sends the characters to retrieve the fabled Coat of Beisrydd, one of the Thirteen Treasures of Britain. To succeed they must find the help of the hero, Gawain, uncover the mysteries of Lindisfarena, and defy the wrath of Mawgaus, Druid-King of the fierce Circind Votadini - a powerful animist known to eat the brains of his enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is taken from the forthcoming RuneQuest supplement, Mythic Britain. It acts as a sampler for the book but is also complete and playable in its own right, with maps and Non-Player Character statistics provided. Do note that it is intended for a party of about 6, reasonably competent characters, with combat-related skills in the 80% or higher area. If used with beginning, lesser-skilled, or fewer characters, then the skills and numbers of the foes should be adjusted accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is complete, although it is an excerpt from the Mythic Britain sourcebook.  The scenario is available as a standalone document (PDF).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
