			<description>Author's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is within the world of Tchalrria that my game takes place. The game is similar to many other fantasy-type role playing games out there. This is not to say that it is exactly the same as these by any means. I have played many different rpgs, but I have always ended up changing the rules to make them more fun, interesting, playable, etc. In making Tchalrria, I tried to take what I liked about other systems, and add to it what it lacked and I wanted. I think that the game is fairly flexible and can easily be modified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot to do in Tchalrria. I have attempted to include a little of everything. Characters use a class and skill based system. This allows for both simplicity and originality for the characters. Players are encouraged to make their characters different from the norm. As far as special abilities go, there is quite a variety. I have included magic, psionics, divine power, and martial arts. There are also a lot of more mundane skills to learn. Original races and weapons also add to the experience of Tchalrria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
