							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombieworld: The Streets of Atlanta</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the end of the world, metropolitan Atlanta was a city of 5 million, plus. Now, it is largely abandoned and overrun with hordes of the flesh-eating undead...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the military failed to hold back the outbreak, the city was lost. Since then, the power has been out and all lines of communication remain down. Large portions of urban core have been bombed out and reduced to smouldering, blackened rubble. Here and there, fires burn uncontrolled, sending clouds of thick, black smoke into the air. Every last road and highway in and out of town is impassible, clogged with countless wrecks and abandoned vehicles. Even worse, the living dead are nearly everywhere, roaming the barren cityscape and lurking in the blasted ruins, hungering for human flesh...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any areas that aren't infested are heavily contested by a variety rival factions at odds over the city's dwindling resources. Scavengers hunker down wherever they can find shelter, hoping to avoid the looters and bandits that prowl the urban core. Squads of heavily armed, rogue soldiers patrol the streets with orders to shoot and kill anything that moves, dead or otherwise. Meanwhile, thugs and gang-bangers hole up on their home turfs, ruthlessly defending what's left of their 'hoods...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up until now, you have managed to avoid Atlanta. You and your group have been able lay low and stay safe somewhere on the outskirts of the city. But now that more than a month has passed, your resources are dwindling ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time for a supply run... it's time to take to The Streets of Atlanta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
