							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hunter&#039;s Harbor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: The Hunter's Harbor is the opening section of the book Thristle Hold - Wrath of the Warden, here presented as a stand-along eBook - perfect for players who can (and are supposed to) read this section before playing, or for anyone who just wants to get a feel for the town of Thistle Hold without buying the whole book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every day for eight long years, Merdalo has risen from his straw bed, combed his shaggy beard and walked to the Antique Plaza. Every day for eight long years, he has entered his wooden box to sing the praises of Thistle Hold, and he has smiled in thanks for every shilling making the bronze cup at his feet sing along. His songs are about successful expeditions to the forest ruins, about the town as a peaceful orchard in a violent world, about women and men who have risen from the deepest misery &amp;ndash; all thanks to Thistle Hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merdalo was once involved in the construction work; ever since he has watched the town grow and evolve from his lowly stage. The songs have always appeared dishonest but that never used to bother him, not as long as the audience rewarded his well sounding lies with equally well sounding coins. But a gnawing feeling has grown in his chest, stronger and stronger with each passing day. Deep down Merdalo knows that he is a murderer, just as Mayor Nightpitch and all others who participate in upholding the illusion. For what else should you call someone who convinces people that they can fly, only to silently watch as they dive headlong into the Abyss with a hopeful smile on their lips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURED CONTENT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A comprehensive introduction to Thistle Hold&amp;rsquo;s history, establishments, factions, and conflicts meant to be read by both players and GMs.&lt;br/&gt;    About twenty detailed taverns, inns, shops and more, where the player characters can spend time and thaler between adventures.&lt;br/&gt;    An introduction to Blackmoor, the huge tent camp just south of Thistle Hold&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed full-color maps of both Thistle Hold and Blackmoor &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
