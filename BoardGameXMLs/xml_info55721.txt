			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iron fist of the Shadow squeezes Eredane dry. In cities across the continent, whole wards are purged of innocents at the whim of dark priests and bloodthirsty orc commanders. But in one city, the residents merely wear the guise of innocence. In one city, the body may be broken but the soul is still strong. Welcome to Baden's Bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook for the city of Baden's Bluff contains a wealth of setting material for DMs, describing a city that is both a place of refuge and one of adventure. Its dark streets can be as dangerous to legates and orcs as they are to resistance fighters, and many secrets lie among its worm-eaten docks, forgotten sewers, and ancient canals. Players will find new organizations to join and feats designed to bring the fight to the dark god. Baden's Bluff is an ember of hope, as well as a culling ground, for all those who try to survive UNDER THE SHADOW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of organizations, NPCs, and location descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;     Maps, adventure hooks, and local rumors to incorporate into any MIDNIGHT campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the lands around Baden's Bluff and how they are used by the factions within the city.&lt;br/&gt;     Terrifying new opponents created by Sunulael himself, and the feats and prestige class with which the Badens fight them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
