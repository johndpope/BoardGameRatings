			<description>&amp;quot;Inspiration for character creation in Inquisitor.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EVERYONE HAS TO START SOMEWHERE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I should apologise before I start - this article will most likely be only of the most passing interest to veterans of the Inquisitor game system. However, there are plenty of people out there who, for one reason or another, have either never played Inquisitor, or are only just taking their first, tentative steps into this most wonderful Specialist Game. In my capacity of moderator for both the Specialist Games Forum, and The Conclave inquisitor forum, I have the pleasure of seeing many new people come over to playing Inquisitor for the first time, and one of the areas in which people struggle is the process of thinking up the background for a new character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is, of course, a process that many gamers will go through with other GW games - many people invest more effort in their armies or gangs if they have made some degree of simple backstory for the key players. However, Inquisitor is unique in requiring this background as a key part of the game. With the emphasis on character-driven narrative, and the potential for further, potentially off-table role-playing elements, character is everything in a game of Inquisitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
