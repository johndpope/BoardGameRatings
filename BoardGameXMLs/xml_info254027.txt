			<description>The Hunt is the first expansion aka thematic pack for Serengeti: A Race For Life. It contains 30 cards and provides an alternative to the starting setup as well as changing the dynamics of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Hunt the emphasis is on predators, a class of animals found in the game that is further expanded in this expansion with the addition of the Cheetah, boosted by the inclusion of a secondary scavenger, the Vulture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vulture takes center stage in this thematic pack and is required in every game playing with this setup while the Cheetah can be added to any setup provided by the base game or other thematic packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
