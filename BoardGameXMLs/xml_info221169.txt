			<description>The Living Starship co-operative, Legacy-style tabletop game gives 1-8 players the job of crewing a Corvette-class starship that is responsible for shoring up the economy, politics and security of their assigned space sector. Utilizing worker-placement, deck-building, and resource management, the ship and its crew must complete missions in order to keep the local planetary system from collapsing into disarray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is not about how tricked-out you can make the armor, engines and guns of your ship. It is about the crew, how they interact with the ship and how the ship as a whole interacts with its environment. Your ship will partake in vital missions that will shape the entire future, for good or ill, of the Citadel Galaxy. Will your crew become elite officers that will be the key players in what is to come or will you continually have to recruit new crew just to keep afloat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
