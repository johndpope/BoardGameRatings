			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting is a collective of different area encounters for several different character levels. While this land was a frequently travelled area for the adventurers it was used for a variety of challenges. While not every challenge is met for every level it is up to the PCs to decide if they are up for the challenge they discover. Of course you can always &amp;lsquo;discourage&amp;rsquo; or hide some encounters from the party. It can also be used in an area frequented by the PC party that can offer an increased challenge with each visit they make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for an initial to low level group of adventurers.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for several one shot adventures or a continuing campaign setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
