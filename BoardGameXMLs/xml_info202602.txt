			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hipsters and Hamsters is a light card game for individual or team play. To begin play, each player is dealt four cards. In a unique twist, players can win the game in one of two ways. Players win as a Hipster by having no cards in their hand at the end of their turn. Players win as a Hamster by having eight (or more) cards in their hand at the end of their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four card types. Object cards serve as simple discards. No action is taken when Object cards are played. Action cards trigger the action shown on the card when played, helping players eliminate, or accumulate, cards. Calamity cards can be played at the start of an opponent&amp;rsquo;s turn, forcing the opponent to take the action on the Calamity card. Comeback cards can be played on Calamity cards, in which case it becomes the turn of the person playing the Comeback card. Depending on the Comeback card, that person either takes the action on the Calamity card, or ignores it, before starting their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its pick-up-and-play game mechanic, Hipsters and Hamsters is filled with dynamic and precisely-balanced strategy, as opposing sets of victory conditions cause players to flip between playing styles in reaction to draws and opponent actions, all while attempting to control turn order to alter the flow of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Basic game, players do not declare which character style (Hipster or Hamster) they are playing as and can switch between styles at any time, as many times as they wish, allowing them to adjust their strategy on-the-fly. In the Advanced variant and Team play, players declare their character style in advance and receive bonus points for winning the round as their declared character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
