			<description>Tibbits is a variation and combination of several games - but played with cubes. The cubes have A, K &amp;amp; Q on them (like cards) and in different colors. You try to build combinations (like 3 identical As, A-K-Q of the same color, etc.) and collect chips based on what colors and combinations you make.  Ages 8 and up. There is also a colors-only version of game play for younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is packaged in a lidded plastic dice cup and comes with 3 Tibbit Cubes, 60 chips, &amp;amp; instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
