			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a most interesting and instructive game. As many children can play as there are cards. Place all of the circular pieces in the center of the table and turn them all face down, then give each player a card. The object of the game is to complete the cards correctly. The first players selects one of the pieces. If it completes a figure in his card this player has another opportunity to draw and continues in this way until he draws a piece which does not belong in his card, which piece is put back on the table face down and mixed in with the others and the next in turn plays in the same way and so on until all have played. Continue playing in turn and the one whose card is complete first wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Box claims a patent date of July 23, 1912&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
