			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 4 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a dealing with Force and Gravity. There are dozens of powers for the Force and Gravity Suites here. Awesome Powers Vol. 4 uses the concept of &amp;quot;Facets&amp;quot; which are foci within a Suite.  The Force Suite is contains a Hard Light and Kinetic Energy powers Facet, each which allow their users to manipulate force in different ways.  The Gravity Suite has High-G and Low-G facets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special feature of Volume 4 is the new Advantage: Membership.  This allows players and Narrators to create teams and organizations for their characters, each with their own perks and drawbacks. An organization can range in size from a small supers team patrolling the neighborhood to an entire nation's government. Membership allows Heroes (and Villains) to utilize the vehicles, bases, equipment, contacts, backup, and other resources of the organization.  But Membership in an organization has its perils.  Enemies seeking to destroy them, moles thwarting their plans from within, a powder keg that must be contained, an angry public that is suspicious, and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements (like Target Exclusion and Side Effect), entirely new Disadvantages (like Non-Combatant), how to create your own Powers, and Random Character Creation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the powers presented here explains how to replicate the power described as closely as possible using the existing BASH! Ultimate Edition rules.  In this fourth volume of Awesome Powers, we present to your two themes, or Power Suites, each based on different tropes. The Force Power Suite allows you to create force fields and energy beams of &amp;quot;Hard Light&amp;quot; energy or to harness and redirect the power of Kinetic Energy.  The Gravity Suite allows you to manipulate the most fundamental energy that drives the universe itself.  Use it to crush your enemies, or simply leave them hanging in midair while you walk on walls or fly.  Even the dreaded might of a Black Hole can be yours to command!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
