			<description>&amp;quot;BIDittle [bi-DIT-tle] players are dealt 7 cards per hand.  Using a simple bidding language based on high card points, partners work together to bid on the number of tricks the team intends to win and identify which suit or notrump the game will be played.  The game board corners include bidding prompts to help the new player bid more easily.  Once the final bid has been defined, the dummy hand is introduced, and the play of the hand is just like Bridge.  The seven-card hands are easy to hold and help make the game move quickly.&amp;quot; [description from website]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BIDittle is actually 3 games in one box, each of which may be played entirely on its own:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;little BIDittle&amp;quot; is a very simple game to introduce trick-taking and trump suits to youngsters and newcomers to card playing. It is recommended for ages 7 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BIDittle&amp;quot; is the main game, as summarized above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The bridge to Bridge&amp;quot; is a more advanced game that deals full hands of 13 cards to each player and uses bidding that is much closer to Bridge itself, though still being a simplified version of Bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains a 2-sided board that has bidding guidelines and a track to show the bidding progress with colored markers. One side of the board is used for &amp;quot;little BIDittle&amp;quot; and BIDittle itself, while the other side of the board is used for &amp;quot;The bridge to Bridge&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
