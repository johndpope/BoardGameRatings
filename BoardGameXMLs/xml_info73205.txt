			<description>Description from box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The little mouse who's hungry for cheese&lt;br/&gt;Must avoid the cat and the old lady's broom&lt;br/&gt;Help him to escape through the mousehole with ease,&lt;br/&gt;Or win all the cheese that's there in the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The mouse is pulled back and wound up, then released from the center circle. Where will he land? Will you win 1-4 pieces of cheese (get 8 on your cheese board and you win!) or will you get the broom or the cat? If the mouse gets out through the mouse hole past the cat you win automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
