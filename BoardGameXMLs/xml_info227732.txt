			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become an artisan chocolate maker by attending the finest Chocolatier school in Paris. Work with world famous chocolate chefs to create signature recipes starting with raw cocoa beans and the finest and most expensive natural ingredients. Prove your chef, marketing and management skills to earn the title as the finest chocolatier in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a master chef, you will have sous chefs and assistants to help create your masterpiece chocolates. Each day, you will choose alumni instructors that have specialties that can give you advantages. You will need to manage your money by selling your chocolates so that you can buy better ingredients and gain the highest marks for your recipes. With limited space and equipment, you will need to plan actions wisely. Crowding a work space will damage your reputation but sometimes it's necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your chosen instructor(role card), sous chefs(workers) and assistants(temporary workers) players will attend classes to increase skills, create chocolate from cocoa beans, choose ingredients at the market to create artisan chocolate recipes and then sell them in the shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 24 different instructor cards, over 100 distinct recipes, variable customer meeples and more than 50 achievement tiles, Chocolatier provides huge replay value. Each game will require new strategies and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
