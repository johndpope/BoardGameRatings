							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bio Grafo The Biography Game of Skill and Chance</name>
									
			<description>75 well-known authors and one work each is known for is the basis of this Bingo-type 'educational' game. Each player gets one of 40 'GRAFO' cards, a 5 by 5 grid where each square has an author number, an author's name, and his or her image. The caller randomly pulls from the stock of 75 tokens, and reads aloud the column letter (G, R, A, F, or O) and title of a play, book, poem, or short story and optionally the author number. If the author of that work is on his or her card, a player marks that square with a translucent disk, hoping to be the first to get five in a row. Can be played in three difficulty levels:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Playing by the numbers. The caller reads the column letter, title, and author number. This makes the game no harder than Bingo with some trivia thrown in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Playing by the book. The caller omits the author number, but players have access to a &amp;quot;Bio/graphics&amp;quot; booklet in which they can find the author of the named work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Playing for mastery. Players no longer have access to the book and have to recall from memory the author of the named work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player calls &amp;quot;Grafo&amp;quot; when he or she covers five squares in a row on his or her card, and once verified is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
