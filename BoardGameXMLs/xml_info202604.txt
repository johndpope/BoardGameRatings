							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sector K-6 Supply Depot</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The government-run Supply Depot in Sector K-6 isn't the best place on the planet to work. The team of clerks, drivers, loaders and security that staff it are usually bored. There's not much to do in the Southern Wastes - in fact people aren't really sure why the government bothered to establish a supply depot there. So, staffed by disinterested 2nd-rate staff, miles from anywhere, forgotten by everyone - which makes it the perfect place for a raid by smugglers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Wargame game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 20 map depicting a futuristic supply depot on a dry wasteland planet. Crates and boxes crowd the concrete courtyard, and fill the warehouses and store rooms of the facility. Ideal for W40K, Firefly and Star Wars games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a 300dpi full size jpg, for poster printing or VTT. (n.b. gridless version only available as jpeg)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
