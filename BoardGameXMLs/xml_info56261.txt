							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deep Space Scavenger Setting</name>
									
			<description>Since 2012, the Deep Space Scavenger Setting has been included in the core rules and is simple called The Scavenger Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Resource Description&amp;quot; text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the players resource for playing a team of Scavvies. Player characters take the role of Salvage Teams on a small Salvage Vessel in Remmar. They leave the safety of their jury-rigged craft in search of treasure in the form of technical items, cargo and rare items. A balance between danger and profit is the character&amp;rsquo;s motivation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting is to be used as an example on how one such Salvage Vessel is run. It includes descriptions what the vessels are like, what NPC crew member jobs are and possible character concepts and skeletons. Some special skills are introduced and an outline of a typical Scavenger operation is finally given. When this section mentions &amp;lsquo;SV&amp;rsquo;, it is dealing generally with Salvage Vessels. When it mentions &amp;lsquo;Botchery Clipper&amp;rsquo; it is referring to the precise example and is placed in a box for easy recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
