			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 12 and up. Buy, Sell, Crash, Split or Option Stocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several game variations let you choose how long to play. Choose a timed game, or set target dollar and stock values.&lt;br/&gt;No one is ever put out of the game by bankruptcy. Elements of skill and luck ensure that anyone can win, even if they are behind in the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  financial game is based on buying and selling stock in 6 different commodities. The board shows a throw dice and move track. Stock prices can crash or be forced to split, penalizing or benefiting those that hold the effected stock. Two card decks 'News' and 'Permission' are drawn from when landing on the appropriate spots. With those cards one can affect the price of the stock. One might force  a stock split or purchase an option. Options work just like in real life. You commit to and pay for shares and then when you land on one of the stock's squares and based on what the going rate for the stock is at that time you will either make or lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
