			<description>Very original Spanish board game with an airplane theme and a dexterity element. Each player has a set of jettons that they try to move to the discs on the seats of the corresponding arms. Meanwhile two airplanes are moving around above the arms. The player who first succeeds to transfer all his jettons to the correct seats is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
