			<description>Papegaaien is a party game where all competitors answer questions simultaneously and get points whenever more than one player gives the same answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One round goes as follows:&lt;br/&gt;- a player draws a card containing 7 questions on a subject. These questions usually read: &amp;quot;Name a x that has attribute y&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- the player reads the questions one by one, each time awaiting the other players answers.&lt;br/&gt;- the other players answer the questions out loud. Each time 2 or more players give the same answer at the same moment, those players score a point. The question asking player judges the simultaneous-ness of the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A session exists of 6 rounds, and in each round each player asks questions once. In the end the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
