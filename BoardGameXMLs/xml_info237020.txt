			<description>A One-Round Adventure for FOR2: The Drow of the Underdark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Underdark. Many words describe the world in which you find yourself: dangerous and deadly, treacherous and travailing, eldrich and yes, evil. A land of great beauty and terror. It is the home of the dark elf and duergar, the ogre and orc, the merro and mind flayer. It is also home to others, less evil, less deadly, less magical... creatures such as yourselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are all members of an elite squad of scouts for the Umber Legion led by Captain Belasarius, a half-drow warrior of substantial reputation. He is a no nonsense commander. Fair, stern and one who above all else, has the best interests of his soldiers foremost in his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your unit is stationed outside of the city of Menzoberranzan, at the request of your employer, the 6th House of the City, Agrach Dyrr. You are ordered to report to the legion&amp;rsquo;s headquarters, a small house in the artisan&amp;rsquo;s quarter of the city. The orders carry the mark of Captain Belasarius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
