							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Make It!  Animal Babies</name>
									
			<description>In Make It! Animal Babies, players compete to assemble a three-dimensional cardboard animal.  Each player chooses an animal and takes the five pieces (head, body, forelegs, hind legs and tail).  The body parts are depicted tiles, which are laid out face-down.  Players take turns choosing a tile.  If it depicts a part of their animal, they take that piece, add it to their animal and discard the tile.  If it is not a part of their animal, they return it to the same spot face-down.  The first player to completely assemble their animal wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
