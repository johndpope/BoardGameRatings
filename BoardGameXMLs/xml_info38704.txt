							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gilroy Garlic Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to KFAT country. That great and wonderful expanse that stretches south from San Francisco to Salinas, possibly even King City. Where the U.S.A. comes out of the Pacific and across to the mountains that make San Joaquin a valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A land of virtually everything that could be wanted (except good snow). A place to raise the spirits of man, perhaps his income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A land of farmers, ranchers, fishermen, electronic engineers, country people, suburbanites, cowboys, etc., etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A mini-world offering a great variety of terrains and activities. All this within the grasp of one centrally located city. Gilroy! Yes, Sir! It's all within 50 miles of the Garlic Capital of the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is the game that plays over the area and enables you to pit your investment skills against others in a race to return big dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Players will be buying and selling agri-commodities and learning all about the necessity of cash flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No need to worry, it's not complicated just business as usual with a KFAT twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They're all real businesses that exist in the area, encompassed by San Jose, Santa Cruz, Salinas, Hollister and &amp;quot;all the rest of them there towns down there&amp;quot;. So welcome to the heart of it all, Friendly Gilroy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
