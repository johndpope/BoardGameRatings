							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Masquerade: Players Kit</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Masquerade Players Kit is the first supplement for Mind's Eye Theatre: The Masquerade. However, the Players Kit is also suitable for use with Vampire: The Masquerade. The Players Kit includes information entirely new to Vampire, with sections on rules conversions, new props and new costuming options. No journey into the World of Darkness is complete without this guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Masquerade Players Kit features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Prelude Flowchart - A series of detailed tables designed to help you flesh out your character's background through your mortal life and into the Embrace.&lt;br/&gt;     New Clans and Disciplines - Seven new clans and bloodlines are detailed here, each with its own special Disciplines, advantages and weaknesses (for use with Mind's Eye Theatre).&lt;br/&gt;     New Handouts - This book is filled with handouts to enhance both tabletop and live-action stories.  These handouts include narratives detailing a variety of Embraces, as well as scripts for announcing the entrance of your city's prince.  Also included are two complete coteries, each with its own dark secrets and sinister goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
