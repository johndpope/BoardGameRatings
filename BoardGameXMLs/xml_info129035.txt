			<description>This is a game played with 6 tops. The 6 tops are different colors corresponding to 6 colors on the game board. You get all 6 tops spinning and wait for them to stop. A top with its tip resting on its color scores 1 point. Any other color scores nothing. The game is to 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a square divided into 4 quadrants. In each quadrant the board is broken up into circular arcs that look like 6 concentric circles that were cut horizontally and vertically through the center, then randomized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some odd reason the box top has the name &amp;quot;Rainbow Spinning Game&amp;quot; but the rules have the name &amp;quot;The Game of Rainbow Tops&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
