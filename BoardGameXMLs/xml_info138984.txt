			<description>Hockey Night in Canada Challenge is a head-to-head stand alone game and an expansion to Big League Hockey Manager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the HNIC Challenge stand alone game is to win the championship by winning four matches.  Each &amp;quot;coach&amp;quot; selects a team of one goalie, two defensemen, and three forwards, plus two extra players.  Each match is played in three periods.  Dice rolls determine the score in each period by both teams.  Challenge cards can be played in each period to influence the score or affect the entire match.  If the score is tied after three periods, overtime is played until their is a winner.  Once a team has won four matches (of a possible seven), they win the championship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion pack option for Big League Hockey Manager allows General Managers (GM's) to collect a Challenge each time they win a match.  Challenge cards can be traded or sold before the &amp;quot;trade deadline&amp;quot;.  Once a GM was won five matches, the first and second place GM's are determined. The HNIC Challenge stand-alone rules are used to play the championship final between those two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: The standard rules for HNIC Challenge are best played with two players.  The expansion pack rules can be played with two to four players.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for a quick, exciting best-of-seven series that's pits you and a rival coach in a challenge for the championship. This game is easy to learn and fun to play. Your teams face off as you roll the dice and strategically play your Hockey Night in Canada Challenge cards.
