							<name  sortindex="1">Winterbottom</name>
									
			<description>[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this puzzle game, you are P.B. Winterbottom, sweet tooth-wonder. Hungry for pies, pies, and more pies, your goal is to collect every single one of them in every level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level is a puzzle, and P.B. will have to use his special abilities to overcome the various difficulties that await him. Mr. Winterbottom can run, jump, kick with his cane and float with his umbrella. But most important is his ability to create clones of himself and interact with them in order to get to otherwise unreachable areas. In order to create a clone, the player must record a sequence of his own play. A clone will then replay this sequence over and over again. This means for example that a clone can walk on a switch to keep a door open, or kick you in the air with his cane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The esthetics of the game are inspired by old silent movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a story mode (where the only goal is to find the pies), and various bonus levels where the player has an additional goal of using the least amount of time and/or clones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
