							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rugrats in Paris: The Movie</name>
									
			<description>Rugrats in Paris: The Movie is a video game based on the movie of the same name from the Nickelodeon animated series, Rugrats. The game follows the adventures of a group of young children in a European theme park. A Sega Dreamcast version of the game was planned to be made, but it later got cancelled.&lt;br/&gt;Tommy Pickles' father has been sent to Europe in order to fix a broken robot at EuroReptar Land and has decided to bring his family and friends with him. The player can choose Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Angelica, and Kimi to play as. There are approx 16 levels as well as hidden bonus levels in both single and multi-player games. The object of the game is to collect enough gold Reptar tickets to buy the Reptar Helmet that controls a Giant Robot Reptar. The PC version does not include collecting Reptar tickets, and it seems to be centered more around Chuckie and his concern about his father, who plans to re-marry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
