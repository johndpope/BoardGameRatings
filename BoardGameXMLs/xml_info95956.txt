			<description>In Art&amp;eacute;, the players represent important tycoons of the 19th century, who love medieval art and architechture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To follow their passion, they find in Alfredo d&amp;rsquo;Andrade the perfect collaborator to restore old buildings or edify new ones, respecting the style of former centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, you will challenge your friends in a hard competition to find money, materials and workers to realize the artworks you desire, by asking new projects to d&amp;rsquo;Andrade, and cooperating with architechts, artists or builders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use at best the available actions to realize the best artworks and gain more victory points than your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Play of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art&amp;eacute; is played over a series of rounds. During each round, every player will take turns assigning his or her Tycoon (and possibly Foreman) to a circle on the Activity Board. Rounds continue in this way until a player completes his or her last Project and there are no more Project Tiles left in the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting in the Second Round, on your turn you must move your Tycoon Pawn to a different empty circle on the left side of the Activity Board. You cannot leave your Tycoon on the same&lt;br/&gt;circle, or on another circle in the same row!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have activated your Foreman, you must place it on an empty circle on the right side of the Activity Board - or move it to a different circle if it is already on the board - on your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may use your Tycoon and your Foreman in any order you choose each turn.&lt;br/&gt;When you place your Tycoon Pawn or Foreman Pawn on a circle, you immediately follow the instructions on the space to the right of your chosen circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you complete any Tycoon or Foreman actions on your turn, you may spend Resources to complete any Projects you are working on. Once all players have had a turn, the round&lt;br/&gt;ends and a new round can begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The End of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have no incomplete (face up) Project Tiles in front of you at any point during your turn, and there are no more Project Tiles left in the stack for you to draw, the game will come to an end. Finish playing your turn as normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is your final turn for the game. Each of the other players then takes one final turn. After all players have completed their final turns, the game is over and it&amp;rsquo;s time to add up your score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
