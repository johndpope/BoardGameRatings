			<description>Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles, known in Japan as Akumajō Dracula X Chronicle , is a PlayStation Portable game in the Castlevania series of games by Konami and developed by Prosoft Works. The game is a 2.5D remake of Rondo of Blood. The game also includes the original Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo, re-titled Castlevania: Rondo of Blood for English localization, as well as a redone port of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with its remake, Rondo of Blood is given new voice acting in English, a slightly revised script, and the option to listen to the English or Japanese voices. For the original Japanese language, the same voice actors are used as in the remake. The original intro from Chi no Rondo, spoken in German, is intact and uses the German dub that is also used in the intro video to the remake. The PSP port of the Original game is also given new English voice-acting for its cutscenes and it's Gameplay such as Richter and Maria's voice samples. Some enemy and monster cries have been replaced with newer samples. Also included as an unlockable game is Akumajyo Dracula X Peke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in The Dracula X Chronicles remains largely unchanged from Chi no Rondo. However, there are minor additions. New dialogue scenes are added, and pre-existing scenes are altered or extended. Small introductory cutscenes are added before boss fights. These are fully voiced in both English and Japanese. First seen in Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance, a Boss Rush mode is added and two new bosses had been added for the remake version. While the original Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo featured anime style artwork, Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles features new character designs by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night character designer Ayami Kojima.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dracula X Chronicles&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
