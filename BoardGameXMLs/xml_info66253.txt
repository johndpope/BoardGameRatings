			<description>This is a card game. There are 3 classes of cards, cards called Sellers, cards with pictures on them called Spectators and money cards. The Seller cards and the Spectator cards are shuffled to form their own decks. The start player draws a Seller card to see what they have to sell and the selling price for the item and then a Spectator card to see if they draw a person willing to buy whats for sale. If they get that combination of an item and a willing seller the player takes the amount of money shown on the Sellers card out of the 'bank'. Some cards show 'no sale' There are also two 'pretty girl' cards, one will buy and one will sell. There is also a 'constable card' which if drawn, the player drawing the card is immediately arrested and so losses his/her turn. When the seller cards are exhausted the game ends and whoever has the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
