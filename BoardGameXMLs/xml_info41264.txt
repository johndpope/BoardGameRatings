			<description>This is a roll and move for 2-6 players, based on the amusement park in Branson, MO. There are two ways to play, Basic &amp;amp; Advanced. In the Basic game players travel around the park and the winner is the first person to land on the finish  space by exact roll. In the Advanced game players travel around the board gathering as much money as possible. Once all players have traveled the board, the winner is the one with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
