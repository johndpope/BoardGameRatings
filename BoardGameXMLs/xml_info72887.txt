							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Devil Inside</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Devil Inside is a horror-themed third-person shooter video game released in 2000 by Cryo Interactive. The game's script was written by Hubert Chardot, better known for his work in the Alone in the Dark  series. The game is presented as a reality television game show documenting the supernatural  exploits of the protagonist Dave and his titular alter ego, a succubus named Deva. The game's theme was frequently compared to The Running Man, written by Stephen King, whose name is mentioned early in the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Devil_Inside,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
