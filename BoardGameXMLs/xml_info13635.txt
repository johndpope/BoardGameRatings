			<description>Melees Gloriosus is a set of miniature rules for conducting land, naval, and siege warfare in the age of antiquity (2500 BC - 500 AD according to this rule'set). The move toward an all-inclusive game system that deals with both land, sea, and siege warfare is a feature that sets it apart from other rule sets, which tend to focus on only one aspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolution of combat, morale, etc., is quick, and resolved using one or two 6-sided dice. Differentiation between troop equipment is scant (armored/unarmored), abandoned in favor of troop classifications. Somewhat controversially, the rules include mechanisms for indirect fire. The rules contain brief 3-4 line notes on the major armies of the era, but no actual army lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
