			<description>A family game where you try to complete tasks before the total time allowed for all players runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get 4-7 cards with different locations and points for your task depending on the number of players. Each card has a task for each color of player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is based on a number gear connected to the main clock gear and corresponds to your pawn color. Each space you move takes 1 hour on the clock, and the clock only makes 12 revolutions before the game ends so think about what task is best to complete first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To shake things up there are relate cards that you can use on your turn that have special bonuses, but you have to satisfy the criteria of the card first! (eg. &amp;quot;Do you know the birth year of the player to your left?&amp;quot; If you answer correctly you add 3 spaces to your current move.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is great for a fun family event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
