							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Do: Fate of the Flying Temple</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear Pilgrims of the Flying Temple,&lt;br/&gt;We need your help&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So begins the latest letter your troupe of pilgrims has received. There&amp;rsquo;s only one problem&amp;mdash;the Flying Temple has disappeared, leaving only a single dragon&amp;rsquo;s egg in its place! It&amp;rsquo;s up to you and the other teenaged pilgrims to carry on with the temple&amp;rsquo;s work, helping the residents of the Many Worlds with their problems. But it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Evildoers plot to take advantage of the temple&amp;rsquo;s absence; there are no monks to give advice on how to deal with them, and your young dragon gets you into trouble as much as it helps you. But you cannot ignore the people of the Many Worlds when they turn to you for help&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do: Fate of the Flying Temple is a family-friendly standalone roleplaying game in the Fate Accelerated style. This book contains everything you need to set off for adventure in the windpunk setting of the Many Worlds. In this game, you can fly with dragons, solve problems and puzzles, and defeat the bad guys just like the heroes of Avatar: The Last Airbender and How to Train Your Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the Flying Temple and set off for adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
