			<description>Author's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Emily Short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prince sits awkwardly on the couch, holding his glass slipper and trying to keep it from crushing. Lucinda and Theodora have the ends of the same couch, and they are taking turns seeing who can bend lowest and show off the most cleavage; while the old lady, in her wing chair, carries on about nonsense&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glass is a conversation-oriented fairy tale, taking place in one room. It is likely to take only a few minutes to play once, but can be played several times to different endings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
