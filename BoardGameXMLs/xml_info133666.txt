			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Solar Echoes is a role playing game involving small unit tactics set in a science fiction universe, with a fast moving game system designed to promote team-play by allowing players to coordinate their moves and decisions together, react to opponents at any time, and see all actions occur simultaneously! As seven alien races struggle to co-exist in an uneasy alliance, the Inter-Stellar Union sends specialized forces of agents on missions to preserve the crucial balance. Without this Union Guard, the races will not be prepared to face a looming alien threat they can only hope to defeat together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A New Gaming Experience! Tired of waiting for your turn? Annoyed with having to chew through tons of hitpoints before defeating an enemy? Angry that you waited so long for your turn, only to roll a critical failure? So were we!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How Solar Echoes is Different from other table-top RPG's:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAST&lt;br/&gt;No longer do you have to wait on your turn:&lt;br/&gt;Players plan their movements and actions together without a prescribed turn order, and can react to anything whenever they choose. Rules are streamlined and the game is designed to move quickly. No more lengthy calculations, no more complicated die rolls---just a single opposed skill check with a little added luck from the dice determines success or failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEAM&lt;br/&gt;The game encourages tactics and team-play:&lt;br/&gt;Players will find success is achieved by actively coordinating together as a team. &amp;ldquo;Soaking up damage&amp;rdquo; is not an option because there are no large hit point pools to chew through, instantly making team tactics crucial. Every system in the game is designed to involve all players working together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUN&lt;br/&gt;Experience a variety of gameplay challenges:&lt;br/&gt;Solar Echoes involves a range of scenarios including squad combat, starship battles, car chases, and even dialogue and hacking encounters. This is all conducted under an efficient and easy to learn game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solar Echoes Player's Guide is the core rule-book for Solar Echoes, the Tactical Teamplay RPG. Streamlined game rules for squad combat, starship and vehicle combat, hacking, and dialogue encounters are presented along with everything a player needs to create unique characters: playable alien races, skills, a huge library of talent choices, weapons, armor, other equipment, cyberware, and much more. Information about history, locations, and interesting organizations is provided in addition to details about starships and other vehicles players may operate in the game.
