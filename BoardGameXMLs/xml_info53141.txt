			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;He's got a gun. He's out there somewhere... and he's not going to let you leave the island alive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the rules for TRAUMA, a complete roleplaying game, and two scenarios. Designed in Paris by Dominique Granger and Frederic Leygonic, TRAUMA took the French-speaking roleplaying world by storm. Now it is available in a newly translated and revised English edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRAUMA is set in the here-and-now. The adventures you will experience are as timely as today's headlines. This volume contains sections on: character generation, skills, and ranged and hand-to-hand combat. Special features include how to create characters based on yourself and statistics for well over 100 contemporary weapons. TRAUMA is comprehensive, yet easy to learn; five pages of tables make even the most complex of situations easy to handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRAUMA is a roleplaying game of contemporary adventure and suspense. Players are encouraged to play characters much like themselves, caught in extraordinary situations of heroism and adversity. TRAUMA scenarios are built out of real world situations we all hope to avoid: conspiracies, hijackings, drug wars, psychotic reactions - terrors we usually experience second hand. The TRAUMA roleplaying game, and supplements, are available in English from Darcsyde Productions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
