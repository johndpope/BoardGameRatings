							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SAVAGE FRONTIER: Game of Adventure and Survival in Colonial America.</name>
									
			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1754 and tensions are increasing between France and Britain. In far off America, citizens of both sides are concerned only with their basic survival and prosperity. Commerce and trading are bountiful, even, with the Indians. In the Frontier regions, hunters and trappers are gathering a variety of furs and pelts to sell and trade with the many Indian tribes, as well as, Europeans. As the clouds of war are brewing, brave heroes of the frontier will find themselves caught between making a living and serving their Countries; some will even become legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;SAVAGE FRONTIER is a game for 1-4 Players. Each Player creates a Player Hero starting out in what will, hopefully be, a long and prosperous life in North American Colonies. During play, Player Heroes (Heroes) will conduct a variety of tasks such as hunting, trapping and trading. In the meantime, however, a war between France and Britain is going on and Heroes may find themselves pressed into Military service as Scouts or Militia for their Sovereign Countries. The surviving Hero with the most Legend Points at the end of the last turn is the Winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY MECHANICS&lt;br/&gt;Players move their Hero Counters on a hex map representing a fictitious area along the New York and Canadian Border in order to complete a variety of assignments. Some special assignments are determined by drawing Assignment Cards. Assignment Challenges and Combat are resolved using Dice. Battles involving larger forces take place on a Battle Mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
