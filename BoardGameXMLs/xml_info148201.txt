							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Freedom Fall</name>
									
			<description>Freedom Fall is a diabolical down-scrolling game with a whole lot of heart. An odd and creepy heart, to be sure, but a lot of heart nonetheless&lt;br/&gt;The Tower used to be a prison but then it got a royal visitor: The Princess. She was shocked by what she saw in that terrible place. It was so dull and dreary. Being locked up was no fun, so she got out of her cell and renovated a little and made the place her own.&lt;br/&gt;Our hero, the Princess &amp;hellip; oh wait &amp;hellip; the Princess isn&amp;rsquo;t the hero? You sure? Ahem, our hero, Marsh finds himself at the top of the great tower and there&amp;rsquo;s only one way out: down past all the spikes and blades and traps and fire. As his journey progresses, Marsh learns that all is not what it seems&lt;br/&gt;Freedom Fall is more than just a run-and-jump platformer and more than just darkly humourous twisted fairy-tale. It&amp;rsquo;s a journey into the past that will let you determine your own innocence or guilt, but at what cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
