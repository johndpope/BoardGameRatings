							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Construction Site</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An empty lot measuring approximately one hundred and fifty by two hundred and ten feet has been recently walled in in this neighborhood. A ten foot height wooden fence surrounds the lot almost completely. Only a single gate has been left open, barely wide enough to let the heavy machines used inside pass through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the construction is still in an early stage. A large and deep pit has been excavated, the excavator used still at the site. The walls of this pit, which will soon be occupied by a solid foundation for the building under construction, have been fortified with sheet piling retaining walls and additional steel beams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
