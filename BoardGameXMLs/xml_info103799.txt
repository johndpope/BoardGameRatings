			<description>&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They came at us for days.  The brass said that they would be coming with that large a concentration of living people but I don't think even they had a clue how many there would be in that first wave.  We weren't worried, though.  I mean we had everything that the Army could provide.  We had guns, composite body armor, soldier-to-soldier networking with real-time satellite image feeds.  They pulled out all the stops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And it meant diddly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This wasn't an enemy that we needed to hunt down in an urban environment or a stand up fight with another military.  This was a feeding frenzy, pure and simple.  All our toys and gadgets, training and preparation, hadn't prepared anyone to fight an enemy like this.  We had to relearn everything and fast.  No more shots to center mass.  No more munitions designed to injure and disable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But we did it.  Between us regular grunts and the civs that fought beside us, we kept the zeds back long enough to build the wall around the settlement.  That gave us a safe place to stay as well as a launching point and supply depot.  From there, we took back the world from those stinking corpses.&lt;br/&gt;        -- Sgt. Larry Winslow, retired, on the battle of Settlement 15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zed Force is a solitaire hex-chit wargame.  You must hold against the hordes of the undead while engineers complete the wall around one of the remaining human settlements.  Uses a combination of standard dice rolling and chit-pull.  Instead of simply fighting the undead, you must also manage your limited resources and choose when to call for reinforcements, when to focus on building the wall, and when to develop new tactics for this completely unforeseen enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
