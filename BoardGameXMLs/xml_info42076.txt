							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bomb Maze</name>
									
			<description>Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Take the two maze tile and orient them anyway you want and place both on the board, one as far down to the lower left and the other on top and as far up to the right as possible without covering any green squares. This makes for 4 (orientations) * 4 (orientations) * 2 (tile on top) = 32 different set ups.&lt;br/&gt;Place the bomb tile on the blue snow flake in the top right corner.&lt;br/&gt;One player places his tokens (four identical coins) in one of the yellow corners and the other places his four tokens in a red corner. These corners are called the reserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game.&lt;br/&gt;To escape with three of your four tokens out of the maze. The first player to accomplish this wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn; a player should move one maze tile, move one of his tokens, and move the bomb. Moving the maze tile and the token can be made in any order the player wishes, the bomb must be moved at the end of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maze movement&lt;br/&gt;Moving the maze tile is done by simply sliding it one step up, down, left or right. The maze tiles are not allowed to enter the green area. Any tokens currently resting on the tile move with it. Any tokens on the board or the other maze tile are not moved. This can cover tokens so that they are not visible any longer. It is not allowed to undo the latest maze move done by the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the 4 Tile Contest:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freely available: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3180808#3180808&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3180808#3180808&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
