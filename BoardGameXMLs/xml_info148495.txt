			<description>Rush is the primary title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire title would be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorado's Green&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rush&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is (as the name implies) about the 21st century rush currently underway in Colorado, meaning...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legalization of Marijuana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game about trying to make money in this crazy industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's like the Wild-Wild-West all over again!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rush is an economic game that involves the fact that law enforcement is always angling to shut down your enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We here at Common Man Games have always taken a special interest in games that are themed after modern-day subject matters, and involve Law Enforcement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think this is a very interesting topic, and one that is evolving right before our eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We began work on this game back in 2013 and hoped to release it in 2014, but getting it right has been a long slow process and one we don't want to &amp;quot;Rush&amp;quot; (sorry), so exactly when it will be released is a tricky question to answer, but please...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stay Tuned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
