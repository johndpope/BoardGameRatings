							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frankenstein</name>
									
			<description>Frankenstein was developed by Rod Pike and Jared Derrettis for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum home computers. The game, based on the novel &amp;quot;Frankenstein&amp;quot; by Mary Shelley, has Dr. Frankenstein find and destroy his murderous escaped monster, just as the monster later seeks to remain free and learn the reason for its existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frankenstein is a standard text adventure with static graphics in some locations to set the scene. It is similar to the earlier game Dracula, which was produced by the same author. It is divided in three parts; the player takes the role of Dr. Frankenstein in the first two, and of his monster in the third.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Frankenstein (adventure game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
