							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barnyard Races</name>
									
			<description>Barnyard Racing begins as a craft project.  The 3-D board is decorated and colored with markers and rubber stamps that are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the completed board, players race their animals around the board by drawing a card and moving the number of spaces indicated.  When a picnic space is reached, the player chooses a stamp from a selection of face down stamps, each depicting a different food.  If the stamp matches the picture on the picnic space, the player stamps their stamp book.  A player wins when all food stamps are in their stamp book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
