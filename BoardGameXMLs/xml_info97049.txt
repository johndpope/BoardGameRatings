			<description>(from the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Begins In Your Dreams...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The voice calling you, the summons echoing inside your skull. Your dreams are haunted by a being not of this world - your Mentor. Its eyes burn into your mind. The awesome Contact scours the depths of your soul, giving you Power beyond all imagination. The Power to know people's thoughts. The Power to engulf the air with flames. The Power to break people's wills. The Power to walk through others' dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wake...but the Dream remains and the chase begins. You and your Power are not alone...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring psychic Personae to life in a world fraught with danger - where cannibalistic Hunters stalk the night, eager to consume your Power; where Government agents are in constant pursuit to add you to their shadowy projects; where Corporate empires vie for your Power to lighten their grip on the public; where the chase can lead into your dreams and even beyond...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book describes everything Players and Directors need to know about The Power, including detailed rules systems, roleplaying hints and in-depth setting information. Included are eleven full-color plates, two 20-page comic books, easy to reference charts to speed up play and an introductory Script to jump-start Players into the psychic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
