			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a place where the Spirit World brushes up against the Waking World and the spirits of the departed can once again interact with those of the living. A city so infamous that it carries a wealth of history that would rival London's own. A city called Paris . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to learning the secret history of one of the world's most famous cities, players are given the opportunity to play as one of four classes of the new Ghost race, each with their own unique skill trees and racial bonus. An all new entry into the ongoing 'Carver' campaign that follows on from the London missions is also included. The mystery around this enigmatic villain deepen as the players find themselves in a city as much their enemy as the person they are hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PANDORA PARIS is the first full expansion for PANDORA LONDON and uses the CASCADE ROLEPLAYING SYSTEM, a streamlined version of the role playing system first seem in the GOLDEN AGE RPG. Carefully designed to allow for quick and easy character creation and simple to remember in-game systems without losing the depth and freedom of choice that make role playing games so fantastic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
