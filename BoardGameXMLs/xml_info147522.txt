			<description>Players are siblings whose parents have accused them of wacky wrongdoings. To appease them, players must create stories out of lies and embellishments, making them crazier and crazier by placing ever-encreasingly valued lies on top of each other, until there are sufficient lies on the story to consider it completed, at which point it comes out of play and is scored at the end of the game. Some lies allow players to draw or place more cards, allowing for powerful action chains. Players are only allowed to keep seven cards in hand at the end of their turn. Other players have some ability to damage opponents' stories, preventing the most outrageous ones from completing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player has completed enough stories, or the deck runs out, the game ends. The top lies from completed stories are scored for their lie value, and any remaining lies and embellishments add or subtract points from each player's score, with the highest score winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
