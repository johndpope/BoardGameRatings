							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cabin in the Hinterlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Cabin in a Winter wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with Square, Hex and No Overlay and the Virtual Tabletop Map (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our plowskiffs keep the river here clear of ice by shattering it and moving it to the shore. Shovel a path up to the cabin but do not shovel in its shadow. All of this is a courtesy to the ice witch and costs Skifjord a small fortune. But gold spends until it is gone; a witch&amp;rsquo;s curse is forever. Do not forget, the witch considers it a trespass to touch the shadow of her house.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Shovel Crew Foreman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cabin in the Hinterlands is a single level exterior map of a cabin on top of a sparsely forested hill with a path descending down the hill. At the bottom of the hill there is a forked lowland path that leads to the northeast corner in one direction and southeast across a bridge spanning a narrow stream in the other direction. The path follows the river on the other side of the bridge towards the south center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cabin in the Hinterlands is intended for use in fantasy or horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cabin&amp;rsquo;s Shadow: A shovel crew member has recently gone missing. The shovel crew&amp;rsquo;s family members plead for help on the streets of the nearby port of Skifjord. The people of the port ignore the family and go about their business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters may get involved by answering the pleas of the family members who tell them about the area where he went missing or by wandering into the hinterlands unprepared and start to freeze to death. The cabin represents a warm shelter. The cabin also is odd in that there is no snow on the roof, meaning it must be very warm inside. The roads and river being plowed are also odd for a hinterland with a mere single building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
