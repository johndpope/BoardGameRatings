			<description>In this game the players (2 or 4 playing as partners) are trying to connect two opposite corners of the board with a road.  Unlike in many connection games, the players' roads may cross each other and even run contiguously.  In addition to the roads, there are rivers and railroad tracks which interfere with placement.  Players score based on the length of their roads (shorter is better) and the number of rivers and railroads crossed over (fewer is better).  There are a number of rules which together can cause significant numbers of forced placements in a way vaguely reminiscent of Fresh Fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game won l'Oscar du Jouet 1974 in the Jeux Senior category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
