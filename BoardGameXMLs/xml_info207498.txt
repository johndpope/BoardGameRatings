Astrologers can read the past and future by reading the stars, while commanding light and sound to their will. Enchanters affect the senses of others, and also tap into their experiences and skills. ArmsMasters use Mentalism magic to prepare formidable defenses and coordinate group attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get the most of your talent points by purchasing from new options.
