			<description>Each player receives a mini board with 9 pictures, corresponding to 36 tiles. The tiles are placed faced down in a draw pile. Players take turns in drawing tiles, and the player who has the corresponding picture on his board recieves the tile. The player who first fills his mini board with tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be played as a version of memory. The tiles are placed faced down on the table, and players take turn choosing tiles and turning them face-up. If a player chooses a tile with a picture corresponding to his board, he places it there and continues his turn. If the tile corresponds to a picture on another players board, he puts it back face-down and lets next player take his turn. The player who first fills his mini board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
