							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Intruder Escapes</name>
									
			<description>A quick two-player game that was published in Intruder magazine #2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes the role of Eric, the Intruder, and the other player plays the monstrous Golden Hoarde.  The object for the Intruder player is to cross the map and enter the throne room, thus avoiding the Master of Chaos and winning the game.  For the Golden Hoarde player to win, he must attack at any opportunity, to force Eric to lose his six starting 'life points', rendering him unconscious and subject to capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
