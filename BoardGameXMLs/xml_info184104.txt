			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world had belonged to them once. The Gobolyns, Boggarts and Spriggans; the Trows, Trolls and Angorym; all the dark and twisted offspring of the un-living N'kroi. They roamed across the face of the world, awaiting the judgement of the Most High Lord of the Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then came the humans. Deceived by the N'kroi, they left their home upon the mount. Lost in a world of darkness, they await the promised Son of the Mountain who will show them the path of return. But as they wait, they must survive. Cut off from their creator, surrounded by countless foes, they must slash and hack a place for themselves in which to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;ARG: The Adventure Role Play Gaming System is published as a series of eight major HTML pages, including:  ARG Index, Introduction, Author's Forward, Creating Characters, Skills, Magery, Combat, and Wounds and Healing.  The system is intended to be a generic/universal RPG system but to date has been implemented only within a fantasy milieu.  Nearly all opposed actions in the game, except combat, are resolved through the skill system which is well-developed.  The skill score plus d20 roll is compared against a target difficulty to determine outcome.  Skill ratings increase through use.  Combat is handled through a fairly traditional system of rounds, hits, and damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
