			<description>Jammin Jimmi Fry was considered the greatest blues singer in his time&amp;hellip;but little is it known that Jimmi's fame and fortune did not come easy&amp;hellip;.no siree bob. It seems that sometimes &amp;quot;deals&amp;quot; have to be made and Jimmi took an offer he couldn't refuse.  On a cold winter's night, a contract was broken and Jimmi's rich, full life was suddenly and mysteriously over.  One minute he was groovin, and the next minute he was prematurely on his way&amp;hellip;down&amp;hellip;down...down&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what happened?  Hell was hotter than usual that night and busier than ever as the &amp;quot;Best of the Worst Contest&amp;quot; was in full swing.  During this time all demons and condemned sinners are allowed to ascend to the surface in order to &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; more souls. The prize? He/she who has &amp;quot;contracted&amp;quot; the highest numbers of new souls is rewarded with a reprieve and a second chance on earth. All inhabitants were just a buzzin' about taking names and giving out numbers. Amazingly, all counts were tied until Jammin Jimmi arrive&amp;hellip;and a winner was declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, who has stolen the soul of our main man&amp;hellip;our bro&amp;hellip;the once famous and now quite dead, Jammin Jimmi Fry?  It's time to get your fire extinguishers and pitchforks ready for your HOT venture into the fiery depths of Hades where a wicked soul robbing contest in full swing. Join the Dark Dude, Flame Retardo, Lucy Fur, General Bea L. Zebub, Good vs. Evil (half angel/half devil) and other demons and sinners and get ready for an exciting, devilish adventure&amp;hellip;.not to mention a HELL of a time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
