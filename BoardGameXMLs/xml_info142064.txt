			<description>Players assume the role of fairytale princesses getting ready for the ball - Cinderella, Rapunzel, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. They move around the board collecting dresses, shoes, accessories and make-up, combining them on their personal &amp;quot;princess board&amp;quot; to create a look. Their looks will earn them &amp;quot;glamour points&amp;quot; if items correspond to the fashion trends defined by the fashion towers.&lt;br/&gt;Players must move they princesses according to dice rolls, and lead towards on of the 4 fashion towers - each of them corresponding to one type of item. The princess collects these items and may wear them, combining them so as to be as fashionable as possible. Cards on top of the towers are kept revealed, and indicate which is the current fashion trend - which also means that when you reach a tower and collect the item, a new one will start a new trend. There are four different possible trends for each of the four item types, and they form four sets of items (each set has it's own shoe, make-up, dress and accessory).&lt;br/&gt;The game is a roll-and-move, with special spaces along the board that may help of hinder the princess and bifurcations to minimize the luck component. When a princess arrives at the Ball, the space in the middle of the board, she compares her fashion items to those on the towers, and get a glamour point for each match (but loses the item on doing so). If she have all items of a set, she gets points for them all, ignoring the fashion trends.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the first of the towers run out of items, which means a winning player may speed up the ending. When it happens, the princess with most glamour points wins the game and the heart of prince charming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
