			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU&amp;rsquo;VE GOT CHARACTER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the HERO System&amp;rsquo;s greatest strengths is its character creation rules, which allow you to create any type of character you can dream up and to define his abilities as precisely as you need. The basic rules in Chapter One of The HERO System 5th Edition, Revised rulebook, combined with the more advanced or genre-specific rules in various HERO System books, provide the most detailed and flexible character creation rules available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help your game run as smoothly and enjoyably as possible, The HERO System Character Creation Handbook compiles the character creation rules from The HERO System 5th Edition, Revised rulebook with key character creation rules from supplements like Champions and Fantasy Hero to create a comprehensive HERO System character creation reference. Additionally, The HERO System Character Creation Handbook supplements that material with new rules, expanded and clarified rules, and other information so you have all the character creation rules you need right at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
