			<description>Kipp-Klapp is a nicely made balancing game made with quality wood construction.  The game contains a base that holds up a simple from.  Players suspend a round playing surface approximately 5 inches in diameter.  Then players take turns placing the cylinders of different size and color on the circular surface trying to maintain balance.  Players are not allowed to touch the surface at any time.  The player who tips the pieces off the surface loses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;base&lt;br/&gt;frame&lt;br/&gt;suspended circular playing surface&lt;br/&gt;42 cylindrical playing pieces in 6 different colors and sizes/weights &lt;br/&gt;One 6 sided die with a different color on each face&lt;br/&gt;One standard 6 sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes four rule set alternatives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Players throw the color die and place a corresponding piece on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Players separate out the cylinders equally between them.  Then on their turn, they throw only the numbered die and place that many cylinders.  Any cylinders that fall off the surface are added to that players collection.  The first player to run out of pieces wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Players throw both dice and must place the number of pieces of that color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Players use only the color die.  The color of each cylinder corresponds to a point total.  The points are proportional to the sizes, so six white pieces are the same height as one blue, for example.  On a players turn they throw the color die and can place any equivalent size of pieces on the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
