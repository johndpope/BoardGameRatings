			<description>From the box: One on one or with teammates, win the opening face off and take control of the puck. SLAP SHOT cards let you make sequences of moves to advance the puck into the offensive zone, to take a shot and score a goal. But, watch out! Your opponent might have an interception card or throw you a penalty. With SLAP SHOT you'll experience the thrill of real hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with 2,4,6 or 8 players forming 2 teams that compete in a game based on the rules of ice hockey. Games are short and play is quick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
