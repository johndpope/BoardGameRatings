			<description>A simple dice game for children that incorporates drawing using a drawing template, and a rock-paper-scissors element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic variant, the active player rolls the five colour dice up to three times per turn. The highest number of identical colours is the number of spaces he/she may paint or cross out on the penguin's racing track on a sheet of the notepad. To make this easier, there is a drawing template that covers all five possible cases (1-5 spaces). The first player to have covered the complete track wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced variant, an ice pyramid has to be covered instead of a straight track. In addition, all players roll at least one die, even if it is not their turn: each player gets one die, the active player the remaining dice. The active player can try to win matching dice from other players by winning a rock-paper-scissors duel (which is re-themed as ice floe, water and rock). The first player to have covered his/her pyramid wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drawing template also includes a penguin shape that the children can draw on their sheet and add further details, like hats or clothes as a drawing activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
