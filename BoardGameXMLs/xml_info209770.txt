			<description>Similar to Six Card Golf. This game is played with 9 cards that start face down in 3 rows of 3. At the beginning of game play one card is upturned (any card). On your turn you can take a new card from the draw pile or one that has already been discarded. There are cards ranging from -3 to 9, a few wild cards &amp;amp; also a lose your turn &amp;amp; a reverse order card. The object of the game is to have the least amount of points. If you get 3 cards in a row (diagonal, horizontal or vertical) all 3 cards count as 0 no matter what their face value. Game ends when one player has all 9 of their cards face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
