			<description>Help your team guess the twisted words by describing and acting them out! The humor of Cards Against Humanity meets the style of Taboo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Split your group into two teams. One player starts first.&lt;br/&gt;2. On your turn, draw a rule card. This rule applies to you during your turn. &lt;br/&gt;3. Then, draw a twisted card. Get your team members to guess the word on your card. Describe it. Act it out. Just don&amp;rsquo;t read out the restricted words in the middle of the card. &lt;br/&gt;4. If your team guesses the word, your team keeps that card. Keep drawing twisted cards until your 60-second turn ends. Then, it&amp;rsquo;s the other team&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;5. Keep playing until everyone has a turn. The team that has the most cards at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
