							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Federation Ship Recognition Manual</name>
									
			<description>The Federation Ship Recognition Manual expands on the ships types seen in the base game Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator, adding new variants for every Federation ship in that product, including new shuttles, starships, freighters, and starbases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the base Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator itself, this is ostensibly an &amp;quot;expansion&amp;quot; for the Role Playing game, in that it provides more data than just the combat element requires.  3-dimension views are provided for all craft, along with extensive historical notes and background.  The cover of this 42-page product features a cutaway of the Federation 'Remora' escort craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No counters are provides with this product, however, the last page is a fold-out diagram showing a time line of the service lifetimes of the various ship classes, as well as silhouettes of all ships showing relative sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
