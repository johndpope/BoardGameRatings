			<description>Hungry frogs are flippin' aross the swamp trying to gobble up the most bugs. But those buzzin' bugs just won't stay put! Using your flippin' skills, and a little luck, you'll need to snatch the next meal before another frog hops along and ruins lunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FrogFlip is a 12-card microgame in which players take turns flipping a Frog Disc towards one of four Lily Pad Cards that are spaced evenly across the playing area between two-players. The target Lily Pad Card is determined by the top card in a stack of score cards depicting 1 to 4 bugs. The number of bugs depicted on the top card of the stack represents which Lily Pad Card to aim for (counting that many cards from the active player's side of the table) and the number of points scored if the Frog Disc makes any contact with the target Lily Pad Card. Players keep taking turns flipping the Frog Disc until all of the Bug Score Cards are claimed or one player collects five Bug Score Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two sets of FrogFlip can be combined for a four-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
