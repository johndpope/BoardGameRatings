							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legion of SuperScience</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCIENCE! It's the biggest, boldest word in the world, especially with an exclamation mark after it. The word &amp;quot;SCIENCE!&amp;quot; makes you think of rugged men of adventure satisfying their curiosity and pushing civilization forward into the future. Or, at least, it does if you live in a parallel world where science isn't a thing geeks do. This may explain why so many real, geeky scientists turn to a life of costumed crime: the frustration of living up to an image far grander and glorious than they could ever be.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;SuperScience has always lurked in the shadows, but the first dramatic displays of SuperScience were during World War II, when Nazi SuperScientist Wilhelm von Frankenstein, grandson of the original &amp;quot;mad scientist&amp;quot;, rebuilt ancient flying saucers from the hollow earth and bred mutant superstormtroopers to pilot them. Fortunately, Germany wasn't the only nation with SuperScience; Professor Bernard Quartermass, who later headed Great Britain's space program, gathered together select Allied SuperScientists to turn back the Frankenstein threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the core rules document, a specialized character sheet and organization sheet are available for download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
