			<description>The five star general knowledge quiz war, Quiz Battle is a battle of brains for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a book of trivia questions and answers.  The box has a sliding drawer that looks like a battlefield and is used as a scorekeeping device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns asking each other questions from their own team book.  If the question is answered correctly, the person who answers can push the Score Drawer one &amp;quot;click&amp;quot; forward to advance his troops.  If the answer is wrong then his army must retreat one &amp;quot;click&amp;quot; by pushing the drawer in the opposite direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to defeat his opponent by capturing the opponent's base camp and raising his flag (or the player whose forces are advanced the farthest when all skirmishes have been fought).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
