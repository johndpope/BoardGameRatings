			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Middle-earth and The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game are full of adventures, and your road goes ever, ever on. Sometimes, when the mood strikes you&amp;mdash;or when your heroes take a wrong turn&amp;mdash;you may see that road darken&amp;hellip; and then darken again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare Decks allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios recast within the darker and deadlier shadows of Nightmare Mode. Each Nightmare Deck introduces new encounter cards that you exchange with specified cards from the adventure's standard encounter deck. The result is a more challenging adventure that comes full of novel and thematic new twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even after they recover Celebrimbor's ring mould, your heroes must continue along their quest, for they have many miles to travel before they can return the mould to Saruman in Orthanc. However, their journey is interrupted in The Antlered Crown when they come upon the battles between warring clans of Dunlendings. In order to successfully complete their task, then, your heroes must battle through waves of hostile Dunland enemies before they can establish a lasting alliance with the Dunlendings who swear their loyalty to Chief Turch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the conclusion of The Ring-maker cycle, The Antlered Crown focused heavily on the cycle's Time X keyword, using it to trigger a number of effects, including the reveal of enemy cards from the Raven deck that you create at the beginning of the scenario. The Antlered Crown Nightmare Deck reinforces this focus on the Time X keyword and the Raven deck, so that both of the scenario's signature elements are more challenging and impactful than ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
