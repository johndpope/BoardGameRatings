			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's the point, you might argue, just parsing through this document?&lt;br/&gt;Another Dungeons and Dragons Clone?&lt;br/&gt;Aren't there already enough Old School Clones?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you are damn right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole point to this document is that while I almost fully endorse the tenets of the OSR I really don't feel part of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe more in free games than in an Old School Movement (although it certainly is full of merits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in (almost) unified game mechanics, the chance for character personalization and that such a thing as game system evolution exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe in a game system that tries (however in a rules-light way) to cover all possible venues of fantasy gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this document strives to retain the simplicity of old game systems without throwing away what I think are the good things recent editions (from AD&amp;D to 3.5 Dungeons &amp; Dragons) of the game brought us: all Dangers and Dweomers wants to be is an &amp;quot;Advanced Basic&amp;quot; version of the game we all love, its model is the very popular Dungeons and Dragons Rules Cyclopedia edited by Aaron Allston back in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I firmly believe in &amp;quot;free games for the people&amp;quot; Dangers and Dweomers will always be available both in pdf and odt format, so that people can take the document and make of it their own game.&lt;br/&gt;No commercial version of Dangers and Dweomers will ever exist. I'm bound to this both by my belief in free games and the conditions required by my sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In referring to &amp;quot;Dangers and Dweomers&amp;quot; I always said &amp;quot;document&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;game&amp;quot;, so consider all this as a massive house rules document, and one that would not even exist without the efforts and incessant analysis of many others such as Matt Finch and Chris Gonnermann who provided for free their own versions of the game that served as a base for Dangers and Dweomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luigi Castellani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
