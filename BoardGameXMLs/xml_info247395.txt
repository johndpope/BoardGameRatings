							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LotFP Referee Book (old Grindhouse Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new printing of the LotFP Referee book is taking way longer than expected (surprise), so with no in-print Referee book the geniuses over at LotFP thought that maybe some sort of Ref information should be available. So here, free of charge, is the Referee book that was included in the Grindhouse set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep in mind that LotFP is a living game and this PDF here is four years old. The next printing of the Ref book will be a complete rewrite and expansion (will be at least three times this size), new layout and graphic design, all new artwork, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF does include the beginning adventure A Stranger Storm, which will not be reprinted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
