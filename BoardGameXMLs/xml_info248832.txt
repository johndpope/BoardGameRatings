The Zip file contains the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;At Faultless U, our beauticians, pharmacists, and surgeons will create you a perfect body. Our dieticians will tell you how to maintain your new look. You&amp;rsquo;ll be the envy of everyone in the neighborhood! &amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Faultless U advert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clinic is a single level exterior and interior map of a longevity clinic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clinic is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction games such as cyberpunk, mystery, or horror in theme. The Clinic may also be of use as a high-tech facility in modern games such as a supers or spy game, for example a base for a super villain obsessed with the pursuit of ageless beauty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting twist could also be an anti-aging process at the clinic first resulted in years being taken off the client&amp;rsquo;s face and skin with wrinkles and stretch lines just disappearing. However, years later the process caused them horrifically fast aging then later death and reanimation, making the place ground zero of a zombie apocalypse in a post-apocalyptic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cracks in the Foundation: The Faultless U Corporation after being founded in Los Angeles has been serving rich clientele from models to actors and actresses. Recently; however, there has been a string of murders by former Faultless U clients. These clients have been killing their husbands and wives. The sheer number of homicides has the Los Angeles Police Department thinking that Faultless U is somehow involved after realizing all the spouses went to the clinic before the murders. They&amp;rsquo;ve decided to send a group of undercover detectives to Faultless U to undergo a makeover. The makeover is a cover; they are actually there to investigate the corporation&amp;rsquo;s beautification process. Is there something going on at Faultless U Corporation that is causing beautiful men and women to become psychotic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
