							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tower of Refuge</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 200 years ago a large fire swept through the town of Narborel. The fire started in the Wizard's Guild, killed a number of towns folk and destroyed almost a quarter of the towns timber buildings before it was put out. For this reason the Town Council told the Wizard's Guild to leave and set up their guild house on the large island in Narborel Bay on the condition that they set up a light at the top of the tower to warn shipping of the rocks in the bay. The wizards felt they were unjustly and harshly treated so they named their new guild headquarters &amp;quot;The Tower Of Refuge&amp;quot;. The then leader of the Guild, Lazilan, build the tower, walls and guest house using magic and stone brought in from the quarries around Mt. Barule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For low-to-mid level characters.  Usually distributed as a ZIP file containing the DOC adventure and two GIF files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
