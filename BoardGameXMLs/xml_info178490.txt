			<description>In GameFactory, players lead successful computer game companies that try to create the next big hit. They must build rooms in their offices, hire staff and decide which project will be the next one to bring to market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GameFactory is a worker placement game with a twist: players start with a small office and only a few options for their workers. They use funds to build new rooms with new capabilities and add them to their office, enabling new placement positions and new options. Players then use staff to build games or spend their work on creating other useful things that help them becoming the next computer game legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Factory is a game for gamers with over 150 cards, a market board, 45 wooden pieces and more than 100 cardboard markers. Two to four players compete in 90-120 minutes about who wins the most cash in the ever-changing computer gaming market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
