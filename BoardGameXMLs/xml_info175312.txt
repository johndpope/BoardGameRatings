							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Allons zo Zoo</name>
									
			<description>The game is to create a panorama of a visit to the zoo. All 30 cards that make up this scene are numbered. Each player gets 5 cards and the top card on the draw pile is revealed. This is the start card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In her turn, a player must play a card (if she has one that fits) one before or one after the card on the table. Thus the panorama is created. At the end of her turn, whether she played a valid card or not, she draws a new card from the draw-pile.If there are no cards in the draw-pile, she ends her turn by drawing a card from the hand of the player on her right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zookeeper is a Joker. Once played, if a player has the correct card which the Keeper has replaced, that player may play that card and take the Joker for herself. The Snake card acts like an Old Maid card in that whoever has it when the panorama is complete, loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
