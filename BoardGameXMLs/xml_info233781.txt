			<description>Six Sided Stout is a print and play, solo roll-and-write game that won an honourable mention in the 2017 GenCant Roll and Write contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a home brewer, preparing for the local home brew contest! Having decided to make your favourite type of beer, stout, you&amp;rsquo;ll spend up to 10 days, visiting the market, trying to find the best ingredients you can to make your the best beer you can. But you&amp;rsquo;ll never know how much will be available, as all the local brewers scramble for ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;You have some help, but will it be enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every day will you roast the malt you already have or go to the market to search out more ingredients? At the market will you buy malt, hops or yeast? Roll the dice to see how many of that ingredient you get, before adding them to your recipe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your recipe by filling in the grid making sure the ingredients meet the requirements to score you the best points possible. Be careful though, you only have 10 days (turns) to make the best beer possible by scoring the highest points with the judges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
