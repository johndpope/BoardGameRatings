			<description>Flying Lead can be used to play tabletop actions in a wide range of genres. From gang warfare to Pulp action, from military operations to black-clad assassins, Flying Lead supplies furious fun at bullet speed! Lead a gang of mobsters, play cops vs crooks, or enter the brutal world of covert special operations and espionage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But will you have the guts to lead your force to glory in world where a street punk or an armed fanatic can blow you away as effectively as a trained soldier? Pick your force, roll those dice and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Lead takes the award-winning Song of Blades and Heroes mechanics into, and even beyond, the modern world of high-powered projectile weapons. These core rules will enable you to play using a small table area and a handful of figures. By using our online force, weapon and vehicle generators, players will be able to customize their characters and get playing straight away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you will find rules for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* hand-to-hand and ranged combat&lt;br/&gt;    * vehicular combat&lt;br/&gt;    * projectile weapons&lt;br/&gt;    * grenades&lt;br/&gt;    * morale&lt;br/&gt;    * advances&lt;br/&gt;    * profiles for cops, crooks, the Mafia, pulp characters, SWAT teams, Special Ops and WWII soldiers, insurgents, terrorists, and more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules can be played in any scale, with five to 15 models per player; a standard game takes around 45-60 minutes once you know the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
