			<description>Group Photo is a simple children's card game in which players take turns drawing and discarding cards in an attempt to be the first player to match the picture cards in their hand, including at least two Photo ID cards, to the characters on their Group Photo card.  The first player to do so wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the regular picture and Photo ID cards which comprise most of the deck, the game contains special purpose cards that function as wild cards (&amp;quot;Camera Shy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Say Cheese&amp;quot;), allow a player to skip another player's turn or retrieve one card from the discard pile in exchange for one from their hand (&amp;quot;Redeye&amp;quot;), or cause an opponent to swap their group Photo card for a new one (&amp;quot;Overexposed&amp;quot;).  The game also includes rules for scoring multi-round play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
