							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rune Stryders (EABA Edition)</name>
									
			<description>from the website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word for world is Rhun. Magic is real and anyone can use it. The Giants sleep in the earth, defeated millennia ago by the piloted constructs known as Rune Stryders. The gods, angered by the deaths of their first creation, blasted the earth and scattered the survivors across Rhun. They then retreated to the heavens, never again to interfere in mortal matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only in the past few centuries have the scattered peoples of Rhun formed nations and rediscovered the magic sigils lost in their diaspora. Building new Rune Stryders, they have expanded their empires, encountered each other...and things go as badly as you might expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rune Stryders is a massive 300+ page gameworld for EABA, detailing the world of Rhun, the nearly limitless flexibility of its rune-based magic and artifacts, the magically powered war machines called Stryders, and the culture and conflicts of the nations and peoples of Rhun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
