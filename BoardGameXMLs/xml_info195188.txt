							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mostly Evil</name>
									
			<description>From their Evil Lairs / Parent's basement players rule Cityopolis by fear, defeating wave after wave of superheroes with their diabolical creations! Who will defeat the most heroes and rein supreme... from jail when they get caught because... well... Superheroes are awesome like that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get a hand of cards from which they will play or discard 2 per turn. For example minions, like Florence 'Hard Nut' McGee, could be placed on the field and players can start to create fiendishly clever weapons like the Poisonous Death Lamp. Alternatively they could play event cards such as the &amp;quot;Publish a photo of your rival stroking a Kitten&amp;quot; to reduce the fear gripping the city. Finally they could get bored and call up a Superhero to help the city... Then later use them for target practise. Superheroes start a set distance from the City and move closer after every round. If they reach the city they start to reduce the fear count which acts as the game timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reducing fear and calling up Superheroes nets players kudos worth VP's at the end but defeating Superheroes earns you Capes which are worth more VP's and after all you are Mostly Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
