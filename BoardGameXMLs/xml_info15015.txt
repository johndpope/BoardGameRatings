							<name  sortindex="5">The Game of Ferdinand the Bull in the Arena</name>
									
			<description>This is a kids track game based on the story by Munro Leaf about the bull who wouldn't fight. Each player is represented by an ordinary bull pawn. On your turn you draw a card that tells you how many spaces to move the special Ferdinand pawn, and also any special instructions for the ordinary bulls (usually sending them to a specific space or an extra number of spaces). A player always moves 2 spaces after drawing a card. The first player to reach the bullring when Ferdinand arrives wins. If more than 1 player is there, they must fight by drawing cards and the highest total of numbers on a card wins. If Ferdinand reaches the bullring first, the first player to join him wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
