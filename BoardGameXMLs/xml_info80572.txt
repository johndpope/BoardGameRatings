							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Herland: Perfect Genetic Utopia</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a world split in two, where women live in harmony in Greater North America while men live across the sea in a society of their own.  The society of women seems perfect, but what is the true cost of their luxury and peace?  There's a war going on, a war hidden from the public view.  And if that doesn't draw you in, how about this: all of the PCs must be female. &lt;br/&gt; Herland: Perfect Genetic Utopia is a futuristic RPG setting designed for use with the QAGS 2nd Edition rules.  This PDF includes detailed descriptions of the Greater North American government and society, as well as description of the Underground rebellion, rules for playing both sides, tips and optional rules for playing an all-female campaign with male players, plot ideas for your campaign, an introductory adventure, sample Words and GMCs, a fancy new character sheet, and hilarious generalizations about the fairer sex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
