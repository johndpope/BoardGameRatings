			<description>This is mildly educational roll and move board game. Game's name comes from Finnish Science Center Heureka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you will travel through Europe by throwing dice. In certain places in your way, there are cities where you have to solve some rudimentary mathematical problems. When you solve the problem you can go on. Most of the problems have something to do with probability and to &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; the problem you will throw some dice, draw some cards or arrange fibonacci numbers in right order. Game includes traditional card deck and 3*6D, 8D, 12D and the two non-normal 20-sided dice. First player who gets back to Heureka Science Center is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
