							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape the Room</name>
									
			<description>I have a headache and feel powerless. I try to open my eyes but strong light makes me close my eyes again. I wait for a minute and barely manage to open my eyes. I can see bright light. I am in somebody's room and now get up on my hands. The room is seen in detail. The blackish iron bars of the door are seen first. I look around the room with the temples of my head pressed. Somebody made the room neat. A sheet of memo is found. &amp;quot;You waisted your time&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You are extremely guilty of it but I will give you a change.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is not difficult. You must show me your strong will for your life.&amp;quot; I don't know who made this trap but I walk up to the door. The door is locked. It will not open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
