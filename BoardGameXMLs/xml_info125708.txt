							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elemental Clash: Tribes</name>
									
			<description>Turmoil has befallen the lands and the tribes are at war. Choose your which side you are on: Will you fight with the earthbound Troll tribes, who are determined to hold their wooded, mountainous homelands in the north against their foes? Will you establish dominion over the skies at the side of the ethereal Spirits? Do you share the fanatical rage of the Goblins keen on expanding their territories or will you help the solemn and elusive Merfolk protect their watery domains?&lt;br/&gt;While war wages, mighty Spellcasters emerge from the depths of space and time, summoning mighty Creatures and casting powerful Spells to battle each other...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third expansion of Elemental Clash is all about Creatures (it features more Creature and less Spell cards than previous sets), in particular the four major tribes, each being associated with one of the four elements: Trolls (Earth), Spirits (Air), Goblins (Fire) and Merfolk (Water). Furthermore, Elemental Clash:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a &amp;quot;Mini-Expansion&amp;quot; included in the game, Tribes offers an exciting new variant of play, with Spellcaster cards being introduced. Players can choose one out of the ten different Spellcasters included and build a deck around him or her. Each Spellcaster has a pre-set deck size, hand size and number of cards which you draw each turn as well as a permanent &amp;quot;Static Ability&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Flip Ability&amp;quot; which gives you a certain benefit once, but shuts down the &amp;quot;Static Ability&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring artwork of Enggar Adirasa and Andreas Propst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
