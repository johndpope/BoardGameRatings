			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Superguy Must Die!, or CSGMD! for short, is a storytelling role-playing game designed to be played as a longer one-shot, or a short campaign of several sessions. It borrows from superhero comic books, graphic novels and other media, to create a fun, cooperative-but-competitive gameplay. CSGMD! can be played using different settings and themes (some suggestions are given in chapter Four, but they are, of course, guidelines only). The one general rule is that the players take on the roles of supervillains: evil businessmen, mutants, aliens and criminal masterminds, united in a common goal - to destroy their arch-nemesis, Captain Superguy. This is not an easy task, however. Captain Superguy is powerful and all attempts to defeat him have come to naught. The time has come for an unlikely alliance...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game you will need at least four players, one of which will act as the Gamemaster for your session (or sessions), several 10-sided dice and some time before actually starting playing to generate your characters and the main Non-Player Character, Captain Superguy himself! Of course some time to play the game would be nice, too...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
