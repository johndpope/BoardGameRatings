							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GRIP: Basic Edition</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRIP (Generic Role-playing for Internet Players) is a set of personal gaming software that brings you all of the basic tools required to conduct a typical face-to-face role-playing session, and combines them with the power of networking to let you literally play any role-playing game with anyone, anywhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Internet, or a Local Area Network acting as an electronic version of a table, GRIP provides the electronic versions of the pencils, paper, character sheets, maps, dice, and other tools required for a good role-playing session. Communication between the Game Master and players is conducted via a text-based chat system, private whisper messages, and optional Voice Chat support with Roger Wilco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online role-playing, while not meant to replace traditional face-to-face gaming, actually offers a few benefits that are hard to match in a traditional setting. GRIP allows you to take full advantage of the multimedia capability of computers by incorporating images, sounds, and any other type of media or file into your adventures. These can then been sent as need to players during the course of the game, automatically opening and activating on the player's computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRIP's private Whisper messages sent between players and the Game Master avoid the awkward note passing and distracting whispers that can accompany face-to-face games. Such messages are passed silently and are only seen by the intended recipient, unknown to the other players (although the Game Master, of course, sees all whispers!). Game Masters can even request secret, mandatory dice rolls from players, perfect for saving throws, and other nefarious purposes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Basic Boxed Edition includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-56 page User's Manual&lt;br/&gt;-32 page Character Sheet Design Tutorial&lt;br/&gt;-Character Sheet Markup Language Quik-Reference Card&lt;br/&gt;-GRIP iGM (Game Master) Module&lt;br/&gt;-GRIP iPC (Player) Module&lt;br/&gt;-Grimshot's Gauntlet Fantasy Adventure for use with GRIP&lt;br/&gt;-A Simple Twist of Fate Science Fiction Adventure for use with GRIP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
