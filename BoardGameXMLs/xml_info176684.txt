			<description>Alewood is the semi-coop outlaw hunting drinking card game where your fight stats change with the amount in your pint glass. The only game where you never drink as a punishment and always drink on your own terms. Create synergistic card plays with your pint glass and inflict hilarious real time physical and spoken hindrances on your opponents. Work together to weaken the Outlaw&amp;rsquo;s gang but then steal the win with trick cards and manipulative tactics. It is a game of strategy, role playing and most importantly, drinking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE STORY&lt;br/&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing the people of Alewood know how to do, it&amp;rsquo;s drinking. But over the years, the Outlaws have taken over the town and the lawmen have become lazy. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible for an honest hardworking drunk to get a day&amp;rsquo;s work done with such an unruly mess. The good people of Alewood have had enough! The community leaders have banded together (over a pint) to form a vigilante committee and are now taking turns leading the courageous party into battle, passing the deputy's badge along with its responsibilities and perks. As the fight rages on stories will form, names will be remembered and people will talk. The group will fight together but only one of them will have their troubled story written into the history books. In Alewood, justice will be delivered by the wicked deeds of good people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PINT GLASS COMPONENT&lt;br/&gt;Your beverage will have a drink line that intersects with your character's drink meter. As you drink, your base fight stats will change. The use of cards can augment and alter your total stats but you glass will always be the root. When you finish your glass entirely, you earn a permanent upgrade to your character but there's only one of each kind so fight for your resource! Refills allow you to start your drink line back at the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TACTICAL AND SILLY&lt;br/&gt;Never wait for your turn! While the Active player token is being passed around, all other players can play or draw after the active player resolves their special action. Skill cards enhance your fighting stats while Hinders give players silly and slightly annoying physical challenges to upkeep. When they fail to follow their hinder card's text, they must discard from their hand, then from their character until they eventually have nothing left. Play cards on yourself or on your opponents, build alliances to protect you from harm and help take down the Outlaw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLE PLAYING&lt;br/&gt;Your TITLE is the culmination of everyone attached to your Character Card. Skills, Hinders and Upgrades all have descriptors that add to your characters flavor. You may start the game as the &amp;quot;Banker&amp;quot; but end up being the &amp;quot;Slack Jawed, Paranoid, Toe Tappin' Banker with a Score To Settle.&amp;quot; Hinders allows players to act out silly moments, sing songs or tell tall tales!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD&lt;br/&gt;Hinders may make your game difficult but also act as points of reputation during the end game. Players with captured Outlaws who have the the highest reputation (aka that hardest life) will win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
