			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane magic is a foundational element of tabletop fantasy. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re drawing upon the concepts of Vancian magic as interpreted by Gygax and Arneson, or embracing pseudo-historical tradition of Hermeticism, the ability to manipulate supernatural energy and cast spells is an important part of the genre. With no arcane magic we&amp;rsquo;d have no wizards, no enchanted arms and armor, and no magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, there might still be divine magic to make those things possible, that implies a whole different set of worldbuilding elements. Divine magic requires supernatural beings and deities willing to share their power in exchange for worship, sacrifices, and some degree of proselytizing. Arcane magic represents the ability of mortal beings to claim that power for themselves, and use it for their own purposes. It&amp;rsquo;s not merely a form of science and technology. It&amp;rsquo;s a form of agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the arcane is so essential to tabletop fantasy, we often take it for granted. It&amp;rsquo;s just there, like fresh aid and sunshine on a summer day. We don&amp;rsquo;t spend enough time thinking about why it&amp;rsquo;s there, who uses it, and how it has shaped the setting. This book will dive into ways that you can use arcane magic for character development, worldbuilding efforts, and adventure design. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll come out of it with a greater appreciation of this ever-present force in your fantasy universe, and new ways to utilize it to make your campaign stand out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the Foragers Guild Guide supplements are system-agnostic, this volume will delve more into the perceptions and archetypal racial capabilities of the arcane rather than their specific abilities. In places, some broad generalizations will be made. You should adapt the concepts to what best fits the mechanics, setting, and character that you&amp;rsquo;re working with inside the context of your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
