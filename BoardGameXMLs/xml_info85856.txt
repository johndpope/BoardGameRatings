			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years ago, EN Publishing released its best-ever selling d20 rulebook, Tournaments, Fairs, &amp;amp; Taverns. The book contained dozens of ways to include games and events found at... well, at tournaments, fairs, and taverns. From the expected martial contests such as jousting and archery, tavern games using cards or dice, to more exotic games such as The Everyman's Fireball, Squashgoblin, and magical competitions such as The Game of Forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we're bringing Tournaments, Fairs &amp;amp; Taverns kicking and screaming into 2010 with the first in a series of 4th Edition versions of the many things to be found in this classic book. We're kicking off with Archery Contests - a fairly basic type of competition, but one found in many home campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
