			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1524; Stage One: Mark Redacted; Stage Two: J Groves; Stage Three: Jonathan Hansen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about corporate culture, with a supernatural premise to exaggerate the satire. Players take on the role of new hires at Tapewood, Scrimshaw, and Scry-Wyrm Inc. As the most profitable and prestigious corporation in the world, competition for jobs at TS&amp;amp;S is rabid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What new hires quickly discover, however, is that TS&amp;amp;S owes its soaring success to shareholders who are not of this Earth. Survival at TS&amp;amp;S demands appeasing Those Below. That in turn demands sacrificing something of one's humanity in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The competition only heats up once you become an employee. Sales drudges through the worst corporate daily grind imaginable but enjoys a brotherhood in their suffering that the overlords in Management and Legal can only envy. Management flaunts their incredible wealth and prestige without shame, and yet depend on the inhuman machinations of Marketing and the cold robotic calculus of Accounting for that wealth. Human Resources has eyes and ears everywhere, and only the inhumanly strong survive in the bowels of Distrbution's warehouses. Every facet of &amp;quot;the Company&amp;quot; schemes against every other unless an outside force threatens to impinge on the bottom line. Then it's all hands to battle stations as TS&amp;amp;S unleashes the full fury of its power in white collar warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, one cannot actually die in a Hot Seat game. Unfortunately, there are many things in the corporate world far worse than death. Unsatisfactory performance can lead to termination, resulting in any number of terrible consequences for the hapless former employee. Left to drool in a mental hospital with a lobotomized memory, stranded in Mexican gang territory with only a severance package and no clothes, or &amp;quot;picked up&amp;quot; by a rival corporation and&amp;hellip;.forcibly volunteered to elicit TS&amp;amp;S's company secrets are all possible, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
