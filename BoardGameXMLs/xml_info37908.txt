			<description>So what is it all about? The Uncharted Lands is a fantasy combat game that uses 28mm scale white metal miniatures. But it is also MUCH more than just a range of well sculpted figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Uncharted Lands will act as the backdrop for all of our fantasy games, including our naval combat game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first races to be supported are Iron Dwarves and Orc Raiders. But we&amp;rsquo;re underway with our Humans and Dragon Lords. Shortly we will be making our Halfling Militia available and over time more races from The Uncharted Lands will appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing a set of rules for the game and we hope to have more news for you on when these rules will be available. Right now we have 9 packs of miniatures (5 Iron Dwarf and 4 Orc Raiders) complete, each with 4 figures for foot troops or 3 figures for command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have greens for new figures, including an Orc commander and his brutish bodyguard and a cannon and crew for the Dwarves. We are busy with the design of our Dragon Lords and Humans, both races we&amp;rsquo;re sure you&amp;rsquo;ll like when they arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time The Uncharted Lands will grow and new races will begin to unfold. The combination of naval game and land game is a novel one and we&amp;rsquo;re sure you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy both. The Gallery below will give you an idea of what our miniatures look like when painted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
