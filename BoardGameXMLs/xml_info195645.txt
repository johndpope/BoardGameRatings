			<description>Weird And Wonderful&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fiction and folklore are full of strange powers. Most of these are so familiar to us from comics, movies, games, and novels that they're &amp;quot;strange&amp;quot; only in the sense that we don't deal with them in our daily lives. Although this lack of evidence leads to disagreements over the details, every gamer has a clear personal picture of magic, psionics, super-powers, and similar phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But then there's the really strange stuff - the powers that push the limits of imagination itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Powers: The Weird is your guide to the mad science, uncanny realms, and bizarre superhuman abilities found in corners of fantasy, horror, and science fiction that attract labels like &amp;quot;bizarro,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;psychedelic,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;surreal.&amp;quot; It goes beyond safe stereotypes to explore powers that warp the human form, sanity, and reality itself. Take a look, if you dare, and unearth:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weird Science. Eleven structured styles of mad and fringe science - ranging from early psychical research and Frankensteinian experimentation to sci-fi nanotech and para-energetics - let you invent unlikely technologies, explore impossible realms, and tinker with the nature of life itself. What could go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weird Realms and Phenomena. Learn of novel ways to use familiar story elements such as outer space and time travel to put a bizarre twist on your campaign . . . and discover completely new strangeness like singularities and metaphysical realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weird Powers. The powers of Dimensional Control, Logos, Metamateriality, Mutation, Noumena, Para-Energy, Parasitism, and Void take GURPS Powers to the outer limits, with 65 fully worked sample abilities that push the boundaries of body, mind, and natural laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this comes with ample notes on the new and variant traits needed to think and act outside the box, plus plenty of advice to GMs who don't want to tether their campaigns to mere reality. Only one question is left unanswered: Can you handle the truth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
