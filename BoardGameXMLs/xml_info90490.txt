			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Lose Your Head is an introductory adventure for the Contagion Revised Edition.&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface it is no different than the world you and I live in. Most people go on about their lives never realizing the terrors that walk among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite humanity&amp;rsquo;s vast ignorance, the horrors are there. Monsters walk the night. Some of them are human: psychopaths and twisted, evil people much like those in the real world. Some of them are Hellspawn, monsters in service to demons. But even the Hellspawn have their servants&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Lose Your Head is an excellent introduction to the darker side of the Contagion setting. In this adventure, characters in league with demons are summoned on an errand to dispatch a rogue Hellspawn. The characters are given a task by a local demon, and left to their own devices. Don&amp;rsquo;t Lose Your Head deals with the seedy underbelly of any given city in the setting. This is a chance for players to cut loose, dwell among the filthy and the downtrodden, kick a little butt, and possibly come out of the ordeal with a bit of demonic favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Lose Your Head is designed for 4-6 players of 1st or 2nd level. People familiar with other role playing games will find something unusual in the design concept of Don&amp;rsquo;t Lose Your Head. Rather than being a linear module with events that go from point A to point B, this adventure offers a story seed. Basic events are illustrated, along with character snapshots. The ending is left open and ambiguous, for the Gamemaster to decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
