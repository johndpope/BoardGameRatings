			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the eleventh entry in our line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2334, Anderson and Felix were contracted by the newly formed Hub Federation Postal Service (Fedpost) to design and construct a fast mail courier with extended fuel capacity and as small a crew requirement as possible in order to deliver both electronic and physical mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several design options were presented for consideration over the following twelve months until the managing board of Fedpost approved a small one hundred displacement tonne courier with enough internal fuel for two Zimm transits of two parsecs and multiple in-system skip-transits. The mail courier design included a maneuver drive capable of a thrust of two gravities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fedpost Mail Courier is that design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 11: Fedpost Mail Courier comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The courier is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the courier comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Ships of Clement Sector 11: Fedpost Mail Courier also comes with a Fedpost career track to enable players to join this new and vibrant organization!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
