							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Satan&#039;s Hollow</name>
									
			<description>Satan's Hollow is a shoot 'em up arcade game released by Bally Midway in 1982, later converted in 1984 to Commodore 64. The gameplay draws similarities to Galaga from Namco. The player must destroy the flying formations of gargoyles in order to pick up pieces of a bridge that must be built over a river of lava. As the game progresses, the gargoyles begin to throw exploding eggs, along with rocks that can destroy bridge sections; the player also occasionally faces Satan's disembodied head that floats around the screen. In addition to firing rockets at the enemies, the player can use a shield that will destroy any enemy touching it. However, this shield can only be used for a short time before it must shut down to recharge. Gargoyles will sometimes attempt to steal a ship from the player's reserve lives, similar to Galaga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the bridge is completed, the player can immediately cross it to face Satan. Destroying him scores bonus points based on the number of waves completed to that point, and also upgrades the rocket launcher. The player then resumes the battle against the gargoyles and must start building a new, longer bridge in order to fight Satan again. The sky darkens on later waves, making it more difficult to see the enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was included on the Midway Arcade Treasures collection, rereleased in 2003 for Playstation 2, Gamecube and X-Box, and in 2004 for Windows. This games was created by Bill Adams who also was the lead programmer of Tron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License./wiki/Satan%27s_Hollow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
