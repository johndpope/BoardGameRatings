			<description>Board is one hexagonal shape pool. On this board can be played two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game is for 2 to 6 players. Each has one figurine. The initial position of each figurine is in one corner of the pool. In the water are placed colored balls. The task of each player is to push as many balls of a certain color in his corner of the pool. In addition, players can interfere with other players by pushing opponent's balls to distant parts of the pool. The winner is the player who first push all of his balls to his part of the pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game is for two players. Each player has 3 figurines (one dolphins,  and other seals). At the pool are placed goals. The teams play a game similar to water polo. Seals and dolphins push the ball forward while moving. They move by the number rolled on dice. After moving, the dice is rolled again, and player don't move figurines, but it can push off the ball forward from the figurine that is next to ball for the number rolled on dice. On that way, players try to score by pushing the ball into goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
