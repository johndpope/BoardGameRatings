							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Compulsion</name>
									
			<description>From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of COMPULSION is to manage $20,000 into a small fortune.  Strategies of conservative patience are pitted against those of high risk brinkmanship, as profits are realized through shrewd investment in the REAL WORLD, disciplined wagering at the TRACK, or natural luck in either sphere.  While players may choose to concentrate in one area, it is likely that they will test their skills and develop personal strategies for success both in REAL LIFE and at the TRACK.  However, certain compulsions, combined with the defensive play of others, may continually threaten even the best laid plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
