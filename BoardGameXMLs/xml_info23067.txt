			<description>Elaborate late sixties design consisting of a large plastic play mat about 40&amp;quot; square suspended off the ground using metal rods and wooden posts.  There is a centrally located raised plastic bowl type structure used for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have 3 thick plastic pucks which they place on the plastic play surface in designated positions.  Players must in turn try to whack these up into the scoring bowl (2 points/5 points in the center) using the equipment provided (tiny hard paddles on long wooden sticks).  Pucks that fall through certain holes in the play mat are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score when all pucks are either in the scoring bowl or have been eliminated is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
