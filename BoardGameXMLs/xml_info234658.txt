			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ratfink: Scurry &amp;amp; Scamper is a trick-taking, take-that action card game set in the walls and countertops of your house. Players are rats scurrying and scampering to amass the largest cheese hoard, while trying to stick their fellow rats with the biggest pile of traps, known as Finks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must use action cards strategically to change trump, improve their hand, or steal cheese from other players if they failed to take any tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Don't like the Dealer's choice of Trump? Play a card to challenge it!&lt;br/&gt;     Need a better hand? Play a card to draw extra cards or steal from others! &lt;br/&gt;     Failed to take a Trick during the hand? Play a card to steal cheese from another player!&lt;br/&gt;     Have too many Finks? There's a card for that too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with 7 cards dealt to each player. One less card is dealt each hand making it increasingly more difficult to take a trick. Every time you take a trick you add a piece of cheese to your hoard. Take the most tricks in a hand to be Dealer for the next hand so you can call the Trump! If you fail to take any tricks for a hand you receive a Fink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner after 7 rounds is whoever has the least number of Finks. If there's a tie it goes to the player with the largest cheese hoard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to avoid getting Finked, hoard the most cheese and scurry your way to victory? Step up to the maze and enter if you dare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
