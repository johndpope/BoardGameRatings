			<description>This game consist of ten different game variants to learn numbers and some basic math. The main components are foam numbers from 0 to 9. There are two pieces of every number and plus, minus and equality signs. Basic idea is to recognize numbers by feeling them in your hand. To prevent you from seeing the numbers, you construct bigger box from the game box and two cardboard walls. Those walls have an hole to put your hand into the box. Hole is covered with cloth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic idea of the games is to find the wanted number(s) from the box. Some examples: 1. You have to pick up numbers in ascending order. 2. You throw 12 sided die and you have to find two numbers that add up to the result. 3. You pick up a tile with a two digit number and find corresponding numbers. And so on. In most advanced games you have to add or subtract numbers or you have to recognize number sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
