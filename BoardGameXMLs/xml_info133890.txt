			<description>Mad Blocker Alpha (also known as Mad Blocker Alpha: Revenge of the Fluzzle's or MBA) is a puzzle game for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 in the PlayStation Minis section of the PlayStation Store, developed and published by Open Emotion Studios. It was released on February 9, 2011 in Europe and April 19, 2011 in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a contemporary take on the classic falling block-style puzzle game made famous by such classics as Tetris and Columns. In Mad Blocker Alpha, players can move the blocks horizontally but not vertically and instead must rack up large combinations of blocks, to trigger chains and unlock power ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's story revolves around a race of creatures called Fluzzle's, who hail from a fictional place called Machu Popyu. Evil creatures called Mokes have infected the world and have turned it into an industrial wasteland. A mysterious stranger entices the Fluzzles to leave Machu Popyu and use their magical, shape morphing to resurrect the long dormant, Great Buhmba, and rejuvenate the lands, thus defating the Mokes. The game features hand drawn cutscenes that guide the player through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad Blocker Alpha is a distinct variation on the classic matching genre. In the game you have to match 4 or more of the same coloured blocks together to pop them. Players are encouraged to stack large numbers of blocks, methodically with the intention of triggering large chains. When chains occur a roulette style device at the side of the screen spins and determines whether or not players should be entitled to a power up. The power ups in the game are both negative and positive. The positive blocks include the mad block, which destroys every block that is the same colour as the block it falls upon. The concrete block which destroys everything in a row vertically. The bomb block which explodes in a cross shape and destroys blocks in its path. The negative blocks include the bad blocks, sick green moke blocks that turn an entire row of the players screen to desaturons (or dead blocks) which can only be destroyed with chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mad Blocker Alpha&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
