			<description>Modern Day Gladiators (MDG) is a pro wrestling-themed game that brings many of the aspects of the wrestling world to bear in one, simple game mechanic. Using a normal deck of playing cards (and a 12-sided dice if you prefer to roll dice instead of flip cards), with a few simple charts that also follow the same mechanic, you can play out a myriad of matches where wrestler's do all the moves you see on TV.&lt;br/&gt; With MDG, you can play solo - booking matches, running segments and interviews, &amp;amp; playing out the matches with run-ins from other wrestlers (or not) - all of which go into making a wrestling show.  The only difference? You won't know how this script is going to play out. Those matches and segments will affect the company you are trying to run, growing it into a global phenomen or watching it crumble before your eyes.&lt;br/&gt; Of course, you can also play in a group adding one, very important element - each person takes the role (or several roles) of a wrestler. Narrate a segment or cut a promo on your opponent and it will impact the mechanics of the game and your wrestler&amp;rsquo;s options in the ring. And once the bell rings, not only does the mechanics allow you to choose what moves your wrestler does, but it gives you a beginning set of tactics drawn from the real-life wrestling world, tactics to attempt (each with their own advantages and disadvantages). As for those not directly involved in the match, they'll be the crowd and impact the match in a very real way.&lt;br/&gt; This FULL RULEBOOK adds several different match-types (cage, extreme, tag, triangle, battle royal). In addition, the advanced rules continue adding depth by introducing aspects to the game mechanic that turn up the realism such as: Counter ability, Weight &amp;amp; Height, Manager's impact, Intimidation,  Stamina (fatigue, injury, tag team fatigue, wearing an opponent down, wrestling with injuries), blood, referees that impact the match, wrestler's individual advantages &amp;amp; disadvantages, how to make a wrestler and let him grow into an Icon of the wrestling world as well as a world for that wrestler to exist - including 21 original, fully illustrated wrestlers existing within a backdrop as wide-open as your imagination.  This world is constantly growing with at least 4 expansions already planned within the game's 1st year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
