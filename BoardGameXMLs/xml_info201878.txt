							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Cauldron Full of Mischief</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allan's roommate, Jeremy, came home from an energy drink launch party last night but this morning he is missing. His car keys and cellphone are still by his bed. Jeremy never leaves without them and this has Allan concerned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, Barbara was very upset when her granddaughter&amp;rsquo;s college application was denied.  Strangers from out of town can get an education but not a local girl like Brittany. Suddenly, Barbara gives in to the temptation of using a strange recipe she found tucked in between the pages of a romance novel bought at the local bookstore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is going on and where is Jeremy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cauldron Full Of Mischief drops you into a quirky mystery that is easily played in a single session or can be the springboard into a great campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the adventure are 5 pregenerated characters as well as two 8 1/2&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; size copies of locations from Fabled Environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
