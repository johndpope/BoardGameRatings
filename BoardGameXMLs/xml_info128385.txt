			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM'S RESOURCE by Richard Green and Liz Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, your PCs have emerged from the dungeon ready to celebrate their victory or raise tankards to their fallen comrades. Returning to town they ask &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s the tavern like, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At that point, likely or not the GM glosses over the tavern or wildly improvises!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unsurprisingly, PCs spend a lot of their time between adventures relaxing in taverns and inns, but often such locales end up being drab, one-dimensional affairs with no real characteristics or flavour of their own. So What&amp;rsquo;s The Tavern Like, Anyway? banishes this problem by presenting dozens of tables covering the tavern&amp;rsquo;s offering, customers and staff along with extensive notes on games of chance, drinking songs and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
