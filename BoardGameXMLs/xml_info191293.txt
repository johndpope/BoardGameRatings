			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanctuary's Edge is a futuristic sci-fi roleplaying game that tells the story of humanity&amp;rsquo;s struggle for survival on a harsh and unforgiving world set in an unknown future, on the face of a world that has forgotten the touch of civilisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can step into the shoes of one of the many individuals that try to make their way on Sanctuary. The intrepid explorer, coin-counting mercenary, visionary pioneer, meticulous researcher, fast-talking socialite, or the ingenious inventor &amp;ndash; these are just some of the many characters players can stick into one adventure after another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character can pick from one or more or Sanctuary&amp;rsquo;s Edge five distinct fully-customisable 'Characters Professions': the hardy Soldier, the stealthy Outrider, the cunning Conman, the analytical Academic or the resourceful Techie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on a proprietary BUILD system, combat is fast and fluid, making players capable of astounding, visceral feats all in the space of a few heartbeats, while still allowing for intricate social scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Sanctuary is as diverse as it is dangerous. The mighty Five Factions that dominate the planet wage a savage not-so-cold war against one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locked in a perpetual stalemate, their chess pieces are many. But for how long can the uneasy balance endure? They eye each other warily, sharpening claws and flexing muscles, waiting to pounce. Who will come out on top and emerge as victor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will it be the disciplined New Jherico, the enterprising Gauldenaand, the traditional Haven of Misu, the diplomatic United Awakened Territories or the divinely-mandated Immovable Empire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What of the smaller piranhas in the pool that swim with the sharks &amp;ndash; the myriad of profiteering corporations, strong-arm security armies, and technologically-adept combines? What niche will they carve out when the chips are down? Only time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come join us on Sanctuary, and welcome to the Expanse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
