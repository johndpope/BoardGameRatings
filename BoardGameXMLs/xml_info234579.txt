			<description>Crazy Commute is a competitive party game for 3 to 5 players. The rock-paper-scissor mechanics make it a fast-paced and easy to learn game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose their driver cards to represent them on the play surface and proceed to try to pass each other. When player attempts to pass another player, their target might steal a card from them and allow them to pass...or they might start a duel, requiring both players to play certain cards to win the duel and collect a point. The player who wins 7 duels first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
