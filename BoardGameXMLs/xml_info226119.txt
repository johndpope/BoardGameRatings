			<description>Now live on Kickstarter: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/639064444/realm-master-a-board-game-of-dice-domination-and-m?ref=bggforums&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/639064444/realm-master-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wizard, a dwarf, an elf, a warrior, a squire and a princess battle it out for control of &amp;quot;the realm&amp;quot;, made up of 4 regions chosen randomly. Each adventurer has a special power. A round starts with a random event and then players take it in turns rolling 6 dice, hoping to collect gold (useful for buying weapons, equipment, banners or curses), swords (for attacking opponents), hearts (for healing the damage) and half-banners (basically two of these = one victory point but one on its own is useless) There is also a blank side and a wildcard side. Players have one chance to re-roll any dice they don't like. Control of the realm enables players to gather more resources but also makes them vulnerable to attack. There can only ever be one player in the realm. There are two versions of the game: an elimination version (win by collecting 10 banners or eliminating everyone else) and a points version (players who lose all their life lose half their resources and re-spawn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
