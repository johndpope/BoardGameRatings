			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2-4+ players. Each player represents a University.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players play as one of two types of universities: &amp;quot;A Public University gets to draw 1 extra card on its first turn. A Private University may put 1 specialty card into play during the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck includes five types of cards: School, Facility, Title, Specialty, and Event Cards. Event Cards have various effects. All of the other cards are used to describe characteristics of the player's university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;School Cards come in six suits: Associates Degree, Bachelors Degree, Masters Degree, Doctorate Degree, Research Institution, and World Class Institution. Each suit is worth a different amount of Curriculum Points.
