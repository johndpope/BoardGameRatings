			<description>The game board is a kind of seesaw which can hold metal balls. Each player has four balls:&lt;br/&gt;- 2 small ones &lt;br/&gt;- a medium one (weighing twice as much)&lt;br/&gt;- a large one (weighing three times as much as the small ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player has to create an imbalance, the other player has to restore balance. If he or she fails to to so, the first player can do it and gain a point. In the basic game, five points win. &lt;br/&gt;There are several variants as well, some including a die which determines the amount of moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
