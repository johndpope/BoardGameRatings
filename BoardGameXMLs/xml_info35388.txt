							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Playoff Hockey</name>
									
			<description>A simple game that has a small wooden block with a painted surface that resembles an ice hockey rink as the playing surface, and contains holes for a peg that represents the puck.  Players roll three special dice, one for passing, one for shooting and another face-offs.  Each die has different outcomes displayed on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose the length of game themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes in a clear 4x3 box, and so is good for travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 7 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
