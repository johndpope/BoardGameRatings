							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wandering Merchant</name>
									
			<description>In The Wandering Merchant, players play the roles of merchants buying and selling goods. They drive carts pulled by horses transporting them between small villages separated by dangerous wilderness areas in a fantasy setting. The goal is to be the first player to earn a fixed amount of money. Players can also upgrade their carts to transport more goods per trip or buy more horses to travel faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry to the Good Portsmanship contest in March 2007, and it's based of Merchant of Venus by Richard Hamblen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
