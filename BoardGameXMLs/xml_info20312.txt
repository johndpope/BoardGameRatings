			<description>LIGHTHOUSE-OPOLY, a fun way for young and old alike to learn about our nation&amp;rsquo;s lighthouses and the keepers who kept the lights ablaze through dangerous storms, dense fog and darkest night.&lt;br/&gt;In LIGHTHOUSE-OPOLY players buy famous sentinels from coast to coast, acquire keeper&amp;rsquo;s cottages and trade them in for lighthouses. Sounds easy but add restoration fees and lose a few turns for failed inspections and it becomes a little more difficult and a lot more fun! Each deed back contains fun facts about each lighthouse. Did you know that Michigan&amp;rsquo;s Old Presque Isle Light is haunted? Even though the lantern room is empty folks swear a light still shines from the tower. Draw another card and you may discover an image of Maine&amp;rsquo;s Nubble Light is on the spacecraft Voyager. It&amp;rsquo;s all fun and games until you&amp;rsquo;re sent to Alcatraz Island locked up till another roll of the dice sets you free. So gather friends and family. Choose your token. Who knows? You may become Head Keeper&amp;hellip;or elected president of Boon Island&amp;hellip;but you better not let the goat in the garden or it&amp;rsquo;s a big fine for you!&lt;br/&gt;Pewter tokens include: A Lantern, Captain's Wheel, Ship, Keeper's Cap, Bell, and Buoy&lt;br/&gt;For 2-6 players, ages 8 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
