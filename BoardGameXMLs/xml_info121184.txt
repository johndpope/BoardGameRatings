			<description>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a 2002 cross-platform video game developed based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. WXP developed the game for Xbox, while Surreal developed the PC and PlayStation 2 version, and Pocket Studios delevoped the game for Game Boy Advance. All three versions of the game are published by Black Label Games, an imprint of Vivendi Universal Interactive. Unlike the subsequent games published by Electronic Arts, The Fellowship of the Ring game was not designed as a tie-in to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy that was being released around the same time. The game received mixed to average reviews, earning a score of 59/100 based on 19 reviews at Metacritic, whilst IGN gave it 7.5/10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game Boy Advance version was released in September 2002 to North American audiences, and to Europe two months later. It greatly differed from its counterparts on other consoles, most notably for its RPG-style turn based battle system. However, the game was poorly received by critics. Most of the complaints came from the extremely slow gameplay, as well as the first few characters being comparatively weak, this is made up for later on when the rest of the Fellowship become available, but doesn't last, as Frodo is the only available character in the final mission of the game. It was also notorious for its poor quality; the game contained many glitches which greatly hindered the player's progress and sometimes even forced them to restart the entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
