							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elements of Arkandia</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elements of Arkandia is a cross between an RPG and a puzzle game.  You father has saddled the family shop with a large debt and left you in charge.  To obtain items to sell you go on adventures and fight evil combatants.  These battles are driven by playing a match-3 type game, matching up three or more symbols to earn mana, gold points, treasure points and rage points.  You cannot attack the enemy until you have enough points accumulated in the relevant stat.  When an adventure is complete you can equip any useful items to make your character stronger in combat and place any unwanted items on sale in your shop.  With your gold you decide whether to level up your character or make a payment on the shop's debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
