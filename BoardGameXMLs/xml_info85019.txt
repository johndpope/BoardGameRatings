			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curse of the Pharaoh: Napoleon`s Secret is an exciting adventure game in which you play the role of Anna, an archaeologist, and your task is to discover a mystery that may link Napoleon to Nefertiti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get to investigate nine worlds each of which is divided into six areas. The worlds include places such as Egypt or the Basilica San Marco, and in each area within these worlds you get to either locate differences between two identical screens, or locate hidden objects which are cleared from a list of items as you locate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also coins to be found, as well as parts of  the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s mask, which are subsequently placed properly so as to complete a puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
