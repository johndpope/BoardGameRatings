							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spot Goes to Hollywood</name>
									
			<description>Spot Goes to Hollywood is a platform video game released by Virgin Interactive for the Mega Drive/Genesis as the sequel to Cool Spot. It utilizes an isometric graphics system to provide a pseudo-3D playing experience. The player controls Spot, once the mascot for the 7 Up soft drink, as he travels to various places trying to free his friends. Spot has somehow become trapped in a movie projector. As he jumps from film to film, he encounters many classic film genres; these make up the various levels of the game. The main levels are a pirate movie, an adventure movie, and a horror movie, but there are many other bonus films to unlock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Spot Goes To Hollywood&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
