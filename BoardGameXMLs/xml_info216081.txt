							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Clinging Shade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The happy bride killed on her wedding day. The soldier who dies after the war is won. The long-waiting mother who succumbs in the childbirth bed. These sorts are the soil from which the Clinging Shade springs. Whenever players brush against an ironic tragedy, they should be wary. There&amp;rsquo;s always a chance that the victim will linger to haunt them and bring about their own terrible demise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, when a person has their life unjustly taken from them, their spirit refuses to pass on to their next plane of existence and they become a Clinging Shade. Struggling endlessly to sate a yearning that can&amp;rsquo;t be fulfilled, the Clinging Shade becomes obsessed with an individual among the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a person has been chosen as the object of its demented obsessions, the Clinging Shade will relentlessly pursue them. Oftentimes, months will pass before it ever reveals itself. As time presses on however, the Shade will only grow bolder and its actions more extreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
