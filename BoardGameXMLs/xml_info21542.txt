							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Read and Rhyme Memory Match</name>
									
			<description>This game is published by Judy/Instructo, a division of Frank Schaffer Publications, Inc.  It appears to be recommended for children Ages 5 - 8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 10 nursery rhyme cards and 30 word cards.  The word cards are shuffled and spread face down.  Each player chooses a nursery rhyme card and places it in front of him or her.  Players take turns picking up a word card and reading it aloud.  If the word rhymes with the boldfaced word on his or her nursery rhyme card, the player keeps it and takes another turn.  The game continues until one player has collected all three words for his or her nursery rhyme.  That player must then read the proper completed nursery rhyme to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
