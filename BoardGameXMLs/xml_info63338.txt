			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeologists, historians, and treasure hunters have long sought the ancient artifacts of the world.  But many who ventured too close to such treasures never returned from their quests, for they fell victim to dense jungles, fanatic cults, or strange, mystical forces.  Recently, however, the journal of one such archaeologist has been unearthed, and its secrets are revealed here for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each artifact's entry contains its description, value, last known location, history, and powers.  In addition, the gamermaster will find a list of parties currently seeking the artifact, rumors and legends concerning its whereabouts, and adventure ideas for integrating it into a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artifacts is an invaluable asset to any who dare to seek the great treasures of history.
