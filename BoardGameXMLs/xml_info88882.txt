			<description>On a secluded island two of the most unlikely people find themselves locked in a dungeon. Who captured them and why? And what is this place anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE DUO&lt;br/&gt;Take control of two main characters, alternating between one and the other. At first they will keep fighting, but hopefully, with time, they'll learn to be more... accommodating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ESCAPE&lt;br/&gt;Help them escape their cells, find their way around the castle and discover who's behind the capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ADVENTURE&lt;br/&gt;Explore 23 locations, inside and outside of the castle. From the dungeon to the towers. Climb ropes, move bridges, pick locks and learn how to mix the amazing Tummy Tonic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
