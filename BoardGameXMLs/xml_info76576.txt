							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Beasts I</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Including over 60 creatures for your Resolute games, the Book of Beasts I gives you a wide range of foes, including such classic beasts as werewolves, vampires, dragons and giants, while also describing a variety of unique creatures to the lands of Arvandoria, each with notes about its role in the realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organized by creature type and level, this handy guide will prove indispensable for referees. Each section also includes setting-specific beast backgrounds: want to know about the rulers of the Unseelie Court? Curious about why dragons hoard treasure? Ever wonder about the best use for gorgon&amp;rsquo;s eyes? The monster sidebars will tell you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a brief guide to improvising monsters, allowing referees to quickly generate new foes on the fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all Resolute resources, this book is only $1, but is jam-packed with goodness to keep your Resolute game going strong! Your purchase includes not only the fully-illustrated landscape version for your laptop, but also includes a printer-friendly portrait edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook is designed for use with Resolute: Towers of Arvandoria, but is also fully-compatible with Resolute: The Superhero RPG 2E, allowing you to challenge your superheroes with mythological monsters with no modifications needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
