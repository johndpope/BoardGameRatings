							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Three Chipmunks Acorn Hunt</name>
									
			<description>The goal of the game is to collect the most acorns. Each player places a plastic tree stump on the circles at the top of the game board and hides the acorns he or she collects under it. Players move their playing pieces to spots on the board designated by spinning a spinner and collecting the acorns there. Some spaces contain special instructions that the players have to follow immediately. When players reach their tree stumps they count their acorns. Player with the most acorns wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game series based on the David Seville singing chipmunks. Other entries included Cross Country and Big Record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
