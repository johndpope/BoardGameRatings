							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Harvick</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This week we present to you PS7 &amp;ndash; City of Harvick. After a restful time in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Point you begin to hear rumors of some &amp;ldquo;lost city&amp;rdquo; being discovered. After speaking with some of the locals and visiting the library you become intrigued. Apparently Harvick was abandoned during the plague years and its riches were never recovered. Along with the regular valuables one would find in an abandoned city, it is rumored that an ancient artifact or two may also be present. Sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s time to strap on the adventuring gear and take a look around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Provincia Campaign for a group of 4-6 adventurers that are level 5-7.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
