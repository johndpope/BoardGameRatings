			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make a Deal With a Devil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occult rituals, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, bring magic to the masses, with lengthy and difficult to perform magical rites which can be performed even by non-spellcasters, but which come with a cost, as well as the risk for terrible backlash to occur for those who meddle in things they do not understand. Unlike traditional spells, only a handful of occult rituals made it into that book however, which begs the question of what other strange and unknowable rituals might be lurking about in obscure tomes lost to history and memory. Tomes like this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a collection of 10 brand new occult rituals for use in your game, all of which are thematically linked to devils, the fires of Hell, and all things infernal. Presented in the guise of a fictitious tome that player characters might stumble across, the book also includes a flavorful introductory section that can be read aloud or handed out to players, and suggestions for how to incorporate the book into your game. The rituals in this book allow players (or nefarious NPCs) to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cause a massive archway leading to Hell to rise up from the ground, creating earthquakes and issuing forth infernal hosts.&lt;br/&gt;    Conjure bearded devils to serve as bodyguards, or an imp to serve as a familiar.&lt;br/&gt;    Transform your enemies into hideous and pathetic lemures.&lt;br/&gt;    Make a pact that barters your soul for arcane might.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
