			<description>In the dark tunnels and caves far below the surface of our world, evil creatures lurk in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;Some of them, such as the cunning dark elves, have developed a civilization &amp;ndash; and in every successful civilization games are played, so the masterminds can sharpen their wits, while the lower townsmen have their share of distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arachne is such a game: While you can find some elements of the chess game played by the surface dwellers, there are quite a lot of differences, too:&lt;br/&gt;First of all, as a devotion to the Spider Goddess, Arachne is played on the strands of a spider web. Also, the cruel and traitorous nature of the dark elves is reflected in Arachne, too: Aside from being able to capture his own playing pieces, each turn, a player gets the option to move and to capture with an opposing playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;So, whatever you plan; always be aware, that the true enemy strikes from within!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been created during the 2016 One Page PNP Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
