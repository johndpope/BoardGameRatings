			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great kingdom of Dardarrick, the Lion of Nuera, is a powerful nation that sits at the very heart of freedom and civilised life. Such a prized position unfortunately and opposing kingdoms and nations push in against them from all sides. The army and various border militias are on constant lookout for threats originating from the outside of the Dardarrian territory but there are other things that they must be wary of as well- dangers from within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the smooth and seamless functionality of the Dardarrian way of life, throughout the cities and the rural places there is something darker lurking. Cults, secret clubs, elitist societies- all of these things exist under the skin of the great Lion. Like parasites sucking away at its hide, they thrive in the out of the way places and scatter at the first sign of being discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies Within tears away the veil from these hidden groups and reveals them to readers of the Wraith Recon series of gaming supplements. Whether they are straightforward enemies that work against the good will of Dardarrick, more subtle manipulators of its people or something entirely different, they are just as dangerous as any Lornish army invasion or Torresh crusade. They might be more so- they are already at home within Dardarrick&amp;rsquo;s borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook focuses upon the use of cults and secret societies in Wraith Recon games or any other chronicle based in the world of Nuera. How they work, who they work with, for and why are just some of the things this book will show to readers. It is a guide to the unknown dangers that Wraith Recon must deal with on its own soil- the types of threats that the public must be spared knowledge of. The book illuminates the enemy in a different light, and gives Wraith Recon Games Masters a host of new adventure and mission assignment ideas for use in their own games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
