							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Top Banana Game</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game made by Waddingtons for Blue Label Fyffes Brand of bananas. Fyffes were the most famous supplier of bananas in Britain, mainly thanks to a catchy TV advert featuring the slogan &amp;quot;Unzip a Banana&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Banana is based on the Banana Industry, its pitfally and its successes. You travel around the banana-shaped board, buying plantations and then shipping your produce to the marketplace in Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is a familiar type of game, suggested by Monopoly, income is dependent on that which you can raise by making and selling (there is no &amp;quot;Collect 200 when you pass go&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The richest player wins if 'time' is called or if that player is the only one still in business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
