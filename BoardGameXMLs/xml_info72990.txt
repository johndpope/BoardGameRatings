							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Himmelveil Sewers</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Himmelveil Sewers is the foundational, fantasy sewer infrastructure setting you&amp;rsquo;ve been dreaming of (if you dream of sewers that is...gross!)! A setting of previously unheard of modularity and flexibility, two years in the making!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing WorldWorksGames exclusive TerrainlinX system, Sewers allows you to create true multi-leveled sewer layouts which sit below Himmelveil Streets! Layouts can be built to any configuration and to any height. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just static boxes and inflexibly structured building shapes; this is a reusable tool-set and an endless torrent of possibilities in all shapes, sizes and dimensions. And best of all, when you&amp;rsquo;re done everything stores flat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It almost seems silly to mention this in passing but Himmelveil Sewers is also automated craft cutter friendly! An industry first for this type of terrain product!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the bustling streets of Himmelveil is a murky world of twisting tunnels and foul odours. A refuge for thieves, cutthroats and worse and a highway for contraband, this dank domain is home to some of the most deadly dangers any would-be adventurers are ever likely to face. Better keep your wits about you... if the stink doesn't get you, the rats surely will...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate companion set to Streets of Himmelveil, Himmelveil Sewers contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 11 6&amp;quot;x6&amp;quot; floors in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * 8 3&amp;quot;x6&amp;quot; floors in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * 12 3&amp;quot;x3&amp;quot; floors in 1&amp;quot;, 1.5&amp;quot; and gridless formats&lt;br/&gt;    * 6&amp;quot; and 3&amp;quot; balconies&lt;br/&gt;    * 6&amp;quot; and 3&amp;quot; balcony supports&lt;br/&gt;    * 6&amp;quot; and 3&amp;quot; plug-in railings&lt;br/&gt;    * 8 3&amp;quot; walls in flat and our exclusive Anti-Warp format&lt;br/&gt;    * 8 6&amp;quot; walls in flat and exclusive our Anti-Warp format&lt;br/&gt;    * Short angled wall in flat and our exclusive Anti-Warp format&lt;br/&gt;    * Long angled wall in flat and our exclusive Anti-Warp format&lt;br/&gt;    * 6 varieties of corner posts&lt;br/&gt;    * GSD automated cutting support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
