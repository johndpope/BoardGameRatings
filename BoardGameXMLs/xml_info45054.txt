			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Ruined Town was destroyed long time ago by an evil warlord who defeated the Lord of the Town and sacked the whole country.&lt;br/&gt;Since the people were all killed or driven off, no one cared to reconstruct the town, which is now crumbling on itself. The Ruined Town has become a haunted and scaring place; old names were changed by local countrymen to reflect the spectral surroundings of the town. So, the Willow Cemetery become the Bones Hill Cemetery, the Hill of Sunray become the Hill of the Haunting Spectre and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, monsters made their lairs in the numerous dungeons and caverns of the town, at least where no undeads were discovered. Many evil beings, such as necromancers, black priests and the like, chose the town as their base of operations. Bandits settled in ruined castles of the town and smugglers use the crumbling docks of the town for loading/unloading smuggled goods.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
