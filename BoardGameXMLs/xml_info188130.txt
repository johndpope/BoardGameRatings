			<description>In Escape from Alcatraz four inmates are working together to try and escape from Alcatraz prison and eventually the island.  The inmates only have 60 days to accomplish this goal before they are transferred to another prison.  To win the game at least three inmates must successfully escape the prison and get off the island without getting caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each day is broken into two phases: morning and afternoon.  Inmates will either spend the entire day at a specific location or can visit two separate locations; one in the morning and another in the afternoon.  Players control the actions of each of the four inmates during the two phases of the day and determine what actions they will take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from Alcatraz is 1-4 player Co-op worker placement game where all the players work together to break out of the prison and escape the island. If any one of the players gets caught the game is over. At least three player players must escape the prison and island to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
