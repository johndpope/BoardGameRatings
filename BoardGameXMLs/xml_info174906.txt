Humans, far from innocent, perpetuate unspeakable evils onto one another for fun, profit, or simply because they don&amp;rsquo;t know any better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While some of these people may avoid punishment and accounting for their transgressions throughout life, all are eventually judged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those whose souls are found wanting are condemned to be punished in Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inferno is a sourcebook that details the history of the Demonic Host and the realm of Hell.
