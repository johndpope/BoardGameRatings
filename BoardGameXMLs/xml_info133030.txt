							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farmtopia</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farmtopia is based on George Orwell's novel Animal Farm. In it, a group of intelligent farm animals overthrow the farmer and his family and try to run the farm for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the game is to explore the power struggles, and the moral and practical problems which arise out of revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introduction assumes you are familiar with roleplaying games and roughly how they work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 3-5 players. Each player must choose and name a farm animal that they will play. One player must volunteer to be the Instigator, the animal who leads the revolution against the farmer, but the other animals will certainly be involved one way or another, and may turn out to be more important in the new order than the Instigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is GMless. Instead of having a single GM, each player takes a turn directing a scene (i.e. saying where the scene is, who is present for it, and roughly what the scene is about).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During scenes, conflict resolution is handled collectively, by a sort of voting system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
