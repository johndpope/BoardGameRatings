							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost Raven Watch</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost Raven Watch is a 1&amp;quot;=5' map for post apocalyptic settings.  It is a military base built recently in the wastelands by a highly advanced, disciplined military organization with lots of resources to spare.  In your campaign, they can be either a force for good, or a force for evil.  Or they can be the very organization your PC's are a part of, and this is their base of operations as they explore the wastelands beyond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raven Watch may have been built using slave labor, or it may have been built by educated members of the organization that owns it.  The builders may have recently left a bunker or vault with knowledge from the old world (engineering, architecture, construction techniques and materials, heavy equipment operation and repair, etc.) , or they may be common survivors that have learned architecture and building techniques in their travels through the wastes.  For that matter, they may be slaves themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter how it got here, the outpost is advanced.  Recycled materials were used as much as possible (which can be seen in the floors and on the rooftops), but new cement foundations were laid for the outpost, to include cement walls, and each of the towers have thick panes of glass on the tops, allowing for good views of the surrounding landscape without fear of what the weather might be doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the technology found here may or may not be found elsewhere in the world.  From the fusion generators that power the facility, to the AeroChopper found on the landing pad.  The organization running Outpost Raven Watch could be very progressive indeed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use this outpost as a starting point for your players (if you decide to make them a part of this shadowy organization), or this can be a place where the players are captured and brought too to await processing and transfer to some other part of the wastelands.  Or they could be required to assault the outpost, or infiltrate it using stealth.  There is a lot of potential here, both dangerous and rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map pack contains three levels -  Ground level, the second level, and a third level showing the rooftops and tower tops of the installation.  A print key is included to assist you with printing out smaller sections of the map if you choose not to do the entire thing (and each level is as big as most Stoneworker Cartography maps, so it is recommended you only print out what you need), as well as keys for figuring out which rooms are which within the facility.  And as always, there are VTT maps of each level included for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    67.5&amp;quot; x 80&amp;quot; in size.  Print out only what you need using the included print key.&lt;br/&gt;    Square Grid and No Grid versions, as well as a NO DECORATION version.&lt;br/&gt;    Full Color Version &amp;ndash; This is a printer intensive, full color version of this map.&lt;br/&gt;    Black and White version &amp;ndash; A black and white version, meant to be the least printer intensive.&lt;br/&gt;    Daytime lighting complete with shadows to give the map depth.&lt;br/&gt;    VTT Maps - Sized for use with any virtual table top software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
