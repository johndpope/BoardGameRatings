							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Burden&#039;s Peak</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sitting proudly, like an unfound jewel in the middle of a dark world, is the bustling city of Burden's Peak. This Point-of-Light setting for use with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition rules is a complete adventuring accessory. Entire campaigns can be played within Burden's Peak towering walls. Guilds can be joined, shops can be visited, and the vast, mysterious underground of the city can be explored. Complete with new monsters, full-color maps, and fully-realized NPCs, Burden's Peak is the perfect city-based setting for the new edition of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future, look for exciting expansions for Burden's Peak, including the entire layout and description for the dark, labyrinth-like Undermaze and detailed descriptions of the city's outside surroundings. Towering mountains, deep forests, foul swamps, and rolling plains encircle the secluded city, posing as a secure barrier to outside invasions, but harboring enough dangerous enemies to be a powerful threat by themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
