			<description>The playing pieces for this games are of different shapes, each made of five cubes glued together. There are six different shapes, each in one color. Additionally, the game contains a color die, two building bases and some scoring chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bases are placed on the table and a handful of pieces are stacked onto them. However, the bases aren't straight, so the pieces have to interlock to avoid falling. Players take turns to roll a die, take a piece in the corresponding color and adding it to either of the two structures. For each row of cubes that is added, the player scores a point. An additional point is scored for adding to the higher of the two towers. Points are deducted when a tower collapses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last piece has been added to the tower. The player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
