							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Illusionist&#039;s Daughter</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for 4-6 characters, levels 7-9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along a cold, inhospitable coastline lies the tiny village of Stormy Shore, where resides an old illusionist, Delthis, and his seventeen-year-old daughter. Delthis lost his beloved wife to a plague 10 years ago, and devoted his life to raising his daughter, Liriandra. Liranandra became a rare beauty with tremendous magical potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two years ago, a band of mercenaries passed through Stormy Shore, short on coin and morals, recently deserted from a distant war. Their charismatic and opportunistic leader, Ladathus, convinced Delthis to hire him and his band as bodyguards. Ladathus immediately wanted Liriandra for himself, but he kept his lusts a secret when he saw how devoted to her Delthis was. As time passed, his lust became and obsession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
