			<description>Description from the publisher (translated):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Learn English children will have a fun experience while learning through playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn English can be played for fun, but has been though up as an entertaining supplement to English teaching in the lower grades (0th to 3rd grade). The game is based on the thought that younger children learn best when they do so by their own choice, and remember best when they learn through playing. With Learn English children will be challenged on their own level, so they will learn actively, inquisitively and playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing is a good way to learn, and especially in the lower grades it will be beneficial to learn in a playful way, which is the reason Learn English is focusing on playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn English comes with 60 picture tiles and 60 word tiles with a focus to create or increase the children's vocabulary with words from their daily life. Learn English consists of several small games with increasing difficulty, including variants of memory and picture-lottery with a focus on English words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn English:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Increases the children's English vocabulary with words from their daily life.&lt;br/&gt;     Strengthen the children's pronunciation of English words.&lt;br/&gt;     Gives the children a sense of connection between the written and spoken English language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
