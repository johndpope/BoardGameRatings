							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrambled Slogans</name>
									
			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The New Adult Game that Peps up the Party - Smart - Saucy - Sophisticated&amp;quot;, Scrambled Slogans consists of six pads (labeled A-F) of perforated and gummed labels. Each pad contains 48 phrases or sayings, such as &amp;quot;Red-headed woman suspected&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Down on the farm&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;No metal can touch you&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;What a Young Girl Ought to Know&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a pad of blank sheets. Each player or team then takes one or more of the gummed sheets and attempts to write a funny story, using as many as possible of the gummed phrases. The players are allowed to bridge gaps by hand writing any names of people or places, pronouns, prepositions such as in, at, of, on, for, to, etc. as well as a dozen common verbs: be, do, go, can, say, have, see, meet, give, think, know, hear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the stories have been completed, each is read aloud and a winner is chosen either by the hostess or by a vote of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
