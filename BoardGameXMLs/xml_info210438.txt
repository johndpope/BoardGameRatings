			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nagas, Maharajas, and More!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: India brings you an incredible collection of insidious enemies and allies from the robust and marvelous legends and lore of India, from mountaintop monasteries and river shrines to denizens of the deepest jungle and the blasted badlands, ranging from CR 3 to 25. Some natives of India are benevolent spirits, like the wise and regal guardian naga or the brave and fierce garuda bird-folk, or are creatures of the wild who prefer their privacy and are dangerous only if provoked by intruders, like the wily water naga and the headless kabandha cyclops. The legendarium of the subcontinent is replete with dangerous and deadly spirits, of course, most famously the rakshasa, ranging from the tiny and treacherous raktavarna to the mighty maharaja, but also the elusive asuras, from the cunning triparasura masquerading as lucky idols to the three-faced upasunda, the beatific masters of deadly perfection, and the savage and serpentine aghasura. These enemies may engage in physical brutality and slaughter, but some prefer secretive and subtle seduction and sedition, like the sinister spirit naga and the ghostly bhuta whose very touch is corruption. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new pisacha is a shapechanging spirit of anger and anguish, hungering for the suffering of mortals but placated by feasts in its honor. In addition to the featured creatures, we bring you special rules for creating mandalas to ward off the spirits, magical offerings to appease them, and a simple system for luring your monstrous enemies to the table with a feast of food!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
