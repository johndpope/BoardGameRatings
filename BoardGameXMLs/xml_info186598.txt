			<description>Thievery is a board game where players assume the roles of Spymasters in a fictional world where condemned souls are syphoned. This world is simply called &amp;quot;The Town&amp;quot; and every player participates in expanding it in order to take a piece for themselves... By force or otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players expand the Town, they will claim special Territories as their own, which will later grant them advantages over other players. Some of these Territories will allow players to purchase enchanted weaponry, lethal skills, or even grant their owners an income boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Town is expanded by each player with 3 different tiles - Roads, Markets and Buildings. These serve as space for the unit to move through and players to claim territory over (by placing faction-coloured territory cards over, directly).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thievery, as the name suggest, revolves around coin management and manipulation. You can steal from enemy units just as well as you can steal from their lands. Your Thieves will help you with all your cunning needs, your Thugs keep the enemy out. And your Rogues, well... They specialise in keeping the enemy out of Town, permanently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways to win the game. Either a player places all of their faction's territory cards, or they manage to capture all their enemies' territories before they can expand too much. Another way to win is to count victory points at any given time for claimed territories, recruited units and gathered coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
