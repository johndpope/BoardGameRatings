			<description>Overnight, the Goblin King and his henchmen snuck into the Elven King&amp;rsquo;s treasury and stole all the magical coins stored in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to get back as many of the precious coins as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They do so by overcoming Evildoers like Goblin Minions, Trolls, Dragons and even the Goblin Queen and King themselves with the aid of Friends, like Elvish Warriors and Magicians, helpful animals, good Dragons and other helpers. In their quest to outsmart the Goblin King's minions to get the magic gold coins back, enchanted Treasures strengthen the Friends you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this easy-to-pick-up card game for 2 - 4 players, which is mainly geared at children and/or families, players do not play against each other, they cooperate in order to get back the stolen gold coins. The unique cooperative mechanics make this game ideal for kids as they learn how to work together to overcome great evil without leaving any player behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is that each player collects a given number of gold coins depending on the number of players. Players draw cards from a shared draw pile of 60 cards that contain &amp;quot;Evildoers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Friends&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Treasures&amp;quot;. Friends are used to get rid of Evildoers, whilst Treasures help your friends in doing so. When a player manages to beat a bad guy on his or her own, he or she gets 2 gold coins. If other players assisted him or her in doing so, every involved player gets 1 gold coin. When the draw pile runs out everybody counts their gold coins. If one or more players did not manage to acquire the given number of coins, all players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Elves vs Goblins&amp;quot; either all players win together by cooperating and playing their Friend cards wisely, or all lose if even only one player is &amp;quot;left behind&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a children's version of my &amp;quot;Social Worker Game&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Together We Are Strong&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
