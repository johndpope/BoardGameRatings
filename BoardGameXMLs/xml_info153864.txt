			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moonmen from Mars is a story roleplaying game about the futuristic Moonmen who have invaded Earth Planet airspace, intending to ravage our planet with their Mars ray beams. Earth is suffering. Our cities have been leveled and Earth Capital is on fire. But we shall prevail! The cosmonauts of Earth Justice will not sit idly. The World-President has issued a decree to all able-bodied men and women. Grab your graviton boots and your laser-rods and join the fight to the sky. Earth needs you. Will you heed the call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moonmen from Mars is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
