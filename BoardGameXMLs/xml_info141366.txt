			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pursuit of knowledge and magic is paramount to the Cynean people and the Cynean wizard Kal-Dor pursued this goal with a fervor and fire unmatched by any of his brethren. However, when this wizard had mastered magic to the extent that he claimed to understand even the Kaga itself, he found his life empty without a goal for which to strive. Using his knowledge and understanding of the arcane arts he crafted a device to serve as both weapon and companion in his new quest: mastery of martial combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
