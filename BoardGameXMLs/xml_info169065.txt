							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Approaching Infinity</name>
									
			<description>Approaching Infinity is a science fiction rogue-like game of infinite intergalactic exploration and adventure. It is a game of stellar exploration, planetary investigation, starship battles, diplomacy, crafting, commodity trading, and much, much more, all set in a totally procedurally generated infinite universe. In layman's terms this means that with each game an entirely new universe is created, allowing for unlimited replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is highly approachable, with Approaching Infinity taking on the tropes of what makes a &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; rogue-like game while infusing the game with a modern, player focused commitment. Beautiful retro-visuals provided by David Gervais (known for his various rogue-like tilesets, along with other science-fiction titles), and immersive music by Nathan Becker aka 'ectogemia', transport players into Approaching Infinity's realm. Control can be mouse or keyboard. An intelligent interaction system allows players to focus on gameplay and not a multitude of commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaching Infinity's nods to classic rogue-like play includes permadeath, procedurally generated environments (with over thirty different generation algorithms), random creatures, items, and quests. Artifacts must be identified and there is a ticking oxygen clock for away missions. Yet, thanks to the ability to turn permadeath off, the ease of play, helpful tooltips, and more, this is a player's rogue-like game; a game of endless adventure, a game of 'one more turn'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, Approaching Infinity is about your story amongst the inky darkness of a bejeweled galaxy. Tell it the way you want it told. Be the gruff but lovable space pirate, the alpha leader who personally puts him or herself in danger, the wide eyed explorer who simply wants to absorb the beauty of creation. And when that story is over, start it all over and discover a brand new universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaching Infinity, the absolute joy of sci-fi adventure on your computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn based&lt;br/&gt;Perma death: optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
