			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wyścig Odkrywc&amp;oacute;w (&amp;quot;Discoverer's Race&amp;quot;) is board game which takes place in 1900. Main goal is to win race around the world and collect as much as possible discoveries and treasures from various places. There are 22 secret locations in game and 20 artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game has few great features;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player can chose 1 character he will lead. Every character has his bio, statistics which have great impact on every situation player can encounter. There are 6 characters to chose. Each character has 5 stats (Cleverness, Wisdom, Diplomacy, Strength, Navigation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     During his travel, player can also use a lot of equipment to enhance abilities of his character. These tools are located on markets around the globe, but once they are obtained, they can give new options to a player. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Many of treasures can be sold. Currency is strong point of the game; walking on foot around globe is not good idea, so player can chose transport with Carriage, Caravan, Train or Ship. Those trips costs - and you can earn money sending your character to work in city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game uses two systems created by Jaroslaw Bilinski: TnE and Ocean, which - combined, give great feel and increase players control over his character and actions he takes in-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In some cities player can hire guide and mercenaries to protect him while hi travel to some location. But such party costs a lot of money &amp;ndash;not every character in game is suitable to walk alone into desert without proper gear. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, you chose what you like: be it exploring jungle or dig in Piramids, but be sure you have good stats for either, or at least tools and equipment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
