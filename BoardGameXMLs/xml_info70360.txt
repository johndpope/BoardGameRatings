							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Texas Holdem Trivia</name>
									
			<description>Play trivia Texas Holdem style. You can play heads up one on one or play with a full table of players playing in a sit n go tournament style. You act and bet the same way as in Texas Holdem, but instead of going for a straight or flush to create your best hand you answer trivia questions to create your best hand.&lt;br/&gt;You must also use your poker skills and strategies in this game like, raising, checking, sensing weakness, value betting, limping in, going all-in, and even folding when you think you are beat.  If you don't know the answers you can try the bluff strategy, but watch out an opponent might be slow playing the hand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
