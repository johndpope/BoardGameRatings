							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Byzantine Captain&#039;s Mistress</name>
									
			<description>This is a game playable on a Byzantine Chessboard (16 round and 4 wide) using Checkers.  The game is similar to regular Captain's Mistress (Connect Four), but players control which side of the board pieces enter (and how pieces will follow when entered).  In the game, players try to get 4 in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally, with a set queuing order for pieces entering a column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is a variant where pieces get recycled, by forming 4 in a row, and winning by preventing their opponent from also doing this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
