							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Welcome to Storm Crow Manor</name>
									
			<description>Your quiet trip to Storm Crow Manor just got cut abruptly short. A deceased host, a crude instructional letter and the raging storm outside are just the start of your problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Storm Crow Manor is a bluffing game where players take it upon themselves to kill or be killed in this classic murder plot. Your gracious host is dead and a letter is found instructing that a game is about to unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players awake one by one each night to secretly attack or heal one another in the night to attempt to kill the hiding murderers amongst them, beset to kill the guests one by one. If the guests don't harm anyone in the night with their item cards the murderers may have a free pass to harm whoever they like, if the guests do attack they risk making the wrong the choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of deduction and lying this is sure to please any horror or mystery fan who likes a longer game where everyone has a choice and the majority doesn't always win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
