							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raise the Roof The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the ITV series. Players move round the board, asking questions when landing on specific squares. All players except the questioner and any excluded from the question, anyone getting the question right gets their stake from the questioner, anyone getting it wrong loses their stake to the questioner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All questions are multiple choice but you cannot use an answer previously read out after the next answer is read, and the questioner may give the three answers in any order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stakes are of compulsory value but can be raised at various points in the game. Player with the most money when someone lands on the End square wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
