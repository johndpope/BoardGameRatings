							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gunfight at OK Corral</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's dexterity game where players have a real-time shootout. The board is a long plastic tray flanked with colorful western town inserts. At each end of the tray is a plastic six-shooter (one for each player) that are attached so that they can move freely across the width of the board. The guns are loaded with ball bearings on the top. A slide comes out the bottom and ends flush with the playing surface where a plastic cowboy is attached. When you pull the trigger, a ball rolls down the slide, goes through the legs of the cowboy and shoots across the tray toward your opponent's side. Each plastic cowboy has a tab by its feet that acts as a target. Hit it with a &amp;quot;bullet&amp;quot; and the cowboy gets knock down &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot;. The fist player to shoot the other player's cowboy wins. Each player has a rock and a cactus to use as cover. The trick is that you have to be out in the open (and taking careful aim) to shoot, but also dodging left and right to avoid your opponent's fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to Crossfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
