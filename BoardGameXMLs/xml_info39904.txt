			<description>Hear ye! Hear ye! With the growing expansion of the King&amp;rsquo;s realm, the time has come to build a new city on the edge of his empire. Aptly named &amp;lsquo;New City&amp;rsquo; by our wise and glorious King, he has sent his four best advisers to oversee its construction, each responsible for building one quarter of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of those advisers, your job is to bid against your opponents to ensure you build the best and brightest area of the city. Whichever adviser has built the most prosperous quarter, as shown by the amount of gold in his coffers, will be declared the ruler of this &amp;lsquo;New City&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
