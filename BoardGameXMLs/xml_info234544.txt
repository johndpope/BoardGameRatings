			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NO TRUCE WITH THE FURIES is a police procedural role playing game inspired by Planescape: Torment and Kentucky Route Zero. All combat is handled in dialogue, story is everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wake up as a disgraced detective lieutenant. Put on your disco pants. Wander a gorgeously rendered seaside city in another world, solving one last case. Or wander the inside of your own head, talking to your senses, doubts and memories. 24 uniquely realistic skills represent the real human psyche and physique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role playing game is an emergent art form &amp;ndash; and we&amp;rsquo;re set to light it on fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SETTING&lt;br/&gt;Is it fantasy? Is it sci-fi? Is it alt history? Some kind of punk? No. It&amp;rsquo;s a genre-busting new world we&amp;rsquo;ve built for more than fifteen years. We call it fantastic realism. And we&amp;rsquo;re ready to show it to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ART&lt;br/&gt;No Truce With The Furies pushes isometric graphics further than ever. The light is dynamic, so is the weather &amp;ndash; pick up a flashlight and see the shadows move at night!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE AUTHORS&lt;br/&gt;Contemporary oil painters hand paint this world. Published authors write these dialogues. A rock&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;roll band records the music. No Truce With The Furies is made by a movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE THOUGHT CABINET&lt;br/&gt;You have an inventory for thoughts. Pick up old mysteries, develop new ideas. Come to conclusions both light and dark. You will develop obsessions you can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of, and beliefs that guide your words and change the way you talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SYSTEM&lt;br/&gt;No Truce With The Furies takes non-combat skill use to absurd new heights. You can sing, dance, pay rent and actually fail at skill checks with profound results. Built by D&amp;amp;D evangelists, we use the rule system to represent real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CHOICES&lt;br/&gt;Everything, even the smallest of details, matters. The minutiae of what you say &amp;ndash; or think &amp;ndash; gets carried from dialogue to dialogue. This palm sized open world is an unprecedented toybox of choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
