			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become the new heroes of a fantastical version of ancient Greece!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land of the mythological heroes &amp;mdash; Odysseus, Achilles, Andromeda and many more &amp;mdash; has been devastated by a second war between the gods of Olympus and the Titans. Greece was disfigured by this cataclysmic conflict and is now plagued by the monsters that have returned from its past. Humankind, abandoned by the gods for a century, now has to fend for itself and face countless threats from all sides. Bandits and raiders roam the countryside. The fragile balance of the rebuilt areas around the great cities of old is constantly challenged. The country is on the brink of chaos. More importantly, the gods now seem to be waking, fallen from grace and turned mortal, obsessed by reconquering their past powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will protect humanity, if not new heroes? Will you join them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
