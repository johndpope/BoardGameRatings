			<description>The game contains 12 cardboard riders with a wooden base, and there are rules for 4 different races: Sprint, Poursuit, Omnium and Madison. The first three are individual while the latter is a team race, each team being composed of two riders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement of the rides is determined by the roll of two dice, and the coloured squares on the board mean:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- red squares: advance two extra squares&lt;br/&gt;        - yellow squares: go back two squares:&lt;br/&gt;        - black squares: take a chance card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who's riders finish the race first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
