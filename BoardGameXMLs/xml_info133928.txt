							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Munchkin Bei√üt! &#039;Baum&#039; Booster (Set 1)</name>
									
			<description>This booster contains 20 German-language Munchkin Bites! cards. Seventeen of the cards come from Munchkin Bites! 1 and 2, and they form a rigged demo that can be used to teach the game. The remaining 3 cards are new and there are no corresponding English versions. All 20 cards have a jack-o-lantern as the icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The packaging for the booster set is clear plastic, and there is nothing inside but the cards themselves (no rules, etc.). Thus, the name of the booster, 'Baum', comes from the top card that's visible through the packaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards in this booster were originally released as part of the Munchkin Bites Halloween DVD set, which is now out of print. The DVD set, unlike this booster, includes the rules on how to run the demo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3 new cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dragwolf&lt;br/&gt;     Eine Frau wie Dynamit&lt;br/&gt;     Omen XXIII&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that these 3 cards have been re-released as part of the Munchkin Sammlerkoffer, but the icon is the Sammlerkoffer icon, not the jack-o-lantern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Munchkin series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
