			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters of 5th-7th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noribund, Commandant-Burgher of Vallidyl, paced nervously around the empty council chambers in the city garrison. &amp;quot;I'm surprised you're not worried,&amp;quot; he told his daughter, who draped herself over one of the tall-backed chairs reserved for other burghers. &amp;quot;I haven't seen Jasper for days.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dad, it's just a stupid cat. I'm a grown-up girl now. I'm done playing with dolls and silly pets. I wish I had more responsibility, like you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Running this city and defending it from outside threats is no work for a young lady like you, Carnelia.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Just forget about it.&amp;quot; Carnelia heaved herself out of the chair and stomped out of the council chambers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noribund stroked his beard, mumbling to himself. He suddenly stopped pacing and called out for his clerk. &amp;quot;Benthric! Visit the taverns and hire some competent mercenaries.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;But sir, the guard has reached full capacity, the barracks are crowded, and we have no more equipment for new recruits.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I want them to find our cat. Jasper's just as much a part of my family as Carnelia. We would all be crushed if something terrible happened to him,&amp;quot; Noribund said, wringing his hands. 'Offer these people 200 gold up front and another 800 gold when they return Jasper alive. He's a brownish tabby with a bit of a paunch. A silver tinkling bell hangs from a silk collar around his neck.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;That should be sufficient, sir,&amp;quot; Benthric began sneaking off. &amp;quot;I'll make the necessary arrangements, and see that your adventurers begin their search for poor Jasper as soon as possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
