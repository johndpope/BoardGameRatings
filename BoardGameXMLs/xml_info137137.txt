			<description>Game published in More Games, Puzzles and Pastimes, published by Odhams Press in 1959.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rules:&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for two, three or four players It is played with ordinary playing cards. Each player, in turn, draws the top card from a pack placed face downwards. When a player draws an ace he takes it and can begin the game. When, in his turn, he draws a two, he takes that as well, until he has a complete series and so reaches the Source. The cards drawn but not required are placed face upwards in a separate pile, which is turned over and drawn from again when the first pile has been exhausted. The sequence of cards may be collected irrespective of suit, but the following particular cards carry forfeits or advantages:&lt;br/&gt;2 of clubs: Attacked by crocodiles: Miss 2 turns&lt;br/&gt;3 of spades: Boat upset by hippopotamus: Miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;4 of hearts: Calm water: Miss 4 turns&lt;br/&gt;5 of spades: Boat wrecked in waterfall: Miss 4 turns&lt;br/&gt;6 of diamonds: Guide shows short cut: Omit 7 and 8&lt;br/&gt;7 of clubs: Attacked by hostile tribes: Miss 2 turns&lt;br/&gt;8 of hearts: Favourable winds: Take an extra turn&lt;br/&gt;9 of spades: Follow false trail: Miss a turn&lt;br/&gt;10 of clubs: Catch malaria in jungle: Miss 3 turns&lt;br/&gt;Jack of diamonds: Rainstorm lowers temperature: Take an extra turn&lt;br/&gt;Queen of spades: Boat damaged in rapids: Miss 2 turns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should cut out four small paper boats, differently coloured, as markers, and move them up the river as the cards fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
