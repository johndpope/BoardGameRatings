							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kits of Old</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you played AD&amp;amp;D second edition back in the 1990s, you probably remember kits. These character options were introduced in The Complete Fighter&amp;rsquo;s Handbook, and became a mainstay of the rest of the books in the Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook Rules Supplement series. Though kits were notorious for providing wildly uneven benefits (some offered all-but-unnoticeable improvements, while others turned characters into walking engines of destruction), they did add depth and customization to a game that had previously offered few character choices after 1st level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month, Unearthed Arcana converts a few of the more popular kits from that era to new class options for the bard and fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
