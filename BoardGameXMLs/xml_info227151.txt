			<description>Set in 1948 in an Alternate History where Dragons had risen 5 years earlier during World War II to decimate most of the world's great cities. Armies made up of the remnants of world powers are making a last stand in this semi Co-operative Resource management, engine building, with area control and dice combat game. &lt;br/&gt;Take to the air in experimental German planes, Use submarines to avoid detection from roaming dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Dragons including the Mother are randomly placed on three major cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players select their army and determine start order.&lt;br/&gt;There is a card drafting phase where certain number of cards are drawn and the last player in turn order gets first pick of the cards and then passes to next turn ordered player and then back to them where everyone gets to keep two cards.&lt;br/&gt;Now it is first players turn. They have a number of actions based on the number of Generals they started with. Each general can give one order Explore/Move, Mine, Sell/Trade, Build, Attack or Draw a Card. Early emphasis is on gathering resources to develop weapons and vehicles. Players will explore the globe and mine by flipping hex tiles. The revealed mine may have gold, oil, metal, uranium or it may be a dragon cave and unleash a new dragon. The new dragon will immediately fly around the board. It's direction will be dictated by a 4 sided die. It will only stop when it reaches a city or player who will have to fight it. If too many cities are captured the game immediately ends and all players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As player armies start to get stronger it is advised that these players team up to start hunting dragons whose carcasses are a plethora of new resources: Scales, Blood and Hydrogen allowing very unique upgrade abilities. If the dragon had a city base, victorious players can turn over the tiles and reap the benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players become strong enough they will attempt to defeat the Mother Dragon. If they poses a hydrogen or atom bomb they can do so but by destroying city they will not reap the treasures.  The city being lost may also cost them the game if the limit is met. Once all dragons are destroyed players count their active mining territories, cities and gold to find out who is the new world super power and ultimate winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
