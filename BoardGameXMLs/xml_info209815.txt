			<description>Alchemists were always tied with the city of Prague. Their inventions built the city, their potions cured the plagues that devastated the townsfolk. Your father is one of those alchemists. Recently, he became secretive, isolating himself to research of an unknown purpose. He works with dedication &amp;ndash; but to what purpose? Will he attempt to achieve the dream of every alchemist? Will he attempt to instill life into barren clay? Will your father accomplish the magnum opus and create creatures BORN OF CLAY AND FIRE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
