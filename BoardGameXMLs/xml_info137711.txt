			<description>designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know those nights where everyone seems to have a problem staying on target? Where every little thing the GM says is taken out of context? Where the ability to make a funny joke is more important to the players than actually following a plot?&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Goblins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a fork in the road ahead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Player: &amp;ldquo;How many tines does it have? Can I use it as a weapon? I challenge the fork! &amp;lsquo;HO THERE, FORK!&amp;rsquo; No answer? I attack the fork!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your normal game the GM would be casting about for ways to rain anvils on the characters first, and potentially the players second. In Goblins!, that kind of thing is sort of par for the course. It gives you a chance to play around with these annoying jokes and random distractions in character. We think it&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of saving the world from cosmic horrors, if you&amp;rsquo;ve killed your 37th ancient dragon, if you&amp;rsquo;re bored of playing an arch wizard from the dawn of time, kick your pointy shoes off and slum it with the grimy little beggars called Goblins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for those whose idea of victory is keeping down dinner, whose concept of high adventure is testing out the Hag&amp;rsquo;s new mushroom collection, whose ambitions range all the way to the dizzying heights of leading their own small army of cockroaches. In their pants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
