			<description>Suche die Unterschiede (&amp;quot;Find the Differences&amp;quot;) is a game built around the well-known puzzles in which you have to find the differences between two similar images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a score card, which displays two similar images, with ten differences. The score card is placed face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in several rounds. In each round, all players receive a category card and have 60 seconds in which to mark all the differences. The first player to do so wins the round and receives 15 seconds to search for differences on his score card. The first player to find all ten differences on his score card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
