			<description>Hockey Cup is a game about building a hockey team. It is inspired by Baseball Highlights: 2045 by Mike Fitzgerald. It uses Games Cards system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hockey Cup is like watching TV highlights of hockey games. In this quick and interactive game, two coaches build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building the team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &amp;quot;mini-game&amp;quot;, each coach alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights &amp;ndash; 3 defensive and 3 offensive actions. Whichever team wins the most mini-games in the series takes the cup!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coaches start the game with a team, which consists of 15 1st level players. On his turn a coach sends one offensive player to make 1 trick, and the other coach sends one defensive player to prevent the trick. Next, both players may use one of their special actions. An unprevented trick leads to goal. At the end of third period, if the score is tied, they play overtime, which is followed by a penalty shootout. After every game, a coach uses 3 experience points to raise the level of his players. A 2nd level player can make 2 tricks, 3rd level - 3 tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
