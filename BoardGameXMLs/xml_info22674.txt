							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mława 1939</name>
									
			<description>The battle for Mlawa was the first of many battles that occurred in the Northern Mazowsze in 1939 (Polish territory north of Warsaw).  Here the German 3rd Army, commanded by General Kuchler, fought against the Polish Army &amp;quot;Modlin&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Germans had tremendous superiority; in the main sector they had five divisions, including one armored division, while the Polish had only one division and two cavalry brigades.  Although there was one Infantry Division (8th ID) in reserve, it was too far away to intervene in the first days of the operation. &lt;br/&gt; Despite their great advantage, the Germans did not break through the Polish front lines because the 20th Polish Infantry Division, which defended the Mlawa position, was strengthened by permanent fortifications whose flanks were situated on swamps and wet terrain.  The Germans stormed the defenses for more than three days before they were able to take possession after the Poles abandoned them.  As the German commander of the 3rd German Army could not overcome the Polish positions frontally, he ordered Mlawa to be flanked from the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box edition (third) comprises a 39&amp;quot;x27&amp;quot; full color map, 400 die-cut counters and a couple of sheets of informational markers that need to be cut. The rules are in Polish but an English translation is now available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_M%C5%82awa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_M%C5%82awa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
