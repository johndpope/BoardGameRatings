			<description>Floating Fortress is a Print-n-Play game featuring a navel battle between two players using standard d6 dice. The game is played on a 8x8 board with each player having 2 bases and 14 ships under their control. Each turn a player may move a single ship or use multiple ships to fire on a single target. Ships have to reload their ammunition between shots and are controlled with attack and defense dice that determine their shots power, their movement speed, their firing range and how much life they have remaining. The object of the game is to be the first player to eliminate both of their opponent's bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires each player to have their own set of 36 dice with the 2 sets being a different color and it can played on the back of the unfolded rulebook. The rulebook and board fit on a single sheet of printed paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
