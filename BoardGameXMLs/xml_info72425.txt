							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Against Gravity</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in the standard set by On the Ground, this sixth issue in the Traveller's Aide Series brings you more than 30 of the most commonly (and not so commonly) encountered grav vehicles in the Traveller Universe. These range from the ubiquitous air/raft to grav buses and cargo haulers, and even covers a number of military grav vehicles such as tanks and artillery units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also find tips and advice from the Yiarn Caardee Design Bureau to help you better understand the technology behind these gravity defying vehicles and how best to put this information into your own vehicle designs. Information on advanced vehicle frames, new weapons and more allow you to add even more tools to your own T20 vehicle design toolbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounding out this issue is a discussion of a number of the corporations that are actively involved in the design, manufacture, and/or sale of grav vehicles. The sky is literally the limit with this issue of Traveller's Aide, be sure not to miss it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
