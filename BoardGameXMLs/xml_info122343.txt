			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical text adventure game. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So.... you've woken up then Ralph?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't suppose you remember much about last night?, how you took part in a particularly alcoholic session at the 'Duck and Plunger'? It appears you were drinking with some of your 'WIZARD' buddies when you performed your usual party piece by turning one of them into a pink and black spotted Salamander...&lt;br/&gt;...That was Mike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the spell wore off the chap in question wasn't too pleased. That's how you ended in his Castle. You are NOT his favourite person. Only your familiar spirit can help you now... If you remember his name that is, you dozy old goat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
