							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolling Freight: Texas Map</name>
									
			<description>The Texas Map for the Rolling Freight game was made available as an exclusive item to people that pledged to support the Rolling Freight project on Kickstarter.  This map was designed to be an apegames.com download, but was instead printed copies for each copy of the game that we ship for Kickstarter backers.  It was printed on thick paper and quarter-fold it so that it fits nicely into the Rolling Freight box.  This map is designed as a quick 2-3 player map which can be played in about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
