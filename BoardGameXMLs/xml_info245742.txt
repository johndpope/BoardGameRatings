							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Storypath System Preview</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of the Storypath system is tied to our work on the Trinity Continuum, a world of hope, heroism, and peril, and Scion, a world where the children of the old gods walk the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early on, we found that both new editions of these games had similar system needs, because their characters are larger-than-life and fight in epic battles on a grand scale. We knew we needed a system that could accommodate everyday citizens on the street, superheroes soaring above skyscrapers, and gods of the sun and sky, but we also wanted rules to help facilitate the connection between the player-characters, their organizations (Allegiances for Trinity and Pantheons for Scion), and their values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To move forward, however, we needed to take a step back, because the first editions of the Trinity Continuum and Scion used custom variants of the Storyteller System which powered Vampire: The Masquerade and other classic White Wolf games. Despite the differences between those variants, however, at its core the Storyteller System was designed chiefly as a horror game for creatures that could be effectively fought by human opponents. In other words, the Storyteller System is great for vampires, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t excel at portraying superheroes&amp;hellip;or gods! To us, this meant that the stories of these action-adventure games were hindered by their original systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Storypath System was designed as a new set of rules, inspired by the legacy of the Storyteller and Storytelling Systems, in addition to other story-centric rules. The Storypath System keeps the focus on narrative, story-built play, and action-adventure. It also draws inspiration from a number of other influences that focus on a cinematic high-octane action and storytelling, as well, to create a streamlined experience for epic stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a preview of the rules and examples for both Scion and the Trinity Continuum. We hope you enjoy the new Storypath System and are inspired to roll the dice and tell great stories!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
