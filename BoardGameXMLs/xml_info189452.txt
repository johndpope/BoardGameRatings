			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Los Angeles, 1984. A creature, neither fully man or machine, arrives from a war-torn future. It's mission: To change the present. Assassinate a future leader of the resistance. Destroy vital infastructure. Protect and safeguard our only hope. Steal motorcycles, trucks, and sunglasses. Tell people to chill out, dickwad. Go on a vacation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It cannot be bargined with, it cannot be stopped, and it cannot remember what it was doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abort Retry Fail is a 1-page RPG about collectively trying to steer a killer robot towards its objectives and failing miserably. Each player takes control of a rogue subroutine, attempting to complete the mission to the best of their limited abilities while also accomplishing a nonsensical goal foisted on them by their malfunctioning programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small, minimalist d6 game for three or more players, with light GM duties, focused on madcap comedy and silly one-liners. It's a good game to warm up your roleplaying muscles before a real session or just waste an hour or so doing Arnold impressions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
