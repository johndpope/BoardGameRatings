							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Filly Witchy: Hexentanz in Zimsala</name>
									
			<description>A Filly Witchy themed roll-and-move game in which players try to reach the center of the board first in order to win the &amp;quot;magical flight into the center of glittering magic&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The board shows 6 concentric circles. With the exception of the innermost circle, all the circles are divided into several spaces. Some spaces have a diamond symbol with a number printed on them.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a Filly figure as their player token and puts it on one of the start spaces on the outermost circle. Players taken turns rolling the six-sided die and move their token accordingly in the direction shown by an arrow (players don't have to use the full pips, i. e. when they roll a 5 they may move 1-5 spaces). If a player lands on a space marked with a diamond, he/she may move one circle closer to the center if their next roll is equal or higher than the number in the diamond. If a player ends his/her turn on a space occupied by another player's token, he/she may put that token on a space of their choice one circle further away from the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player token reaches the center of the board. This player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
