							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El gran juego de Hobby Consolas</name>
									
			<description>Players attempt to buy famous video games for several contemporary consoles, and also the consoles themselves. Income is gained by other players renting games and consoles from them, and money is spent when they rent games and consoles from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned game, they have the opportunity to buy it and add it to their collection. If a player owns all the games for a specific console, they may then buy consoles to rent with each game, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If they land on a game owned by another player, they must pay that player a rental price according to the value of the game and any consoles coming with it. There are other places on the board which cannot be bought, but instead require the player to: draw a &amp;quot;News&amp;quot; card and perform the action on the card; draw a &amp;quot;Question&amp;quot; card and answer a question about video games in order to win a prize; collect income; or fix a broken console (which can keep them from moving for as long as three turns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player elimination&lt;br/&gt;If a player does not have enough money to pay for a debt, not even by selling all of their video games and consoles, they will be bankrupt and out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;This Monopoly-inspired game was gifted to readers of Spanish video game magazine Hobby Consolas with their numbers 54 and 55. Publication of the game was sponsored by Spanish video game retail chain Centro Mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents:&lt;br/&gt;-Game board.&lt;br/&gt;-26 video game cards.&lt;br/&gt;-26 console cards.&lt;br/&gt;-20 News cards.&lt;br/&gt;-31 Question cards.&lt;br/&gt;-310 point notes.&lt;br/&gt;-10 Centro Mail discount coupons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Additionally, two dice and one token per player are required to play the game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
