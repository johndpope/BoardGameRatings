							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Ring: Hong Kong</name>
									
			<description>Dark Ring is a card game designed for 4-8 people. Simple to learn, highly strategic, little luck involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players act as Dark Ringers and needs to do their best to collect Energy Orbs each round. Each player would be assigned a secret role at the beginning of the game (either Innovator, Protector or Hunter). There are a total of 120 Play cards in this game. Each Play card would have 2 functions. The first is to use it as an action, and the second is to use it for scoring. Players need to choose a player to be the first Host. Every player needs to give one card faced down to the Host. The Host player would then decide which cards to give back to each player, faced down again. These cards would then become Trace cards to be used for scoring. In a clockwise order, starting from the Host player, everyone would have 2 chances to perform different actions by using Play cards from their hand. Play cards can either investigate or alter the Trace cards on the field. After 2 Action rounds, players need to decide to either take or give up their Trace card. Since there are positive and negative Scores, players should make their decisions wisely. The next player would then become the new Host and starts a new round. The game ends when any player collects 10 or more Orbs. Everyone then needs to reveal their Role and determine which team is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
