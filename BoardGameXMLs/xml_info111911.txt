							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Midsummer Night&#039;s Scheme</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of faeries has been exiled from the Faerie Court by Oberon for excessive connections to the mortal world, but Titania has persuaded him to give them one last chance to return to the Faerie Realm. They have until dawn to prove that they are not emotionally attached to a mortal, through pranks and games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for the faeries, each of them *is* attached to a mortal, and the best way to &amp;ldquo;disprove&amp;rdquo; the accusation is to target the very mortal they are suspected [rightly] of caring for with the cleverest&amp;mdash;or cruelest&amp;mdash;pranks they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game for one Storyguide and 2 or more players. You will also need at least a dozen d8s and pencils and paper. If you wish, there is a character sheet at the end of this document that you can print out (one for each player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
