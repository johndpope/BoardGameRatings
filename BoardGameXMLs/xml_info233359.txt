			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been some weird shit going down. Something&amp;rsquo;s moved into the neighbor hood and it&amp;rsquo;s dark, like evil dark. People are scared to walk around at night. Something&amp;rsquo;s creeping it&amp;rsquo;s way into homes and scaring the shit out of people. Man, people are outright disappearing. Something ain&amp;rsquo;t good here Man. Time for the Agents of The Funk to do something about it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an Agent of The Funk you are part of a collective of badasses who have the talent and the power to suss out, address, and protect The People from the Supernatural and just plain Evil. When the shit goes down the Agents of The Funk come around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents Of The Funk is a minimalist RPG loosely based on our QADD system of using any dice as long as they all have the same sides.  Both full size and PocketMod versions are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
