			<description>Catch My Drift is a hilarious and interactive card game of hip hop charades. Think Taboo meets urban dictionary. Outguess your opponents in the most lingo to win! Teammates race against the clock to guess as much urban lingo as possible in 2 minutes. Each lingo card is worth 1 or 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person giving the clues is called the shot caller. If the shot caller mentions a violation word while helping the team guess the lingo, the opponent a.k.a. security will clap the hand clapper and deduct 1 or 2 points if a violation word is mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;The shot caller can mention the clue, use gestures, be creative and have fun. The team with the most points after 3 rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;Game play is 25 minutes 4 or more players required&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
