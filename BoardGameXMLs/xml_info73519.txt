			<description>&amp;quot;Viva Pi&amp;ntilde;ata is a life simulation game developed by Rare, for the Xbox 360  video game console. The project was headed by Gregg Mayles and the team behind the Banjo-Kazooie series, based on an idea from Tim Stamper. Although rumors of the title circulated among fans for some time, Viva Pi&amp;ntilde;ata was officially announced on March 15, 2006, and first released in November 2006. With a &amp;quot;general audiences&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; rating, the game provides bright, colorful visuals, intended to appeal to children and more casual gamers. The game received a positive reaction from game critics, despite its poor sales and pre-release advertising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Likened to The Sims, Animal Crossing  and Harvest Moon, the game tasks the player with turning a neglected plot of land into a beautiful garden. As with many sandbox games, the game is open-ended, with no strict winning or losing requirements. Instead, players are guided only generally towards the objectives of increasing their garden's value and attracting pi&amp;ntilde;ata  residents. Players are free to determine their own sub-goals and work towards them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing a successful garden requires setting up the land and foliage appropriately to attract pi&amp;ntilde;atas, as well as purchasing various items to place within the garden (e.g., homes for the pi&amp;ntilde;atas). When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a simple black-and-white version of a given pi&amp;ntilde;ata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the pi&amp;ntilde;ata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version. Once two pi&amp;ntilde;atas of the same species are residents and their mating (romance) requirements are met, they can perform a romance dance, resulting in a baby pi&amp;ntilde;ata egg. No pi&amp;ntilde;ata has a gender specific design, and hence any two pi&amp;ntilde;atas of the same species can mate (with inter-species romances possible as well in a few cases). After a given pi&amp;ntilde;ata species has successfully romanced, the player no longer needs to fulfill the full romance requirements for pi&amp;ntilde;ata of that type, but can instead simply have the pi&amp;ntilde;ata eat a specific type of candy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Viva_Piñata,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
