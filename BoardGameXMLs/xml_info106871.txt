			<description>Players use a magnetic spider attached to a plastic branch via a string (web) to catch bugs on platform that vibrates, thereby making the bugs jitter all over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bugs and spiders are colour coded. The player to catch the 3 bugs of their colour wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may also be played non-competitively, using the bugs as a counting tool (how many bugs did you catch?) or a colour recognition and instructional tool (can you catch all the red bugs?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
