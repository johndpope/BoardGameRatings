							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Ferien Express</name>
									
			<description>As a give-away in the seventies, private customers of the insurance company DEVK received a free copy of the game &amp;quot;Der Ferien Express&amp;quot; (the holiday express), probably as a summer gift for the kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple Roll and Move game, with a gambling component.&lt;br/&gt;Players have to supply their own player-tokens, coins, and a die. Only the board game field was given away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die which indicates how far they are allowed to move down the 42 field track trough Europe. If he lands in a black city (Copenhagen, Cadiz, Bern, Athens) the player has to pause for a round and has to pay a coin into the pot (as a hotel fee). If the player lands on a red City (Berlin, London, Paris, Madrid, Venice) he has to pause for a round, but has the chance to take a shortcut when rolling a one on a D6. If he is allowed to take the short cut (express line) he must pay two coins into the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who is back in Berlin receives half the pot, the second and third divide the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
