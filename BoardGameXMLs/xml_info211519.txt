							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bone March Journal 594 CY</name>
									
			<description>A Supplement for the Living Greyhawk Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year has been difficult for Bone March. A lot of new alliances have been made and a lot of new hostilities have broken out. Nonhumans continue to rampage the land and occupy Spinecastle and Johnsport. One more year and the proper ruler of Bone March is absent, presumed dead by almost all now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this chaos, a logical man Count Joachim Dunstan continues his efforts to uphold his County intact against the orc invaders. At the small town of Nivlek Landed Knight Bae continues his effort to build a decent city. Landed Lord Lynette defended his village during the Battle of Nlul, and many adventurers are now known in the region of the March.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
