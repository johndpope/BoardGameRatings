			<description>From the creator:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A border-less strategy game where players attempt to surround and outflank their opponent(s) without leaving themselves open to attack in kind. No formation can be strong everywhere though, and advancing and retreating can be equally important. Expand around your opponent's placements and leave your options open while closing off your opponent's. Outflank lasts between 30 minutes and an hour on average and plays either two player or four players in teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outflank is themed towards medieval pike warfare, advancing in formations linked back to their starting formation and attempting to find the weak spots in enemy formations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is light since the game is an abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting from fixed positions, players build out formations to surround and entrap their opponent using limited number of actions each turn. With seven actions a turn you can advance or withdraw cards from the field based on the number of soldiers on the individual tiles. You can also use your actions to draw additional tiles or mercenaries that can augment your cards for further costs. The aim of the game is to take four of your opponent's tiles in a four player game and 6 in a four player team game (combined total with your ally).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
