			<description>It is a time of decision!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you relive or will you reshape history?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stakes are high as you take your role as a leader of a great power in the darkest days of the 20th Century. The scene is set in summer 1941 as the Axis launched Barbarossa, the greatest military campaign in history, which set the course for the rest of the Second World War. Will you lead the Axis and Soviet Union along this path or will you attack the South to acquire the oil rich Middle East or strike the Empires a death blow? As the USA player can you thwart an Axis surprise attack on your Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor and avoid the USA&amp;rsquo;s sudden entry into the war?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How will you guide your power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interact with your friends in 5 dimensions in this realistic historical game, as you build up your strength using different resources and skills to gain advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set your heart and mind on one or more of the 5 dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Military war: great land, sea and air battles.&lt;br/&gt;    Economic crisis: the struggle for strategic resources and economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;    Diplomatic pressure: coerce or persuade new nations into trade or war.&lt;br/&gt;    Technology race: develop new weapons or production methods.&lt;br/&gt;    Moral conflict: the eternal fight between good and evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Moral Conflict game can be played in either a co-operative or non-co-operative way. In this fast moving non-turn based educational game, opportunities are continuously presented to make decisions and act. The rules you need to play are not difficult but to master the dimensions many skills are needed. Each dimension is learned one at a time and the rules are written to allow players to gradually add more dimensions. As the intricacy increases with added dimensions, you will enjoy the growing challenge to plan more strategically, think more long-term and more effectively leverage the interdependency of the dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Reality Change Game&lt;br/&gt;As you take your path through the seasons and steps of the Moral Conflict challenge, it is like your walk through life, making decisions and developing new people and mind skills and even heart change. The challenge to grow in strength in the game, encourages learning in critical thinking and problem solving, in team work, negotiation, and strategy, which can change the attitudes and thoughts of both your mind and heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moral Conflict educational guides supplied with the game and videos and rule books to download on the Playford Games web site provide inspiration and ideas to equip you for both life in the Moral Conflict game and afterwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
