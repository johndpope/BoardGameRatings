			<description>Do your ABC's like you've never done before! Turn your ABC's into a hilarious and challenging game. Pick up a category card from the deck and think fast to find the words to match--alphabetically!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A, B, C might be easy,- see if you can get to X, Y, Z!&lt;br/&gt;There are multiple ways to play. Try it on your own, go head to head, or compete in teams. Pick the one that best suits your group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object is to be the first player or team to reach the targeted point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pick up a card from the top of the deck. Each player in clockwise succession gives a word in alphabetic order (A to Z) relating to the category.&lt;br/&gt;If a player gets stumped they are eliminated from this round. Last player standing wins the points posted on the card. If all players get stuck on one letter, the topic&lt;br/&gt;is discarded and another topic is chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     101 Category Cards&lt;br/&gt;     24 Wise Alec Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
