			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators should be travelling by car across Dartmoor when the vehicle breaks down in an electrical storm. The loss of their vehicle and the lack of any way of communicating with the outside world, isolates them for the duration of the adventure. Of course you can strand them any way you wish, but this way seemed convenient and believable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local family doctor is an evil wizard, descended from a wicked local baron. He now leads a small cult of fanatics all dedicated to the worship and eventual coming to earth of Shub-Niggurath. Thanks to the archaeology team who are currently digging near the old stone circle, they now have nearly all the information they need to call forth the Dark Mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario consists of three PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        14-page Scenario&lt;br/&gt;        3-page Maps (odd page sizes)&lt;br/&gt;        4-page Handouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
