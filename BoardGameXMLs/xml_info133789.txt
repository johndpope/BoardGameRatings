			<description>Do you know who came up with tower-to-park urbanism? Who designed the first skyscraper? Who wrote Delirious New York? The Modern Architecture Game, designed by Amsterdam-based NEXTarchitects, lets players test their architectural knowledge, competing for the right to wear Le Corbusier&amp;rsquo;s iconic round-rimmed glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Containing almost a 1000 questions, the Modern Architecture Game provides the base for an evening full of insights in the world's most famous architects, buildings and trends of the Western architecture, all through the roll of a dice. The goal is simple: To reach the heart of the board before anyone else. This is done by moving your way through questions of six different categories: Visuals, Architect, Project, Style, Influence and Quote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Modern Architecture Game is the second edition of the architecture game. The first edition was launched on 30 August 1999. It was the first project collaboration involving the four partners at NEXT architects and was distributed in the private environment of Delft University of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years later, we've produced a revised version of the game, analytically unravelled and improved. This edition is an international version, in the sense that it is produced in English, but also that the questions range right across the breadth of modern world history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that many of the questions about the Netherlands that were abundant in the first version have been dropped, unless they were significant in relation to world-wide developments. By introducing these changes, we have endeavoured to make the game suitable for an extremely broad and international group of architecture enthusiasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your knowledge of the greatest architects, their famous buildings and legendary quotes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
