							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vintage Story</name>
									
			<description>Vintage Story is a game about innovation and exploration. It thrusts the player into a carefully-generated semi-autonomous world and challenges them to survive and overcome the natural and unknown threats of their new home. Intrepid players who accept this challenge will find themselves rewarded with mechanics that respects their intelligence and allows for tangible, realistic invention. In addition, they&amp;rsquo;ll find a world with its own character and a deep, interconnected narrative (WIP) within it. It aims to become the new standard of voxel games, as we, a small dedicated team, relentlessy expand it with story elements, more creation tools and survival elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [vintagestory.at The Game Website].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
