			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead your people to the other side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gefira...the only way out of the wretched jungle. Guide your explorers across a dangerous and unstable hanging bridge in a race of life and death. Your opponent will try to boycott, slow and outsmart you. You will need a sound strategy and use all of your wits to succeed in your mission!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware... snakes, strong winds, floods and more will cross your path on a bridge already half in ruins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players need to escape the jungle by crossing a bridge. Crossing is made more strategic and difficult by flipping and replacing parts of the bridge based on cards that are drafted that can trigger events - both negative and positive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
