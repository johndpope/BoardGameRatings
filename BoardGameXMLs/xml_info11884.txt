							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New York Scene</name>
									
			<description>From the back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The excitement of Broadway, a shopping spree along Fifth Avenue, elegant dining among the skyscrapers of Manhattan, and a tour of the city's famous landmarks - all these are a part of the New York Scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to own the Mets, Tiffany's, the Plaza Hotel or the Daily News?  Now is your chance by playing the New York Scene!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- you will buy and sell your favorite local properties;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- become either a union leader, a lawyer, a politician, or a network executive;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- bargain with the other players to receive a &amp;quot;Connection Card&amp;quot; which will permit you to develop your properties and thereby collect increased rent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the New York Scene is to accumulate wealth and enjoy a unique witty and up-to-date view of the exciting way of life in New York.  During the Game you will draw New York Scene Cards which will reward or penalize - for example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- The Aussie Strikes Again - You may Buy Any or All of the Newspapers for Twice Their Stated Purchase Price&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- You're Riding the Subway, the Hand in Your Pocket Belongs to Someone Else - Lose Two Turns Due to Shock&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
