							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harvest Moon 2 GBC</name>
									
			<description>Harvest Moon 2 GBC is a farm simulation video game for the Game Boy Color developed by Victor Interactive Software, and the second portable game in the Harvest Moon series. The object of the game is to cultivate a farm to prevent the land from being used to build an amusement park. As with the previous game the player may choose to play as a boy or a girl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several differences between this game and the previous installments on the Game Boy. Some major differences between Harvest Moon GB, and Harvest Moon 2 is that in Harvest Moon 2 one is able to build a sheep pen and buy sheep, build a greenhouse, and walk around the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial goal is that in three years time, the player must bring up the farm by growing and selling crops, and raising livestock. There are also plenty of secrets to unlock in the game. At the end of the first year, the mayor of the city comes back to the farm to check up on it. If he thinks it's looking good, the player may continue the game for another couple years. If he thinks the farm is short of success, a second chance is given to revitalize the farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Harvest Moon 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
