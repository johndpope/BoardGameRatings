							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">L&#039;histoire de France en un tour de cartes!</name>
									
			<description>Card game for children aged around 10 years old. There are rules to four games using the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1: Qui, quoi, quand?&lt;br/&gt;A game for 2 players&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and placed in a stack in the centre of the table. On a turn, the player takes the top card and looks at the picture and the text on the other side of the card. From this, he or she must guess the correct historical period for the card e.g. L&amp;eacute;onard de Vinci would be a La Renaissance card. Then check the summary card. If correct, he scores a point. If not, the card is discarded and the opponent has a turn. When all the cards have been used, the one with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2: L'ordre chronologique&lt;br/&gt;Cards are dealt out evenly. The remaing cards are placed in a stack. A card is revealed and the player must lay a card that goes immediately before the date on that card or just after it. If you cannot play a card, you must pass and take a card from the stack and add it to your hand. The first player to use all their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3: Qui suis-je?&lt;br/&gt;Stack all the cards with only the picture side showing. Each player, in turn, takes the top card and tries to name the event, person, etc. The card is then turned over to reveal the text. If the player is correct, he keeps the card. If not, it is discared. The player with the most cards when the stack is emptied, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 4: 9 Familles&lt;br/&gt;The cards are colour coded so a straightforward version of 7 Familles/Happy Families can be played. Each set collected is worth one point for every card in that set. When all the sets are played out, the winner is the one with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
