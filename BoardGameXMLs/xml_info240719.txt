							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Depths to Which I Sink</name>
									
			<description>Descend into tubes, pass through hoops, avoid moving walls and smash windows into pieces. In the Depths to Which I Sink, stereoscopic 3D is an integral part of the gameplay - not just graphics. It's impossible to play without 3D glasses. Your screen becomes a cube, and you will feel like you're floating inside of it. The goals and objectives force the player to think in Z - not just X and Y. The Depths to Which I Sink uses 3D to enrich gameplay and the player&amp;rsquo;s experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
