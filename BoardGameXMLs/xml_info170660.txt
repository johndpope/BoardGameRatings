			<description>Don's Starve Together is a standalone multiplayer version of the wilderness survival game Don't Starve from Klei Entertainment only available for PC/Steam. It features all the content of the original game Don't Starve and the Reign of Giants expansion but with the ability for several players to play together either cooperatively or competitively online. Several tweaks were implemented to try and balance the game for multiple players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stars a number of different characters who have all been transported to a strange world by a demonic creature known simply as Maxwell. Players takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving. It's relatively well known for an Indie game, mainly thanks to a number of lets-plays on Youtube, and features a unique Tim Burton-inspired gothic-cartoon art style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the success of Don't Starve several expansions have since been released, although its worth noting that other then the Reign of Giants expansion which is already implemented into the game they are only compatible with the original Don't Starve, and not Don't Starve Together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
