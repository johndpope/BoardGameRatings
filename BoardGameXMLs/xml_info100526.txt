							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A First Class Murder</name>
									
			<description>Flossie Carrington had it all - she was young and beautiful, she was the heiress to an American steel empire, and she was married to a handsome ex-Guards officer. But last Thursday, the nation was shocked by the discovery of her body, stuffed under the seat of a first-class compartment on the Plymouth Express. She had been stabbed to death and her fabulously expensive jewels were stolen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flossie's father promptly called in Hercule Poirot to investigate. And now he has summoned all those concerned with the case to reveal what really happened that fateful afternoon. One - or more - of you around this table is a murderer. And your task is to discover who that is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the new edition of A First Class Murder, with a new plot and new characters, based on a couple of Agatha Christie's mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
