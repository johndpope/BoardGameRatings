							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom Death: Monster â€“ GenCon 2015 Lantern Promos</name>
									
			<description>The Dying Lantern and Vibrant Lantern promo gear cards were created to celebrate Kingdom Death: Monster's first ever public appearance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards were originally given away at GenCon 2015 to people who participated in a demo of the game vs. the White Lion.  If the group died, each received the Dying Lantern promo. If they survived, they were given the Vibrant Lantern promo.  Both were later made available in the Kingdom Death webstore for purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creator has stated that these promos are just for fun. They do not have associated recipes or rules on how to incorporate them into a campaign; it is meant to be left up to the players how to use them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
