			<description>Your mission is to find and uncover the Master of Disguise - a dangerous criminal who earned this title because of his extraordinary ability to utterly transform his appearance. He can be a tramp one day and masquerade as a Matador the next. It would be impossible to identify him, but he has an extraordinary compulsion to include three out of eight particular features. These are - a blue beard, dark glasses, a red cloth, a leather briefcase, white trousers, a black hat, one black shoe and a brown jacket.&lt;br/&gt;The Master of Disguise can be in any one of 56 disguises. Players have to uncover his disguise by identifying three of the features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disguise (first published as Dr. Futsch - 1984, with same graphics) was republished by Noris: Das Lustige Detektivspiel fuer Kinder - MOG (Mann Ohne Gesicht)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
