							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jomsborg</name>
									
			<description>Jomsborg is freely based on an ancient viking game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is made to symbolise the viking stronghold Jomsborg and the game is centred around the struggle between Harald Bluetooth (Harald Bl&amp;aring;tand) and his son Sweyn Forkbeard (Svend Tvesk&amp;aelig;g). The player playing Sweyn starts at the center of the board with 1 king and 28 vikings. Harald starts as an outer rim on the board with 1 king and 47 vikings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turn moving one piece at a time. Pieces are moved horizontally or vertically - never diagonally - on the board. Vikings can move as many or few spaces as they want in one direction without crossing other pieces. Kings can only move one space at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kings can only be beaten by a king moving to the same space. Vikings can be beaten by having enemy pieces on 2 opposite sides of it. Beaten pieces are removed from play. A piece is captured if it is surrounded by pieces on all 4 sides and at least one of these are an enemy piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweyn wins by having his king reach the outer rim of the board or by capturing or beating Harald. Harald wins by capturing Sweyn or by beating him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
