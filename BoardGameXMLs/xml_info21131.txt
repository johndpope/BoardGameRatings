			<description>The 1965 version has three scenarios.  The deck consists of 36 cards.  The first card displays an advertisement for this product, the next two cards show a list of instructions, and the other 33 cards are divided equally between circus character pictures of heads, bodies, and legs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #1: This version is essentially the only game.  It is for 3 or 4 players.  The head cards are divided equally among the players.  The rest of the cards are mixed up and spread face down on the table.  Player take turns revealing cards in a memory game type fashion.  A player with a &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; card must uncover a &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; card while a player with &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; cards must uncover a &amp;quot;legs&amp;quot; card, otherwise the turn passes to the next player.  The first player to complete all of his funny characters wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #2: A player can divide the three types of cards into three piles for a solitaire version players where the sole player reveals a &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; card followed by a &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; card followed by a &amp;quot;legs&amp;quot; card, creating various funny-looking circus figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #3: A player can place the cards in numerical order to create a &amp;quot;flip-movie&amp;quot; by riffling the top of the deck with his or her thumb.  (It might be noted that these different numbers and pictures on the backs of the cards could be used essentially as &amp;quot;marked cards&amp;quot; for the 3 to 4 player game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
