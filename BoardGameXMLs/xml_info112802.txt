							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dual Deck</name>
									
			<description>The Dual Deck has 96 cards that are similar to Poker cards, except that each card is actually 2 cards combined into 1. There are 2 sets of rank and suit on each card. Players can choose which set they want to use. The Dual Deck puts a new twist on the traditional card games! It is also a cardgame system that is waiting for new games to be designed just for it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
