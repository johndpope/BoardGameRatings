			<description>Necropoly (Game of the Dead) is a spin on Monopoly but the differences are a dead giveaway. Two to six players make their way around the board beginning at Death and navigating through cemeteries and pitfalls trying to build up their stash of personal burial plots and even adding tombstones and mausoleums so they can charge more for other players standing on their grave. The &amp;ldquo;Fate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Communal Coffin&amp;rdquo; cards are hysterical. But beware the devil in one corner; he will send you straight to the fire. &lt;br/&gt;Players advance with the roll of the black dice, paying bones to the bone collector or taking in bones for fees, and the game ends when one player is the last to have bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot of cultures celebrate the dead with holidays like Halloween, Day of the Dead, and All Souls Day. This game is great for all ages and takes perhaps the scariest thing in life and makes it a fun and competitive adventure. The entire family will get into the spirit and will be laughing out loud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
