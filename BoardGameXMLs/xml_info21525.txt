The spinner lists various results in two concentric rings - &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;strike&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; appear all around the outermost ring, while various other results appear sporadically in the inner ring (&amp;quot;foul&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fly to center&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hit to right&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;out at first&amp;quot;, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lineup cards for various teams are included.
