			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LittleBIGPlanet 2 is a sequel to the popular LittleBIGPlanet. The game continues Sackboy&amp;rsquo;s adventure from the first game, and an inter-dimensional vacuum appears over LittleBigPlanet and begins to suck up everything. Sackboy is saved by &amp;ldquo;The Alliance&amp;rdquo;, and he joins them in their quest to stop &amp;ldquo;The Negaivtiron&amp;rdquo; from destroying Craftworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to in its predecessor, with many of the levels being 2.5D platforming stages. Unlike in the first game, however, players can now create different types of levels including racing stages and puzzles. The game allows for an unbelievable amount of customization, allowing players to create levels, bosses, music, characters, movies, and everything in between. Also improving on the original game, LittleBIGPlanet 2 features new enemies, themes, toys, powerups, and machines. The player can even rewire the controller to suit their needs in a stage they have created. Any customizable content can also be found and used online using the new search system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
