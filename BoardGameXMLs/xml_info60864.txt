							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords of Our Fathers</name>
									
			<description>Epic tales are filled with mythic figures and their mighty blades. The fates and fortunes of these bold heroes are irrevocably entwined with the enchanted weapons they carry ever at their sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic swords in d20 System games are usually temporary tools, but Swords of Our Fathers gives player characters a reason to hang on to their magic weapons. The magic blades in Swords of Our Fathers offer minor powers to any wielder, but grant their better abilities to those wielders who take one of four new prestige classes: the sword scion classes. The wielder unlocks new abilities of the weapon by advancing in the weapon's associated prestige class. In short, the prestige classes reward the player for keeping a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swords of Our Fathers includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fifteen new magical weapons, including thirteen swords such as the Sword of Kings and Draakhoorn, the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Doom. &lt;br/&gt;     Four new prestige classes that allow characters to access the special abilities of legendary weapons: the battleblade scion, spellblade scion, faithblade scion, and swiftblade scion. &lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for how to incorporate these powerful blades into your own campaign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
