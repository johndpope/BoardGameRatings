			<description>From the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panthers in the Shadows is an advanced simulation that re-creates World War II tactical level combat in Western Europe, the Mediterranean, and North Africa from 1939 to 1945.  The scale defaults are platoon/section units, 1 minute turns, and 100 meter hexes, although players may customize the first two conditions.  Extremely flexible, Panthers in the Shadows can portray anything from a quick patrol size engagement to a day-long battle between two divisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panthers in the Shadows is much more than just a game.  It is an excruciatingly accurate and comprehensive representation.  Historical force structures are included for the United States, British Commonwealth, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, and Italy.  Over 1500 different weapon systems of all types are available, including small arms, tanks, artillery, guns, rockets, spotter and strike aircraft, landing craft, amphibious vehicles, and warships.  Even more impressive, every single weapon is painstakingly modeled for movement, ballistic, protection, and general characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the depth that Panthers in the Shadows provides, the challenges come naturally.  Forget about learning to beat a &amp;quot;game system&amp;quot; - because real-life tactics produce the same results in Panthers in the Shadows as they did historically.  Also forget about having a force that unthinkingly and instantly responds to your commands.  In Panthers in the Shadows your force behaves like real soldiers that are affected by morale, the command structure, and other intangible factors.  Like no other commercially available computer wargame, Panthers in the Shadows places you squarely in the Commander's position.  It is truly a unique and innovative interactive tool to study and explore military history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panthers in the Shadows - It's not over until the smoke clears!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
