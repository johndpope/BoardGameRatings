							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Il gioco della Melevisione</name>
									
			<description>A game about an Italian TV-series, the Melevisione. The main characters have lost their favourite objects and the players must help them to find back three, randomly chosen at the start of the game. The children roll and move on the board and visit some locations, each hiding 2 items (face-down tokens). When coming to a location, they may secretly look at those object tokens.&lt;br/&gt;Some tiles have special powers, such as swapping places to tokens, getting free moves and so on.&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player thinks they know where each object is, they walk back to the starting place and show the locations of the three items. If they are right, they win. If not, they are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
