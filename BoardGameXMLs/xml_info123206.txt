			<description>From the box:  &amp;quot;Playful Malice is a conversational frolic for adult adults - a game in which players compare views of one another's quirks.  The purpose of the game is to have fun - and, incidentally, to see who wins the most chips.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a round, one person is called the &amp;quot;Target&amp;quot;.  The Target takes one of the 64 cards from the deck and reads it aloud.  He reads the statements one at a time, giving players time to rate each item on their score pads from 0 to 5.  The Target also rates his own personality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the Target will guesses aloud how each player rated him, and depending if he is near or far from the ratings he will receive chips.  The player with the most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
