			<description>The fun family game about Holy War and the End of the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeehawd! is a satirical tabletop game designed for three to six players where you take on the role of a Prophet preparing for the End Of The World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to collect as many followers to your faith as possible before Armageddon to secure your place in the Afterlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game is divided into seven chapters, in which the Prophets use their spiritual connection, as shown by their available Mana, to play Verse cards. A new chapter card is drawn and resolved at the start of each new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different types of Verse cards. &lt;br/&gt;Acts of God: Cards that negatively affect the other players &lt;br/&gt;Miracles: Cards that affect you in a positive way &lt;br/&gt;Disbelief: Cards that cancel or in other ways affect Miracle or Faith cards&lt;br/&gt;Faith: Cards that cancel or in other ways affect Acts of God or Disbelief cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the Prophet with the most followers wins the game, and the rest of you get a ticket to that hot fiery place downstairs. However, should two or more prophets be tied to win, they are all annihilated in a furious Holy War and the next prophet in line wins the game. A game usually takes anything from 30 minutes to an hour depending on how many players you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
