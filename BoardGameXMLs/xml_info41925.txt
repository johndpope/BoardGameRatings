							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Chicago</name>
									
			<description>A word card game made in celebration of the centennial of Chicago's founding in 1833.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has 54 cards: 1 rules card, 1 joker, and 52 letter cards -- the complete alphabet in both red and black.  Each letter card also has a picture from Chicago's history or architecture; the joker, which is a wild card, shows Mrs. O'Leary's cow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for two games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Chicago: Deal 7 per player and turn up the top draw card to start the discard pile.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from either pile and discards 1.  The hand ends when a player can lay down a 7-letter word from the hand.  Then everyone scores for the longest word they can spell: 100 points for 7 letters; 60-30 points for 6-3 letters respectively.  Spelling &amp;quot;Chicago&amp;quot; earns 500 points, which is the goal total of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alphabet Rhummy: Start as above.  In a turn, a player: draws 1; lays down a word of 4+ letters, or adds to either end of an existing word, or substitutes letters in an existing word; and discards 1.  The letters substituted for are taken in to the hand, and must be at least as many as were just played.  The hand ends when a player goes out; he then gets 1 point per card in others' hands.  The game ends when a player reaches  52 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
