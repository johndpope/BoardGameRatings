			<description>A Musical Surprise Game. Musingo by Mattel. Stock #461.&lt;br/&gt;For ages 5 to 10.&lt;br/&gt;Players use one of four different bingo cards and a plastic monkey counter. A racetrack around the perimeter of your bingo card has some squares with coin icons and some with music box icons.  Roll your D6 and if you land on a coin icon, take a coin from the bank.  Land on the music box icon and, if you have a coin, place it in the slot in the music box and turn the crank.  After the Musingo song plays, a slot-machine-like roller will spin and display up to three notes in one of the five colors of the bingo card rows and columns.  Cover a square on your bingo card matching the color(s) displayed on the music box. First person to make a row, column or diagonal wins. &lt;br/&gt;Contains: 4 Monkey Playing pieces; 4 Individual Musingo Boards; 1 die; 48 Musingo Markers; 50 plastic coins; and the 'Musingo' man, an 8 inch plastic music box shaped and colored as mustachioed organ grinder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
