							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Metacell: Genesis â€“ The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Exciting mix of strategy and luck, a 2-4 person, fast paced card game that has unique characters with powerful abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Metacell: Genesis you take the role of one of humanities last defenders who are training to battle a scientific abomination that was created by our hunger for answers on the nature of reality. Battle your friends and learn the skills you'll need to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick match making game play and activated player powers, with sudden game endings and complex scoring system creates a dynamic game that can either be a drawn out head to head or quick sudden duel. The rules include a 2p vs. 2p teams mode, as well as modes for 2, 3, or 4 players to play independently. Awesome variability in play makes it a game with plenty of replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
