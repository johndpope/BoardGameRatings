							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wallis&#039; complete Voyage Round the World: a new geographical pastime</name>
									
			<description>A double hemisphere map of the world overlaid with a point-to-point track. Players start at Portsmouth (#1) and roll an eight-sided teetotum (dice were heavily taxed in Britain at the time) to move along the track, trying to get to London (#100).&lt;br/&gt;Each space has a description to help the player learn about the place he is visiting, and some have favourable or unfavourable effects.&lt;br/&gt;e.g. #62. Hudson's Bay - the English have several forts. Stay one turn and trade with the natives for beaver and other rich skins and fur.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Like the Game of Goose, there is a 'death' space (Magellan Straights #89) where &amp;quot;the traveller is shipwrecked and loses his chance of the game&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;The game was published until at least 1802.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
