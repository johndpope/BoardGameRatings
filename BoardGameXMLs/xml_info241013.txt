							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turkey Catchin&#039;</name>
									
			<description>Tom the Turkey is no dummy.  He knows that Thanksgiving is right around the corner, and he needs to get out of here before you and your friends fence him in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns playing fence pieces trying to capture Tom.  But with every piece, Tom also makes a move!  Plan your moves carefully, but if you get stuck, you can always lure Tom back with Turkey Feed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players win if they can make a complete fence around Tom.  Tom wins if he makes it all the way off the map before the players fence him in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
