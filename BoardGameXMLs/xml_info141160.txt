			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you overturn a worthless chunk of granite, you note a faint shimmer in the dust. Could it be? You quickly pick up the mineral and examine it closely in the light. It's a diamond all right -- and not a bad size -- just waiting to be cashed in, cut, and mounted on some high-born blueblood with an inflated bank account. Should you risk remaining in the mine looking for more stones, or return quickly to the surface with your valuable find?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eureka is a fascinating game of diamond mining. As a prospector, you search high and low for a glimmer of that most elusive of gem stones. But no matter how many stones you find, you always run the risk of losing all -- if you're not careful. Good hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
