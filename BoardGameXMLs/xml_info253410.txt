							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eldritch Weapons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excalibur. Varunastra. Mj&amp;ouml;lnir. Fragarach. Tyrfing. Stormbringer. Dragnipur. Mythology and fiction are rife with epic tales of legendary weapons imbued with amazing powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small supplement provides a quick and easy system for generating potent magical weapons, using a regular deck of playing cards. It provides a list of thirteen different trappings for each of the five characteristics (Boon, Geas, Nature, Legend, and Destiny), and the abilities of the relic are determined by drawing five cards and cross-referencing them on a table. Drawing multiple cards of the same rank also increases the overall power of the weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be aware that these weapons are designed to be powerful, comparable with the true relics in the Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion. Eldritch weapons are not mere trinkets to hand out at random during an adventure, they should be a major part of the story, perhaps even the focus of an entire campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
