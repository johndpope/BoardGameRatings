							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psionic Powers</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of psion in the world, wild psions and true psions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;True psions&lt;br/&gt;It costs 6 points to become a true psion, this gets you three level 1 psionic abilities and 6 power points with which to power these abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you create your psion you must choose one specialist school which you are very good at using and one trouble school you have great difficulty using. Your three starting level powers must be from your specialist school. You may not start with any level 2 powers. The general sphere cannot be chosen as specialist or opposite and always costs the cheapest cost to purchase from. True psions cannot be mages or soul casters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild Psions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wild psion ability can be bought by any class and costs 4 points. The three points gain you one level one ability and three psi points per day with which to use it. A character with a wild psion ability does NOT count as having a secondary class psion. Mages and soul casters can have wild psion powers. Wild psions only regenerate psi points through a good nights sleep and as such once they have used their three psi points they cannot regain them until the following day. Wild psions may not purchase additional psi points. Wild psions may also never attain abilities of greater than level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild psions that wish to increase their powers may do one of two things&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st they can purchase the wild psion skill again and get another level 1 power and another 3 points to use it with. Characters may buy the wild psion skill as many times as they like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd they can spend another 4 points on the wild psion skill and make themselves up to a full psion, this makes them a full psion with psion as their secondary class. Mages and soul casters with wild psion powers CANNOT take this option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
