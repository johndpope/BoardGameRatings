			<description>This rare game is one of only two published by Hamilton-Meyers Co. of Middletown, PA around 1890.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a fairly routine roll-and-move affair, with players having to move four pawns from the castle in their corner of the board toward the center. The tracks are separate and colored red, yellow, blue and black, but they do cross over one another, with a picture of various bridges in the spaces where they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork is fabulous, featuring medieval knights in battle, castles and heraldry, all in pastel tones, with an elaborate wreath in the middle awaiting the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
