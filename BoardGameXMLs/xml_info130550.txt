							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sum Ducks</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sum Ducks is a captivating game that combines lively, colorful animation with mathematics to add up to sum fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Jenny and her animal friends by the side of the bright blue pool and toss rings around the necks of the ducks swimming by. But you don't want to &amp;quot;ring&amp;quot; just any duck. Because each duck is marked with a number - and all the numbers figure in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star off with basic arithmetic. Get your feet wet with the Addition game. Or select the Subtraction game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out! Just when you think everything's going smoothly, a duck you need will duck under the water, and you'll have to toss a ring to make it pop back up. Sometimes you'll ring the wrong duck, and oops! Down it goes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound tricky? Don't worry, you'll catch on fast. And after you've mastered addition and subtraction, why not toss some rings at the more advanced game which teaches you all about multiplication and factoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
