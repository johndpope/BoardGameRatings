In the chili of pre-dawn London, a top secret file was stolen from Q Branch despite the tight security of M.I.6 headquarters. The files, containing chemical warfare secrets from Nazi Germany, were passed on before the thief was arrested. The culprit one of the most trusted and loyal Q Branch technicians!
