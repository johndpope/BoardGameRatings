							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Merry Christmas</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Merry Christmas is probably the earliest known version of Mall Madness type game.  In the game, players roll the dice and move to make their way through the streets of the village. Players visit the local shops and spend their money to purchase all the items on their families Christmas wishlists.  The first player to buy all their items and returns home will be the winner in this vintage Parker's Brothers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
