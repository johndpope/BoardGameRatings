Smelling porridge and comfy beds, they head to the village. &lt;br/&gt;In the village, the grown ups won&amp;rsquo;t wake up! The babies wake each other up and grab their parents armor and head to the wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACCESSIBILITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower Babies is a fantasy themed board game for ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOALS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower player must defeat all monsters. Monster player wins if one monster reaches the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower player begins by placing the ₩ wall pattern piece. Place the walls so that they do not prevent a path from the starting to ending spot.&lt;br/&gt;After Tower player has placed a wall, Monster player rolls a d4 and places that many paths. Walls may not be placed on paths.&lt;br/&gt;Tower player places a wall from wall pattern ₩ to pattern &amp;yen; to pattern &amp;pound; and back to pattern ₩. Monster player rolls a d4 and places paths until the path reaches the ending spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the path has reached the end, Tower player places a tower on a wall that is not within the starting zone.&lt;br/&gt;Monster player spawns a monster.&lt;br/&gt;Towers may fire or reload. Then, place a tower until a maximum of five towers is reached.&lt;br/&gt;Tower player may move towers that can move.&lt;br/&gt;Monster player moves monsters up to their full movement as long as they do not block the starting spot. &lt;br/&gt;Monster player spawns a monster.&lt;br/&gt;Repeat these steps until the sixth monster is to be placed. Monster player may now play a monster and the boss monster. No more monsters are spawned. &lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all monsters are killed or one monster reaches the end of the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
