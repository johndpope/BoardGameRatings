			<description>This game in the KI.KA Spiel series by Kosmos uses characters from a German children's television programme, KI.KA. Chili, Briegel and Bernd are packing to go on holiday and each player is helping them to pack 15 items in their suitcases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a chip with the face of each of the 3 characters, and a number of tiles shaped like cards, planes and ships (modes of holiday transport) in 3 different colours (red, blue, yellow) are placed in the centre. There is a stack of rectangular card tiles showing different numbers of items one might bring on holiday (books, caps, sunglasses, slippers, etc.) and each player reveals one card. Players then place a chip on the items they would like to pack. Cards without chips are discarded, cards with only one chip are taken by the player who put the chip there, leaving cards with more than one chip on them. Ownership of the tiles with more than one chip are resolved by throwing a six-sided die showing the 3 forms of transport and the 3 colours. Players with a chip on the card being competed for now grab as many of the colour or kind of transport shown on the die - the player who grabs the most gets to keep the cards and the items on it.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to pack 15 items in each of his or her 3 character's suitcases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
