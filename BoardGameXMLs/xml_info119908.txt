			<description>A typical roll and move game with a theme of travelling by car through western Europe. Each player draws destination cards and have to travel from Berlin to them and back to Berlin the fastest. There are naturally some special fields along the way; bordercontrols, gas stations and accidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version is Norwegian, with no known publisher, but with production nr 2201 and according to the map and general production has to date from the between the first and second world war. There are references to East Prussia and Jugoslavia on the map as well as country borders that are different than today's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As game production in Norway was very limited during this period, and the fact that Berlin is the starting and ending point as well as all the countries and cities are named in their national language, one may assume that the game is a localized version of a foreign game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
