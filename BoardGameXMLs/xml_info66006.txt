			<description>The Noble&lt;br/&gt;One of the Unlikely Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Length: 5 pages + licence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are dangers in the courts, as much as there are dangers in the life of an adventurer. But few that have the opportunity to choose a life of luxury would instead choose to put their lives on the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher classes have many advantages over the poor and middle classes. They have the time to learn to self-defense, and the money to live healthy and buy tutors in whatever arts and skills might take their fancy. Some choose to devote themselves to the courts, in the currying of favor and trading of secrets, while others devote themselves to the knighthood, to defend their land in war or their reputation in the tourney. But few, if any, seek adventure: they have others to risk their lives for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, however, adventure comes calling, irrespective of station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upper levels of society give rise to the Nobles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy literature abounds with tales of ordinary folk, lifted to the status of Hero by extraordinary events. The Unlikely Heroes are seven character classes with concepts drawn from the standard NPC classes in the DMG. They are for those exceptional people who choose not to adventure, but should fate intervene, their quality shines through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
