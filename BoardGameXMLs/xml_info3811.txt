			<description>Free web-published card game that can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.xenomind.com/ludo/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.xenomind.com/ludo/index.html&lt;/a&gt; (currently this page is down).  Made to be printed on business cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are evil geniuses attempting to satisfy the requirements for performing &amp;quot;Greater Experiments&amp;quot;, such as building a robot army or mastering weather control.  Among the requirements are various ingredients, such as body parts or duct tape, as well as completing &amp;quot;Lesser Experiments&amp;quot;, such as building a mind control laser or harnessing a brain in a jar.  These lesser experiments also require ingredients, and once completed they can give players special powers (such as increasing their hand size).  Players may trade with other players for ingredients and whatnot on their way to world domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
