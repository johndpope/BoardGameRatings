							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fane of the Heresiarch</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None know from where the Heresiarch first came, but all remember the night that it did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It rode down from the bleeding stars on a great serpent, hurling bolts of obsidian lightning that shattered the monuments and capitols of every nation. Its infernal army swept aside the defenses of the mortal empires in a single hour, decimating legions once thought to be the invincible fist of humanity's god-kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faceless priests - each bearing the symbol of the trident - drifted through the fallen cities and scorched villages on a frigid wind, and when they rose to greet the huddled men and women ringed by their festering, bloated dead, they spoke a single, simple offer: worship the Heresiarch or die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of crusaders fell tonight so that you might be given this chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a last stand that, for the first time, united all of the empires of humanity as brothers and sisters, a way was cleared into an infernal stronghold said to contain a gate to the Heresiarch&amp;rsquo;s fane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All is silent save for the clangor of distant battle. Surrounded by grim-faced knights and teary-eyed peasants &amp;ndash; their hands clasped in desperate hope &amp;ndash; you step through the glowing, churning doorway, knowing there will be no help and likely no return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
