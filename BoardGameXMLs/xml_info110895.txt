			<description>From the concept introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game where you play teenagers, teenagers given awesome powers, these awesome powers perhaps are manifesting their emotions, driven by their desires, focused on another person, or perhaps it is not the emotions that manifest the powers, but being given those powers creates the emotional craving (as if they were some odd variety of vampires).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using those powers, they try to gain control of their object of desire, they try to fulfill their wishes. Their emotions both chain them, limiting what they can think of, as if they were halters on their eyes, and manifest as powers, the ropes with which they will wrest control of destiny, bring down the moon and take control of it. As they exert their power over others, they too are manipulated by those emotions &amp;ndash; until you cannot say who pulls and who pushes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
