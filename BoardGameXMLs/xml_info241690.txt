			<description>The players have to move their token from start to finish. The token have holes in their center, which are used to move the token with a stick (lance). Movement is determined by 40 small cards with letters on them. The cards are used to form the words &amp;quot;Ruck&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Zuck&amp;quot;. The players start with 3 cards, lying open in front of them. Every turn the player draws a card. As soon as he can form one of the two words the player has to move his token accordingly. &amp;quot;Ruck&amp;quot; means forward and &amp;quot;Zuck&amp;quot; means backward. The number of spaces is equal to the number of cards used to form the word (2-4). If a player moves his token onto a green space, he may move forward to the next green space. A red space means the player has to move backward to the last red space.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the finish wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
