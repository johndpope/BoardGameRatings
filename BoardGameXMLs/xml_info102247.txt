			<description>OVERVIEW: A dice game for two players. Players create random FORCE POOLS, arrange them secretly into four Lines opposite each other, then reveal their setups and resolve combat. The leftover 5 COMMDICE may be added to a player's Line using SPECIALS [surprises]. Loser of each combat surrenders a die from that Line. After three rounds of play, the player with the most captured dice wins.&lt;br/&gt;DETAILS: Each player starts with their own pool of 45 dice. Select 10 randomly and roll, repeating twice for a possible 30 dice FORCE POOL [some may be chosen over others]. Players then bid for a COMMON DICE POOL of 10 dice. Winner rolls the COMMDICE, keeps three and passes two to the loser. Players then secretly arrange  their dice into four Combat Lines [hence the name]. Each opposing Line is resolved [with special dice that can remove, add or manipulate dice in their own or opponent's Line] with the loser surrendering one die. After three rounds of play, the player with the most captured dice wins. &lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS: &lt;br/&gt;90 dice [total]&lt;br/&gt;- 45 of one color [Player A]&lt;br/&gt;- 45 of a different color [Player B]&lt;br/&gt;- 10 of a third color [Common Dice]&lt;br/&gt;a pair of hand-sewn dice bags&lt;br/&gt;a 20 page rulebook [includes a complete game, in step-by-step example format]&lt;br/&gt;a pair of laminated cheat sheets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
