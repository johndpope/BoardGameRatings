							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken Hill Class Prospector</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2285 AUship held a series of meetings with several large Australian resource companies operating large holdings both in Earth system and other interstellar locations. As the meetings progressed a specialized design began to evolve that would eventually become the Broken Hill-class prospector. Construction of a prototype commenced in July 2287 and by the middle of 2288, the five hundredth anniversary year of the settlement of Australia, orders were placed by all four participant companies. This entailed an order of sixteen ships with options for additional hulls should the design prove itself in service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prospector allows for up to four mining cutters to dock and transfer mined ore to the two ore holds. There are two cargo locks on either side of the access and docking spine that directly deliver ore to a hold via a dump chute. The prospector can only carry two mining cutters externally but the added flexibility of allowing two more cutters to simultaneously dock to transfer ore during mining operations is a definite bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 12: Broken Hill-class Prospector comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The prospector is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Ships of Clement Sector 12: Broken Hill-class Prospector also includes the Venture-class Troop Transport.  A variation of the Broken Hill-class prospector, the Venture-class troop transport is marketed as an affordable transport vessel for small system defense forces and private security contractors (mercenaries). The distributed hull design and large small craft carrying capacity of the Broken Hill allows for relatively inexpensive conversion into a light military transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
