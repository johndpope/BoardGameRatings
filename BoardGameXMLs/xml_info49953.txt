			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology is power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power corrupts. Therefore absolute technology corrupts absolutely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an Age of Revolution; the world has been cruelly purged&amp;hellip; in fire, and blood, and steam. From the past, untold horrors wait to clutch at men&amp;rsquo;s souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an Age of Invention; even the Laws of Nature must fall before the power of Progress! Sinister villains plot to use their newfound inventions against society, nature, and even God Himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an Age of Steam; the most brilliant minds of the age experiment with novel, wondrous ideas - but is mankind ready for such power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Screampunk presents a toolkit for incorporating Victorian steampunk into games of gothic horror. Included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A guide to gothic horror themes, locations and plots, with suggestions on how to add a doom-laden atmosphere to your games.&lt;br/&gt;     The use of weird technology as a corrupting influence.&lt;br/&gt;     Real-world Victorian scientific institutions - and the mobs that opposed them.&lt;br/&gt;     Character archetypes including the cruel guardian, the sinister servant, the ingenue, and the swarthy foreigner.&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure seeds, plot hooks, and guidance for running gothic horror scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ominous shadows of the past loom over the present. The forces of reason man the last barricade against superstition, medieval barbarism, and ancient nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you stand against the darkness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
