							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Omicron Protocol: Shadows over San Lazaro</name>
									
			<description>San Lazaro, the city by the bay, a shining jewel of a city on the West Coast of the United States.  It is the year 2050, and one of the most virulent strain of avian flu had just struck the city.  The National Guard mobilized to help with the overwhelmed hospitals and emergency services, and everything seemed routine.  But something didn&amp;rsquo;t seem right this time.  The city was quarantined within a week, with barricades and checkpoints set up all around the city that kept people from leaving.  At first, the citizens went about their daily lives as before, hoping they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t contract the flu.  Then, all of a sudden, all of the high level city officials and law enforcement evacuated overnight and the citizens were left to fend for themselves.  All the while, rumors spread quickly about some &amp;ldquo;loonies&amp;rdquo; on the streets who had begun to attack and murder the city&amp;rsquo;s residents indiscriminately&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omicron Protocol is a small scale near-future sci-fi skirmish game in which rival factions fight for the scarce resources they need to survive the downfall of civilization. Each faction and its members are represented by detailed 30mm miniatures, and players can play out the story of the game cooperatively, or battle it out on a 2&amp;rsquo;x2&amp;rsquo; board to dominate what was left of San Lazaro. The characters each have their own rich history and personality, as well as powerful abilities they can use to help their faction survive and escape the City alive!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omicron Protocol is filled with innovative game mechanics that will make each game feel dynamic, cinematic, and bring players deeper and deeper into the colorful world of San Lazaro!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
