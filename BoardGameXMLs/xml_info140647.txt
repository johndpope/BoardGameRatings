							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Scalphunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assassins today must deal with ever increasing security measures. Technology like X-ray screening units and metal detector make it nearly impossible to get a weapon near a heavily guarded target. A new breed of hired killer has developed a new method to bypass security. Known as scalphunters, these assassins can summon weapons into their hands from a mysterious dimensional pocket. No one knows how they are able to summon these weapons or where the weapons come from but no one has been able to detect a scalphunter before they summon a weapon. This 6 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Haven: Full Metal Zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
