			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For hundreds of years, the monks of Sheargardt Manor at Luci Keep have provided spiritual guidance, and world-class ale to the folk who lived nearby in Luci Village. The Keep itself was tasked with keeping the pass over the high mountains of the central continent safe for travellers throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in recent months, creatures dark and wicked have plagued the countryside. The &amp;lsquo;insectmen&amp;rsquo; (as the locals named them) have created no end of anarchy and fear among the populace. And especially within peaceful Sheargardt Manor itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After many dark days, the Abbot Christoph sent no further word regarding his battle against the foul creatures. The brothers and sisters of the Abby contained the creatures that swarmed below the venerable building. But on a day, nothing more was heard from the Caelian monks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the fate of the monks? And what is the nature of the creatures that roam freely below the catacombs of the monastery, the keep, and the village? Only a foray into the dark depths of the earth will tell truly...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
