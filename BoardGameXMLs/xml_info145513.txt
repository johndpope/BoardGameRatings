			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the strange and exotic (not to mention very dangerous) girallon. These four-armed, white-haired, gorilla-like creatures have been with the game since they were printed in the 3rd edition Monster Manual, and have always been kind of unusual. The first of our three new takes on the girallon is the howler girallon (CR 5), which trades in some of the girallon&amp;rsquo;s size and strength in exchange for a suite of potent vocal attacks, similar to certain howling monkeys. The spore-back girallon (CR 8) is more intelligent, able to use weapons and tools, and covers its fur in irritating spores and poisons its own teeth in order to better disable foes for its own nefarious purposes. Finally, the behemoth girallon (CR 15) is a massive, silver-backed version of the creature which not only has two additional arms, but potent regeneration and spell-reflecting abilities, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
