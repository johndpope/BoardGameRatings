							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mentis: The Wolf</name>
									
			<description>The Wolf adds a new tile to your starting hand but is not considered part of the core game. The Wolf introduces an imbalance to the game (and its core strategies) which is why it is not considered part of the base game. The Wolf is intended as an extra tile to add just a little bit of lighthearted fun and a small token of appreciation to those who backed the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deployment Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wolf obeys the regular deployment rules except that, unlike regular tiles, the Wolf can be deployed onto a tile adjacent to an enemy tile.&lt;br/&gt;The Wolf cannot be deployed as part of a stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wolf tile can move only 1 square per turn and can move diagonally. &lt;br/&gt;The Wolf tile can never form part of a stack, either during or at the conclusion of its move, nor during the movement or at the conclusion of the movement of any other tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capture Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wolf tile can only capture an enemy tile which is one tile away, orthogonally or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wolf cannot block any attacks, and the Wolf can capture and be captured by all the other tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
