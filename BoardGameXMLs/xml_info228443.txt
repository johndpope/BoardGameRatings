							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tarzan and his Animals</name>
									
			<description>There are two ways in which the game can be played.&lt;br/&gt;One is for two players, in which one player is Tarzan in charge of the animals, and the other player is the Hunter operating the cage and attempting to capture the animals.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for Tarzan to direct the animals to the safety of the game reserve without letting the Hunter capture the animals.&lt;br/&gt;The other way in which the game may be played is for two to five players. Tarzan and his helpers share out an equal amount of animals each. In this game one player plays the Hunter so this is a one versus many game.&lt;br/&gt;The animals are moved according to the result of dice throws. A player may move only one animal per turn. Each player must move one animal the number he throwed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
