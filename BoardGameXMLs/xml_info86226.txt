							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom is an action adventure game for the Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles. The game centres around an unusual pairing: a human thief named Tepejo and a troll-like Majin called Teotl. The two have teamed up to defeat the forces of darkness that have swept across the land and recover Teotl&amp;rsquo;s memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In single-player mode the player controls Tepejo as the duo travel through the kingdom. Elements of stealth action, puzzle solving, platforming, and combat are all interwoven into the quest, which is driven by a strong storyline. The AI teammate is helpful in a number of different situations, and can make battles much easier by allowing Tepejo to eliminate or avoid enemies by utilizing the environment. Although the game starts in a small restricted region, as the player progresses they gain access to more areas and are able to freely explore their environs. Majin appears to be influenced by Ico-like features, but is a distinctly unique game in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two player co-op mode is also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
