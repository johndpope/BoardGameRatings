			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the super-fast card game Supermarket Shuffle, you are shopping at the supermarket and trying to grab the best combination of items in your shopping cart. Score points for collecting the most apples. Watch the Daily Specials to help you pay for you groceries using less money And once you're done shopping, you might have won a special prize! But be careful which groceries you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you! And make sure you have enough money to purchase your groceries or you have to give them back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supermarket Shuffle takes card-drafting mechanisms and distills them into a 20-30 minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of &amp;quot;draft and pass&amp;quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum.  As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of groceries you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
