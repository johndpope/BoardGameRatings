			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tar Kiln, a wild region of wooded hills, cut by deep gulches, where giant blocks of gray stone rise from the upland prairie like islands in the sea. Here streams feed lakes or wild rivers and the sky seems to stretch on forever. But the Tar Kiln is not a kindly place; it is littered with tar pits, constantly oozing the ichors of the world's birth upon the green grasses. And it is home to wild beasts, hunting dragons, bull headed men and tigers so large their fangs are like sabers. And in the midst of all this lie the ruins of an ancient god, Nunt, master of dark places. Only the hardy dwell here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such is Brian, Lord of Helliwell, who rules his people with benevolent neglect. He asks no more of them than their oaths require, nor does he give them any more than his oaths demand. But herein lies his doom, for to protect his people he&amp;rsquo;s crossed his King, and suffered the loss of his son. Borne into the wilds of the Tar Kiln by mercenaries, the boy is gone. But Brian must head off to the south to confront his monarch, turning to other to aid his child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you find yourselves entering the Tar Kiln, and the wilds, whose echoes carry a terror, that only the bold can face. For in them, lurk monsters from the edge of nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaping Bones is a fast paced pursuit adventure that plunges the characters into the wilds to find a boy whose captures are anything but normal mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
