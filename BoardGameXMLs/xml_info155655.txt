			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something dreadful has come to Ravenor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People are disappearing. Fishing boats have been found drifting unmanned through the morning mist. A river boat, loaded with cargo bound for the town of Ravenor, was found run aground, the crew and cargo missing. Who or what is responsible for these acts is not known. The Lord of the Vale ordered a search of the banks of the Crysamar River. All that was found were a few strange tracks along the river bank and a river flowing out of a previously undiscovered cave and into an isolated cove along the Crysamar. Desperate for answers and desiring justice, the Lord of the Vale and the town council are offering a reward for any willing to explore the cave and, if they are there to be found, return with rescued captives, recovered cargo and proof that those responsible have been brought to justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The barge is anchored outside the cove, your equipment loaded and the boat is ready to be underway. Are you prepared to travel up the river and discover what lies within the Caverns of Chaos?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CV2 Caverns of Chaos is a Labyrinth Lord adventure for characters of 1st to 4th level. The adventure includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete Background and Start information,&lt;br/&gt;     a Map of the Caverns,&lt;br/&gt;     over 30 Encounters,&lt;br/&gt;     7 New Monsters,&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caverns of Chaos is the second in the Fantastic Adventures series of products from News Realms Publishing. Set in the Crysamar Vale, Caverns of Chaos continues the adventure begun in CV1 Catacombs of Chaos, or can be played separately if desired.
