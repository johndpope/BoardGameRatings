			<description>This game was manufactured by Novelty Manufacturing Co. out of Richmond, CA in 1955. Arm chair quarterback is a game that consists of a game board, first down/yardage marker, 11 red defensive pawns, 1 tan offensive pawn, and a huddleboard with two metal stands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the gameplay: The huddleboard is placed in the middle of the board allowing the offensive and defensive teams to call their play.  The offense has 9 spots/plays to place their pawn.  The defense has 11 pawns with 16 spots to try and stop the play of the offense.  When the huddleboard is removed each team can see the result of the play. At each spot on the board a result of the play is posted as whether its a gain, loss, turnover, TD, or incomplete. After each play, you record the information on the yardage/down marker. Like football, the offensive player must make 10 yards in 4 downs to continue or the the board is turned around to switch positions.  The game can be played for 30 or 60 minutes depending on your preference. Note: All plays are based on national averages. There is no advantage to either team. It all depends on how good you are at playing QUARTERBACK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
