			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: You are led into the king's hall where he sits on a throne on an elevated dais at the far end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: We walk forward, bow and present the gift offering of peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: How is the gift presented?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Hmmmm...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gifts - the word conjures images of brightly wrapped packages and eager anticipation on a recipient's face.  In games, gifts are often presented to adventurers for their heroic deeds or presented by adventurers to nobles or as offerings to deities to gain favor.   A poorly presented gift can reflect as badly on a group as a poorly chosen one.   Unfortunately, a present's appearance is often glanced over.  Never fear -- your friends here at Healing Fireball are here to help with a collection of tables to make each gift you deliver a memorable one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This table presents tables for wrapping modern gifts, fantasy gifts and even sci-fi and steampunk gifts.  Stuck for gift ideas?  Then check out our free sister product, What to Give the Adventurer Who has Everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
