							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Elf on the Shelf Naughty or Nice Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The Elf marker is placed in one of six locations on the board based on a card draw.  Players spin to determine how far they can move (0-6 spaces) their pawns and the first player to reach the Elf's location gains a token worth 1-3 points.  A new location is drawn for the Elf and the cycle is repeated six more times.  The player with the highest point total after the Elf has been reached at the final location wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
