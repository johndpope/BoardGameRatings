			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the sun rises over the horizon, you see the glimmer of ICBM's de&lt;samp&gt;cending from the sky. As you leap into the computer control console, the panel becomes active showing your two missile silos ready. The targeter locks into position and your ABM's launch trying to save the cities below. You realize that this is only the first wave of enemy missiles. As each wave descends, the difficulty increases, making accuracy and absolute must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This realtime game (with sound effects) pits your twin silos of ABMs against a barrage of enemy missiles trying to destroy your cities. As your skill increases so does the difficulty of this ever popular arcade game! Watch the skies and may our aim be true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete with high score recording, realtime graphics, sound effects, bonus cities and MIRVs. This game will captivate your computer for hours on end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
