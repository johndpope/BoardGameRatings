			<description>Oh no! The Space Program is in peril now there's NO MONEY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD!! That won't stop two scientists from taking on the Orbit project, a no-budget exploration of our solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dodge through asteroid fields, and avoid nasty enemies intent on stealing cash, fuel, or just throwing slime in your eyes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By collecting the money mysteriously floating in orbit around the planets, you'll give the project a cash boost, upgrading shonky systems and gaining new ships to move beyond the Moon - from Mercury to Uranus - as never before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbit's research menu features almost 200 unique upgrades, plus there are hidden relics and blueprints to find, stat tracking, and 12 challenging medals to earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The launch pad is all set. Are you ready to get into Orbit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
