			<description>ï»¿Marvin Redfield&amp;rsquo;s mother always told her son he was born under a lucky star, that he was promised a great destiny. And she was right: the little boy was gifted with incredible luck. Yet Marvin didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for anything. Being left in peace was all he wanted. Marvin&amp;rsquo;s life was turned upside down the day his family was caught in a grisly accident. The boy was extracted from the rubbles without a scratch but was now an orphan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years flew by and Marvin became a bodyguard. As if to ward off the past, he used his luck to better protect his fellow Survivors. When the zombie apocalypse came, Marvin was not afraid for himself but for his friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays, Marvin scouts the city trying to save as many people as possible. His legendary luck hasn&amp;rsquo;t left him and gives him the aura of a &amp;ldquo;redemption angel&amp;rdquo;: some people pray to him and beg him to find their lost ones amidst the death vortex. Marvin&amp;rsquo;s still cool: no way he&amp;rsquo;s going to become some kind of messiah. His dearest wish hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed since his childhood: all he wants is to be left in peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marvin is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Kickstarter campaign.  He may be available in limited quantities at upcoming conventions.  A zombie version (Zombivor) will be available to backers in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
