			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Players create numeric patterns (sequences and series like 1,2,3,4 or 2,4,6,8 etc.) much like they would create words while playing Scrabble. There is an amazing number of possibilities, a lot of fun and all players compete equally while receiving play money as they show off their creative ability.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with $1000 and 7 numeric tiles.  On a player's turn they must create a numeric pattern using at least 3 of their 7 tiles.  Points scored are equal to the sum of the numbers played, multiplied by the number of tiles played.  Additional tiles can be purchased with game money.  Additional money can be earned by creating a pattern where the sum of the numbers is equally divisible by the number of tiles played.  The game ends when no more tiles are remaining.  The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
