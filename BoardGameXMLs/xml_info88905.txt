			<description>Tasked with cultivating crops on 8 alien planets in order to fund space travel, the player must combat rival alien farmers whilst planting and harvesting crops for income, the ultimate goal is to reach the final planet and take possession of a batch of alien weedkiller called agent orange. Play begins with the player's mothership heading to the first planet, the mothership displays the number and strength of enemy farmers on the planet. The mothership contains seeds and 8 smaller daugheterships; seeds generate crops when planted and daughterships are combination fighter craft and planters. When ready the player's first daughtership is launched onto the planet's surface, it is this vehicle which the player directly controls and each represents the player's 'lives'. The daughtership can move in eight directions, the play area scrolls left and right from the mothership. Alien farmers attack while the daughtership flies around the planet's surface, initially they can be destroyed easily but this becomes more difficult as play progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Agent Orange (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
