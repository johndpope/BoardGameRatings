			<description>Blood on the Streets is a 132 page hardback book which supplements the Judge Dredd Miniatures Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life has never been easy in Mega-City One but, with BLOOD ON THE STREETS, it's about to get a lot tougher!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Blood on the Streets, you will now have a new way to fight in Mega-City One, the Cursed Earth and beyond, with a new range of scenarios tailored specifically for each force. These allow you to play games that reflect the comics and the activities your force will be typically getting up to. For example, you can now play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Judges rushing to extract an informant from a criminal before he is rumbled.&lt;br/&gt;     City-Def soldiers conducting a weapons test on a rival block.&lt;br/&gt;     Apocalypse War Resistance fighters engaging in a midnight raid on an enemy position using bat gliders.&lt;br/&gt;     Sky Surfers practising for the next Supersurf competition.&lt;br/&gt;     A mob war between organised crime syndicates.&lt;br/&gt;     The Angel Gang rescuing captured family members.&lt;br/&gt;     Chief Judge Cal using Klegg mercenaries to hunt down traitors.&lt;br/&gt;     Cursed Earth Desperadoes holding a fort against all-comers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amongst many, many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood on the streets also includes rules for all the latest releases in the Judge Dredd miniatures range, including Max Normal, Grampus, Shamed Judges, and the full force lists for the Judda, Klegg Invasion Forces, Mechismo Strike Forces and the ABC Warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If that were not enough, there are new Talents, allowing you to further specialise your Heroes, Judges and psychics with truly awesome feats of skill and ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Blood on the Streets. Mega-City One has never been deadlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
