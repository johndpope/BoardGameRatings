							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fearsome Critters of the Woodlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remote mountains and forest wildernesses are home to strange creatures that are almost never found in dungeons, or any kind of captivity. Traditionally, the only way to get information about these &amp;ldquo;fearsome critters&amp;rdquo; is to encounter one, or talk to a lumberjack, miner, or hermit that lives in the area. Discerning what is merely a tall tale, and what is stone cold truth, is a problem for the players to solve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas many role-playing game monster supplements draw heavily from European mythologies, these fearsome creatures are all drawn from the folklore of North America. As a result, there are several Dungeon Crawl Classics settings where they are already obviously appropriate &amp;ndash; areas that deal with Western, Appalachian, or post-Apocalyptic America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The authors urge you not to be limited to just these settings when introducing fearsome critters. Just as, in DCC, orcs might appear in a Western adventure, or robots in what is otherwise a fantasy setting, so too might hide-behinds lurk within a dank forest near your PC&amp;rsquo;s home village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fearsome Critters of the Woodlands is a monster sourcebook for the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
