			<description>3 Cards to Midnight is a new style of game with elements of traditional adventure games and casual games built around a compelling story experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last thing Jess Silloway can recall is meeting her boyfriend, Daniel, for dinner on the eve of her thirtieth birthday. The next morning, she'll fly to the Florida Keys to celebrate her birthday with her parents aboard her father's yacht. Everything in Jess's life is good...on track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except...something feels different. Maybe it's just her impending birthday &amp;ndash; some kind of mini-midlife crisis. Or maybe it's something else...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jess suddenly finds herself in a room with a man she's never seen before, who tells her that something has happened...something that has caused her to block out the events of the past days or weeks since her last memory. The man is there, he says, to help Jess remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The man lays out a series of Tarot cards, each of which seems to trigger memories of a person or place in Jess's subconscious &amp;ndash; some from childhood...others from the recent past...and some that are totally unfamiliar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The man asks Jess to choose one card and focus on it &amp;ndash; and so begins her chilling journey into the past...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
