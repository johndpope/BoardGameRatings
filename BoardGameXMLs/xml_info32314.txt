			<description>From the publisher: &amp;quot;On this superfun lake you'll catch fishes of all sizes. The largeer fishes worth 3 or 5 points each and the smaller ones 1 or 2 points There are also the fishbones that are worthless, they are there just to hinder your fishing. So you'll need a bit of luck to catch the better fishes before the other player. Who get more points at the end is the winner!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cute little game for the small kids (ages 4 to 8), where two players race to catch the most fish but also the bigger fishes. When all the fishes are caught, players add their points, who got the most wins, simple as that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
