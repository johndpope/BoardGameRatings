			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 5th Edition compatible adventure for 4-6 PCs of levels 8-11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are asked by a friend, Captain Erfaran Honamatros, to find out what has casued the death of one of her fellow captains. After weeks of storms and bad weather, ships from Mohkba haven&amp;rsquo;t been arriving, but a body has floated in. Captain Honamatros is so concerned that she offers her ship, her crew and even to pay for the journey if the PCs come along, as well as everything they find unless it is a keepsake. The captains that sail the Serpent Lake are experienced women and men and the loss of a ship and its complement is a rare event outside of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What starts out as a journey to discover what sank a ship quickly becomes more involved.

The task is now to decommission the machine and make the sailing route safe once again.
