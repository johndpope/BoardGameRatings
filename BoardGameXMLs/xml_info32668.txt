							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hypercube Hop</name>
									
			<description>Hypercube Hop is the first game from Brane Games. 2-6 players each take turns to move their individual wooden pieces one step around a flat representation of a four-dimensional space, collecting small stones as they pass over them. At the end of the game, the player with the most stones wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appeal in the game comes from the simplicity of the rules and the different strategies that are needed when playing with different numbers of players. Advanced players will discover that careful negotiation can allow them to strategically &amp;quot;fence in&amp;quot; players who take an early lead, giving rise to diplomatic gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
