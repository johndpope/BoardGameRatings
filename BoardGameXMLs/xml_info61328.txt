							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribebook: Children of Gaia (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hand That Offers Peace&lt;br/&gt;There is no peace in the World of Darkness, but the Children of Gaia would change that. From the tribe's origins in Mesopotamia to their hidden efforts in the war-torn modern world, the Children have always tried to promote healing and unity. As werewolves, they know it's their duty to fight the last battles of the Apocalypse, but their love of life is their strength. Gaia willing, it won't prove a weakness as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the Claw That Protects It&lt;br/&gt;The next in the revised Tribebook series examines the Children of Gaia, the werewolves that strive to heal as well as kill, protect as well as destroy. This expanded and revised edition outlines all the strengths and weaknesses of the tribe, from their vast healing powers to the conflict between their desire for peace and the instincts that drive them to hunt and slay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
