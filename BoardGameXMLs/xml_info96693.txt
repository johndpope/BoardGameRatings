							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Land Grab</name>
									
			<description>Land Grab is an abstract played with a standard chess set.  It was first published as part of Chief Herman's Next Big Thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to, using your pieces, create a continuous line enclosing over half of the board, including your home row.  Pieces move as in normal chess, although the king is the only piece which can capture.  Pieces start off of the board and each turn a player can either place a piece on their home row or move one of their existing pieces.  Which pieces can be placed is determined by the number of pieces of both colors already in that column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
