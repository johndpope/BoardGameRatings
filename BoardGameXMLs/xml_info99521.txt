			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of games that utilize the Keyboard Controllers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touch Me (1 or 2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must correctly repeat a sequences of tones. The sequence gets long with each attempt. The game ends after one player has entered four incorrect sequences, or once both players have completed a full 32 tone sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Me (1 or 2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is similar to Touch Me, except that a sequence of numbers must be repeated rather than a sequence of tones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture Me (1 player)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four objects are briefly displayed on the screen in a specific order. The player then has 20 seconds to correctly replicate the order in which the objects were displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find Me (1 or 2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four objects are displayed on the screen. All but one are identical. The player scores points by identifying the dissimilar object as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add Me (1 or 2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four or five numbers are displayed on the screen. The players must enter the sum of the numbers before a time limit expires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Me&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pressing the keys on the keyboard controller will produce various tones. The game manual lists the key combinations to play the songs Happy Birthday, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Three Blind Mice, and a &amp;quot;two-player&amp;quot; medley of Row Your Boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
