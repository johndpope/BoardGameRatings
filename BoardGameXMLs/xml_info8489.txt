			<description>A collectible game with hexagonal tiles. Two or more generals move their armies against each other. &lt;br/&gt;To do that each player must build his deck but the strength of a players' deck is limited by a total rating of each tiles' power. Tiles can be units, spells, maneuvers or battlefields. The tiles are drawn randomly and can be used afterwards in the players turn. Like in Magic a turn consists of different phases. The number of actions per turn is limited as well.&lt;br/&gt;The game is won if a player can't perform an action or loses all his battlegrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collective aspect of the game is not too strong because only one additional release of tiles were made so far. But the players' decks are nicely balanced because the game limits the total strength of a deck. So tactic and a good hand in drawing tiles is more important than spending money on tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
