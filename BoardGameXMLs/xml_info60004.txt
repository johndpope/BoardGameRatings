							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classic BattleTech Master Rules</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is the new revised edition. BattleTech Master Rules replaces the BattleTech Compendium: The Rules of Warfare as the single-source rulebook for advanced BattleTech players. The complete guide to combat in the 31st century, it includes all the rules needed to simulate exciting conflicts between BattleMechs, vehicles and infantry, as well as special rules for artillery, hostile environments, air and naval forces, and much more. This new rulebook combines material from BattleTech, 4th Edition; CityTech, Second Edition, and other sources in the most comprehensive set of rules ever published for the BattleTech game system. Also included are complete new table-top miniatures rules that let players play BattleTech in three-dimensional terrain. Inner Sphere and Clan 'Mech designs, plus scenario-building rules and the Battle Value System for balancing forces, let players create their own BattleTech games from the ground up, and make this book a must-have manual for BattleTech enthusiasts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the 31st century, a time of endless wars that rage across the known universe. These epic conflicts are won and lost by BattleMechs, 30-foot-tall, humanoid titans of metal bristling with high-intensity lasers, rapid-fire autocannons and dozens of other lethal weapons; enough firepower to level entire city blocks. Your elite force of MechWarriors drives these juggernauts into battle, blasting at your opponent's 'Mechs in a deadly game of kill or be killed. Will they become instant legends, or forgotten casualties? Only your skill and luck will determine their fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on years of experience, this book combines the best of the BattleTech board game into a unified whole. BattleTech Master Rules is entirely restructured and streamlined; it is the same game, but like you've never seen it before. This book includes the complete game rules, a quick-and-easy scenario creation system, the Battle Value point system for evaluating 'Mechs and balancing forces and revised and expanded miniatures rules. This revised edition of BattleTech Master Rules has been updated to incorporate all Level 2 weapons and units presented in various technical readouts and Field Manuals.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
