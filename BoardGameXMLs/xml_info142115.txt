			<description>&amp;quot;Working Dawgs: A-Maze-ing Pipes celebrates the classic pipes puzzle game with a fun, new twist. Set on the construction site of the Working Dawgs, players will need to work quickly and efficiently to complete the challenging pipe puzzles before time runs out. Using different pipe shapes, wrenches, and even bombs, players will be able to route the incoming flow and direct it to the puzzle&amp;rsquo;s goal. If the pipeline doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect from start to finish before time runs out, the water will burst through to flood the Dawgs&amp;rsquo; work site. With 80 unique and progressively challenging puzzles, players will be increasingly entertained as they save the work site from the impending water flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because A-Maze-ing Pipes is based on the classic pipe puzzle game, players of all ages can enjoy the colorful world of the Working Dawgs. As the player progresses through each puzzle, The Working Dawgs will help the player by delivering integral pipe pieces and wrenches. At the end of each puzzle, the Dawgs will celebrate the player&amp;rsquo;s success, or will panic depending on how the pipeline directs the gushing water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, bonus points are awarded when the water is routed in the correct direction in a designated puzzle area. As each puzzle is completed, the player will be awarded points, earning them an overall construction grade. The additional challenge of earning the highest grade on each puzzle makes this game even more captivating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working Dawgs: A-Maze-ing Pipes is the puzzle game you simply won&amp;rsquo;t be able to put down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     80 Puzzles to conquer.&lt;br/&gt;     A point total and grade are awarded depending on pipe pieces and bonuses acquired.&lt;br/&gt;     Dawgs will help to bring supplies to solve each puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;     Use bombs to make room for more pipes.&lt;br/&gt;     Large scrollable play areas.&lt;br/&gt;     Drag-and-Drop stylus control.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher/Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
