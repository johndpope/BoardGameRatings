			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put on the market as Flanker 2.0, this title is the 2.0 version of 'Su-27 Flanker'. However, this was not only marketed as a new game, the game itself underwent severe remodelling, including now both the Su-27 and the Su-33 (the navy version of the Su-27). Since the Su-27 is a pure air superiority fighter and the Su-33 is also used for ground attacks, this makes a pure air-to-air sim a new game about all-round fighter combat with both air-to-air fights as well as ground attack missions.&lt;br/&gt; On top of that, the game now has 3D accelerated texture-mapped graphics, giving it an entirely new appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, the in-game menus and pop-ups are language dependant (so the French version is in French), but the cockpit itself is purely in Russian, as is it's real life counterpart. Players do have the option to switch the HUD (Heads-Up-Display) between Russian and the game language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
