			<description>The pirate with the most jewels wins this head-to-head game. Players must move their colored pieces around the board attempting to capture opponents 10 pieces and the five jewels which occupy the board. Players depart either hidden or safe harbour at the start, and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do so the players move their pieces one or two spaces per turn in any one direction and attempt to land atop an occupied space, capturing either the pirate piece of an opponent or a jewel which resided there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captured pieces are removed from the board, and a player wins if he or she removes all of the pieces belonging to an opponent. Otherwise, play ends when all of the jewels have been claimed, and the player with the most jewels wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
