			<description>Fantasia comes with 49 plastic playing pieces (flat squares of varying size, all about 2mm thick), a mounted map 16&amp;quot;x18&amp;quot; (40x46 cm), and 4 pages of illustrated rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side, red and blue, have 21 pieces with simple illustrations to distinguish them: one sorcerer, three wizards, three hunters, three warriors, five archers, and six soldiers.  In addition there are seven yellow pieces representing treasure to be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a hexagon of hexagons (think Settlers, but it's not geomorphic).  Each edge of the entire hexagon is made up of six smaller hexagons.  These are in three colors: red, blue, and yellow, such that no two hexes of the same color border each other.  Two of the corners have castles printed in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving one piece at a time.  Each of the pieces moves and captures differently.  Basic chess-like rules apply: one piece per space, you can't move through a piece (though there are some knight-like pieces that can jump), land on a piece to capture it, promotion of the lesser pieces if the reach the opposite side, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five different victory conditions given in the rules.  Players must decide on victory conditions before beginning the game.  They can be combined, such as &amp;quot;Sudden Death&amp;quot; (capture the opponent's sorcerer) and &amp;quot;Castle Occupation&amp;quot; (just what you think it means).  The treasure pieces aren't used unless one or both of the treasure victory conditions are in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's basically it.  The pieces are rather bland, but the board is a must for abstract game designers who think in primary colors ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
