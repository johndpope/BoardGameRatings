			<description>Taken from the box:  &amp;quot;Eyes down for a new way to play Bingo - on DVD.  Its easy!  All you need is the remote control.  &lt;br/&gt;Why pull numbers out of a bag, when you can sit back and watch every draw 'live' on your home TV with family and friends.  And there's no need to shout out the numbers anymore - not when Mike Vyse, National Bingo Caller of the Year, calls every  game for you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a DVD and TV (or PC) to run the game and announce the numbers.  Players have wipe-clean bingo cards and mark off their numbers with pens provided.  The first one to complete the card is supposed to say &amp;quot;Party Bingo&amp;quot; and then gets to sing and dance to 'The Winners Song', if they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
