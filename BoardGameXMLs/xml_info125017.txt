							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Gods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Down the rough streets of Philadelphia, a solitary figure walks. He is dressed in a shabby suit, giving all outward appearance of a normal person. Perhaps not entirely normal, his pale skin and the dark makeup around his eyes contrast with his pinstriped suit. A neon light shines onto the damp street ahead. It sits above an unassuming door, beer signs illuminating the small windows on either side. The sign reads &amp;quot;The Golden Bough.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Gods is a campaign frame for Mortal Coil. Old Gods still live among us, fading but not gone. Their followers are all dead and no one makes sacrifices to them any more, but they linger on, powerful yet useless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Gods is a fully sketched out setting in the form of a detailed theme document, with all of the world set-up choices written out in detail. The frame is customizable by your game group. You choose a tone, and pick the magic level that is appropriate for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
