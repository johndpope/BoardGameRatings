							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Microcosms: Half-Elf Barbarians</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microcosms are intended to give some interesting, unique options to a specific race-class combination in your fantasy campaign. With feats and prestige classes that support these options and offer interesting angles on staples of fantasy role playing, Microcosms can expand previously flat characters into creatures that stand out from the rest of the adventuring pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMs too can benefit from Microcosms. By utilizing the feats, prestige classes, background information, and peripheral features (like monsters, special items, NPCs, etc.) DMs can present their groups with surprising opponents that possess abilities capable of raising the eyebrows of even the most jaded gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microcosms: Half-Elf Barbarians provides players and DMs with a set of options for those human hybrids that are rarely considered candidates for the berzerker's path. The 17 page, full color, bookmarked product includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     19 New Feats: Including Olu-Na Hybrid Form which allows the raging half-elven barbarian to become a lycanthrope-like terror, and Mystic Conduit, a single feat that changes the very nature of the barbarian class.&lt;br/&gt;     2 New Prestige Classes: The Olu-Na Champion, a paragon warrior of his people and Mystic Channel the apex of supernatural fury.&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics for the snow leopard.&lt;br/&gt;     A short history of the Olu-Na tribe, and optional backstories for any half-elf barbarian close to your heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
