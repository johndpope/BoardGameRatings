			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirror, mirror on the wall...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you is a dark forest with trees rising as much as a hundred feet into the air. Foreboding and sorrow seem to emanate from within. Occasionally, shadowy creatures are glimpsed moving among the trees. Slow, plaintive howls echo among the dark branches as a cool wind begins to blow, as if whispering barely discernable words&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;She has returned. She has returned. She has returned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows of the Dusk Queen is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible adventure for 8th-level characters that takes players deep into a forest out of a dark fairy tale, where a long-imprisoned fey queen has returned &amp;ndash; and evil creatures are stirring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring full-color art by Brian Syme, Shadows of the Dusk Queen is great for groups who love dark fantasy adventure, or for GMs looking to shake things up by bringing a little fear to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whispers are getting louder. Do you dare take the forest path, and learn the secrets of the Dusk Queen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 12-page art and map appendix to speed play; heavily illustrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Adventure for levels 7 and 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
