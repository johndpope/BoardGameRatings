							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Canadian Armchair Football</name>
									
			<description>From the Rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canadian Armchair Football is a game designed to test the football enthusiast while at the same time teach the novice the intricacies and strategy of Canadian football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player becomes the quarterback.  By referring to the play book, he calls the plays using his own strategy to score points by moving the ball down the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed for two players, the game lends itself well to a solitary player or several divided into teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to consist of calling an offensive play (short run, long run, pass) and then rolling the dice to determine the outcome of the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;One gameboard, two dice, two tokens, yardsticks (used to measure the 10 yards for a first down and record the downs), a play book, instructions, and one statistics score pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
