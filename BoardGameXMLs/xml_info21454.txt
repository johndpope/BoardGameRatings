							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crow Hunt</name>
									
			<description>This 1931 game from Parker Brothers was advertised as a splendid shooting game. Crows were inserted on a slide at the rear of a target and automatically appear one at a time. Using a repeating rifle which shot 6 elastic bands, the object was to hit the birds who slid down the ramp and into an opening in the background target.  When you hit one the next one slid down into place. Each bird that you hit was worth 1 point. The last bird hit was a duck named &amp;quot;Elmer&amp;quot; He was worth 5 points if you successfully hit him. First person to get 25 points won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the ad for the game stated that additional ammunition (60 elastic bands) were available for 30 cents from Parker Brothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
