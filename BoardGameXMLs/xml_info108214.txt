							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BODY COUNT: Terror at Camp Hackaway</name>
									
			<description>It's 1984 and this is the last summer before you and your friends head off in different directions to college. You have all packed up the essentials and headed out in Billy's van for the camping trip of a lifetime. The camping spot Billy's family has always enjoyed is so secluded you have to ditch the van for the weekend and hike a couple of miles to reach it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gang finally arrives at a small clearing, sets up camp and begins to enjoy a weekend that should be wrought with pranks and campfire stories and memorable moments... but the first night proves it to be an unforgettable event for a much different reason as a violent storm rips the campsite apart and forces your gang of friends to abandon the camp set out for the van. But, through the storm, Billy gets turned around and leads everyone in a different direction. After a half hour of trudging through the forest and being assaulted by the torrential rain and heavy winds, you all break through the treeline and happen upon a small group of cabins. You lead the way and rush to one. Finding refuge inside the dark, musty cabin, you discover that the lights don't work and the phone is dead, yet you all take comfort in the belief that everyone is finally safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for some idiotic reason, you all decide it's more important to explore the other cabins on a dark and stormy night than just rest in this one until daylight. WHY?! Why would you do something so stupid?!!! Oh... wait... of course, you're in a slasher movie... that's why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon you and your group of friends come to realize that you are all being stalked and murdered by a seemingly unstoppable mad man known as Hackin' Hank who roams the grounds of his family's abandoned summer camp ground... Camp Hackaway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In BODY COUNT, you get to step into the role of a stereotypical slasher flick teenaged summer camper or as the silently stalking slasher flick psychopath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 ways to play!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a camper, cooperate with your fellow campers to find items and weapons that may help you survive the night as you attempt to escape Camp Hackaway alive. Do you have what it takes to outwit Hackin' Hank, find the items you need and make it out in one piece or are you going to end up just another number in Hank's Body Count?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Hackin' Hank, use a bit of strategy and a bit of luck to silently stalk and hack the campers to pieces one by one, gaining more power and becoming a more efficient killing machine with each camper you add to your Body Count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
