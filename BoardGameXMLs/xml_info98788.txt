			<description>Midnight Mutants is an action/adventure video game for the Atari 7800 prosystem. The game, along with Sentinel, was one of the last releases by Atari for the Atari 7800.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight Mutants features a broad video game landscape with many locations, a background musical soundtrack, battles against boss creations and an animated introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight Mutants tells the story of the young boy named Jimmy Harkman, who, on Halloween night in 1992, learns that his grandfather has been turned into a pumpkin by a villain named Doctor Evil. On Halloween night in 1747, Doctor Evil had been burned at the stake as a witch by a Jonathan Harkman, an ancestor of Jimmy's. When Doctor Evil returns from the grave in 1992, he takes out his revenge on Jimmy's grandfather, by transforming Grandpa into a pumpkin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With his grandfather now taken away from him, Jimmy heads on a Halloween quest to try and find a cure that will return his grandfather to human form. With Doctor Evil on the loose, Jimmy finds the countryside has become inhabited by scary creatures such as zombies and werewolves that can injure him physically and also make his blood impure. Fortunately, even though Grandpa is trapped in pumpkin form, he is available to give Jimmy advice on occasion with the click of a button. Along the way, Jimmy can collect weapons and items that will help him in his quest to defeat evil creatures, giants bosses, and, ultimately Doctor Evil himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight Mutants is a scrolling action/adventure game with a horror theme. It is displayed from a pseudo-isometric viewpoint and features a completely free-roaming world design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his quest to save Grandpa, Jimmy travels across the country side, exploring an old haunted mansion, a secret laboratory, underground caverns, a haunted forest, a pumpkin patch, a haunted graveyard, an old shipwreck, among other locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, Jimmy is powerless to fight the evil that faces him and must rely on his wits and grandpa's advice in order to stay alive. Contact with the creatures roaming about will either cause him physical injury or make his blood lose its purity, both of which will prove fatal if he's not careful. As the game progresses, he locates various weapons of increasing power, health power-ups and other useful items that make it possible to defeat the minions of evil. Key parts of the game culminate in battles against giant boss creatures that take up most of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Midnight Mutants&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
