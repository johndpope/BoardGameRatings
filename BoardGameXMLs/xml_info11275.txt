							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sue For a Million</name>
									
			<description>British game with the object of successfully suing other players and defend against their lawsuits. Players move around the board; who can sue whom, and for how much money, depends on where the players land. Players sue in one of four torts: assault, fraud, libel and negligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a hand of evidence and other cards, which are used to determine a trial winner, if a trial is necessary. The winner is the player who has the most money when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be played by 2 or more, but is best with at least 3 and not more than 6 persons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
