							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: &quot;Nightwatch&quot; Elite Premium</name>
									
			<description>This is a special premium-painted version of Koshka and her Grand'Ma walker that come in the Operation Zverograd expansion.  Because it includes its own reference cards, this is playable with or without the Zverograd expansion.  It is available for purchase by Elite members of Paolo Parente's Dust website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are very proud to introduce our first Elite Exclusive item: Koshka and her own walker Grand'Ma. They are both presented here in their &amp;ldquo;Night Ops&amp;rdquo; version, used during many special operations in all parts of the world where the SSU is present. Koshka is the most active and successful SMERSH operative ever. Many of the SSU bold operations have been made possible thanks to her and the skills she has piloting her very own war machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can see this &amp;ldquo;Elite Version&amp;rdquo; comes with a special diorama base that can also serve as a playing base for Grand'Ma (it takes one space on the field). The walker can also be placed on a regular grey round base that we have magnetized: you can swap Grand'Ma from one base to another with ease.&lt;br/&gt;We also magnetized Koshka: she can be played independently, the rock under her feet is the same size as a regular base. And thanks to the magnet she can be placed back on the large base with her robot with instantly. In an instant Koshka and Grand'Ma can go from a Collector Item to being fully playable. And of course, as usual, everything is already painted and you can enjoy it as soon as you open the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular pose of the KV47, on which Grand'Ma is based on, has been specifically created by a good friend of Dust Studio: Italian modeler Livio Emanueli. He has taken the time to help Vincent create this unique model for you during his last visit in our production facility in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course these two models come with their very own unit cards, but these are stat and skill wise identical to the regular Dust Tactics version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
