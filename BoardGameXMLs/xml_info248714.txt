			<description>Star-Hammer is a set of miniatures rules based on the &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot; movies, using alterations to the Warhammer Ancient Battles rules, so you will need a copy to play them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are a tactical level game over the vastness of space.    It is a game of movement and not about getting your Squadrons facing the right direction (so no need to turn or wheel).  The Shooting Phase been removed and all combat takes place in the Hand to Hand Phase, because Fighters only can shoot at each other and cannot fire over the great distance of space.  Full Army Lists included, which includes; X-Wings, Tie Fighters, and the Millennium Falcon, Also statics for ships from the new movies (The Forces Awakens)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author designed the rules to use his collection of &amp;ldquo;Hot Wheels Star Wars Starships&amp;rdquo; toys, through any Star Wars miniatures could be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
