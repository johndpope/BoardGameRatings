							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Across Angry Waves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ocean itself seems to fight back against the united armies of the pegasi and the griffons, with waves and wind as its foot-soldiers. Will the landing force be too wrecked, after their ocean voyage, to wage war effectively?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only you and your brave party of adventurers can break this trail, find out what has angered the ocean, and stop it. Or will you break instead? Will it all be for naught and your bones join those of countless ponies at the bottom of the ocean?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure that starts at level 3 and ends into level 5 and continues the fight, bringing the war to the doorstep of the elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is made to scale for a party as small as three or as large as six. It's set in the world of Everglow, but standard PCs (humans, dwarves, maybe not elves) can function just fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
