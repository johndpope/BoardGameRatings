			<description>This Poker-type game clearly derives from Primero. In this game there is only one round of wagering, but there are three sparate stakes. Every player gets two cards and a third one which is revealed. The first stake goes to the player who has the best card among these. The second goes to the player with the best hand. The third goes to the player with the best cards totaling, or most approaching twenty-one points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
