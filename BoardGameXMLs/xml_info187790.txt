			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In By the Shadow, players encounter a world of the dead. People who die usually dissipate into levels we don't know of or maybe they disappear into nothingness. In some circumstances, they're left in the shadow world, the land of the dead. Some types of dead can interact with the living world and some can't, but they all have one thing in common: all kinds of occult-dwellers are intrigued by them. Players can portray either dead people or occultists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are presented in five major HTML sections:  Main (introduction), Character Creation, Rules, World (setting), and Adventures.  The Rules present a fairly straightforward implementation of Fudge.  Adventures presents a few plot hooks which would require substantive development prior to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
