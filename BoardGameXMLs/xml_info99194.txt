			<description>Mutt-Opoly is a mutt-themed version of the game Monopoly, &amp;quot;celebrating the world's most popular dog.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this roll-and-move property trading game, properties are individual mutts that can be traded between players. Properties also include themed locations such as a fire hydrant and butcher shop. Other themed features of the game are Dog Toys (rather than houses) and Big Bones (rather than hotels), &amp;quot;Good Dog&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bad Dog&amp;quot; cards, and the Kennel, where a player may end up out of the game for three turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pay money when they land on each other's properties, and the goal is to bankrupt your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
