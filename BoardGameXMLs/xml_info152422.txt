			<description>FM14 features a revamped transfer module where opposing clubs and managers adopt a more realistic approach when making or responding to transfer offers. In addition, a number of new &amp;lsquo;real world&amp;rsquo; transfer clauses have been added, such as the ability to loan a player back to the club he&amp;rsquo;s just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of cash and loan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance fee. The old &amp;lsquo;turn-based&amp;rsquo; system of transfer negotiations can now be done two ways, the tried and tested system and a new &amp;lsquo;live&amp;rsquo; system, similar to that used in Football Manager's contract negotiations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interaction between players, managers, their rivals and the media has been improved. For example, members of the coaching staff now offer feedback on how reserve and youth team players are performing. Managers can also ask key players to have a word with unhappy squad members, while the introduction of an end-of-season meeting allows the manager to let the squad know how they have performed and set targets for the coming season. Contract negotiations are more realistic in the game, as managers and boards can now make demands and lay down their visions for the club in both initial job interviews and contract renewal discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Managers can attempt to renegotiate transfer and wage budgets as a reward for staying loyal if they&amp;rsquo;ve been offered a job by another club, with the outcome helping to aid their decision on whether to move or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Football Manager 2014&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
