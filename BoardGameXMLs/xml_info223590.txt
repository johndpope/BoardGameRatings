			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third game in the Shields &amp;amp; Swords II series tackles two unusual engagements. In both battles, the &amp;quot;invincible&amp;quot; Livonian Order - an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Knights - met their enemies atop a frozen body of water, and in both cases, they suffered a humiliating defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1242 battle at Lake Peipus was immortalized in Sergei Eisenstein's rousing film &amp;quot;Alexander Nevsky&amp;quot;, and is probably the first thing most folks think of when they hear &amp;quot;Battle on the Ice&amp;quot;. This battle should have been a cakewalk for the Livonians, as their elite, well-armed, ruthless cavalry were facing a feudal army of peasants. But Nevsky exhibited sound tactical judgment, and a deployment of his own cavalry at just the right time turned the tide decisively in his favor. Similar to THE GRUNWALD SWORDS or S&amp;amp;S I game OUR ROYAL BONES, this battle allows the Novgorod Player to choose the exact moment to bring in his horse archers (making their first appearance in the S&amp;amp;S II series). The longer he waits, the more VP he'll score, but the greater the chance that it'll be too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1270 Battle of Karuse, fought on the frozen Baltic Sea, is a bit more obscure, but quite possibly more interesting. This time around it's the Livonians and their allies against a Lithuanian Army under Grand Duke Traidenis. The Lithuanians use sleds as a defensive barrier, and use hit-and-run tactics to unhorse the bold brothers. Special rules for unhorsing, dismounting, and charging the sleds give this one a lot of nuance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both battles see a force that's strong in cavalry brought low by a force that's predominantly fighting on foot. Semi-random force pools utilized in each battle provide additional replayability. As always, the core S&amp;amp;S II system - easy to learn, teach, and play - allows for a fun, fast, streamlined medieval experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
