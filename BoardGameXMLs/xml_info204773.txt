							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wave</name>
									
			<description>A hand sensing, light changing, exciting modular game system complete with 5 different modes! Wave your hand over the top to activate the 5 different sections. The 5 modes are Catch Me, Join, Remember, Follow, and DJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catch Me: A target color will appear. The five sections will blink on and off with different color lights. Every time the target color appears, move your hand over it to score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join: Your goal is to connect the two like colors that appear in the set of five within a few seconds. Wave your hand from the first color to the second to paint The Wave with that color and score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember: A sequence of five lights will appear. After a few seconds the sequence will shuffle itself. By waving your hand from section to section, you can exchange the positions of colors. Recreate the original sequence in time to score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow: The Wave will say a target color and present you with five lights. Wave your hand over the correct one to move to the next level. Each level's difficulty increases by increasing the amount of colors you need to remember in order while decreasing the time and shuffling up the lights each time you hit a correct color!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make Music: A free play mode where you can make your own jams! Wave your hand over a section to turn it on, triggering a music loop to play until the section is turned off. Hold your hand over a section to play an alternate loop of the same type. Combine different music loops and explore the beginnings of becoming a new DJ!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
