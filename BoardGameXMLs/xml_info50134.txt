			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Is Meaningless in Castle Tristenoira&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forlorn has long remained hidden in the shadows of notorious Brovia and Kartakass, yet the tiniest domain in the lands of the core is nearly as old as Ravenloft itself. This land is sick with evil, a twisted mockery of the place it once was. It is filled with creatures of despair who were drawn into the demiplane of dread....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within Castle Tristenoira lies oblivion. The crumbling keep slips in and out of time, carrying its unwary explorers across the centuries, where they may be abandoned to the cold winds of eternity - and to the ghosts in the castle! Spirits both innocent and guilty haunt the timeless passages, whispering tales of murder and vengeance. Escape is for the lucky ... or the hopelessly mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Castle Forlorn boxed adventure set provides the DUNGEON MASTER with a rich and complex domain in which to set a campaign of any size and duration. It includes a 96-page sourcebook. The Weeping Land, which reveals the complete history of the domain and the strange and terrible lord who rules over it. Descriptions of the living and dead who call this lovely land home abound, as do details of the forbidding Tristenoira castle where adventurers may spend an evening or an age.&lt;br/&gt;After learning Forlorn's history of sorrow, the DM can lead player characters into Melancholy Meetings, a 32-page collection of encounters that provide adventure in every corner of the domain. Finally, only Eve of Sorrows remains which is a 32-page assortment of mysteries and nightmares within the castle itself.&lt;br/&gt;This deluxe boxed adventure set completes the portrait of Forlorn with a highly detailed, double-sided poster map of the castle, a poster map of the domain, and a special wall poster created by award-winning artist Robh Ruppel - all in full color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
