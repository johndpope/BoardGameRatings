			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the Back of the Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you interested in classic paper-and-pencil role-playing games, but you have no idea where to start? This is the book for you! The Role-Playing Game Primer starts from the very beginning, first showing you how to play, then giving you hints and tips on how to do it better. Later chapters provide guidance for beginning Game Masters, to get you up and running even if you have little or no experience as a player. The RPG Primer is aimed at players and GMs of &amp;quot;Old School&amp;quot; paper-and-pencil role-playing games and their modern &amp;quot;retro-clones.&amp;quot; It features several of the earliest and best known of the Old School Renaissance games, including Basic Fantasy RPG (by the same author), OSRIC, Labyrinth Lord, and Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
