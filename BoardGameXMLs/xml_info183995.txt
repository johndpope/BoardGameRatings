			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build Your Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With nothing but their wits and strength, your hardy band of hearthlings will carve a place in the wilderness. Watch a clearing become a camp, and then a town&amp;hellip; and soon, a thriving outpost of civilization! There are no limits on what you can build&amp;hellip; what your settlers can imagine, they can create.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expand Your World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All your hearthlings begin their story as simple workers. But as your village grows, your hearthlings will grow along with it. Watch with pride as their skills and capabilities expand; from carpenters and farmers to masons and blacksmiths&amp;hellip; and beyond. The variety of items they can craft and the abilities they learn will make their village the envy of its little corner of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight, Defend, &amp;hellip; and Attack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your hearthlings are not alone in their new home. The wilderness teems with unfriendly characters&amp;hellip; and sooner or later, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to deal with them. Some are annoyances, and some&amp;hellip; are the stuff of nightmares. Make sure you prepare your villagers to meet the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
