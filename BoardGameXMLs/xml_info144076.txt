							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Against the Slave Lords</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Against the Slave Lords is a hardcover collection of four classic Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure modules that form a series -- A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity, A2: Secret of the Slavers Stockade, A3: Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords, and A4: In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords -- complete with original black-and-white interior art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added to the collection is an all-new fifth adventure -- A0: Danger at Darkshelf Quarry -- that you can use to kick off an AD&amp;amp;D campaign that pits a group of adventurers against the evil Slave Lords! Module A0, designed for levels 1-3, sets the stage for events that unfold throughout the remainder of the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity: It is time to put a stop to the marauders! For years the coastal towns have been burned and looted by the forces of evil. You and your fellow adventurers have been recruited to root out and destroy the source of these raids&amp;mdash;as hundreds of good men and women have been taken by the slavers and have never been seen or heard from again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A2: Secret of the Slavers Stockade: The battle against the slavers continues! You and your fellow adventurers have defeated the slavers of Highport, but you have learned of the existence of another slaver stronghold, and you have decided to continue the attack. But beware! Only the most fearless of adventurers could challenge the slavers on their own ground, and live to tell of it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A3: Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords: Into the Drachengrab Mountains! Hot on the trail of the marauding slavers, you and your fellow adventurers plunge deep into hostile Hills. Spurred on by your past success, you now seek the heart of the slaver conspiracy. But hurry! You must move quickly before the slavers recover from your previous forays and attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A4: In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords: Trapped in the dungeons of the Slave Lords! The hardy adventurers must find a way out, with only their wits and courage to help them. But can they do it before everything is destroyed by the dreaded Earth Dragon?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book can also be run using the new D&amp;amp;D Next (or fifth edition) play-test rules, by encorporating the bestiary pdf in the June 7th, 2013 D&amp;amp;D Next Play-test document available from the Wizards of the Coast Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
