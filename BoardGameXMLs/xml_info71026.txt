							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Order</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the human history of Exodus, the mysterious entity known only as the Kaga has imparted its subtle wisdom upon the leaders of men.  The Kaga&amp;rsquo;s will and knowledge have flowed out across history, sometimes a soothing balm against the harsh wounds of war, and other times a spiced perfume - enticing mortals to loftier heights and goals.  But always the Kaga has its will in the world, and that will is served by a hand &amp;ndash; a hand known only as the Order. This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History of The Order&lt;br/&gt;     The Order&amp;rsquo;s Headquarters &amp;amp; Methods&lt;br/&gt;     Agenda and Methodology of The Order&lt;br/&gt;     Membership in the Order&lt;br/&gt;     New Prestige Classes: Auger and Harbinger&lt;br/&gt;     New Spells: Body Theft and Mind Worm&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items: Infiltrator&amp;rsquo;s Graft, Memory Graft and Mind Defense Graft&lt;br/&gt;     5 New Feats including Arcane Utility, Great Insight and Subtle Spell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this, plus added for free: Terrornomicon: Khaynites. The undisputed masters of First One society, the Khaynites are both a race and a priesthood, an entire species dedicated to the worship of the grotesque god of blood, Khayne. Depraved and sadistic, the Khaynites are also brilliant and mighty, and to defy their will invites tortures beyond imagining. The Khaynites have long desired a return to glory in Exodus, and after two thousand years of exile, they are prepared to fight with all their formidable resources to effect that return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
