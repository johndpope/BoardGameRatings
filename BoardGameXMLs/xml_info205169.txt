			<description>This undated card game has a deck of 40 cards with a motor vehicle theme. There are four suits (red, blue, green, yellow) and most of the cards have illustrations of cars, trucks, motorcycles or buses. A few cards (different in each suit) have hazards or stop signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to the left of the dealer starts by playing his lowest card of any suit. Whoever has the next highest puts it on top, with play continuing until someone plays a stop sign card or until no one can follow. Then the next player starts a different colored suit (missing a turn if he has no other color). Winner is the first to get rid of all his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
