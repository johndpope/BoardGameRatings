			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhance Your Utility Belt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vigilante class, introduced in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Intrigue, is one of the most modular classes in the game, allowing players to heavily customize their character with both vigilante and social talents, and, through use of archetypes, create vigilantes that are focused on combat, stealth, or even magic. Further, the class drips with crime-fighting flavor in the style of comic book superheroes. So, what is the one thing that all vigilante players will want? An even greater arsenal of options!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents nine new social talents and sixteen new vigilante talents, giving your character the edge on both the battlefield and his or her social circles. Use your social identity&amp;rsquo;s renown to attract a crowd of admirers just when you need them, gain a personal assistant who can help manage your social life, or ensure that your social identity always has a standing invitation to anywhere you might want to go. On the vigilante side of things, use your cloak or cape to block enemy blades and help you perform tricky maneuvers, be sure to take your enemies alive with talents that help you subdue your foes and bind them more effectively, or gain a utility belt from which you can draw items as a swift action. This book contains all that, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
