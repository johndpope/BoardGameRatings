			<description>Legendary Showdown: Machines and Magic combines the worlds of Girl Genius &amp;amp; Gunnerkrigg Court to create comically epic battles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worlds of Girl Genius and Gunnerkrigg Court are about to collide in a legendary showdown!  Legendary Showdown: Machines &amp;amp; Magic is a game of comically epic battles where each player uses strategy, sabotage, and one-upmanship to develop a secret battle plan.  This lighthearted and easy-to-learn tabletop game is designed to be enjoyed by experienced gamers and newcomers alike.  Haven&amp;rsquo;t read the comics before? No problem! No background reading is required to help your characters win battles and be the last one left standing! Let the mass chaos, devious strategies, and humorous battles begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is this Girl Genius?&lt;br/&gt;Girl Genius is a three-time winner of the highest honor awarded for works of science fiction and fantasy: the prestigious Hugo Award.  The webcomic follows Agatha Clay, a seemingly mild-mannered mechanic who discovers she has inherited the abilities of a spark (a feared mad scientist with the natural ability to understand complex sciences and wield them for their own chaotic purposes). Even more shocking, Agatha discovers that she is the descendent of a long lost line of sparks whose unparalleled skills and insanity made them legends in their own time.  Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated by Kaja and Phil Foglio, Girl Genius is full of adventure, romance, and plenty of MAD SCIENCE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is this &amp;ldquo;Gunnerkrigg Court&amp;rdquo; of which you speak?&lt;br/&gt;This highly praised comic is the work of the celebrated author and artist, Tom Siddell.  The story follows Antimony Carver as she attends an isolated boarding school called Gunnerkrigg Court.  Antimony soon learns that the Court is no ordinary school - the teachers are hiding ancient conspiracies, it is bordered by a forest full of dangerous monsters, and the school is inhabited by strange creatures and students with special abilities.  In the course of her adventures, Antimony befriends an ancient trickster god, discovers her own supernatural powers, and begins investigating the dark secrets of the court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why do we love these comics so darn much?&lt;br/&gt;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already faithful readers, allow me to let you in on a little secret: these comics rock.  The stories are masterfully crafted, the art is top notch, and the characters are instantly endearing.  It's no wonder that these comics have won so many rewards and attracted such loyal fans.  We also appreciate that both comics feature characters who make great role models.  For example, Antimony Carver and Agatha Clay are some of the strongest and most intelligent women you could hope to meet and their friends will stop at nothing to stand by their sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play the game that will... change your life:&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a total of five characters from the worlds of Girl Genius and Gunnerkrigg Court.  These characters line up in anticipation for their chance to battle.  During the round, you try to equip characters in your line with powerful weapons and bonuses while equipping characters in other players&amp;rsquo; lines with faulty or otherwise terrible equipment.  You can also give yourself secret advantages or sabotage your opponents.  When the round ends, the characters at the front of each line will engage in a (legendary) showdown.  But the madness doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there!  You can rearrange your line and the lines of your opponents to change who will be competing in the final battle.  The round suddenly ends when all players but one (the poor chap) are ready to fight.  At that point, each player reveals his or her battle strategy and the winner is decided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
