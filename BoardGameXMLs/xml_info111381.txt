			<description>Abstract strategy game. Each side has six pieces - 2 Battleships, 2 Submarines, and 2 Mines. Each turn a player must add one of his pieces to the board. This piece will never be moved again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to form a line of three pieces, a Battleship between a Submarine on one side and a Mine on the other side. This line can be horizental, vertical or diagonal, and it doesn't matter which of the three pieces are that players. He can win if, for example, he puts his Battleship between two enemy pieces. If victory is acheived the winning player must call out &amp;quot;You're Sunk&amp;quot; to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think a lot of games might well be draws (as in Noughts and Crosses, for instance). And if there is a number of placements that will always make that player a winner (as in Nim) then that will kill the replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no publisher name on the box or rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
