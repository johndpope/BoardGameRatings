			<description>This kids game is played using a floor mat like in &amp;quot;Twister&amp;quot;. The mat depicts a series of paths leading to the Forest of Feelings space. The paths have various foot symbols depicting either a left foot, a right foot, or both feet. The first player draws a card showing a series of jumps along the mat spaces ending at the Forest (like, double-footed hop, left-foot hop, then 2 more double-footed hops, Forest). The player then jumps the sequence. If he stumbles or uses the wrong foot, he returns the card to the deck and his turn ends. If he succeeds, the other players must duplicate the jump sequence he just performed. The first player to correctly duplicate the sequence wins the card. The player with the most cards at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
