			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-dimensional shoot'em up/platform game developed and published by British developer Palace Software. The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a witch, who aims to become the &amp;quot;Witch Queen&amp;quot; by defeating an enemy called the &amp;quot;Pumpking&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cauldron_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A version of Evil Dead was also written for the ZX Spectrum but this was never released on its own and eventually appeared free with the Spectrum version of Cauldron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Evil Dead (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Steve Brown: design&lt;br/&gt;Richard Leinfellner: design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
