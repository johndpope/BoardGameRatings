							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">4th Edition DM Set of Conditions Tiles</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping track of which PC caused the monster to become weakened for the next round has become a full-time job for the DM and there are certain conditions that come up more often for DMs than for players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After carefully reading all of the entries in the Monster Manual and the Player's Handbook, we have created this supplement to our condition tiles to assist the DM with the more common conditions.  It contains 39 tiles that show the different conditions from 4th Edition D&amp;amp;D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 - Blinded&lt;br/&gt;5 - Dazed&lt;br/&gt;1 - Dominated&lt;br/&gt;2 - Grabbed&lt;br/&gt;5 - Immobilized&lt;br/&gt;1 - Marked&lt;br/&gt;5 - Ongoing Damage 5&lt;br/&gt;1 - Ongoing Damage 10&lt;br/&gt;1 - Ongoing Damage 15&lt;br/&gt;1 - Petrified&lt;br/&gt;2 - Restrained&lt;br/&gt;5 - Slowed&lt;br/&gt;1 - Stunned&lt;br/&gt;1 - Weakened&lt;br/&gt;6 - Bloodied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like our other tile sets, the squares are just under and inch on each side so they fit easily on 1&amp;quot; gridded maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conditional Tiles are lightweight, store in very little space, durable, and quick to set up.  When you're done, just scoop them into a box or bag and you're ready to go.  Perfect for convention gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compliant with the Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition GSL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
