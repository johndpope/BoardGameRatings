							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of 190</name>
									
			<description>The Game of 190, a Bingo-like game, uses 190 cards.  Each card features three rows of nine squares, with five squares in each row containing one or two letters. Ninety balls with one or two letters on them are drawn from a bag and called out, and written down on a chart. Each player has one of the 190 cards, and checks to see if any letters on the card correspond to those called out. Any that match are covered with a marker. The first player to have five markers in a row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
