							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grey Alien Racial Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Got Your Sci-Fi in my Fantasy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greys are a tall, thin, race of aliens. Eons more advanced than any culture in contemporary fantasy settings, they exist as quiet universal observers and agents of peace. However, they are an innately intellectual and curious race which often comes into conflict with their general rule on non-involvement. When a planet peaks the interest of the greys they first abduct several members of the race for study before seeding the planet with agents. These agents generally attempt to blend into the culture. Often times they are left on a planet for many generations and they gain a very deep understanding for the culture of the planet they immerse themselves in. Such exploratory colonies often become so integrated into the native culture that their own ancestors become part of their own myths and legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Grey Racial Guide: Including plot hooks, greys in your game, favored class bonuses, etc.&lt;br/&gt;     Cleric of the Supreme Ideal: Cleric Archetype&lt;br/&gt;     Star Explorer: Ranger Archetype&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
