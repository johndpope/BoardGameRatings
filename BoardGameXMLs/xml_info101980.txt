			<description>The Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With most of its crew missing and its weapons systems ruined the space research station Aegis is all but lost. As the last remaining pilot you must help rebuild the station&amp;rsquo;s defences, acquire alien technology and create your own uniquely configured set of fighters. By mining the asteroids within the grid dimension, valuable resources can be harvested to fuel the Aegis&amp;rsquo; molecular furnace and build devastating weaponry. In the warp you will encounter allies to aid in your struggle to escape, uncover the terrible purpose of the evil Archnid race and learn why you and the rest of the crew were brought here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
