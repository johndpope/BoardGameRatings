			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting has been used as a bridge for the F and the FN series as it runs along the border north of Feastelburg. While this adventure setting is a collective of areas to adventure it does feature the locations of two Filbar uploads. The Sunken Temple of Bulu and the Elven village of FT10: Silvantri are both located in this area. Of course there are other areas to explore such as the Centaur settlement, Pixies, and even a mad mage for flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for any level group of adventurers.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for several one shot adventures or a continuing campaign setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
