			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krazy Kragnar is a trickster, merchant, dealmaker, survivor, and, of course, goblin. As a master trader, his career has a long and colorful history, much of which should not be repeated in polite company. Kragnar first came to prominence when he began a line of used chariot yards (the merchandise for which is detailed in The Genius Guide to Loot 4 Less Volume 7: Krazy Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s Used Chariots). When angry dwarves shut down that operation, he turned to a new business plan with Krazy Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s Surplus Alchemy Shop. When that entirely legitimate business burned to the ground (and the local human guards and fire wardens made no effort to save it), canny Kragnar turned back to his roots and began working in semilegal magic items at a Goblin Market (as detailed in Krazy Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s Black Market Magic Items).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of running a successful shop in a Goblin Market, Kragnar was regularly dealing with cheats, thieves, adventurers, and insane folk in almost equal measure. One of the more common insane people was Garious the Grogomancer, a failed wizard who had fallen on extremely hard times. Once a true master of arcane arts, Garious had been kicked out of the prestigious Meiramazal Academy Arcane for creating an explosion during a demonstration of a new way to make magic staves. Having fallen to the bottom of the social ladder, he lurked in the Goblin Market of Refuge, offering (and sometimes succeeding) to cast spells for wine, to extend his days-long binges of inebriation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one, Kragnar included, took Garious seriously. When the &amp;ldquo;Grogomancer&amp;rdquo; came to the merchant goblin&amp;mdash;claiming to have recreated his alternate magic creation ritual, and in the process made a &amp;ldquo;tige vierge&amp;rdquo; (a magic staff that could have any spell impressed upon it and then recast)&amp;mdash;Kragnar was certain it was part of a complex con game. But a good con game can be an asset as well so Kragnar allowed Garious to demonstrate. When the demonstration went well, and Kragnar could find no sign of deceit, the goblin had Garious set up a shop to make another tige vierge under supervision. When that worked, Kragnar set up a new shop. Well outside the slums surrounding the Goblin Market, Krazy Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s Magic Staff Emporium offers a wide range of &amp;ldquo;stock&amp;rdquo; magic staves, as well as custom orders returned in half the time of any competitor. Unlike previous shops owned or run by Kragnar, the Magic Staff Emporium is a high-end establishment that caters to high-end clients. In selling only magic staves it keeps its client list exclusive, but in doing so quickly it attracts dwarf gesith mages from the far-off Rune Peaks, tormentor battle-cursers from Ankhara, secretive shadow-bedreven from the Cairnwood, and adventurous archmages of all stripes. The prices at the Magic Staff Emporium might be a little higher, but when you need a staff of healing by the end of the week, you&amp;rsquo;re willing to pay a premium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
