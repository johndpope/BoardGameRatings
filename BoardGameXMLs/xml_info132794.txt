			<description>This little card game consists of 32 word cards, 4 number cards and 4 ghost cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word cards have four words printed on each side, numbered 1-4. The number cards are used to select one of the four words from the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 8 word cards (if there are more than 4 players, the game is played in teams). Players stack their cards and put a ghost card on top of the stack. At the start of each round, each player takes the bottom card from his/her stack and also one of the number cards. The number cards determine which of the words is used. They also determine who has to ask whom. The aim is to ask the other player a question that he/she will either answer wrongly or with the word on the card. For example, if the word is &amp;quot;vampire&amp;quot;, the player could ask &amp;quot;What creature drinks blood and dislikes garlic.&amp;quot; If the other player gives an incorrect answer, no answer at all or exactly the word that is on the card (in this example, &amp;quot;vampire&amp;quot;), the person who asked the question earns a point. The person who is being asked earns a point if he/she is able to give a different but correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
