							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Firearms II: Double Barreled</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Firearms: Double Barrel[sic] builds upon the black-powder and gun combat rules introduced in that first book (Fantasy Firearms written by Eric Karnes), and adds even more fantastic firearms content to your next D20 Fantasy campaign. Double Barrel is standalone product, but Fantasy Firearms is definitely a recommended purchase. In addition to basic gun combat rules, Fantasy Firearms introduces rules for the most common type of fantasy firearms- flintlocks, pistols, muskets and black powder, while this sequel focuses on more advanced and exotic weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find rules for Dwarven and Elfish firearms, as well as other arms like the Cheater&amp;rsquo;s Shield, The Hell Belcher Repeater, Mars Blade, Rachel&amp;rsquo;s Repeater and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also covered are several enchanted firearms and specialty ammunition.  Your character can take to the field weilding a pair of Corruption Kiss revolvers, or a Kingslayer Carbine.  Adamantine Rounds, Cold Iron Rounds, Holy Ice Rounds, Rat Shot, Chamber Thief&amp;rsquo;s Bullets,  and Silencia&amp;rsquo;s Bullets are just a few of the types of ammunition covered in this release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus there are New feats, spells and more! (Including a new Player Race and Diety with Clerical Domain.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lock and load; adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
