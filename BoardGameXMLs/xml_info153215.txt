			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a shadowrunner who brings a lot of guns to the table, you might have seen how cards help keep your arsenal organized and easy to reference. We recently released Gun Haven/Heaven 3, which has game information on more than thirty firearms, and we&amp;rsquo;ve now made the game information and art available on card form! Whether you want cards with the Shadowrun, Fifth Edition stats or cards with the Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition stats, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a deck for you! Each card has a full-color image of one of the firearms, as well as the game stats for that piece. So load up and make sure you&amp;rsquo;re carrying the right collection of weapons for any situation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lethal Force (On Your Tabletop!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not a noob. You&amp;rsquo;re not a poseur. You&amp;rsquo;re a shadowrunner. When you pick a weapon, it&amp;rsquo;s with a purpose, and 99 times out of 100, that purpose is to bring suckers down. You&amp;rsquo;re going to choose your weapon carefully, and you know that the more options you have, the better your final choice will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These 33 weapon cards feature guns first seen in the recently released Gun H(e)aven 3. Available in both PDF and POD form, these cards have everything you need to start shooting right away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
