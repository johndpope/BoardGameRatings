			<description>From the rules manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Texas Wildcatter is a board game designed around the Texas oil industry.  Players pit their skill and luck against the risks of the oil wildcatting business as they vie to lease and develop 16 of Texas' most famous oil fields.  Authenticity and quality have been the bywords in the creation and publication of this originial board game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must move around an outside track landing on properties they can lease from the bank.  Once leased, players can attempt to develop their properties and collect.  Players may also form joint ventures or farm out agreements.  If the property is not developed and a player lands on a property, they can attempt to buy out the lease out from under the owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also purchase services or oil transportation companies that allows them to collect from  other players who happen to land on that property (similar to rent in Monopoly).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first person to accumulate $1 billion cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
