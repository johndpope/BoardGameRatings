							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kyr&#039;shin Unchained</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every GM has time to build the perfect NPC, and not every player knows precisely where to look to build their ideal character concept. Fortunately, Everyman Iconics has your back! In each installment of Everyman Iconics, we present one of the recurring characters illustrated throughout multiple Everyman Gaming products and all the information needed to play the character, including stat blocks for GMs and easy to reference pregen sheets for players. Within, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Kyr&amp;rsquo;shin Yilenzo, Everyman Gaming&amp;rsquo;s iconic Fighter. Uses rules from Everyman Gaming&amp;rsquo;s hit product, Everyman Unchained: Fighters.&lt;br/&gt;    Includes a detailed character gazetteer featuring Kyr&amp;rsquo;shin&amp;rsquo;s vital statistics and character history.&lt;br/&gt;    A full, easy-to-reference 20-level character build for Kyr&amp;rsquo;shin including full class, archetype, feat, and option references. As presented, Kyr&amp;rsquo;shin is an unchained fighter without any archetypes or mutliclassing.&lt;br/&gt;    Seven stat blocks designed to allow GMs to use Kyr&amp;rsquo;shin as an NPC in their campaigns at CR 1/2, CR 3, CR 6, CR 9, CR 12, CR 16, and CR 19.&lt;br/&gt;    Three regenerated character sheets that allow GMs to hand Kyr&amp;rsquo;shin to a player as a 1st-, 4th-, or 7th-level character for quick playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
