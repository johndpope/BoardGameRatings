			<description>Choose A Way to Happiness is a game designed to encourage good behavior in children and teach them how to make choices that will help them be happy. Players move about a board by drawing move cards and collect C-Points for landing on squares that describe a good behavior, like &amp;quot;Always Helping&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Feeling Happy All Day.&amp;quot; Players can get collect A-Points for landing on squares with negative actions, such as &amp;quot;Cheating at Base Ball&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Late for School.&amp;quot; Players can remove A-Points by playing Apology Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is divided into four areas, Paradise Island, Sulky City, Sunshine Valley, and Misery Mountain. Each section has squares that will either add or subtract from the player's C-Points. The winner is determined by who has the most points at the end of the set time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
