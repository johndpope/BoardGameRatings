							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Mormon Characters</name>
									
			<description>Book of Mormon Characters is a simple card game for LDS families in which players attempt to complete the &amp;quot;Books&amp;quot; of various Book of Mormon prophets. Each prophet has four cards with various facts about his life as well as an Aztec-style illustration. Players seek to collect all four cards of a prophet by asking other players for cards the contain the image, fact, or name of the prophet they are missing. The winner is the player with the most books completed once the game is completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include four variants that decrease difficulty for children and increase it for experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
