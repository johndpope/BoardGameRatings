			<description>In Small Planets players take the roll of burnt-out writers which embark on a journey to the distant galaxy in search of inspiration. Planets are unusual: each of them has a distinct theme: western, industrial era etc. Players will send probes, which help them witness amazing things and events. The &amp;quot;richest&amp;quot; player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the round players put a counter on each of six planets. Then, active player rolls three dice and puts additional counters on the corresponding planets. Then, players roll their dice and decide which to reroll. After that, active player asks players which planet they want to visit. Players then decide if they put the dice on the planet or not. Player who puts the most dice on the planet takes the counters from them and also gains a favor of planet's inhabitants. When all planets were pointed at by active player, the round ends. Players gather their dice and the next round begins. Game lasts 9 rounds. Player with the most counters at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
