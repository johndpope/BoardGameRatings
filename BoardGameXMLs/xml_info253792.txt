							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Flower Essence Game</name>
									
			<description>Designed by award-winning Napoleonic wargame designer Kevin Zucker, this flower game is used for learning the names and properties of flower essences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven flower cards are dealt to each player, dealing the cards one at a time, picture side up, so that all the cards can be seen at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three symptom (green) cards are laid out in the center of the playing area face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players agree on a famous real or fictional person who fits the &amp;quot;patient profile&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players scan over the flower cards and turn over 1, 2, or 3 cards that their eyes land on first. Each player turns over his or her own cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read the separate cards and pick one that relates to the symptom or symptoms, explaining to the other players how this addresses the symptom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn plays one flower card that best addresses the symptom or symptoms, explaining how this applies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players scan over the remaining cards in front of them and pick those they wish to turn over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repeat these steps until all the cards that each player wants to introduce have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discuss which of the flower essence cards introduced into play by the players best fit the symptoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refer to the Flower Essence Repertory as needed. There may be more than one right answer. The goal is to agree on up to 5 essences for the perfect blend to fit the patient's symptoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example of play:  If Marilyn Monroe is considered to be the &amp;quot;patient&amp;quot;, the following might happen when the flower cards are examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player played &amp;quot;Pretty Face&amp;quot; which says &amp;quot;I accept all parts of my self. Light shines through darkness and pain. My whole self is my beautiful self. I am this Shining Star.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second player played &amp;quot;Dogwood&amp;quot; which says &amp;quot;My body is healed by flowing grace. I release what has become hardened. This gentle purity fills body and soul. I feel the blessing of grace-filled life.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was determined that either flower card would help address the life challenges of Marilyn Monroe, and both players were considered to have right answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; deck of cards that are part of the popular Apples to Apples game can be used with this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also solitaire and advanced versions of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
