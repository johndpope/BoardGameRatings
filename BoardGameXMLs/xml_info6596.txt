			<description>This game is about murder, but there is no mystery who did it: all of the players! Players try to kill their relatives in order to inherit a title such as Duke or Earl. There tends to be a great deal of laughter during this game as players move around from shop to shop to collect weapons and from estate to estate where their relatives are visiting, waiting to be murdered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is strategy: start killing immediately with your bare hands, collect the best weapons that are most effective in certain locations, or collect as many weapons as you can then start murdering with the best available at each location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can also be tactical: change your path to avoid the detective, or drop your weapons so he won't be suspicious of you? When to play cards that can help you or hurt your opponents? Rearrange the board to help yourself and/or hinder other players?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One favorite is the Distraction card: &amp;quot;Look a comet!&amp;quot; you shout as you move closer to the edge of the cliff to push your cousin off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
