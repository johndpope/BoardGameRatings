			<description>Madrasso, also known as Mandrasso or Magrasso, is perhaps the most popular and widespread card game in Venice and the surrounding region, where it has over the last 50 years practically replaced the older game Scarabocion. In the ranking and values of cards and the presence of a trump suit it is related to Briscola, but because of the necessity to follow suit (as in Tressette) Madrasso offers greater scope for sophisticated card play technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
