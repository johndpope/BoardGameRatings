			<description>A Ridiculous Tabletop Module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulation on being accepted, and welcome to The Waybury University and Elemental Academy of Magic! The following is a primer to familiarise new students with the rules of the university, its expectations, the staff and facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waybury U accommodates the following classes most easily: Wizard, Sorcerer Cleric, Bard, but has little to offer other classes, particularly Fighter, Barbarian, or Monk. The recommended starting level is 1 to accommodate a sense of early growth, and the game should aim to be a low-gold campaign for two primary reasons &amp;ndash; 1) to keep the price of tuition and the value of working a part-time job for money relevant, and 2) to emulate the starving student atmosphere of education. At least long enough for second term tuition to remain a consideration for the players. This does not preclude occasional successful hauls, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope your education at the world-famous Waybury U is as magical as the classes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
