			<description>Nubian Jak was created in Britain and developed in the USA. It has 8 topics: Leaders &amp;amp; Icons, TV &amp;amp; Film, Modern History, Art &amp;amp; Literature, Sport, Science &amp;amp; Engineering, General Knowledge, Music &amp;amp; Theater. The game combines wit, skill and luck to outplay your opponents by getting three pyramid pieces from one area of the board to three new homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nubian Jak uses multiple-choice questions on cards with the correct answer giving an instruction to move forward or throw again. In most cases the least likely of the 3 options carries a penalty for the wrong answer. There is also a Super Challenge Format, which is played by asking the topic card questions without giving the multiple choice options as clues. The correct answer gives the bonus, while any wrong answer incurs the penalty on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nubian Jak can either be played in singles involving 2-8 players or in teams of 3 with each Jak represented by a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
