			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion, of unknown compatibility with all Lost Legacy sets, was first handed out as a promo sheet on Tokyo Game Market spring 2014. Unlike the other promo sheets, this is not a separate set, but a set of 8 special ability cards that are possible to use with any Lost Legacy set and that gives the player a special ability throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The promo status of this expansion was primarily because it wasn't fully tested and the designer was not sure it wouldn't completely break certain sets or combinations of sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
