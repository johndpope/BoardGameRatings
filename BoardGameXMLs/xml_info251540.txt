			<description>In Too Many Heroes, players take on the role of rival corporations, racing to be the first to build their super-team of heroes. But you&amp;rsquo;re not building a team to fight crime and injustice...you&amp;rsquo;re in it for the money. Movie rights, book deals, sponsorships...you name it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fast paced card game for 2-6 players. The massive deck contains 216 cards, featuring 100 fully-realized heroes. Fighting alongside them are villains, action cards, upgrades, downgrades, and the coveted License Cards. Yes, License cards. Your heroes must be licensed to count. Otherwise they&amp;rsquo;re classified as illegals, operating under the law, vigilantes, and most importantly for the government, untaxable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
