			<description>The object of this game is to remove all of your balls from the board. Each player, in turn, inserts his pop-stick through any one of the openings as far into the board as he pleases. The insertion of the stick causes the balls to pop up. The player must remove all of the balls that pop up, even his opponents. The stick may not be removed until his next turn. The stick acts as a block for the opponent. The white block-ball is a barrier and may not be raised. or removed from the position it fell into at the beginning of the game. The winner is the first player to have all his colored balls removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
