							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Albuera 1811: A Lines of Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>The Battle of Albuera has gone down in history as the bloodiest battle of the Napoleonic Peninsular War. Marshall Soult thought he could roll up a mixed Spanish/British/Portuguese force and claim a great French victory. He was wrong. A clever flank attack was stopped dead by some of the best Spanish troops of the war. Then, despite a devastating charge by his fearsome Polish Lancers, the Allies held firm and Soult's efforts were in vain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lines of Battle is a new series, of which Albuera 1811 is the first game. It features a fresh take on Napoleonic gaming where the essence of Napoleonic combat is distilled into an enjoyable and interactive battle experience - you can feint, outflank, form square, charge with cavalry, bombard, withdraw - it's all here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the historical battle, Albuera 1811 contains optional rules for Leaders (counters included), and you can construct any number of scenarios based on a combination of &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
