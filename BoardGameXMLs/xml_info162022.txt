			<description>6 nimmt! Schnupperspiel is a small, promotional copy of 6 nimmt! containing 24 cards and playable for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays very similar to 6 nimmt! except that the cards here are numbered 1 through 24. With 2 players, each player will be dealt a hand of 10 cards, but for 3 or 4 players, each player starts with 7 or 5 cards, respectively. 3 of the remaining cards form the rows where players will play their cards. Players simultaneously select a card to play and will add their cards to the rows in ascending order. If a player selects a card that is so low it cannot be added to any series, that player takes a row of cards and the low card begins a new row. Each row can contain at most 5 cards. The player that places the 6th card must take the other cards in the row and the 6th card is used to start a new row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of 4 rounds. Rounds end after all cards have been played. Players score points for each ox head present on the cards they collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
