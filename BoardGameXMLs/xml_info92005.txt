			<description>Non-Stop Safari is a 2 to 4 player print and play board game submission to the 2011 Global Game Jam. Players take on the role of rich financiers who send hunters on safari to find valuable animal pelts. Only the rarest pelts will fetch the highest price, and you can&amp;rsquo;t get more rare than extinct! By hunting a species to extinction players can guarantee a high return on their precious pelts. Oh, and watch out for poachers, unless of course, they&amp;rsquo;re working for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the player with the most money by the end of the game. The game ends immediately after the third species has gone extinct. All pelts of this species are sold off as usual and then money totals are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
