			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bushi d6 core rules assume the reader is familiar with basic roleplaying concepts and methods.  Characters have four attributes (Might, Agility, Wit, and Charm), hit points, and skills.  Basic skill performance is based on the related attribute (e.g., Axe/Mace skill is based upon Might).  Characters may chose to specialize in non-combat skills, one of which allows spellcasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-combat contested actions are resolved by adding attribute plus skill plus die roll and comparing that to a target difficulty.  Combat uses a similar process with more complexity in modifiers and a variable target difficulty based on the opponent.  Combat need not be damaging--several options are presented (for example, tripping).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also include a section presenting magic spells and a basic &amp;quot;bestiary&amp;quot; of monsters.  The final section of the document focuses on the setting of the game--The Empire of Honzu (a campaign map is provided as a separate document).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
