							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Toad&#039;s Journey</name>
									
			<description>A Goose-type game for pre-5 year olds. The game appeared in the 1978 Playhour Annual. Mr. Toad was a character who first featured in Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, written in 1908.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;To play this game with your friends, you will need a dice and counters. To start playing the game, each player has to throw a six, and then throw the dice again and move his counter along the numbered spaces. On the white spaces there are things you must do if you land on them. The player who reaches number 50 first, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
