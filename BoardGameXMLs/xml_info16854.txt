			<description>Straightforward card game of office politics with a humorous tone.  This is a hand-produced game with hand-cut, black-and-white, laminated cards that come in a plastic trading card box adorned with a black-and-white cover label.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a time on this great planet of ours that wars were fought between nations and/or political factions for ideals, territory, money, or power.  Although the goals remain the same, wars are no longer fought by people in uniform.  Today's wars are fought by the groups that hold the real power in today's society.  Political factions are puppets to these entities, armies and military might are under their control.  These entities are referred to by a name that belies the fact that they have more power than any nation on the planet:  the Corporation.  The foot soldiers who slog forward daily to do battle on myriad fronts are no longer called privates, cadets or seamen.  Today's foot soldier defends his particular trench under the idealized rank of &amp;quot;account representative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;data input specialist&amp;quot;, or simply, &amp;quot;marketing representative&amp;quot;.  His/her trench is also outfitted with the modern conveniences of a fax machine, a speed-dial telephone, and part interest in a secretary.  Today's wars are fought on the battlefield of office politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
