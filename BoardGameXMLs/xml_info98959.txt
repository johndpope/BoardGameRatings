			<description>The Galactic Mystery Race Game With A Retro Theme (working title) is a game where people race their colony's ships across the galactic system, trying to land on the goal planet when it is most beneficial to them. However, players do not know who their opponents are, and additionally players can move each others' ships closer or further away from the goal planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are really simple. Players move up to 2 pieces up to 3 spaces per turn. Once 3 pieces have made it to Prosspar, the round ends and points are given to the players and to the ships themselves. After 5 rounds, players attack each other based on what colour they think their opponents are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you were too obvious in your movement you don't stand a chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
