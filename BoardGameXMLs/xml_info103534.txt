			<description>From the cassette inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest for the PENTAGRAM could not have been further from Sabreman's mind as he collected his Grand Arch Wizardry spell book from the Old Mystic Curio Shoppe in Conjour town. It was the last copy of the book now left in existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sabreman chortled to himself as he eagerly jumped into his shimmering blue robes and hat. Now at last he was ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through jungle, cavern and castle had he struggled, he trembled as he relived the fear of ghosts and horrors, battling against all odds to complete his tasks and to bring him to this moment. He paused and the in an instant was off, spell book at the ready to solve his quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
