			<description>Luck based combined card/dice game. A player rolls two dice which determine whether he or she can put a card openly in front of him or her. There are some special cards that allow placing cards face down in front of another player, which then count negative points. When a player runs out of hand cards, the game ends. Open cards count plus, face down cards count minus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
