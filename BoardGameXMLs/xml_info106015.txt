							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Where Time Stood Still</name>
									
			<description>A plane has crashed in a remote and unknown plateau of the Himalayas. To their horror, the survivors soon discover that it is populated by dangerous prehistoric creatures and tribes.&lt;br/&gt;The player must guide the party of four survivors - the pilot, Jarret, and his three passengers - to safety, avoiding dinosaurs, cannibals and natural dangers, while also ensuring they are sufficiently rested and fed during the long and difficult journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player initially controls Jarret, the leader of the party. The other survivors are Clive, a wealthy businessman; Gloria, his daughter; and Dirk, her fianc&amp;eacute;. Each member of the party may be controlled by the player or by the game.&lt;br/&gt;A simple menu and cursor system is used to select members and manipulate objects.&lt;br/&gt;Each member of the party has a different personality and abilities. For example, Clive is overweight, tires easily, and is always hungry. Dirk is athletic and has some knowledge of the local languages; he is reluctant to leave Gloria, and will become despondent if she dies.&lt;br/&gt;Computer-controlled characters will complain if they are injured, tired or hungry. It is up to the player to decide what action to take in response. Indulge them too often, and food and time will run short. Ignore them, and they will abandon you and try to make their own way to safety.&lt;br/&gt;Useful objects are scattered about the map, which should be carefully explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Where Time Stood Still&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
