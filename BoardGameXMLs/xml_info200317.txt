			<description>Winner, Game We're Most Excited About, 2015 Golden Cobra Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Golden Cobra website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formal dinners are one of those social occasions in which the rules are different everywhere you go, but are somehow all the same. Eduardo Caetano has hacked the dinner party game genre into something wondrous and fraught. Francis has invited to dinner several people close to him, only they didn&amp;rsquo;t know that he&amp;rsquo;d be running so late. The game consists of that awkward period before the real party happens, when people haven&amp;rsquo;t yet decided how the evening will go and when intimate secrets are revealed. &amp;ldquo;A kind of dinner larp freeform,&amp;rdquo; This Folks At the Dining Room uses the core elements of formal dining &amp;ndash; making toasts, hearing a certain background song play, passing food &amp;ndash; into functional game mechanics that enhance the mood. We are excited to prepare meals with our friends, and then have them deal with some potentially romantic and luxuriant fiction as part of the main course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
