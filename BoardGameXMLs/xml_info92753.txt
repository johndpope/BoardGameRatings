			<description>Lethal Enforcers 3, known as Seigi no Hero (正義のヒーロー&amp;mdash;Heroes of Justice) in Japan is a 3D arcade light gun game which is the third installment to Konami's Lethal Enforcers series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lethal Enforcers 3, players play as six different law enforcement roles in various scenarios in present day Tokyo, Japan. Players make their ways to checkpoints while shooting criminals, terrorists, or fugitives along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lethal Enforcers 3 is similar to World Combat which players shoot outside the screen to activate the shield. Unlike Warzaid, simply pointing outside the screen performs the same shield-activating mechanism as described herein. Raising the shield guard allows players to protect themselves from incoming bullets at the expense of not moving forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Lethal Enforcers and Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters, players must compete with other in making their way to checkpoints in various areas and capturing the wanted criminals allowing their ranks to be promoted. Also, players do not lose lives when they shoot innocent civilians but rather have their ranks demoted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the game's gameplay and mannerisms are reminiscent of Police 911, so much to the point where it could be considered a quasi-sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lethal Enforcers 3/Seigi no Hero allows the player to play the stages in the order they desire (with the exception of the Diet Building a.k.a. &amp;quot;Lethal Enforcers 3/Seigi no Hero&amp;quot; stage). There are 6 stages in all with 5 selectable at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lethal Enforcers 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
