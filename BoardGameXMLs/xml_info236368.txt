			<description>The Cheap Chapel is a fully cooperative role-playing board game for one to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your unique character and make strategic decisions with your group to overcome a variety of monsters from dozens of scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;Optimize your character&amp;rsquo;s attributes  as you level up and work together with your group to fight battles of increasing difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See your character grow after each fight by learning new skills and increasing attributes. Choose to specialize and grow more powerful in certain attributes, or expand your versatility with a greater variety of skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by a role-player for role-players,this board game offers steadily-building character development and a variety of attributes including: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Likewise, the available classes --Paladin, Mage, Priest, Thief and Ranger--  include 20 skills as well as 6 companions who can be hired for each of the quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fighting system is direct, so that skills can be used to their full potential. &lt;br/&gt;The standard attack is carried out with an attack roll and compared to the monster's defense. &lt;br/&gt;In contrast, many skills have nothing to do with throwing dice, but require the party to come up with a plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story contains a storybook with over 25 scenarios, 20 monsters and battle slides for some scenarios. The variety of these monsters guarantees for a constant difficulty level.&lt;br/&gt;We recommend playing  5 scenarios, which will take about 1 hour per player, and then taking a break until your next game night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game in The Cheap Chapel is different. Apart from different stories, decisions in one game can influence the course of the next game, not including the incredible number of possibilities to customize your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your character, roll starting attributes, put on your gear and go on an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of The Cheap Chapel awaits you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
