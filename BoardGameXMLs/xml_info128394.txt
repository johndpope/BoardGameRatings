			<description>Bang Bang Racing is a racing video game played from a top-down perspective. The game's sole objective is to finish before all other racers. It features a compacted art style similar to older top-down racing games such as R.C. Pro-Am, Super Off Road and Super Sprint. In addition to single player races four player splitscreen gameplay is offered and scores can be tracked via online leaderboards. Courses, cars and liveries are unlocked in the single player portion of the game, and these unlocks carry over to the local multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features four different race car classes, each with unique attributes: N-Dura, Evo GT, Protech and Apex. Within each class five different cars are offered for a total of 20 cars. Each car also features eight different paint liveries. Nine courses are available, and each can be played in a reverse layout. Additionally each course has multiple shortcut layouts, resulting in a total of 54 unique configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bang Bang Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
