							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mount St. Helens Volcano Game</name>
									
			<description>Dice determines how many spaces a player can move on the board.  When landing on certain locations a player may accumulate certain points.  Only 24 turns are allowed for each player as each round corresponds with an historical milestone leading to the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens on May 19, 1980 (edit: it was May 18th...).  It is possible for no player to win the game if all players are still in the red zone after the 24 historical milestones are reached.  Each historical milestone may give conditional instructions to players depending on where they are on the board.  Also, certain spots on the board may provide additional instructions...or instruct the player to draw from the emergency deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
