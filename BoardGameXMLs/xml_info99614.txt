							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fun Meal Caper</name>
									
			<description>Fun Meal Caper, invented by a veteran elementary school teacher, provides multiple levels of strategy to entertain the whole family. Filled with amusing twists and turns, Fun Meal Caper keeps every player in the game until the very end. The goal of the game is to collect all the items needed in a &amp;quot;fun meal&amp;quot;: sandwich, fries, veggies, drink, dessert, and a toy. Using higher-order thinking skills, kids learn to look ahead and plan their best move.  The players also experience moral dilemmas within the game, which gives them the choice of being fair or taking advantage of their opponents. Wet floors, good deeds, trades, and taking care of Nana who left her glasses in the car makes it a unique and delightful caper each time you play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
