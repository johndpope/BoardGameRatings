							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laser Chess</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser Chess was published as type-in source code in Compute!'s Atari ST Disk &amp;amp; Magazine magazine as Modula-2 source code, written by Mike Duppong, intended for an Atari ST computer.  It was the grand prize winner of a programming competition.  Combined BASIC and machine language source code listings for a variety of other platforms subsequently were published in Compute! Issue 85, June 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take alternating turns.  Players control multiple pieces on a chessboard (the pieces do not move as in traditional chess).  Most pieces have a &amp;quot;laser&amp;quot; on one side and mirrors on the other sides.  Special other pieces act as &amp;quot;teleporters&amp;quot;.  On each turn, each player can make two &amp;quot;moves&amp;quot; - moving a piece one square, rotating a piece ninety degrees, or firing a laser.  The laser is capable of destroying a piece but also is subject to being reflected (along pathways that can become quite complex).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was quite popular and spawned multiple (unofficial) ports, imitators, and variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
