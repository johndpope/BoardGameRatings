							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: 1st Somerset Strikers</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clans:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They came from beyond the Periphery, attacking dozens of planets in a massive blitzkrieg more devastating than any in the history of warfare. World after world fell before their technologically superior BattleMechs and armored infantry. Nothing in the Inner Sphere seemed able to stop them.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major Adam Steiner:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His unique brand of battlefield tactics earned him a transfer to the prestigious Nagelring War College on Tharkad. No sooner had he left his home world of Somerset than Clan Jade Falcon attacked, easily conquering the planet and capturing his brother Andrew. Now Adam must forge a ragtag bunch of cadets and misfits into a team in order to retake his home and rescue his brother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Somerset Strikers is the official guide to the BattleTech Animated Series. This sourcebook describes and illustrates in full color every character, BattleMech, and vehicle from the show. Detailed accounts of each of the original fourteen episodes include a complete plot synopsis and special background information, and designer notes offer FASA's perspective on the production of the BattleTech animated series. A section of BattleTech rules for the equipment and characters in the show, and scenarios based on the episodes make this book a valuable resource for fans of the game as well as the animated series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion was... probably inevitable. After all, if you have a cartoon series based on a wargame, then you need to have an expansion for that tv series, to help bring people into the game. This expansion has details of the equipment and 'Mechs used in the BattleTech tv series, which includes a number of 'Mechs already printed in other sourcebooks, and some equipment that's... unusual. While the gameplay value of some of this equipment is negligeable, it certainly has some novelty value. This is possibly of most interest to those who really liked the tv series or are BattleTech completists... and althouigh it's out of print, the current licence holder has it available in electronic form from their website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
