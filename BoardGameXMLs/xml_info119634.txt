			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Albion about?&lt;br/&gt;Things that are concealed and things that are&lt;br/&gt;revealed.&lt;br/&gt;The physical setting has ordinary splendours. There&lt;br/&gt;are mountains, valleys, rivers, seas, dark forests,&lt;br/&gt;lonely moors and bustling towns. Its fantasy is not&lt;br/&gt;one of spectacles like fortresses in huge spires of&lt;br/&gt;rock or cities built in trees. Neither is it a large place&lt;br/&gt;with features of extraordinary size.&lt;br/&gt;The people get on with their lives &amp;ndash; for the most&lt;br/&gt;part in pretty ordinary ways. Everyone knows stories&lt;br/&gt;of strange creatures, magic and heroes who perform&lt;br/&gt;remarkable feats, and they enjoy hearing them and&lt;br/&gt;passing them on. But when you enquire about the&lt;br/&gt;origins of these tales, they usually come from a&lt;br/&gt;distant relative or a friend of a friend. Only a few&lt;br/&gt;people have witnessed such things firsthand.&lt;br/&gt;Yet magic does slumber beneath the land and is&lt;br/&gt;occasionally woken. Fundamentally the game is&lt;br/&gt;about what people do, and through this wonders can&lt;br/&gt;be manifested and the land itself can be changed.&lt;br/&gt;The gifted few can shatter a rock with a spear or&lt;br/&gt;summon the wind with a song. The destined few will&lt;br/&gt;encounter creatures of the otherworld and become&lt;br/&gt;champions of humanity. The despised few will blight&lt;br/&gt;the land and twist the spirit of the people.&lt;br/&gt;The role of your characters is to be the flash that&lt;br/&gt;illuminates what people are capable of, what&amp;rsquo;s really&lt;br/&gt;going on in the world, and the road their society will&lt;br/&gt;travel into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
