							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Air Combat: Il-2 Shturmovik</name>
									
			<description>Table Air Combat is a fast, simple air combat game that can be played on any flat surface. Each ruleset is a self-contained game including cut-out miniatures of one aircraft and a set of rules. All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.   Download a free set of the complete rules here: Flight Operations Manual&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a flight of four fighters, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &amp;ldquo;performance rulers&amp;rdquo; that represent the aircraft&amp;rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.&lt;br/&gt;TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Il-2 Shturmovik was a heavily-armoured attack plane used by the Soviet Union.  It specialized in low-level attacks, and was occasionally pressed into service as a fighter.&lt;br/&gt;This set is a self-contained rulebook that includes miniatures for the Il-2 Shturmovik and includes four scenarios that reference other aircraft:&lt;br/&gt;Air and Bread: Attack a bridge on the Berezina river to slow down the invading German army.  This is a standalone scenario using only the Il-2.&lt;br/&gt;Circle of Death:  Il-2s form a defensive Lufbery circle against  Bf-109F fighters.&lt;br/&gt;Anti-Transport: The Luftwaffe tries to supply by air, but has a shortage of transports.  He-111 bombers are loaded with supplies and used instead. The Il-2 aircraft are assigned to shoot down the lumbering aircraft.. The airfield is defended by Bf-109F fighters.&lt;br/&gt;Zementbomber:  Fight the battle of Kursk by attacking German tanks.  Il-2 are escorted by Yak-7 fighters, but the Luftwaffe defends with Fw-190A fighters and counter-attacks Soviet tanks with Ju-88 bombers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
