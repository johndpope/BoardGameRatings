			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ROAD TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS COVERED WITH SINS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice and move where the skull leads you. If you step on the 'sin square', you will get the opportunity to confess your sins and start over from the beginning. If you're not fast enough, your friends can remind you of your sins. Once on the 'sin square' you have to give a pawn (punishments&amp;rsquo; can be made up as you like) and start over. The yellow square gives you a chance to think about your sinful life, while you miss one round. Once you have redeemed your sins and reached the gates of heaven- you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The producer does not take any responsibility for the consequences of the game or injuries caused by the revelations and does not cover any resulting medical expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
