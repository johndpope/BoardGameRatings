							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Petz Wild Animals: Tigerz</name>
									
			<description>The game starts when Enzo and Ana, two young animal trainers, are given two baby tigers by their grandfather. In order to save their family company of animal trainers from bankruptcy, they travel the world, training several show animals, to earn money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's goal in the game is to train show animals, and care for the pair of tigers that have been given to the player. By use of the touchscreen and the built-in microphone, players can touch and talk to the animals to interact with them. The key part to the training is a combination of leading the animals in doing the tricks, and finding out what distracts the animals, to help them concentrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tigerz&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
