			<description>Which Friend is a social game that was designed to bring friends together. It promotes interaction and laughter as the question cards tend to bring up old stories and funny instances that are unique to each set of friends that play the game. It involves thought and strategy, and is a great way to see which of your friends knows each other best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to vote with the majority. Each player is given a rotating voting wheel that has a specific number on the back that represents themselves. After a question is read from the pile of question cards, each player rotates their voting wheel to display the number associated with the player they feel best represents the question. Once all players have chosen their vote and rotated the voting wheel to the appropriate number, all voting wheels shall be flipped over and set on the playing surface simultaneously. Once the votes are tallied up, any player that voted with the majority is awarded a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is a tie, any players involved in the tie must try to persuade any players that are not involved in the tie to agree with their answer and swing their vote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
