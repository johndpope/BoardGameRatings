			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the file's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sages and philosophers often note that the end of any endeavor is simultaneously the beginning of another. How fitting, then, that the word &amp;ldquo;resolution&amp;rdquo; can refer to both endings and beginnings. Some use this word to talk about the conclusion of a period of time, such as the end of a calendar year. Others use it to discuss plans for what lies ahead, such as the personal goals people often set for themselves at the start of a new year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This principle of duality is starkly evident in any court of law. A hearing or trial is the conclusion of a particular series of events, and the verdict determines whether closure has been achieved or renewed reflection is necessary. At the same time, the trial is the beginning of the defendant&amp;rsquo;s new life as a convicted felon or a free person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolutions puts the heroes in a courtroom for the trial of Audrey Petersen, who stands accused of complicity in several homicides and crimes resulting in millions of dollars of property damage. But will they have the resolution to ensure that justice is served?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Short Urban Arcana Adventure for Four 13th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
