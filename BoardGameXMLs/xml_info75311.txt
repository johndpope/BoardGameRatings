			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 new 4e monsters for the world's most popular role-playing game, with an urban twist!  As a GM do you wish to darken the 'points of light'?  If you believe towns and cities should be just as exciting and frightening as the wilderness this monster collection is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each creature is illustrated (with fresh, new illustrations not stock art) in printer-friendly black-and-white and each comes with at least one encounter suggestion (34 encounters in all, fully detailed for seamless insertion into your campaign world).  &lt;br/&gt; The monsters described range from level 1 minion to level 15 solo and include all of the following: a helpful imp, a moth that clears the battlefield of the dying, an alchemically-created ooze, a cat that won't stay dead, a huge fish that gobbles everything in its path.  Not enough?  How about a fire-starting insect, an elemental that haunts unlucky blacksmiths, a disgusting and acidic worm?  Maybe you would like a bevy of fat, psychic-powered rats?  Or, the book also inlcudes: a ghostly hound, a spider that eats light, a muddy earth elemental, a hangman that continues to work the gallows long after his death.  More?  Alright, Urban Adversaries also includes:  a pair of toads (one good, one evil), a swarm of diseased bats, a beautiful moat guardian, a shadow-loving serpent, a vine that lures the unwary to their death, plus a cadre of undead (see the Tethered Soul and Tomegeist full-size preview) and the tower owl!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many creatures feature our own &amp;quot;Shining Ideas&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Dark Thoughts&amp;quot; designations, these represent ways to make the creature more likely to be an ally (Shining Ideas) or to add even more evil and foulness to an already deadly creature (Dark Thoughts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every single creature comes with at least one mini-scenario with encounter level and XP total.  And every creature comes with the tactics, lore, and backstory you've come to expect!  Give this product a look and add some menacing and intriguing foes to your towns and cities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
