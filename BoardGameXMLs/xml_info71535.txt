			<description>[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released in Q4 2006, the Wii is a seventh generation home video game console, and Nintendo's followup to its GameCube console. Targeted at the broader family demographic, the distinguishing feature of the console are its various wireless controllers (its Wii Remote, Nunchuk, Classic Controller, Zapper and Wheel). It's also popularised by its many sports and fitness titles, some utilizing the Wii Balance Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wii Family Edition variant is identical to the original model, but is designed to sit horizontally (the vertical feet are still present; however, the front labels are rotated and a stand is no longer included) and removes the GameCube controller and memory card ports although the casing under the top cover stil has the GameCube controller and memory card ports holes with no ports and no slots. For this reason, the Family Edition variant is incompatible with GameCube games and accessories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
