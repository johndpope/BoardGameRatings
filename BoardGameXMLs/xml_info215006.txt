			<description>designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbital Yards lets you create and store a collection of spacecraft and starship designs using the rules in Book 5: High Guard (Second Edition), as amended by the Consolidated Errata and Adventure 05: Trillion Credit Squadron. It doesn't support multiple weapon types per turret, collapsible fuel tanks, or spare systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I did add the ability to adjust stateroom allocation in starships between normal, full staterooms for all officers, and full staterooms for all crew so you can build really roomy designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires iOS 8.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. An iPad is highly recommended, as this gets you a completed IN Form 3 with Universal Ship Profile, which I couldn't squeeze into an iPhone form factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
