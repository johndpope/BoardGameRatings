			<description>Each player has an identical set of tiles numbered 0 through 9, along with three division, subtraction, and addition tiles and two multiplication tiles. On a turn, each player chooses a math symbol, and then each player chooses a number. Each player then performs a mathematical operation using his number, his symbol, and his opponent&amp;rsquo;s number. Results are compared. The player with the higher result gets a cube. If any result is between 0 and 9, a cube is placed onto the matching number on a game board. Used tiles are discarded. Play continues until all the number tiles are gone (nine rounds). Each player then collects all the cubes on the board that cover either of the two mystery numbers that he selected at the beginning of the game. The player with the most cubes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
