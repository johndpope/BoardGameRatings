							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Make Frank&#039;s Monsters</name>
									
			<description>Frank Einstein is known for his monsters... and his factory makes the best monsters bar none.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make Frank's Monsters is four different card games that can be played with the same deck of cards. Although each of the four games are a little different in theme and play; basically you are trying to build  monsters by getting the four different cards needed (the Lightning Bolt /Helmet, the Head, the Arms/Torso and the Legs) to complete a monster and score points. But, when things don't quite work out you can lose points. Starting with Make Frank's Monsters 1, each of the four games are a little more complex and strategic then the previous game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  deck consists of 64 cards: the 4 types of cards,  in 4 different colors (Red, Blue, Yellow and Gray) with 4 of each card in the deck. In the first two games the colors are not used, but in the last two they are. There are also two kinds of  tokens (the +3 tokens and the -1 tokens) which are used for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
