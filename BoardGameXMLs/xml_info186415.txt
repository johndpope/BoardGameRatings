							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kinetic Game Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kinetic Game Rules are presented in two main HTML pages--one for Character Generation, and one for everything else.  The second page leads to numerous sub-pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters select one of four Classes which determines point pools and types of builds that are possible.  Characters have Abilities (usually ranging from 2-9) and several types of Skills.  Access to Skills is partially controlled by Class; Skills are grouped in categories.  Characters may have alien technology or skills, or cybernetic implants depending upon their build.  Hit Points are divided among body locations.  Characters are equipped based on Gear Points, which are depended upon Class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat includes specific rules for hand-to-hand fighting, firearms and futuristic weapons, psionics, and high-speed firefights.  A one-on-one hand-to-hand dueling system, called Katana, also is elaborated.  Generally, combat is fairly complex.  Healing is slow and difficult unless augmented with technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
