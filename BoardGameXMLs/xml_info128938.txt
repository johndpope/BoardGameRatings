							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pack of Heroes</name>
									
			<description>Pack of Heroes is a two-player card game set in a fun parallel universe of vintage comic books. Each player picks his team from the 30 different heroes in the game, then takes on his opponent in an exciting tactical battle with all sorts of crazy super powers! Combat is resolved with the unique &amp;quot;power card&amp;quot; system, which is designed to have all the excitement of dice-based combat but with far less randomness. Whoever has the last hero standing wins control of Power City!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is the hero cards. They represent one hero in the game and are modelled after vintage trading cards. On the front side is a picture of the hero, and all the gameplay info about their powers; on the back are fun stats and an origin story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player assembles his team. You can either pick one of the set starting teams or draft your team. Drafting allows you to put almost countless sets of heroes together to try out all sorts of crazy combos and synergies. Drafting works almost like a mini-game before the main event, as the players try to put their best possible team together. Once you have picked your team, it's time to fight. The players take it in turn either bringing a hero into play, or using their hand of power cards to trigger one of their heroes' amazing special abilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
