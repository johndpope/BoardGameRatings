							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fat Lady Sings: 14 Compositions for the Maestro Base Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not over until the fat lady sings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maestro base class is effectively the bookish bard, an individual who studies music to the point that he can compose his own custom scores from various intros, outros, and melodies in his Composition Book. At release, the class had enough compositions to get by, but, as wizard-like classes go, they can always use more. This modest expansion seeks to add some variety to the maestro's development as a character by providing a selection of compositions with feat requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maestro primarily works in five schools of magic: conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, and illusion. This product features three compositions that require the Spell Focus feat for each of these schools of magic, save enchantment, which has two to balance the fact that the base class already has a composition requiring Spell Focus (enchantment). These compositions offer highly specialized uses, including fate-fixing through rerolls, buffers against hostile enchantments, party-wide mirror image effects, and the conjuration of a fat lady who stuns everything near her. Applied to the base compositions present in the maestro base class, this collection of the situational and the downright powerful will be sure to get the creative juices flowing once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
