			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to 8-Bit Adventures! Do you yearn for a simpler time, when video games scrolled right and you only had to deal with 2 buttons at a time? An era where blocky, colorful, vaguely recognizable shapes made up heroes that battled odd and often confusing villains with little to no context? Then Fat Goblin Games has you covered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only do you get an amazing 8-bit bestiary with over 15 iconic 8-bit monsters, you get 11 mini-adventures in classic 8-bit worlds where these creatures play major roles! Take on the role of your favorite 8-bit hero and jump, hop, and climb your way through the various levels to do what else... rescue the Princess of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product line is designed to take a nostalgic look at the iconic video games of the past and bring those adventures to life in your campaigns in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game with all new options. Each volume will include monsters, magic items and maybe more! The names have been changed, but the flavor remains the same to ensure that the references are easy to see. Each volume will describe a different game world, each inspired by a classic game sure to inspire nostalgia in even the most hardened of veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume covers the incursion of the Turtle Legions into the peaceful Fungal Kingdoms. The Turtle Legions have a variety of lethal troops at their disposal, ranging from the lowliest CR &amp;amp;frac;12; wrenchy raccoons all the way up to the imposing Turtle King himself, weighing in at a whopping CR 15. Most of the monsters included present optional variants to help encompass the vast array of foes found across the many incarnations of the Fungal Kingdom. These foes provide a wealth of options to challenge parties of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out Fungal Kingdoms and find: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Amazing monsters from the 8-bit ages such as Cloud Turtle, Hammer Turtle, Spikey!, The Windup Bomb, the twisted Barracuda Bush, and many more!&lt;br/&gt;    11 Fantastic adventures from the mind that brought you Fat Gobln Games Campaign Kits. Check out the Castle Hopping Princess or perhaps take your chances in the Ice Pass!&lt;br/&gt;    Magic Items that bring back the memories! Invulnerability Stars, Fire Hammers, and other old time favorites!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
