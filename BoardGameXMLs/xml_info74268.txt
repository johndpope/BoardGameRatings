							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super International Cricket</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Super International Cricket is a cricket game for the Super Nintendo that was released in Australia, Europe and Pakistan in 1994. The sequel to International Cricket on the NES, it was developed by Melbourne House (as Beam Software) and published by Nintendo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features much improved graphics over International Cricket and gameplay superior to all cricket games of its era. However, Super International Cricket also suffered like its predecessor by missing official team and player licensing, has a one-track sound loop and one stadium. This was the only cricket game released for the SNES, and, unlike its NES predecessor, offered test match length games. In practice, however, the game did not scale and the AI was easily exploited even on the hardest difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melbourne House followed Super International Cricket with two sequels, Cricket 96, which was developed in 1996 for EA Sports, and Cricket 97 the year after that.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super_International_Cricket,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
