			<description>Organized Chaos is a fast, fun, and exciting game that pits you against your opponents with one simple objective: Don&amp;rsquo;t run out of all your cards. However, don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the simple objective! You will be tested in many ways, and perhaps if you make smart moves and think strategically then you will emerge victorious. Accomplishing the objective will be much harder than it seems, especially since you are racing against opponents that have every reason to prevent you from reaching your objective so that he or she may win the game. Think you are winning big time? Seconds later you are losing horribly. Got a strategy you think works every time? Not so much. Prepare for excitement and disappointment, structure and disarray, this is Organized Chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone starts the game with one card in their hand. A token marks each players draw pile because it is very likely that one or more may end up face up at some point in the game. During a turn a player draws one card, giving them two in their hand. Each card has two sides, each with a different ability. The player may choose which card to play and which side of the card to invoke. Most cards have a side that is offensive and one that is defensive. For example, the most common type of card has Burn on one side and Refresh on the other. Burn allows you to choose an opponent and they must &amp;quot;Burn&amp;quot; or place the top X cards from their draw pile directly in their discard pile. Whereas, Refresh let's you take the top X cards from your discard pile on the bottom of your draw pile in any order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also special cards that let you do things like flip yours or an opponents draw pile face up so everyone sees what their next card will be, another that lets you switch your entire deck with one of your opponents. There are several other cards that do similarly things to turn the game upside down. Use them all to your advantage to force your opponents' to lose all their cards and you will be the last one standing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See our website for official rules updates or to purchase this and other Van Ryder Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
