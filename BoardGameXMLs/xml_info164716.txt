			<description>Shinkukan is a deck building, head-to-head collectible card game, akin to Magic or Pokemon. With the world, art, and visual designs created by artist John Hathway, and game system designer Takashi Sakaue, this is JH Lab's latest attempt to expand &amp;quot;true understanding&amp;quot; of otaku culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a possible future world where science and spirituality have merged, causing a certain regression of technology. Mainly, it is found that spirits could be contained in now-defunct vacuum tubes, which could in turn be used to power various robots and androids. Human beings could transfer their consciousness into androids, and man-made androids could develop human intelligence. The world has embraced this discovery, doing away with any national, religious or ethnic segregation. Instead, people are identified by their intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game utilizes 4 different types of cards. 1, The Android Cards are your main cards which are built up and strengthened by the other cards. 2, The Resource Cards strengthen the androids. 3, The Unique Resrouce Cards are one time use cards capable of changing the properties of gameplay. And, 4, Assist Cards are one time use robots that have the ability to shift the flow of battle! Using these cards, your goal is either to destroy all your opponent's androids, or completely deplete their main card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
