			<description>The Falklands (&amp;quot;Malvinas&amp;quot; in Spanish) are a small group of islands in the South Atlantic that have caused a diplomatic conflict between Argentina and the UK since 1833.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the 2nd April 1982 Argentinian forces invaded the islands, which started the Falklands' War. The British reaction was immediate and on the 5th April the first forces sailed to the Falklands. The Argentinians surrendered on the 14th June.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Falklands' War was the largest air and sea operation since WWII and highlighted the importance in modern warfare of logistics, missiles (air-air, ship-air), the air forces, professional troops, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
