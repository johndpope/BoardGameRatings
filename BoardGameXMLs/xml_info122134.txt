							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run</name>
									
			<description>Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run is the first installment in the Spy Hunter series to allow the player to play as the character and not only the vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowhere to Run was intended to be a tie-in to a movie by the same name. However the film got stuck in development hell and the game was released as a stand-alone.  The game stars Dwayne &amp;quot;The Rock&amp;quot; Johnson as government agent Alex Decker, who replaces Alec Sects, the &amp;quot;Spy Hunter&amp;quot; who was to have been the main character of the movie. Johnson is no longer affiliated with the movie project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, like its predecessors sets up for a sequel. In the final scene, a new Interceptor is revealed, capable of flight. However no sequel has been announced yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
