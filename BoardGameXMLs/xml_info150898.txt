			<description>Game in the Hotspur Book for Boys, a 1980 children's Annual. Three different routes lead to the general's HQ. Players dice for starting route. Those starting from routes A or B are Allied Agents. Those starting from Route C are the Gestapo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple roll and move game where you must follow instructions on special squares. Unusually for these type of games, if you land on the same space as another player, you must &amp;quot;fight to the death&amp;quot;. Each player rolls one die repeatedly until one player rolls a six. That player 'kills' the other player. A &amp;quot;Dead Man&amp;quot;  is out of the game. First to reach the HQ wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
