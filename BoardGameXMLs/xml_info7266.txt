							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Glyphe Caster</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher... &lt;br/&gt;There was once a powerful order of magi' known as the Casters. The Casters could carve mystical symbols in the air with their hands and their breath. They called these symbols glyphes. Weaving combinations of the glyphes the Casters could twist reality and call upon the power of the elements. From thin air they could conjure mighty storms, raging fires, howling winds, and terrifying creatures. Some say the Casters could even manipulate time itself, bending it to their will. In their quest for power, the order discovered a chaotic quasi-element. Calling upon this chaotic element was dangerous and many of the order met their doom trying to wield it's power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLYPHE CASTER &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 6 players - Ages 10 and up Each set includes 8 glyphe dice (enough for two players) and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note from Paul - for $5 how can you go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
