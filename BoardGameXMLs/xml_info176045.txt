			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cohorts &amp;amp; Companions &amp;ndash; Simay Niazi provides twenty stat blocks (levels 1 thru 20) for a vishkanya sorceress who specializes in enchantment magic and poison.  Whether hurling spells or firing blowgun darts, Simay whittles away opponent abilities and will to fight.  She is also skilled in diplomacy, deception, and stealth, making her a versatile mixture of combat ability and social interaction.  Add this sultry, serpentine spellcaster to your campaign today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game compatible and gives you twenty ready-to-play stat blocks for a stalwart companion at all levels, 1 thru 20!  Use these stat blocks to add companions or assistants to the party when players are absent, extra muscle is needed, or mercenaries are hired.  This also gives the GM the ability to have potential cohorts on hand built at any level needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find the character&amp;rsquo;s history and other story elements not to your liking, you still have twenty NPC stat blocks you can use as standalone characters of your own naming and developing or as minions and other rabble.  Increase your available NPC stat blocks at every character level (Challenge Rating 1/2 thru 19).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cohorts &amp;amp; Companions series is designed to make the GM&amp;rsquo;s life easier.  Each release provides numerous stat blocks that can be used immediately along a specific theme.  Locate a specific kind of foe to introduce into your campaign or collect them all to build a toolbox of NPCs to unleash at any time.  Give your players a new ally today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
