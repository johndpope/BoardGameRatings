			<description>Board game of naval/air warfare with capture of islands/bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game features perhaps one of the largest boxes in the history of game publishing--24 1/4 inches by 18 1/4 inches by one-and-a-half inches.  The hard-mounted board is twice this size.  The single combat chart is the size of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box top features a reproduction of a hand-drawn charcoal-pencil picture of an aircraft carrier flight deck and island with crewmen on deck, with ships and planes in the background along with yellow-and-red shell bursts, muzzle flashes and black smoke plume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are contained in a single-folded 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include Board, Battle Chart, twenty cards (numbered from One to Ten), two dice and two fleets of miniature vac-u-formed ships in red and blue, plus eight injection-molded miniature 105 mm guns in silver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board is a grid of one-inch white-outlined squares on a blue sea.  Along one side of the board is a display for each carrier deck plus a Dry Dock and Shipyard display for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along each baseline is a Home Base and Airfield.  A sixteen-square island with an Airfield and four fort zones occupies the center of each half of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Fleet consists of two Aircraft Carriers, 3 Battleships, 4 Landing Barges, 5 Planes, 2 Cruisers, 2 Destroyers, and 4 Submarines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Battle Chart&amp;quot; has 26 columns, one for each possible attacker/defender type combination, plus a column for &amp;quot;Units of equal strength.&amp;quot;  Ten results are provided for each column including outcomes such as Sunk, Damaged, Return to Shipyard, Retreats, Escapes, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved by either sinking the enemy Fleet or capturing the enemy's Island Base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toomey Toys was located in Harrisburg, PA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
