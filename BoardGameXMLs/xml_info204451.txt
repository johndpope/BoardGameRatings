			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Act One, we get to know the PCs by seeing what their life is like in the organization. We learn more about their Hooks and their Outs. Hooks give a sense of why the characters have stuck with the Organization. Outs are the people who give PCs a reason to get out of the Organization before it&amp;rsquo;s too late. Act One culminates in a tipping point for each PC - a concrete action that catapults them into the most important decision of their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Act Two, we turn up the heat. PCs have to choose sides as the actions from Act One come to a head. As the Organization puts pressure on the PCs to uphold their vows, the Outs promise escape and peace. Act Two ends with each character&amp;rsquo;s fate made clear: freedom, death, or resignation to a life of crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Act Three is our epilogue. We learn about the ultimate results of Act Two&amp;rsquo;s climax. PCs, Outs, and the Organization itself all receive closure in Act Three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
