			<description>Ever confident of victory, Daimyō Osugawa charges recklessly into battle, leading his fearsome, masked retinue to spill the blood of his foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Osugawa's mounted retinue brings extra skills to the game via new cards especially for cavalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mounted Retainers introduce a cheap mounted melee unit, while the Mounted Sergeant can give another mounted commoner an extra move, meaning 12&amp;quot; and shoot, 15&amp;quot; charge range or 18&amp;quot; total move!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are new metal demon-masked helmets and 18 new cards in the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'Terrifying Visage' card means that enemies must pass a Test of Honour or lose 1 dice from their Avoid roll, while 'Momentum' allows you to draw the next token if you cut down an enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Osugawa himself is arrogant and out for blood and glory - he charges 7&amp;quot; until he's managed to cut down an enemy samurai. And look out for the 'Self Confidence' Quest card - field 2 points less than allowed and still win the battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
