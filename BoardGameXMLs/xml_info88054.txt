							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tome of Battle Maneuver Cards</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Web Enhancement for The Book of Nine Swords&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the nine disciplines for Tome of Battle's Sublime Way is composed of a number of specific stances and maneuvers-- namely, strikes, boosts, and counters. Much like a sorcerer's spells, each stance or maneuver is a specific ability that a character might know. But while a sorcerer's spells rely on arcane power that is depleted by continuous use, a martial adept's abilities are always available to him as long as he has a few minutes to prepare the maneuvers he wishes to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of flipping through your copy of Tome of Battle every time you attempt a new maneuver? The following web enhancement, courtesy of Mark A. Jindra, provides downloadable cards for each and every one: simply download the pages you need, and cut out the maneuvers you'll need to reference!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included 20 separate PDF documents two for each discipline of maneuvers one with art and the other without, plus one each art and no-art blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
