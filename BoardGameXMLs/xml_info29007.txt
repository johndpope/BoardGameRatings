			<description>Strongholds: Ancient Rivals is the third released set in the world of Terris. In this game, and it's sister product Strongholds: Axe &amp;amp; Shield, players get to try their hand at empire building, starting with their own castle. Each player tries to become the first one to complete their castle while preventing other players from doing the same. Winning players must not only manage their castle construction, but successfully attack and defend with their troops as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strongholds: Axe &amp; Shield and Strongholds: Ancient Rivals are each sold separately. Each package contains all the materials needed for a 2 player game. They can be combined or played separately. You can purchase multiple copies of either game to support more players. Future starters and expansions will be sold in a non-collectible format, allowing players to create the types of games that suit them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strongholds: Ancient Rivals pits the mighty Roma Empire against their ancient Fey rivals from Frikara, the Tyrians and their Thulean mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    60 game tiles&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    2 player sheets&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    1 die &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    1 Full-Color rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
