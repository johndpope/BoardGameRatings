			<description>Explore the solar system and outer space, visiting celestial objects and obtain information and points.  The game starts and finishes at Earth and the winner is the one who gains the most points, not necessarily the first one back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn roll and move along the track, through the solar system and into outer space and back, visiting as many celestial bodies as you can.  The first two players back get extra points, so don't take too long.  Use your fuel wisely to maximise your points, and dock with other players to gain extra speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
