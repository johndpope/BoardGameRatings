			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the noble unicorn. These proud and noble creatures have a long history in fantasy media, but rarely serve as creatures that the average group of adventurers have a reason to fight. The first unicorn in this book, the sylvan guardian unicorn (CR 5), is not a paragon of good, but rather of nature, and will do anything to defend its sylvan home, especially impaling hunters and woodsmen who might threaten it. The storm unicorn (CR 8) is a mix of a unicorn and a pegasus, and possesses the ability to fly, as well as an affinity for storms and lightning, which it can fire from its jagged metallic horn. These elusive creatures are rare and exotic game, and are not noble paragons of virtue like their more common cousins. Finally, there is the purifier unicorn (CR 10), which is so pure and divine that non-good creatures that look upon it are struck blind. While it makes a suitable challenge for a group of evil adventurers who are far too powerful to find a challenge in the standard unicorn, its magic tears provide a reason for characters of any alignment to attempt to subdue one, if the need is dire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
