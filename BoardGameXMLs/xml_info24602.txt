			<description>Sheep-dog Trials is a compact and unique little boardgame (using a 12x12 grid playing area) where players are competing with each other and a timer.  Each player attempts to round up as many sheep as possible against the clock - whilst the sheep attempt to keep out of the dog's reach. The sheep can jump the fences but the dog must go through the gate!  Then the roles are reversed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
