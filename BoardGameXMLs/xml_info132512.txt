			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GANAKAGOK is a roleplaying game where you, as &amp;ldquo;Game Master&amp;rdquo; (GM), introduce a group of two to six other players to a fantastic world where they are quasi-Inuit tribal hunters on an island-sized iceberg where night fell a thousand years ago&amp;mdash;but now the spirits have said that dawn is coming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world where it is always night, the harbingers of the dawn foreshadow change, loss, and uncertainty, but also perhaps a measure of hope. In this game, play begins at the point at which the characters have each acknowledged that change is coming. It is up to the players to decide how they will face that change, whose precise form and consequences are to them unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of it as &amp;ldquo;Eskimo-punk&amp;rdquo;: it's about people facing chaos on a grand scale as humans, not as &amp;ldquo;heroes.&amp;rdquo; When the world is radically uncertain and wildly unknowable, while at the same time exerting on each individual powerful pressures to act, to do something, then their actions will be an expression of pure identity: &amp;ldquo;This is who I am!&amp;rdquo; You and your players will create a tale of real people in a strange and dangerous world facing potential loss and striving for the possibility of hope. Some very cool stories emerge in the play of the game, and everyone who plays will be thrilled to watch them unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
