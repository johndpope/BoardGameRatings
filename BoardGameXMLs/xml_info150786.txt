							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of the Mummies</name>
									
			<description>Tomb of the Mummies is kind of like an Indiana Jones or Mummy film. Each player is an archeologist searching a tomb for treasures. Players move along the maze like paths built by tile laying. Attempting follow hieroglyphic clues they find on each tile that they stop on, the players use deduction to find relics, which can protect them from mummies. They search for treasure which they must take out of the tomb to win, but which slows them down so that the mummies may catch up with them. Each player controls 1 archeologist and 1 mummy.  Each player hides treasure, relics, mummy and various traps. The fun is in searching for treasure while attempting to avoid mummies and traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
