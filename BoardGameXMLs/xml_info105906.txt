			<description>Big Five Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help protect the planet from a wide variety of cosmic crafts that are really . . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WEERD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weerd! bears a passing resemblance to Galaxian and similar games in that the player moves a ship back and forth across the bottom of the screen trying to shoot aliens which attach from above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, Weerd! presents a few twists on the standard &amp;quot;dive-bombing aliens&amp;quot; shooter. First, the ships is Weerd! come in a number of odd shapes and sizes, more than living up to their title billing. The ships do not start off in a formation like Galaxian, but instead enter the screen individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weerd! offers the player a Shields command which causes three shields to appear across the bottom of the screen for a short time. The placement is somewhat reminiscent of Space Invaders, except that the Weerd! shields are flat and wide rather than being block shaped. The shields in Weerd! block the shots of the player and the aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the player's ship could be moved at two different speeds. Using the directional keys moved the ship at a standard speed, while holding down the Shift key along with a directional key caused the ship to move more quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weerd! was the last TRS-80 game released by Big Five Software. It was also the second Big Five game not programmed by Bill Hogue. Weerd! was the creation of Arthur Gleckler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some information obtained from the official Big Five Software website: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
