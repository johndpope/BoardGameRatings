			<description>Crush Online is a client-based MMO for PC with a strong focus on PVP battles featuring MOBA-style combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Gaia is home to three realms, each populated by thousands of players fighting an endless territory war. These nations, along with a comprehensive guild system, are the groundwork for truly grand military clashes. Guilds and nations can ally with each other in exciting Castle Sieges to gain control of a nation and lord over its subjects, while entire nations may scheme with and against each other to win epic wars where not just glory, but also valuable treasure and powerful ability enhancements are at stake. Players can choose their avatars from a number of distinct, fully customizable classes, each with tons of different weapon setups and compete with other players and NPCs in tactical and challenging fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just a match &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
