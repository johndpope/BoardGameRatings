			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast break for big-time hoop play with Pat Riley Basketball.  This is backboard-slamming action at its hottest! Gunshot passes, sneaky steals, dazzling tactics- it's all here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your club from a league of 8 teams.  Scout your challengers in exhibition play.  Then hit the court to the screams of a packed house!  Eagle-eye your team's action and switch your controlled man as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closeups capture the on-court intensity- tips, free throws, 3-point jumpers and airborne slams!  Face off with the computer or duke it out with a friend.  Sink some bombs in tournament play, then slam your way to the championship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
