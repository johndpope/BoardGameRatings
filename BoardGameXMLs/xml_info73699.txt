							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carrera&#039;s chess</name>
									
			<description>Carrera's chess was a chess variant created by Pietro Carrera, 17th century priest and historian from Sicily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carrera's chess was played on an 8x10 chessboard with two new pieces: a &amp;quot;champion&amp;quot; (a combination of a rook and a knight) and &amp;quot;centaurus&amp;quot; (a combination of a bishop and a knight).  It was a predecessor of Capablanca chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no castling is this version of chess.  Pawns may make an initial double step, but not if they could be taken en passant by the rules of orthodox chess and at the same time block a check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
