			<description>The plastic board has two distinct halves. The first half features a spiraling track that leads from the top down to the second half, which is dish-shaped and has 'pockets', each worth a different number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ball is placed on the spiral and then let go. The ball will go round the spiral and eventually it will reach the second half. It will settle into one of the pockets and that is your score for that ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to reach a pre-decided score, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
