			<description>This is a tile placing game for two to four players. Each player has a board of 7 x 7 squares, and the object of the game is to completely fill the board with coloured tiles - these being multicoloured and covering between 1 and 5 squares. Like-coloured tiles may not be adjacent, but can touch at corners. Game play involves throwing two dice to determine which tiles to use, and once placed, they may not be rearranged (tiles may be discarded, or refused). Throwing a six allows you to steal a tile from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With dice, there is an element of luck, but strategic play can help mitigate this. Games are comparatively short so they are ideal fillers between more complicated longer games. Sometimes gameplay can be frenetic. Because of the simplicity, it can appeal to a wide age range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
