			<description>Chase Across the Planes is a boardgame for two to four players set in the worlds of the Intruder.  The game was published in Intruder magazine #1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player assume the roles of supernatural characters who are testing their powers for the first time... each character has a special ability that allows them to 'bend' the rules in a slightly different way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around a small stylized mapboard that represents the different planes of existance, attempting to visit each one and 'leave their mark'.  Along the way, they may battle other characters and/or destroy other player's markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player has markers in all of the planes required (depending on the number of players, this can be 4 to 6), he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
