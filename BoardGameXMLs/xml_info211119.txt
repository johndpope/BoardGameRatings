			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of space surrounding Sol warrants a proper sci-fi role-playing game adaptation. Indeed, many games adopted the region, either as a two-dimensional abstraction or as some representation of the real three-dimensional space. However, currently, there is little in the way of an up-to-date, concrete star-maps of Sol's immediate neighborhood for the various older-school sci-fi RPGs, such as the Cepheus Engine, 2d6 sci-fi games, and several other games utilizing a two-dimensional hexagon star-map. This product comes to remedy this issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides a full Sol-centered, hexagon-based star-map, 20 parsecs by 16 parsecs in size - a &amp;quot;Quadrant&amp;quot; if you will. Additionally, it provides full Cepheus Engine (and 2d6 sci-fi SRD) data for the &amp;quot;main world&amp;quot; planets of each and every star involved, ready for you, the Referee, to colonize.&lt;br/&gt;For your convenience, we also provide expanded Temperature rules for the included worlds, fully compatible with the Cepheus Engine rules, as well as a short overview of star spectral types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We based these maps on real, up-to-date astronomical data, which we have abstracted into a two-dimensional hexagon grid where each hexagon is one parsec in width. We tried to make sure that the system data suits the data we have now &amp;ndash; as of the summer of 2016 &amp;ndash; about our stellar neighborhood, though abstracted, as noted above, for gaming use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps, UWPs, and rule data in this product are fully open-content, as per the OGL. This means that you may take this data, and even the maps, and directly base your own sci-fi RPG product on them, even include the map or a modified version of it in your product. And yes, this includes commercial products as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
