							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aetaltis Bestiary Collection: Trench Crawler</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trench crawlers creep along reefs and the rocky walls of deep sea trenches in search of their next meal. Once they locate good hunting grounds, they secure their hooks in small crevices and lay flat against the trench wall. Keeping at least one hook buried in the wall, it lashes out with the other hooks with lightning speed and deadly accuracy. Once its victim is impaled, it is extremely difficult for the creature to pull away, leaving the trench crawler to simply wait for its prey to exhaust itself or die from blood loss. Make your players regret their decision to go into the water with this deadly new monster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
