It is a huge suit of exo-armor almost 13 feet tall. The most advanced and destructive weapon built during the Solomon Empire, its original name has been lost to the mists of time, its current name is reference to its origins and its role as the true legacy of a dead civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Wissenschaft Leader Warrior/Mystic- Lv. 65+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 6 | Dm 6 | Df 9 | Ar 5 | LP 35 | Re 10 | Mo 8/12 | AP ?/5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage Resistance: Legacy has Damage Resistance and cannot use Dodge or Counterattack Actions, except for Energy Screen.&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Immunity (Poison, Blind), Open Movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oo - Energy Screen (Magic, Dodge)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+ 1 Defense.
