							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Raid Mirror</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halad al Bim didn't take all of his relics to Tannoch with him when he died, and now a pack of blight orcs has found his cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the cost of many lives, they have cracked the secret of al Bim's mirror, a device which not only allows viewing of distant places, but travel as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, blight orc raiding parties are appearing a hundred leagues from the blight, raiding the unfortified villages beyond the borderlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They slaughter everyone, take everything, and leave no tracks. They've eaten their way through three valleys' worth of cattle without a defeat. That sort of thing can make a baron lose sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
