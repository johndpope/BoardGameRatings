							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Depths of Durangrar</name>
									
			<description>The Depths of Durangrar is a dungeon crawler table top game that is played in the dark. Individual explorers will light up to illuminate only what is in front of them in a 3D maze. The goal of the explorers is to find treasure in the maze and bring it out of the maze from where they came. However, explorers must be careful for a monster hunts them in the maze. The monster does not light up and remains hidden in the darkness. The monster player is wearing night vision goggles and can see the whole maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move throughout the maze using action points. Action points are spent moving space to space, rotating, picking up gold, using their unique abilities, using items and attacking other players. Explorers can also team up with one another to increase their odds of killing the monster, however, it leaves them open to betrayal where another explorer can steal the gold they have collected for their own gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explorers are the Scout, Knight and Demolitionist. The Scout can have more action points than other explorers. The Knight can reduce damage they take in combat and the Demolitionist can permanently remove walls from the maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monsters are the Thresher, Excavator and Sentient Fungus. The Thresher can jump over walls to ambush explorers. The excavator can build temporary walls to trap explorers and the Sentient Fungus can build environmental traps to injure and slow the advance of explorers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
