			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombi is a French adventure/survival horror game released on several platforms by Ubi Soft. The game tells the story of a group of four survivors (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) stranded in a mall after their helicopter ran out of fuel. They must somehow evade or fight the hordes of undead roaming the mall and find a way to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a point &amp;amp; click interface, with an icon system for every available action. The player can switch between each of the four characters and must take care of their well-being (they must feed and rest or their health bar will drop). Of course, if a character dies he or she returns as a zombi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plot is heavily inspired by George Romero's Dawn of the Dead movie (which was released as &amp;quot;Zombi&amp;quot; in Italian and some French theaters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
