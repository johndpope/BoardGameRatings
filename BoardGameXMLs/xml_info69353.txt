			<description>&amp;quot;The core gameplay of Dark Chronicle is an action RPG with some elements from dungeon crawl games. The player proceeds through a series of randomly created dungeon rooms, which are periodically interrupted by set rooms where they either witness a cutscene or fight a boss. In the dungeons the player will find various materials to use in item construction and Geostones, which are necessary for the Georama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outside of dungeons the main focus is the Georama system, where the player is tasked with rebuilding certain locations in order to restore the future. By retrieving Geostones from the dungeons the player is given guidelines for the town as well as plans to make objects (such as houses, bridges and shops) required for filling said guidelines. Along with rebuilding the infrastructure, the town must be populated with inhabitants&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dark_Chronicle,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
