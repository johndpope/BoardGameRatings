			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows of Latin America is a sourcebook &amp;mdash; originally planned for Shadowrun Third Edition &amp;mdash; that describes the countries and conditions in Central and South America circa 2064. The project was originally proposed for publication in 2005, by Shadowrun Line Developer, Rob Boyle as FanPro SKU 25011, and later developed by Jong-Won Kim. The ISBN would have been 1-932564-51-9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FanPro's project description: &lt;br/&gt;Can you stand the heat?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You'll be sweating bullets if get caught in the crossfire between Amazonia and Aztlan - and you'll need that extra ammo. Latin America is no vacation spot, gringo. Even if you avoid those juggernauts, you'll still be running against Caribbean pirates, drug-dealing Ghost Cartels, Old World dictatorships and communist revolutionaries-and whatever you do, stay out of the jungle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows of Latin America explores the many countries and territories of Central and South America in the world of Shadowrun. Each profile includes details on location hot spots, government and corporate rulers, the criminal underground and religious factions. It provides extensive updates on the Awakened nations of Azlan and Amazonia, as well as a selection of paranormal flor and fauna to be found in the deep jungles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circa 2007 it was announced that the content would be part of the then pending (now cancelled) Holostreets website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.holostreets.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.holostreets.com/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt; In 2010, after it was officially announced by Shadowrun license holder Catalyst Game Labs, that the book would not ever see an official printing, most of the authors publically released their drafts on the internet for use by fans of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the exception of the &amp;quot;Crime in Latin America&amp;quot; chapter, all of the released drafts were formatted and compiled into a single PDF by Franz Ernst, a German Dumpshock poster known as fexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
