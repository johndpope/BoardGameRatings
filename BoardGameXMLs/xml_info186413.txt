			<description>Mythic Magic with Class!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is the first all-new Mythic Magic supplement since the publication of the Mythic Spell Compendium from Legendary Games and Kobold Press, and it brings you 134 all-new mythic spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide! While the original mythic rules for Pathfinder included many cherished favorites from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook as well as the other core rules hardback rulebooks and the Mythic Spell Compendium compiled a vast array of mythic spells for your game, new rules for Pathfinder continue to come out and spellcasters have a continual supply of new tricks to try from more recent rulebooks like the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide. That diversity of options that we love so much about the game is what Legendary Games brings to you in the Mythic Magic series. The product before you completes the mythic rules for every spell in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Advanced Class Guide. All of them, from adhesive blood to widen auras and all spells in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're an arcane or a divine caster, Mythic Magic: Advanced Spells III contains mythic spells of every level and every kind, from minor spells to the mightiest magics. You will find combat spells like molten orb, sonic scream, and whip of spiders right alongside defensive magic like guardian of faith and shield of fortification, spells to aid your allies like path of glory and contingent action, and utility spells like investigative mind and climbing beanstalk. They are all here, every one, developed with flair and function in mind as only Legendary Games can bring it, by the same designers that wrote most of the mythic spells in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
