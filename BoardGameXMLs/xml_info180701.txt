							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Tower of Viondor (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The glory and riches of the ancients await!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ghostly ship on the Sea of Mists, a frozen wreck in the Thousand Teeth, and the long-lost legacy of an arrogant archmage who stared the doom of Nimoth in the face and did not blink; these are the stepping stones to finding the forgotten Tower of Viondor. An Atlantean wizard of unparalleled inventiveness, the legendary Viondor would not flee with his kin when the glaciers approached. Hidden in the far glacial rifts of Nimoth his tower remains, with the wisdom of the ancients perhaps unguarded after his inevitable demise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Tower of Viondor is a pulp adventure for characters of 7th-9th level, taking them from familiar shores across the wild northern seas and into the heart of the frozen north in search of magical treasures and lore that will make them rich beyond imagining. While easily portable to any campaign with icy seas and fallen ancient empires, this adventure is set in the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting from Sasquatch Game Studios! Inspired by the literary traditions of sword-and-sorcery adventure, lost worlds, and fantastic horror, the land of Primeval Thule is a savage, intense campaign setting. Primeval Thule is a multi-platform campaign setting, available for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the 13th Age Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
