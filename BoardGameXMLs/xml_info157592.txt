			<description>from The setting:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bleeding Hearts&amp;quot; is a hot, new medical soap opera set in Memorial Hospital. The players will be taking on the roles of the principal characters. Like most soaps Bleeding Hearts is big on melodrama and overacting. Plot consistency and plausibility can be thrown out the window whenever they become inconvenient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a scenario for 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;The system was inspired by the game &amp;ldquo;Soap&amp;rdquo; published by Wingnut Games. The original game was a storytelling game in the style of &amp;ldquo;Once Upon a Story&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Pantheon&amp;rdquo;. The rules &amp;hellip; bring the game closer to a traditional roleplaying game. The game can be played either in a semi-LARP style with player moving around a set and acting out their roles, or in the traditional sitting-around-a-table style. The scenario is designed to run using the pre-generated player characters at the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
