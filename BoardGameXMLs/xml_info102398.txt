			<description>Pursuit Force is a video game for the PlayStation Portable. It puts the player in the role of a police agent who joins up to a law enforcement agency known as the Pursuit Force, to restore order to a city overrun with crime. This elite unit specialises in direct armed encounters with adversaries, whether it be on foot or on the bonnet of a speeding car. The player has to try to seize cars and motorbikes while engaging in gun battles at speeds of over 150 miles per hour (240 km/h). It is set in fictional Capital State (which includes Capital City) in America where there are various criminal gangs to contend with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of thirty missions, six per gang. These missions include escorting, protecting and destroying the enemy on foot, by speedboat, in a car or in a helicopter. The game also includes a race mode with several different courses and scenarios and a time trial mode, setting you across all the games' tracks. There is also a wide variety of unlockable content such as pictures and videos to access. The amount of content you unlock, however, is completely dependant on the scores you get playing the career mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pursuit Force&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
