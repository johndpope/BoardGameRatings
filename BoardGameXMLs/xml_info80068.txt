			<description>Mega Man Xtreme 2, known as Rockman X2: Soul Eraser​ (ロックマンX2 ソウルイレイザー) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. It is a spin-off title in the Mega Man X series and is a direct sequel to Mega Man Xtreme, released the previous year. Chronologically, it seems to take place between Mega Man X3 and Mega Man X4, sometime after Mega Man Xtreme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game works similarly to the first Mega Man Xtreme title, except that the player can choose between playing as X and playing as Zero. Both have special skills that help them through the stages, but each also has weaknesses as well. X uses his X-Buster to shoot enemies from a distance. It can be charged up to three levels. Zero uses his Z-Saber for close-range combat. He risks taking damage more often by getting closer to enemies, but his slashes are more damaging than X's bullets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major change in this game is that X and Zero do not both gain a weapon when a boss is defeated; only the player used to destroy the Maverick will get the special weapon. This adds a hint of strategy to the gameplay, as one must consider not only the order in which they will fight each boss, but whether X or Zero's gained weapons will prove more effective later on, and which are needed to reach power-ups. Also, after each level, the DNA souls gathered in the level will accumulate, which the player can use to buy power-ups from Iris. A difficulty setting called &amp;quot;Extreme Mode&amp;quot; can be unlocked where the player can utilize both X and Zero on any level and can gain different weapons depending on which bosses they defeat. The final boss of this mode is Sigma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Mega Man Xtreme 2 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
