							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psycho-Slasher: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Psycho-Slasher: The Game is a 30-page miniatures game homage to the low budget slasher films of the 1970's and 1980's, playable in any scale from 15mm to 54mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psycho-Slasher is easy to learn, and fun to play, with each player acting as a Writer and running their own Slasher. The competing Slashers don't interact directly, but the Writers have the ability to hinder or help other Slashers with the placement of new weapons, or, more importantly, manipulating the horde of Pawns (Victims) that populate the Slasher film tableau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You say that you love the idea, but that you don't have miniatures for a game like this? No problem! Included with the game are printable paper miniatures... you get 5 distinct Slashers, a Cop, and 4 distinct Pawns. Print as many Pawns and Cops as you need, snip, fold, glue, and you are all set! Also included are printable Weapon counters, and Pawn Special counters that introduce twists to the game like Phones (self-explanatory,) Beer (dangerous for Pawns), and Hysteria (AHHHHH!!!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a Slasher ends his/her movement in contact with a Pawn or Cop, the Slasher must conduct an attack. If the Attack is successful your Slasher removes the Pawn from the board, earning Collection Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collection Points translate into ratings, or popularity, for the Writer&amp;rsquo;s Slasher and Slasher story line. So, earning Collection Points in the game, while preventing rival Slashers from collecting points when you can, is how you can win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not recommended for children under the age of 16. This is meant to be a fun game, based on a movie genre, and does not take itself seriously... still, the subject matter may not be appropriate for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
