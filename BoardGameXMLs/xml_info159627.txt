			<description>Flynn, the pirate owl is a real mischief-maker. Very secretly he has pinched anything and everything that he could fi nd on deck and has stashed it away in the look-out &amp;ndash; the crow&amp;lsquo;s nest: the gold drinking cups of the crew, the captain&amp;lsquo;s sword, the treasure chest, the jewellery for the lady pirates and a few mice &amp;ndash; just in case. You can never know how long you&amp;lsquo;re going to be left sitting high and dry. Cheekily, he&amp;lsquo;s throned high up in the crow&amp;lsquo;s nest and is smirking joyfully over so many riches. It&amp;lsquo;s no surprise that the ship&amp;lsquo;s crew is fuming and want their belongings back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the objects that Flynn has stashed away in the crow&amp;lsquo;s nest. A die shows you what you have to look for. Like in the trick with the table cloth you have to pull a cord stick to a card and hope that the Flynn stays in his nest and that the nest is not toppling over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
