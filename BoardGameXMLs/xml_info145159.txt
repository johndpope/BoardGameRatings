							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mechanical Assassians</name>
									
			<description>This game is very close to a movie franchise (1984 till 2009), and a tv series (2007 till 2009) - in which machines try to kill a future leader by sending back in time certain characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game pits players against each other in two teams: The Mechanical Assassins and the Resistance Fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on your allegiance your personal goals are set. Reach them, and support your team mates and you will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players travel as a group to different locations in time.&lt;br/&gt;The current (active) player asks the group to perform a certain action, which is then voted upon. Success: and s/he may either hack, attack, or (possibly) kill someone, or succeed at this time's mission to gain an artifact/item. Fail: and it is the next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items grant special abilites (skip certain votes), but may have a limited usage. They also may change the might of a character in the vote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when John C. (son of Sarah C.) dies, or all possible time locations having been explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the individual goals, a total is made for both teams, who ever has the higher wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created for the &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/974256/pnp-hidden-role-bluffing-card-game-design-contest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/974256/pnp-hidden-role-b...&lt;/a&gt; in 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
