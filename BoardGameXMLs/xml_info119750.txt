							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Megafortress: Operation Sledgehammer</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows in the silent hangar stretched hundreds of feet, cutting huge black angles across the cracked concrete floor. Lieutenant General Bradley Elliott, USAF, stood facing the two Iranians in the dim yellow light cast by a single old work lamp. The air reeked of oil and desert dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sweating cabinet minister mopped his forehead and spoke rapidly in Farsi to his interpreter, a young, tired-looking woman. She turned nervously toward Elliott. &amp;quot;The minister asks if you have brought the 'potk'...the 'sledgehammer' spoken of by your ambassador in Kuwait City?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tell the minister that we are prepared to carry out our part of the bargain if we receive the data we require.&amp;quot; Elliott's voice rasped in low tones through the hot air of the darkened hangar. &amp;quot;We want to see your government secure against the extremists in your army. But we need locations and specs on certain targets to finalize our work.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The minister and his aide spoke together for a strained moment. She turned again to Elliott. &amp;quot;The minister is concerned also about the Libyan terrorist machine. He says the training camps and factories and supplies must be stopped also, or his coalition will be... destabilized?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We already have made plans to deal with that situation,&amp;quot; said the general grimly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sound broke the stillness, in darkness a couple of hundred feet behind Elliott's left shoulder--a soft hiss and dull clank, as though a hydraulic door were being closed and latched. Elliott didn't move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reluctantly, the minister pulled a folder filled with loose documents from his robes and handed it to Elliott. &amp;quot;He says that he will die if these are discovered missing, and prays that you safeguard them,&amp;quot; said the woman. Elliott half-smiled to himself in the darkness. &amp;quot;Ma'am, you tell him it's safe with me.&amp;quot; As if by signal, a Kuwaiti lieutenant materialized out of the shadows and the two visitors were ushered out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elliott turned as the lights came up. He looked at the monster slowly appearing where the shadows had been, its heavily loaded wings drooping slightly at the tips. He smiled, &amp;quot;Potk, huh? As good a description as any, I guess.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     25 New missions in Iran and Libya, with over 1000 square miles of new territory, threats and targets to master. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New enemy targets include terrorist training camps, port facilities, chemical weapons and nuclear research facilities, ships, submarines, oil storage depots and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Megafortress ordnance now includes the CBU-95 FAE (fuel air explosive) and Penguin Mk 3 anti-ship missile. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New enemy naval weapons platforms include guided missile destroyers, frigates, and fast attack craft. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New enemy airborne weapons platforms include MIG-25s and Mirage F-1s. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New enemy SAMs include the SA-10 &amp;quot;Grumble&amp;quot;, SA-12A &amp;quot;Gladiator&amp;quot;, SM-1 MR, and the Hawk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
