							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unofficial Elder Scrolls RPG: Core Rules (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was written out of my personal desire to combine existing house rules with new material to enable myself and my friends to role-play in the Elder Scrolls setting, but at a  certain point it grew a lot bigger than anticipated and I realized I just wanted to write a full conversion. I had experience with the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and Dark Heresy (2nd Edition) systems by Fantasy Flight Games, and decided to use them as a model for this new game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
