			<description>Jigsaw puzzle with an educational value: 6 panels, each panel is shown in 6 designs, along with free fields for the matching image. On display is one place or activity - the train station, business, etc. -  and the matching image must be placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pictures on the blackboard and the pictures of this place are numbered alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules in the lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More detailed Information:&lt;br/&gt;In this game it's important to observe. Each card show a person. This person can be a glazier, a gardener, a firefighter or another profession. These people find their place during the game on the white areas on the panels next to a representative exercise: the glazier replace broken glass, the gardener pour the flowers, the firefighter extinguish the burning house ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first step a moderator is to be chosen. The moderator distribute the panels under the players and places the cards face down on a pile. Now he takes one card after another, shows the person and calls them by name. Each player looks now, whether the person fits to one of the pictures on his panel. If matching the player calls &amp;quot;for me&amp;quot;, takes the card and places it in the appropriate space on the panel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to complete all white boxes on his panel is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
