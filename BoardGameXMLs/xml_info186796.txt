							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bridge Constructor Medieval</name>
									
			<description>Dive into the Middle Ages and play the successor to the worldwide #1 hit, Bridge Constructor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridge Constructor Medieval turns back the clock a few centuries to the time of knights and castles. Build sturdy bridges to supply your city with provisions - or cunningly constructed bridges that collapse under the weight of attacking troops, sending the horde of enemies into the abyss below. You won&amp;rsquo;t even be safe from cannon fire in the 40 brand new levels. Protect your foot soldiers and your horse-drawn carriages with covered bridges and stable pillar structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of five materials available to help you build the perfect bridge: wood, heavy wood, stone and ropes, along with the new addition of the bridge roof. &lt;br/&gt;Throughout the exciting background story, you will familiarize yourself with the various materials on a step-by-step basis, and learn everything you need to know so that your bridges meet the requirements of the different levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative game modes in store for you! &lt;br/&gt;Besides building stable bridges, there's also plenty on offer for veterans to discover in the new game modes. &lt;br/&gt;In the siege level, your bridge is bombarded by enemy catapults. Strengthen your bridge so that it doesn't collapse, and protect your own troops on the bridge with a bridge roof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In another new game mode, you build your bridges so that they collapse under the load of enemy units to send as many of them as possible into the abyss. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, the unique bonus challenges will leave even the most experienced players at their wit&amp;rsquo;s end. That way, both bridge-building professionals and novices will face a challenge in Bridge Constructor Medieval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
