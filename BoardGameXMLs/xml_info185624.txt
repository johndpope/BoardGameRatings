							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wayfarer: Things Beyond Wonder</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wayfarer is a tabletop role playing game in which intrepid explorers adventure between realities. Narratives span multiple genres, from high-concept science fiction, to sword and sorcery epics, and everything in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core resolution mechanic of the game uses d10 with modifier, compared to a Difficulty Value set by the GM.  Success or failure degrees are based on the difference between the modified roll and the Difficulty Value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have several Attributes, namely:  Strength, Dexterity, Bulk, Agility, Endurance, Reason, Perception, Willpower, Creativity, and Charisma.  Characters also have several Functional Attributes, namely:  Power, Fortitude, Coordination, Action, Speed, Mass, and Aptitude.  Characters have Traits, Skills, and may know Tricks.  Character creation follows an established formula--Species, Occupation, Attributes, Personality, Skills, Bonus Experience, and Equipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
