			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gyropod, the player is tasked with the defence of a large spaceship. The ship has a central component housing the engines connected to a large ring component. You command a pod which runs around the rim of the ring. Your ship must be at the correct point on the ring to shoot the incoming enemy fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship and the pod have separate shields. You also have limited ammunition. When the pod's shields or ammunition are running low, you can transfer to a planet. It is essential to fire retro-rockets when landing for a smooth landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When on the planet, the player must continue to dodge or shoot aliens while the ammunition supply is replenished, but you must leave before your air supply runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
