			<description>Revenant is an action-RPG computer game by Cinematix Studios, released in 1999 by the publisher Eidos Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main character of the story is Locke D'Averam, a revenant named after the house of Averam, which raised him from the dead. His real name is never revealed in the game. Immediately after being brought back from Anserak (Hell), Locke is sent on a quest by his new master, Sardok, who is the advisor to Lord Tendrick, ruler of the island. The quest is to locate and rescue the Tendricks' long-missing daughter, Andria, who was kidnapped by a mysterious cult calling themselves The Children of the Change. The entire game takes place on the island of Ahkuilon, which is home to the town of Misthaven, where Tendrick rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player progresses through the story, it is revealed that Locke was once the king of an ancient empire centered on Ahkuilon. This warrior-king made a pact with a demon god, but he found the price of the pact - his beautiful wife's soul - too much to bear and could not go through with her sacrifice. For this reason he was condemned by the demon god to an eternity of suffering in Anserak and his mighty empire was destroyed and pulled into the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cult that the newly resurrected Locke finds himself facing is in fact led by the avatar of the same demon god he betrayed ages ago. As he explores Ahkuilon in pursuit of the missing Andria, Locke finds himself facing enemies both new and ancient. Many characters in the game hint that there is a &amp;quot;darkness&amp;quot; surrounding Locke and some even seem to know of his past. As the story builds to a climax it becomes clear that not all is as it seems and that history may yet repeat itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aspect of &amp;quot;Revenant&amp;quot; is its unique combat system that comes in two flavours. Locke can be controlled by the mouse, performing standard attacks. In addition, the player can control Locke with the keyboard, performing different attacks and even attack combos, some of which result in special death animations (fatalities). These specialized kill moves appear to be enemy-specific, and range from a crushing stomp to beheading. A gamepad or joystick can also be used in a similar way to the keyboard method, with nearly every move or command able to be mapped to buttons or button combinations. Locke gains extra fighting abilities after a level cap has been reached (every 3 levels, seemingly up to 24), thus providing the drive to go through the level grind. It is also possible to combine certain movements into a fluid cycle of kicks and thrusts. A trainer in town provides Locke with the necessary instructions whenever he levels up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to melee combat, there are also a number of talismans which can be combined to cast magic spells. Certain combinations can be found in scrolls starting with basic spells and progressing to more complicated ones. Spells vary from freezing to poisoning, and certain spells lock opponents in place allowing Locke to combine a magical attack with a special combat move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Revenant (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
