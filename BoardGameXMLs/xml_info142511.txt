							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Palestina under Davidstjernen</name>
									
			<description>A 50s boardgame themed on the Jewish rights to settle in the promised land of Palestine (&amp;quot;Kanaans land&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Jews land&amp;quot;). Players move their token on a classical 50s map of Palestine, and scores points as they reach different cities and locations on the map. Winner is the player with highest score after 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move on the board from directions given by the David star; players spin the David star, mounted on a large paper clip, each turn, and move on the board accordingly, as the David star tells you both which direction to go, and how far you should go. The rule book states where this location is mentioned in the bible, and how many points you get from entering this location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a game published with a clearly political intension, it is quite ironic to find the 1948 UN map of Israel as a part of the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced version is to point in what part of the bible this location is mentioned. The game is in Norwegian, published by Karmel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
