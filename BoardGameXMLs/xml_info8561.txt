			<description>There are six horses in every race. Each horse is represented in the deck by seventeen cards. The deck is shuffled and the top twelve cards are revealed. When a horse&amp;rsquo;s card is revealed, the horse&amp;rsquo;s odds are increased from 1:1 to 2:1 to 3:1 to 4:1. The players then bet which horses will win, place and show by having their cards revealed fourteen more times first, second and third, respectively. Progress of the horses in kept track on a gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two races are played for the Daily Double. The eighth race has no betting and a jackpot is paid to the players who pick the winning horse in this last race. The player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
