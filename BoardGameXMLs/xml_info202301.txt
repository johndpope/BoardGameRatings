			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by traits.  Play creates custom card artifacts (on blank index cards) that are used throughout the game.  The setting of the game is co-opted from a specific historical period, incorporated by reference to a Wikipedia article.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published as a series of tweets, none of which were edited.  This process adhered to the Game Chef 2014 theme of &amp;quot;the unbound book&amp;quot;.  After the final tweet comprising the game was made, the author produced a storify version to place the tweets in a specific non-chronological order to enhance accessibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
