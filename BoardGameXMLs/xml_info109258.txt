							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero&#039;s Call</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old World is a place of constant war, and the unending battles take their tolls. Still, there are those rare individuals who continually apply themselves to improving their talents and accomplishing their goals. They let nothing stand between them and their terms for success, no matter how mammoth the opposition may be. These few, exceptional individuals rise to become the Old World&amp;rsquo;s great powers, generals of armies, wizard lords, and arch lectors&amp;hellip; Are you ready to answer the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero&amp;rsquo;s Call provides your heroes with tremendous new ammunition to face the challenges before them: 12 new high-powered careers, 12 regional options for men and dwarfs from outside Reikland, two new player races, action cards for each new trait, and&amp;ndash;for the first time ever&amp;ndash;new spells and blessings for Ranks 4 and 5. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing, too, that your characters will gain greater power than ever before because Hero&amp;rsquo;s Call also explores the daily challenges of the Old World&amp;rsquo;s greatest heroes, including the Epic Threats they must face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With new rules for characters of Rank 4 and 5, players will be able to attain power most mortals have never tasted&amp;ndash;provided your characters can survive the challenges that await them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At long last, wizards and priests can further their mystical mastery beyond Rank 3. As they make choices about which path to pursue in their profession at Rank 4, the powerful new spells and blessings they wield provide them fantastic new options in battles. As an example, Caress of Laniph, a Rank 4 spell for the Amethyst Order can deal as much as 6 + WP + Int damage, ignoring the soak value of your target&amp;rsquo;s armour, and allow you to recover 1 wound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But players aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones who will gain untold power in Hero&amp;rsquo;s Call! Powerful new adversaries lurk within the supplement&amp;rsquo;s pages, with notable adversaries such as Archaon the Everchosen presented with special rules and guidelines for inclusion in your campaign. Additionally, other powerful creatures await adventuring heroes, and Epic Threat sheets allow you to boost standard creatures into elite adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new paradigm for epic adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paradigm shifts for the high and mighty, and Hero&amp;rsquo;s Call presents several adventure seeds and features a complete adventure, The Art of Waaagh!, specially tailored to meet the interests of heroes who have seen it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
