			<description>This is the google Translation of the german game description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In several rounds of play, the Knights try individually or jointly to the respective places on the board to achieve victory. Failing that, they get handkerchiefs as favors and can move onto the barrel fields of the board towards the castle. Whoever reaches the castle, and has the most favorable evidence, winner of the rivalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the middleage the players fights to get points to get to the castle. There are some fights I have to solve alone, other fights must be solved by all the players together. The player with the most points win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
