			<description>The learners will be able to identify different aspects of the program Authorware Professional by Macromedia. Specifically the learners will be able to identify different basic properties of graphics, movies, animations, and sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in the following manner:&lt;br/&gt;   1. Dealer shuffles the deck and deals seven cards to the players starting with the player to the left. He then flips the first card of the playing deck over next to the remaining cards.&lt;br/&gt;   2. The player on the dealer's left begins play. They may either pick up the card lying face up or take the top card from the stack. They may choose to keep this card in their hand or return it to the face-up pile on the table. If one of the new cards is taken, one must be discarded in its place. Play continues around the circle.&lt;br/&gt;   3. Players sort their cards according to categories of media type (graphics, video, animation, or sound) or according to informational category (9 categories.)&lt;br/&gt;   4. The winner of the round is the player who is able to discard all of his cards first. Each of the remaining players gets a point added to his score for the cards he has in his hands. Each player is eliminated from play when he exceeds 25 points total. The winner is the last person left after elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
