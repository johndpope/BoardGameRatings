							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SuperFooty Table Soccer</name>
									
			<description>SuperFooty Table Soccer is similar to the classic Subbuteo table-top soccer game.  It is played on a large cloth playing field, with teams of players that are represented by miniature men mounted on smooth round bases. The figures are made to kick the ball by flicking their bases, which causes the figures to slide around on the pitch, hitting the ball. The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SuperFooty Classic Edition contains the cloth playing field, two complete teams (10 outfielders and 1 goalkeeper, each), two goals with nets, two balls, and instructions.  Figures are hand painted in the colors of Argentina, Brazil, England, or Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game insert:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SuperFooty is a skillful and exciting table soccer game for two players.  Great technique, clever tactics and quick thinking make for the closest simulation of real soccer around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SuperFooty is for friends, for families, and for the most passionate there are National and World Championships for boys, girls, men, and women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you up to the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
