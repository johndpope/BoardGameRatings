			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next piece of essential gear covered in the &amp;quot;Adventurer Essentials&amp;quot; line is Rope. Adventurer Essentials: Rope is divided into three parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part One deals with gear; and presents different types of rope and materials used in its manufacturing, from standard Hempen rope, to ropes made from other materials such as monstrous Spider Silk, and even Mithrial Laced cords! Part one also discuss the use of the grappling hook, block and tackle, and introduced one new weapon: the lariat. (Often incorrectly called a &amp;quot;lasso&amp;quot;!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Two focuses on the Use Rope skill, with respect to the tying of knots. Various in-game knots are presented along with their uses including the Grief Knot and the Thief's Knot; two knots that are NOT what they appear to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Part Three describes a handful of new magic items and spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
