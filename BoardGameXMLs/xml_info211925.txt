			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This morning your mother, a superb snow leopard, took you outside to practice your pouncing. What she didn't realize is that a deadly Siberian tiger stalks these mountains too! Find the adult snow leopard before you find the Siberian tiger to win in this game of frolics turned fatal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, one or two players play a group of four snow leopard cubs who are in danger!  They must find their mother before the Siberian Tiger finds them.  The board is made up of thirty cards, played face down.  Twenty-eight of those cards are mountains, one is the adult snow leopard, one is the Siberian tiger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn, as long as they hold a snow leopard cub in their hand, they may swap that card with any card on the board.  The card they take is revealed.  If it is a mountain, nothing happens.  If it is the Siberian tiger, all is lost.  If it is the adult snow leopard, they win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the adult snow leopard or Siberian tiger hasn't yet been found, for each snow leopard cub already on the board, the player can flip face-up one card that is located diagonally adjacent to the snow leopard cub card. These cards are flipped down at the end of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the snow leopard cub cards have been played, players may retrieve a snow leopard cub card on their next turn by swapping it back out with a Mountain card in your hand.  When playing a two-player game, this means you can start to retrieve your cards after playing two, instead of all four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played solo, with one person controlling all four snow leopard cubs, or fully co-op with two players playing two cubs each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
