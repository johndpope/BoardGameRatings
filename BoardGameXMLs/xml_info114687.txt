							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Company: Field Operations Manual</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;ver wondered what it is like to jump out of an aircraft 50,000 feet above a stricken oil tanker? Or how you&amp;rsquo;d handle defusing an IED? Or what it is like standing between a visiting VIP and that sniper&amp;rsquo;s bullet? Well now you can because The Company will put you right at the centre of the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Company you play an employee of The Company &amp;ndash; an elite independent Private Military Service Provider, a global security concern capable of dealing with any situation from a high octane firefight to the tracking down of serial killers. If you can think of it, The Company can handle it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 214 page Roleplaying game puts you in the boots of a member of The Company. Play a solider, a pilot, a surveillance officer or any other concept you can dream up that fits the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a modified version OpenQuest, a straight forward d100 system, with extra rules to handle Guns, non-lethal weapons, mental trauma and Vehicles. All rules necessary to play are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also contains pages of World information about Trouble hot spots, terrorist organisations, and Competitors to the company. A skill-full blend of real world information, written by someone who has worked in the UK Defence industry, and game-able fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
