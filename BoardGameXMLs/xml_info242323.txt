							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Isaac Newton + F. G. Newton</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most fascinating and valuable educational game ever devised - Isaac Newton challenges the players (1-4) to assemble evidence and discern the underlying &amp;quot;Laws of Nature&amp;quot; that have produced this evidence.  Isaac Newton is an inductive game that allows players to intervene actively by proposing experiments to determine if new data conform to the &amp;quot;Laws of Nature&amp;quot; in question.  Players may set the level of difficulty from simple to fiendishly complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F.G. Newton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Graphics Newton - this version of Isaac Newton presents all data in graphic form.  Because data is graphic rather than symbolic, this game is suitable for very young children.  Players may select difficulty levels challenging to the most skilled adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isaac Newton was sold for several months by itself; F.G. Newton later was added on as a second &amp;quot;version&amp;quot; - they were subsequently distributed together as Isaac Newton + F.G. Newton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
