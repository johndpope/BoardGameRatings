							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Defenders</name>
									
			<description>Description:&lt;br/&gt;Castle Defenders combines the strategy elements of chess with a spell system like Magic: the Gathering&amp;trade;. It was inspired by the brilliant video game Hero Academy&amp;trade; for iOS and contains similar gameplay mechanics. The combat system has been simplified to better fit the physical board game format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal:&lt;br/&gt;Players send units to attack enemy castles and defend their own. You win by destroying all enemy castles OR units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: &lt;br/&gt;-The game board resembles a rectangular chess board. Players agree on a layout and arrange their castles and bonus tiles (extra attack, shields, or bonus castle damage).&lt;br/&gt;-Players maintain a 6-card hand from their personal deck containing units (mage, healer, knight, etc.), spells, and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;-On their turn, players choose 5 actions to perform (cast a spell, move a unit, attack, heal, etc...).&lt;br/&gt;-Part of the game is trying out different moves to find the best plan, so you decide when your move is final.&lt;br/&gt;-Players receive bonus spell cards when two of their units are destroyed (this balances gameplay and allows you to counter an opponent's momentum).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy elements:&lt;br/&gt;-Units have strengths/weaknesses and must work as a team.&lt;br/&gt;-Formations help reinforce attack/defense effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;-Board location and unit placement is key (e.g. &amp;quot;Is my Knight far enough away to avoid being knocked out?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is my Archer close enough to knock out the enemy Healer?&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;-Unit trading: killing enemy units can leave yours exposed...is it worth the risk?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
