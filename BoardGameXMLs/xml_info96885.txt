			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Cloaks and Daggers is role-playing game where the characters take the roles of spies in a spy organization. The players are let loose in a large GR (game runner) made world where they go do anything they want. If the players are at a loss about what to do, then the GR gives them an &amp;ldquo;involving event&amp;rdquo; to get things going again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players give their characters an &amp;ldquo;advantage&amp;rdquo; which is like a class in other role-playing games. They pick from the categories like talent, trait, and possession and then give themselves powers with it. i.e. a 5% chance to make someone believe them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is handled like this. Characters declare their action, which have a time to complete in seconds. The GR counts off each second and finished actions happen at the end of the seconds. They can pick from a list of actions or use their own. Combat is not intended to be a major part of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A section on spy equipment and tactics is provided to give the players some sense of what they could do as spies. Without it, they would not know what to do more than a normal person off the street would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoy this role-playing game as much as I have enjoyed making it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
