							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Ketchup Vampire Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A cardgame based on an animated TV-series called &amp;quot;Die Ketchup-Vampire&amp;quot;. Game includes 56 playing Cards and is similiar to an old german traditional cardgame called Mau-Mau that is close to the wellknown UNO.&lt;br/&gt; Players will start with 6 cards each and play one card each turn following suit or color. About half of the cards have wellknown rules like &amp;quot;draw 1 or 2 cards&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lose turn&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;choose color&amp;quot;, but also special rules like &amp;quot;guess card under the magic book card played&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;stop play and play card no matter whose turn it is&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when one player has played all his cards. Cards still in hand will score negative points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
