							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In Search of Dr. Riptide</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Search of Dr. Riptide is about a quest to halt a greedy scientist in his plan to transform all sea creatures into canned tuna food products using his newly-made &amp;quot;Tuna-Matic.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a submarine that has limited shields and air, but is also equipped with a smaller vessle called JASON.  The smaller submarine can fit into smaller gaps in the oceanic terrain, but runs out of power if it is apart from the larger sub for too long.&lt;br/&gt;One must balance the need to conserve air with caution in taking on too much damage in order to save Earth's sea life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
