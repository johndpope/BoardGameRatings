			<description>The fast &amp;amp; crazy game of triangle cards! Green means go, but watch out for the reset cards or you lose a turn! To win, you've got to be the first to get rid of your cards by being strategic and getting others to reset before they can place a card. Triangle cards emphasize where you can play your cards. Sometimes in your favor and others not. The corners of the triangles point to the areas of the playmat you can use. Includes 105 triangle cards of multiple colors and printed playing mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
