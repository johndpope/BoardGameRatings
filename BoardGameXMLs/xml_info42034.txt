							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vanavaas: The Adventures in the Forest</name>
									
			<description>In the Indian epic, the Ramayana, Dasharatha, Rama's father is forced by an old promise to send Rama, his eldest son away to the forest for fourteen years. This is a game conceived by Kreeda, and follows the footsteps of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita through the forest. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. In the forest they have many adventures and face many hardships. Vanavaas - The Adventures in the Forest lets you understand their experiences and brings you face to face with the demons they meet in the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the footsteps are pictured as sandals or padukas - the old and traditional footwear worn by forest dwellers and rishis. The game is played with long dice which are the traditional dice in India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game begins with Rama and Lakshmana leaving Ayodhya and follows their adventures in the forest. The game takes you through the stay at Chitrakoot, Bharata&amp;rsquo;s encounter with Rama, the meeting with Shoorpanaka and the incident of the golden deer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to introduce the characters of the epic to children in a fun package which is easily absorbed and retained. It is suitable for children over five with some adult guidance. Now available with paduka shaped coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
