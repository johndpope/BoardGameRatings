							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bloody Blades of Ares</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bloody Blade of Ares is a much sought after weapon of legendary power. Tales tell of the many bearers of the swords over the eons, known as the Sons of Ares, being changed through use of the bloody blades. They are known as paragons of violence and prowess in battle. There are no known records of any Son of Ares being slain while he was in possession of one the swords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blades are also said to unlock the Pillar of Eris, goddess of discord, and release her from her confinement at the hands of the Dragon Ascendant and the other gods of light. The Pillars are the abodes of the gods. Refuge and sanctuary, the Pillars dominate the surrounding countryside and marks the center of the god's power. Far round the Crystal Sphere the lands of Ares are locked in an eternal war with the gods of light. Darkness, bloodshed and fire mark and define the lands of Ares. Thousands of years ago the Blades of Ares began cropping up in the numerous battles surrounding those lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF gives you the history, stats and powers for the Bloody Blades of Ares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also get the monster template for the Makhai, foot-soldiers for the Sons of Ares, wielders of the Bloody Blades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
