			<description>Become a great commander from history and shape destiny!&lt;br/&gt;Taking an army of model soldiers, you can recreate a famous battle, or enjoy a relaxing game with friends across the tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War and Conquest is an exciting and dynamic tabletop miniatures battle game.  Each player commands an army of soldiers through movement and combat phases.  The rules cover movement, shooting, charges and combats, morale, and more.  Each player fields an army constructed from free army lists utilizing a points system to arrive at historical and competitive army compositions.  Players collect and paint historical armies based on the free army lists. Combat is resolved by a single dice roll for each figure, creating a fast and streamlined system that simultaneously does not compromise on detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War and Conquest features randomized initiative rolls for more dynamic battles and introduces a mechanic called &amp;quot;Strategy Intervention Points&amp;quot; which allow the player to influence morale, initiative, and even terrain placement to turn the tide of battle in their favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
