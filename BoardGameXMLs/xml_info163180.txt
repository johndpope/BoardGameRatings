			<description>A game for a solo or multiple players to use actual physics to land the Lunar Exploration Module (LEM) on the Sun, planet, or Earth's moon.  Note:  Pluto is not not one of planets to land on, so maybe back in 1980, Dr. Cleaver recognized then that it wasn't really a planet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a double-sided 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper, folded in a manilla envelope) and players have to provide a set of 10 coins, for each player, with each player having a different denomination.  The charts on the back include altitude, velocity, and fuel expenditure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player a)burns fuel, b) calculates velocity, and c) calculate altitude.  When the velocity and altitude are both zero, the astronaut landed.  If velocity takes the craft to an altitude less than zero, the player crashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solo player determines success by comparing fuel expenditure value to three category ranges:  good, fair, or rotten. In multi-player, use the least amount of fuel to land without crashing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
