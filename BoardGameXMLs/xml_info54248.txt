			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Philip Reed's vs. Monsters is a fast-playing horror roleplaying game that provides everything you need for fun, frightening adventures in a single product. For those of you that like to expand your games the Rewards Deck will significantly vary the outcome of your combats and game sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 6-page PDF, designed by Philip Reed, is a printable &amp;quot;rewards deck&amp;quot; -- 36 cards that players may gain access to at the end of each game session. The cards in the deck provide bonuses to combat, give players the opportunity to affect the game's storyline, and put the power of creative roleplaying directly in the hands of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this supplement you will need to print four of the six pages of the PDF on cardstock. A card back design is included though not necessary. The rules to use this deck in play takes less than a page and are easy enough to remember that the rules don't even need to be printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
