							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fancy Meals</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Spaces: Fancy Meals offers a collection of four tables to offer inspiration to describe a fancy meal. You can get hints to help you decide who&amp;rsquo;s cooking, what&amp;rsquo;s cooking, how it tastes, the list of ingredients, and more&amp;hellip; It starts by determining which sense you use for the description, then deciding what element you&amp;rsquo;re describing and gaining some sensory detail about that element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re describing a meal, let&amp;rsquo;s start with Smell. If we get Bowl as the element and Bitter as the descriptor&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A bowl of some brown, viscous liquid appears before you with a splash and a spoon. The first thing you notice is the smell. Something bitter may have died in the stew pot tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or perhaps you rolled Taste (sense), Appetizer (element), Mystery Meat (food), and Candied (descriptor)&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Though you have no clue what kind of meat is on your plate, it looks well-prepared and sweetened with a bit of candied fruit. As you taste a forkful of the stuff, you wonder if you might not have wasted your evening as you thought when you walked in the door.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of possible combinations will inspire an insane number of food-related encounters and culinary delights (or disasters). Your players may in fact wonder if you&amp;rsquo;re a master chef or just the ogre in the kitchen butchering the night&amp;rsquo;s meal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
