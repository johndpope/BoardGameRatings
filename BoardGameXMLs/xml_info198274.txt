			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you sad? Do you have no friends? Perhaps your partner left you because you have no sense of humour. Maybe no one comes to your parties because, quite frankly, they are incredibly boring. Are you a loner? Are you finding it difficult to impress someone with your pathetic attempt at trying to be funny? Are you relying on the old &amp;quot;knock Knock&amp;quot; jokes. Lord have mercy! Well don't worry boring person... Help is here! BLANKR is an awkwardly hilarious card game that will get the whole party roaring with laughter. When you see people trying to escape through windows to flee boredom, just pull out BLANKR and see those lips smile again. Bringing a new twist to the 'complete the sentence' game, Blankr encourages players to think and write down the most awkward and ridiculously funny sentences. The rules are simple, one player reads out a Blankr sentence containing a blank and the others think of a word or phrase to fill in the blank. At the end of each round all the answers are read out aloud and the funniest answer wins a point (actually lets make that 3,873,093 points). Don't worry if you're low on wit and/or lack a sense of humour as the references cards contain over 330+ weird and wonderful ideas to get your brain juices flowing. See your friends and family curl their toes and chuckle as they read out the answers. Perfect-size travel box to put into your bag or back-pocket. Perfect for girls night, boys night, girls and boys night, university game, ice breakers, drinking game etc.. Get yours now! Get some friends! Everyone is enjoying it, about time you did too. BLANKR: An Awkwardly Hilarious Card Game for ★★★★★ ****************************** A great and hilarious game!!!!! **********************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
