			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT IS IT?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santimanitay: Race to the Stage, is an action-packed board game based around Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. Two to eight players compete to reach their ultimate goal - The Stage. The path to their ultimate goal is filled with challenges; players must avoid Hard Luck spaces, get past Midnight Robbers, take advantage of Warrahoon cards AND display their knowledge of Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. As unpredictable as it is enjoyable, Santimanitay is a must have for anyone interested in Carnival, board games or just having fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO&amp;rsquo;S IT FOR?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santimanitay was conceptualized as a game that captures the spirit and fun of Trinidad and Tobago while preserving important aspects of our history and culture. The game is designed for 2 to 8 players, making it suitable for any situation or occasion, from a quite evening at home to the highlight of a Friday night lime. The ability to choose characters with different attributes can give an advantage to those who may not be as familiar with Trinidad and Tobago&amp;rsquo;s culture and history, making Santimanitay universally enjoyable. From age 8 to 80, choose a character and start the race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHY DO IT?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Known as the greatest show on earth, Trinidad and Tobago Carnival is a festival of beauty, colour, and pageantry. All aspects of Carnival have a rich and storied history; music, costuming, performance. As well-known as the festival may be, not many people know in what year the first Panorama was held, or who was the first winner of the International Soca Monarch competition, or even when the Canboulay Riots occurred in Port of Spain. Santimanitay was developed to help share and preserve this knowledge through engaging game play, memorable characters and challenging questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
