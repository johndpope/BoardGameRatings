							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Port Singapore</name>
									
			<description>In Port Singapore you are paid by the load.  So your team of grunts better work hard for you. But making money should not be too hard, this is the busiest port in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Port Singapore board is divided into bays. Next to the board lie the ships that need to be loaded. Each ship has a hold that needs to line up with one of your bays before you can get your grunts to load the goods (barrels).  Along the back of the board is a track on which 4 action cubes sit.  On your turn you pick up one of the cubes, do the action, then slide all the cubes forward putting your cube at the end.  Cubes usually have a cost involved in choosing them, but they get cheaper the farther they move down from the top of the track.  The actions on the faces vary from cube to cube, you may only take the action shown on the top face of the cube when you choose it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cubes contain actions like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Heave ho.  Pull a ship along the wharf or send full ships off and get new ships to load. Good for annoying players who may be about to load or bringing a ship to your warehouse bay.&lt;br/&gt;    Union meeting.  Shuffle you grunts around the wharf and roll one of the action cubes for a random result. &lt;br/&gt;    Do business.  This gets goods in your ware house to load or lets you hire grunts to do your loading.&lt;br/&gt;    Load a ship. Move one load per grunt into a ship's hold opposite to your warehouses.&lt;br/&gt;    Take a bribe.  Helps you get things done.&lt;br/&gt;    The Payoff.  Pay one of your opponent's grunts to simply go home for the day.&lt;br/&gt;    Brawl.  Cause a ruckus in the bay next to one of your bays, good for disrupting opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the barrels in the supply run low (depending on the number of players).  The player who has made the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
