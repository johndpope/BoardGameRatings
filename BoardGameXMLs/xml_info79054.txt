							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Smuggler&#039;s Run</name>
									
			<description>Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and prohibition, the thirties were a age of adventure and self-indulgence. It was inevitable that the Unseen would be drawn to this time. And where the unbidden travels, will not a circle soon follow?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smuggler's Run is an adventure designed for use with The Whispering Vault role-playing game. It is also recommended that the gamemaster have access to Dangerous Prey, as this adventure makes use of creatures from that book. It is not necessary to have Dangerous Prey, though some of the shadows may have to be adjusted, but The Whispering Vault book is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 page PDF in portrait format. Written by Andrew J. Lucas. Illustrated by Christopher Shy. This adventure was originally published in Adventures Unlimited #2 (Summer 1995).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
