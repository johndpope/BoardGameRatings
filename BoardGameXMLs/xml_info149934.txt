							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">32 Suspects</name>
									
			<description>Quoted from the rulebook: Policemen have to catch a disguised thief. Whoever wins the largest number of medals becomes the best policeman. Policemen can jointly investigate in catching a thief and they can win and share more medals,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round one player is the thief and the other players are the policemen. The thief draws one thief card (from 32) and the policemen have to find out that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, the policeman turn over 4 cards from the suspect deck, which consists of the same cards as in the thief deck. Then they ask a closed question (yes/no) about a feature of the thief, like baldness, wearing a beard, wearing glasses, having a red jacket etc., which the thief has to answer. After that, the thief is allowed to turn over one face-up card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After six questions the remaining cards are turned face up. Now the policemen have to point to the suspect, they think suspect being the thief. If all policemen guess correctly, they get a number of medals that is printed on the thief card. If they point to different suspects, only the correct guessing policemen gain 1 medal. If all policemen fail with their guesses, they all lose one medal.&lt;br/&gt; The game ends when each player was the thief once. The player with the most medals wins. Ties are possible...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
