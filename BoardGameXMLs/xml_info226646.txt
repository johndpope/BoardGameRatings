							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice of Our Lives</name>
									
			<description>A Soap Opera themed board game where players interact with twelve characters (cast members) throughout the game. The players play themselves and all also considered cast members of the drama taking place in the town of Fine Valley.  The goal of the game is to reach the Laun-Dramatic and disclose the 'ugly truth' of all the players.  This is done by separating the truth from the 'vicious gossip' given by the twelve characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Clue, players must roll the dice to move their token towards places of their choosing.  Once at a location, the player interacts with a character to get them to disclose a rumor about one of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
