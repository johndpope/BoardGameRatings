							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Railway Rivals Map AUS: Austria</name>
									
			<description>A map for use with the Railway Rivals game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers Austria with connections to surrounding countries. The map is very hilly and is for 3 or 4 players only, preferably experienced ones. There are 2 in 7 special runs to neighbouring countries, and some routes into neighbouring countries may be built by players, or assumed to exist and be usable for racing on. This was a relatively late stand-alone map, which was not released in the large (approx A2) size, but just as an A3 black and white map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
