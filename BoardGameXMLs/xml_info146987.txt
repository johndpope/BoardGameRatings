			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil Mothership, lurking in deep space, is preparing to take over your beloved planet. She has launched an all-out attack. Waves of drone fighters come tearing down the Zarway like crazed lemmings. You and you Starfighter must dodge the drone fighters, destroy them, and then attack the Mothership. But watch out! She's got laser cannons too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mothership is an early game for the ZX81 with surprisingly deep gameplay. As well as moving your ship left and right to avoid and shoot at enemy craft, you can also move up and down in height. You have to be at the same altitude as enemies to shoot at them or for them to hit your ship. Shooting aliens at a higher altitude scores more points, but flying at a higher altitude also makes your craft move faster, making the game more challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a selection of three levels. In the first, enemies try to crash into your ship, but do not shoot, in the second, they do not crash into you, but can shoot, in the third, enemies both attempt to crash into you and shoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Andrew Laity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
