			<description>Who's Eating Who is designed for upper elementary students who are interested in food webs and the creatures of the Antarctic Marine, Australian Grassland, and African savannah habitats. The game would be played following study of the roles of organisms in the food webs of the habitats above. The game would be played in the classroom as a means of guided learning or at home as independent practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who's Eating Who can be played two ways. The standard version of the game allows players the choice to play within the contexts of three different habitats. Both versions of the game mirror the complexity and variability of actual food webs, and could be played a limitless number of times with no two games ever being the same. However, it is only the content of the game that is complex; the rules of Who's Eating Who are quite simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 1: Who's Eating Who&lt;br/&gt;To create or add to food web links which are worth the most points. The winner is the player with the highest score when all Organism Cards have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 2: Food Web Trains&lt;br/&gt;To make accurate groups of Organism Cards by habitat and/or role (carnivore, omnivore, herbivore, producer, decomposer). The player who uses all his/her Organism Cards first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;    *  Game board&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 set of Antarctic Marine Organism Cards&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 set of Australian Grasslands Organism Cards&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 set of African Grasslands Organism Cards&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 Antarctic Marine Food Web Card&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 Australian Grasslands Food Web Card&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 African Grasslands Food Web Card&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 Organism classification card&lt;br/&gt;    * 4 card racks&lt;br/&gt;    * 4 wooden cubes&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 card tub&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 die&lt;br/&gt;    * Scoresheet&lt;br/&gt;    * Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
