							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hannah Montana DVD Game</name>
									
			<description>From Amazon.com's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Disney Channel's teen pop sensation Hannah Montana stars in this multi-activity DVD game. Players compete to be the first to make it to the stage and &amp;quot;rock out the show&amp;quot; just like their favorite singer. Along the way, they must earn tokens by winning challenges, which include singing the lyrics to Hannah's songs, posing for the paparazzi, guessing Hannah's fashion sense, and answering questions about the show. The winner will be rewarded with her own karaoke-style spotlight performance. DVD bonus materials include a virtual version of Hannah Montana's Magic 8 Ball. Includes DVD, 3-D game board, die, four movers and 20 tokens.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
