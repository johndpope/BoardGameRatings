			<description>The players have an upright 4 x 4 grid between them, into which dice can be placed so they can be seen from both sides. A number of letter dice are rolled and a timer is started. Players now take turns putting a die into the grid, trying to fill it in a way that words appear on their side. This should be done as fast as possible, as the game is timed. When all dice have been placed, the remaining time starts running for both players. They now have some time to note down as many words as possible that are contained in their grid. If a player thinks s/he has found all possible words, s/he can end his/her turn early for bonus points. Each word counts the number of letters used. The player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
