							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caravanserei</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This caravanserei is a welcome sight to the eyes of many travelers and traders. Built along an important trade route it sees a lot of guests and is built to accommodate them. The caravanserei itself is the large three story building behind the small well of the oasis. The sturdy mud brick building has no windows on the ground floor and its gate is made from sturdy beams. Add the retaining wall built around the oasis and the caravanserei offers a reasonable amount of protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caravanserei is not the only building though. A few other one or two story buildings are grouped around the well within the wall and some tents have sprung up in between them as the caravanserei has become home to more and more people. The buildings have all been constructed with roof access to allow defenders to hold the high ground and defend each building on its own in the unlikely case that the wall should be breached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
