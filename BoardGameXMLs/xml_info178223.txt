							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypts &amp; Creatures Campaign Adventure: Good Deeds</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the Adventure Begin!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Good Deeds. This is a campaign adventure designed for four to five characters at level 1-2, whose total combined levels should be between four and eight. A dedicated healer is essential for this adventure. The difference between this book and the Dungeon Adventures series is that this is a narrated campaign story. Good Deeds was specifically designed for use with the Shaleria Campaign Setting book. The majority of this story takes place in the Crescent Lands, near Tregaron, Corinthea. After being hired to deliver a copy of the new Living Contract between Ni'Deera and Corinthea, the players find themselves caught in a deadly political game involving two counties, a quest, and a spider cult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
