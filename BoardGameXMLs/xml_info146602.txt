							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcane Duels</name>
									
			<description>In Arcane Duels the players are wizards fighting each other using their spells while at the same time they try to complete an arcane ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 2 actions per turn to gather energy, cast spells and complete one part of the ritual, then the next player takes his turn. The game goes on until all but one wizards are eliminated from the game (by reducing their hitpoints to zero) or until one ritual has been completed (in this case the player who contributed the most to all the rituals in play wins the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catch of this game is that each wizard with all his abilities and spells is represented by a single card which will be rotated after each time that wizards has used a spell, giving him/her new options for his next action(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
