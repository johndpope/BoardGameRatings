			<description>This is a math based card game.   The object of the game is to play eight cards, each with a larger number, in a sequence.  There are eight different sequences each starting from a number between one and eight.  The sequence is basically the multiplication table.  For example, the second number in the sequence that starts with 5 is 10 and the third number in that sequence is 15.  You do not have to stay in the same sequence. If you have played a 10, you can proceed with a 12 or 15.  The cards helpfully show which cards they can be played on and which cards can be played on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of up to four players is dealt three cards.  On each turn they can draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.  They then either place a card in their sequence or discard.  There are eight cards when played cause player to exchange hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is done by adding up all the points played by the player who completes his sequence of eight cards.  All the other players add up their cards played and subtract the points for cards still held in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
