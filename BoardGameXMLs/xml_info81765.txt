			<description>From the in-game info screen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time in a dowdy chemist's shop, there lived a lonely old chemist named Cyril.  If you were to go inside his shop, you would see many shelves laden with bottles, boxes, pills and potions.  Disaster struck one night when poor old Cyril carelessly swallowed a powerful reducing agent.  Please help our shrunken chemist to recover by collecting his pills and reaching the magic elixir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEWARE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little people have big problems!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a non-scrolling platform game - leaving one screen will take you straight into the next one.  It is pretty tricky, with things that will kill you outright appearing onscreen with little notice to avoid them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
