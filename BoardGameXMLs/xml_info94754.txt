							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Azakhar</name>
									
			<description>From deity &amp;quot;Description:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dark god Azakhar is described as a towering, muscular warrior clad in blood-spattered black plate armor and wielding a barbed greataxe. Chains run from his belt to collars around the necks of distraught slaves, and his face is concealed by a full plate helm ; it is said that the face of &amp;ldquo;True Fear&amp;rdquo; is concealed behind the helm &amp;rsquo;s visor. Azakhar is the embodiment of fear, tyranny, and oppression. He is the god of war for the sake of conquest, and his clerics &amp;ndash; the Bloodknights - serve his will by spreading evil and fear, abducting and selling slaves, and waging war throughout Ryh&amp;rsquo;ardha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Infernal Emperor resides in a large castle in the center of Dis. This citadel is known as Acherus and is similar in appearance to Azakhar&amp;rsquo;s earthly temples, though multiplied a thousandfold. Acherus is home to countless devils, fiendish mercenaries, and spirits of those who died in Azakhar&amp;rsquo;s service, and the unfortunate creatures who have been captured and enslaved to serve them and their unholy master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
