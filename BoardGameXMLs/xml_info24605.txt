			<description>Teddy Bear and Friends, 100 years after the creation of the first Teddy Bear comes a new game from Shannon Boardgames that celebrates their favorite pastime, picnics! The object of the game is to try and collect the perfect picnic. Beware though as you must always keep your eye on your hamper as other Players attempt to steal your collection. &amp;quot;Teddy Bear and Friends&amp;quot; is a game that will delight both children and adults alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
