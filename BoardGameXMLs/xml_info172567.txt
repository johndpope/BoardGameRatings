			<description>Sent to backers of the 2015 Kickstarter campaign for Quartermaster General: Air Marshal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details on this card:&lt;br/&gt;Can be used immediately after the players draw their cards at the beginning of the game, before discarding any cards to form the opening hand. If a country from each team agrees, both of those countries may immediately shuffle the cards drawn back into their decks and draw again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quote about this card by the games designer Ian Brody:&lt;br/&gt;Maybe this should &amp;quot;simulate&amp;quot; something like the German/Soviet treaty, or the Soviet/Japanese treaty, but I felt like I loved the iconic imagery of the three leaders, Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt sitting at Yalta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
