			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've made it to the campgrounds on Madman Island! The trip was no picnic, with the driving rains and howling winds making everyone miserable. The boat rocked in the swift river. The moon provided little light - with gray clouds obscuring it and making the whole scene even more gloomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then there was that crazy old man from the village on the other side of the river. He kept saying &amp;quot;Turn back before it's too late! That island has a death curse. The madman will get you all!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, at Emi's urging, you all continued on your camping trip. Now that you're here, you know there's no turning back. The boatman who dropped you off said there could be no way for him to return until tomorrow - at the earliest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you quickly ran to the cabins, and entered the large communal building. Kira and Yukio built a large fire, and you began cooking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the smell of succulent roasting meat and delicately boiled potatoes reaching your nostrils - and the warmth of the fire drying your clothes - your spirits are lifted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you begin to relax, a flash of lightning illuminates your surroundings. A thunderous crash quickly follows, and your cabin shakes violently. Clumps of dirt, splinters of wood, and shards of stone fly everywhere. A blast of chill air strikes you, and you notice water pouring in where the chimney and fireplace used to be. The torrents of water put out the fire, and your cabin plunges into darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 27-page DOC scenario is distributed with two BMP (map) files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
