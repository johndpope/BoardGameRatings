			<description>A 1920s scenario for Call of Cthulhu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this scenario, set in Europe in 1928, the investigators travel between England and Crete, receiving a newspaper article along with a small note from their honoured friend William Tanislow. William, an English curator, has been recently commissioned to work alongside the famous biologist Dr. Harold Bantry. The photograph accompanying the article is dated late April 1928 and is of William smartly dressed and smiling. He is shaking hands with a portly gentleman who sports a finely shaped moustache. A striking feature of the photograph is a beautifully shaped necklace, the Stone of Concordance, hanging around Williams&amp;rsquo;s companion&amp;rsquo;s neck. The gentleman is the friendly British Foreign Minister Wilfred Forbes. After recently pushing the British government hard for William to receive the commission of working alongside Dr Bantry, the photograph of the pair shows his gratification at the outcome. Unknown to him and his only daughter Valerie, at the time of the photograph he is but ten days away from a most gruesome death.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
