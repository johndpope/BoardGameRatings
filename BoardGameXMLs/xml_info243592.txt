			<description>Spring, a game of flowers and growing gardens, is a 18 cards microgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Spring each player takes turn placing a card on other previously played cards. Each card shows four groups of flowers and, in order to play it, you should place it overlapping other cards in play, parallel to them, never perpendicular, and covering at least one symbol that do need to match the one(s) on your card. The goal is being the player with the largest garden (area of orthogonally connected groups of flowers) at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
