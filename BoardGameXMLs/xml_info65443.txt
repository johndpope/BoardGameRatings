							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Control: The Game of Absolute Power</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare for a unique role-playing experience. In Control, players take on the roles of men and women investigating a world-spanning conspiracy. Characters can be created in less than five minutes, using an exciting system of &amp;quot;qualities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gamemaster (or Controller) can create any conspiracy he can imagine with Control&amp;rsquo;s build system - from ancient supernatural forces playing their games on the world stage, to corrupt politicians manipulating the stock market, to alien cover-ups and abductions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the most unusual feature is the ability of the players to not only investigate and infiltrate, but to take over! When a player character becomes powerful enough, they can challenge the Controller for dominance of the game, thereby becoming the gamemaster themselves. It is an unprecedented game of RPG king-of-the-hill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control is a stand-alone game with no other books needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s All About Control: &lt;br/&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s Got It, &lt;br/&gt;Who Wants It, &lt;br/&gt;And Who Will You Kill For It.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
