							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk</name>
									
			<description>As of 2006, this game is produced in Seattle, Washington and sold in the souvenir shop at the nearby Museum of Flight. Players are assigned the roles of Wilbur and Orville Wright, each moving along their own separate track of 38 spaces. Movement is handled by flipping a coin, moving one or two spaces forward depending on the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each track is peppered with trivia questions about the Wright brothers, which move the player an additional space forward if answered correctly. The first player to reach the end of their track is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is printed on the back of a large sheet of card stock, which is folded into a simple, 6-page book about the Wright Brothers, providing the basis for the game's trivia questions. Also included are two folded cards, one for each of the players, which contain the answers' to the opposite player's trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
