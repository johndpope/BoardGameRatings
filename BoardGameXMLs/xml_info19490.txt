			<description>The Holograms are excited about flying to Paris to make their very first music video.  But their rivals, The Misfits, have mixed up all the fashions Jem, Kimber, Shana, and Aja have picked out for their trip!  The situation seems hopeless- but you can help the Holograms by finding and packing their mixed-up clothes in time to catch their plane.  It will take a good memory and some truly outrageous moves.  The first player to do it wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
