			<description>Long, long ago, there was a world in which mages and humans existed in harmony. Deep contrasts in their two cultures, however, caused differences that could not be overcome between the two races. The humans feared the great power of the mages, and hunted them, trying to erase their kind from the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despairing, the mages sought refuge, and God, feeling pity for their plight, created a world of magic for them, which they could go to in exile. In this way the mages faded from the Earth, and all contact between the two peoples ceased. Each continued on their own paths, the humans that of civilization, and mages that of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few hundred years have passed since that time... The mages are hopeful that, once again, their races can live in harmony. In the hope of finding a way to bridge their differences, the mages send out their young acolytes for training in the world of the humans. If the younger generations of the two peoples can find a way of connecting, perhaps the acolytes could gain important knowledge, and bring it home with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year three young wizards will cross over into the world of humans... Two of them are elite, and one a total drop out. Can they reunite the two peoples?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
