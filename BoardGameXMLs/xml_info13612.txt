			<description>The expansion kit for Turning Point: Stalingrad was simply a set of 216 counters (96 3/4&amp;quot; and 120 1/2&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion generated controversy because the rules for it were printed in the rulebook that came with the base game, leading some consumers to claim that part of the game was &amp;quot;left out&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A seemingly common misunderstanding is the assumption that this extension enables players to play until the end of the battle; as a matter of fact, this expansion does not even reach the date the Soviet counter offensive started historically: The extended game ends November 14 (as opposed to October 3 in the base game), which is roughly a week before the Soviets began their offensive to encircle the German 6th army at Stalingrad. In other words, the extension covers more, but still not all of the German offensive part of the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
