			<description>Once upon a time a good and virtuous girl found her prince charming and lived happily ever after. Good bedtime story. But life isn&amp;rsquo;t a fairy tale, and what parents have told us often goes beyond the truth. Heroes of fairytales had to fight for their rights, often in a brutal way ... and they did not always win. Welcome to the grim world, where a road lined with dead bodies of enemies leads to a happy ending!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to defeat the opponent's character. At the beginning of the game each player chooses 6 characters. They&amp;rsquo;re also preparing five energy points. The randomly selected first player begins the first round with one energy point less. The first player chooses and puts one character in the front line on the table. Then Second player put His first character in front of that character and second character in the back line, right behind his first character. The first player selects the next two characters, places one to the back line behind the already placed character, and the second to the front line on any side of already placed cards. We repeat the process until each player has six characters in the battlefield, three in the front, and three in the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take one action in turn. They pay energy points for the action. The action includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Character activation;&lt;br/&gt;     Movement of the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player pays one energy point for activating the character. Activation includes both attack and the use of character special skills. If a player wants to activate a tired character, he can do it, but for activating a tired character, the player pays two energy points. Player can&amp;rsquo;t activate a tired character if any of his character is still ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts until one of the players defeats all opponents&amp;rsquo; characters. If all opponents&amp;rsquo; characters have been defeated, we do not consider any effects of cards activated after the end of the round, for example resurrection. Of course, the winner is the player whose characters survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
