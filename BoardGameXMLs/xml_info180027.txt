Middle Empire is a strategy board game that can be learned in 15 minutes and play a full game in 30 minutes.  Middle Empire provides engaging and dynamic game play in every game, fun for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Middle Empire is an easy to learn, quick playing strategy board game where players compete to obtain the winning number of empires through construction, defense, and attack cards.  Players can construct their own strongholds on new spaces and upgrade them to empires or attack other players to obtain more strongholds.  From your construction cards, you decide where to place a stronghold on the board or to upgrade to an empire.  Strategically time the picking and playing of construction, defense, and attack cards!
