							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Notre Dame Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>Players must obtain six different colored headquarters chips by correctly answering trivia questions about the University of Notre Dame.  Question order is determined based on where a player lands on the board using a die roll. Once all six chips have been obtained, the player moves to a leprechaun space in the center of the board and answers a question in the category of their opponent's choosing.  Once this is answered correctly, the player must return to their start space and answer another question of the category that matches the start space color. If incorrect, the player loses that color chip and must move around the board to correctly answer a question of that category and retrieve the missing chip.  If correct, the game is won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
