			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Spaces: Spacecraft takes the Little Spaces series from the grounded worlds of fantasy, modern, and horror, and launches them into the future (near or far). Like with Burial Mounds, Fitz has changed up the format a bit to include a handful of tables and going away from the Senses, Descriptive Element, and Sense Descriptor methodology. In Spacecraft you get six separate tables helping you determine what your spaceship might look like - everything from a small probe in deep space to a huge freighter, passenger ship, or military vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the craft itself, the tables include: size, state, population, crew status, mission and destination. This collection of tables offers a wide array of options for determining who may be resident on the space ship your PCs are exploring. Roll a few dice and see who answers the door when the characters knock on the airlock!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an example, let's say the PCs are out in space exploring and come across a vessel not traveling the usual trade routes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;(Medium/In Stasis/10/Science/Wounded/Open Space)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergency beacon was the only thing that caught our attention. The ship was far outside the usual trade lanes between Alpha and Betaverse. Not unusual for folks to get off course and find themselves in some trouble, but we weren&amp;rsquo;t usually the ones to reach out and offer help. Captain decided to change course and see what he could do this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A whole lot of life signs on board got our attention. We could only tell they were in some sort of suspended animation. The manifest told us it was the ISS Trinity, a science vessel bound for the dying stars on the edge of the Betaverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We docked and a few of us went on board to see what we could figure out. Other than the emergency beacon, everything seemed in order. But something moved shortly after we opened the airlock. Something that didn&amp;rsquo;t show up on our scanners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever it was didn&amp;rsquo;t bug us, but we kept our eyes open. As we got to the stasis chamber, we noticed some thngs were more than a little out of whack. Every single crewmember was accounted for, but every sleep pod was covered in bloody handprints &amp;ndash; inside and out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time we told our ship what we&amp;rsquo;d found, it was too late and the alien had knocked off Pfc Harvey. We weren&amp;rsquo;t leaving the ship alive&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can hardly wait to see what the PCs decide to do to try and get out of this one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of possible combinations will inspire an insane number of adventurous encounters and hidden dangers. Use your imagination to come up with intriguing ships bound for destinations unknown for your next science fiction session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
