			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following scenario was written for UniCon 97, and re-written for Leprecon '98. It is set in the 1920's, in Ballaraat, a large town in north central Victoria.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;From the Melbourne Argus, November 3, 1924...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEIRESS MISSING POLICE FEAR KIDNAPPING&lt;br/&gt;Miss Victoria Hennesley, who disappeared last Saturday evening, is feared by police to be the victim of foul play.  Miss Hennesley was last seen leaving her family estate near Ballaraat on horseback during the early afternoon.  The alarm was not raised until quite late in the evening, as Miss Hennesley is known for her extended rides.  It was initially assumed that Miss Hennesley may have become waylaid due to the inclement weather.  However, after several days, it has become clear that any difficulties Miss Hennesley may have encountered could be more severe than a foundered horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario typically is distributed as a ZIP archive containing two RTF documents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        13-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;        5-page non-player-character details&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
