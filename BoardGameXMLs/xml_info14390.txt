			<description>In The Willem Wever Game, players look at photos and ask each other tough questions about various subjects like animals and plants, food and drink, geography, the human body and many more. All players have the chance to give the right answer. Of course, players also try to get in each others' way with pay cards. Who will make it to the finish first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the great success of The Willem Wever Game, there are now two supplementary versions for even more playing enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
