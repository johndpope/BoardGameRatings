			<description>From The Game Crafter's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;MERC is a complex strategy game where each player hires and controls a team of mercenaries. You may play against each other, or cooperatively against the evil dictator Koen, and you may play individually or as teams. Either way, the goal is the same, to take control of the war torn tropical island of Tenagra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenagra is a wealthy country full of industries. Taking control of those industries will finance your efforts. Along the way you'll pick up equipment and hire additional MERCs. You'll need to train guards to fortify and hold territory after you've taken it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 50 unique MERCs for you to hire, each with their own personalities, special abilities, skills, and weaknesses. The right combination of MERCs will lead you to victory, but you'll have to compete to hire them against the other players who are also drawing from the same talent pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MERCs would be nothing without their equipment. The game offers more than 40 different types of equipment. There are various types of weapons; everything from a simple 9mm handgun, all the way up to a shoulder mounted assault weapon (SMAW). There are various types of armor and accessories. And you can even get vehicles like tanks and helicopters to assist in your conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game of MERC is unique, because the map deck allows you to reconfigure the island of Tenagra so many ways. Plus, some times the best MERCs are killed in the first couple days on the island, so you have to fight your way to victory with their lesser counterparts. And don't forget that you can play as teams or individuals both in death-match and cooperatively. All of these variables ensure that you'll have endless amounts of fun playing MERC.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
