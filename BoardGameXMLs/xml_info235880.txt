			<description>Khymir is an adult RPG which deals with mature themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khymir the role-playing game takes place in the city of Khymir and its environs in the world of Thorgon Karrelssa. This is the world where Mark E. Rogers&amp;rsquo; books, &amp;quot;Zorachus&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Nightmare of God&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;Blood of the Lamb&amp;quot; series are set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thorgon Karrelssa is founded on a blend of: gritty fantasy, logic, philosophy, and theology. Thorgon Karrelssa has its own Satan, Tschonbog, and its own messiah, Esaju. The people of Thorgon Karrelssa are stronger and more exterous than their counterparts on Earth. They can also work magic, because &amp;quot;the Fall&amp;quot; occurred in the second generation. God is real and omnipresent in Thorgon Karrelssa, and Khymir reflects this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khymir uses dice rolls to resolve the outcome of uncertain situations in concert with GM judgment. The GM is the ultimate authority in determining the outcome of any action in the game. Characters have five basic aspects and six derived aspects. The five basic aspects are: physical, discipline, mental, charm, and favor. Physical, discipline, and mental are used to generate the derived aspects. The derived aspects are: brawn, endurance, resistance, logic, intelligence, and quickness. The aspects are used to generate talents. Talents are proclivities that a character has toward successfully performing a wide variety of related skills. For example, one talent is stealth. Included skills would be hide and sneak. Most actions are resolved using the skills. Raw skill totals are added with situational modifiers to produce potentials.  Potentials are pitted against challenges.  Challenges are the trials and obstacles facing the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An innovative gaming engine that encourages heroic action and lets the players determine how much risk they take to overcome each challenge&lt;br/&gt;     An extensive game mastering section suitable for use with any system based on the Origins &amp;quot;Classic GMing Seminar Series&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     A grimoire complete with gaming effects&lt;br/&gt;     A bestiary of monsters and demons&lt;br/&gt;     Sections on military formations and tactics&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed descriptions of geography&lt;br/&gt;     Maps&lt;br/&gt;     Dramatis Personae: mages, warriors, seductresses, and murdering madmen from the Zorachus series&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Based on a preview and authors' website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
