			<description>From the Publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;When Peter Parker, bitten by radioactive spider, he received a spider's relative speed, force and movement. He became Spider-Man. &lt;br/&gt;Such amazing talents like to hang the web and climb the walls, he used to fight against crime.&lt;br/&gt;Now Spider-Man is in danger of losing his power to his secret enemies. The radioactive spider has disappeared from his dark secret laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;Now all the Spider-Man disguised enemies are terrorizing the New York. They all are now more dangerous than ever, because now they hold the key to Spider-Mans power.&lt;br/&gt;The only way to cope with precarious situation and restore order to New York is to find the radioactive spider and take it to security, a secret laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;Your task is not easy, because all the players will try to find the missing spider. &lt;br/&gt;During the game you need to survive action events and traps, you also have to fight against other players.
