			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Skywire 2 sees a return to the amusement park gone wild from the original.  Once again, you must pilot your tram car along a fixed track by accelerating or decelerating it to avoid obstacles.  There are many new obstacles and enemy patterns, as well as new hazards like degrading track, that will attempt to stop you from getting your passengers to the end of the line.  Too many collisions with these dangerous animals and all your passengers will fall from your car, and you'll have to start the level over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the game includes a two player competitive mode where you can challenge a friend, using the same keyboard, to see who can complete the level faster and with the most passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
