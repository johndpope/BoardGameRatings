							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Runes of Power</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's our signature runic magic system, streamlined and easier to use than ever before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This magic system spawned the Runed Age, and therefore everything else that came afterwards. It's an amazing tool and now it's quicker to use and easier to grasp. The magic system in Runes of Power allows you to craft nearly any magical spell you can think of by giving you the tools needed to make your imaginations a reality. The slot based system means that you can swap magical runes in and out on the fly to create entirely new magical effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for using this magic as both drawn runic magic as well as the more traditional spoken incantations.&lt;br/&gt;    A full rune list showing how each rune works and how they interact with each other.&lt;br/&gt;    Sample runic spells to use in your games and use as references.&lt;br/&gt;    Cutout templates to draw your own runic magic on.&lt;br/&gt;    Character creation option for starting off a game as a runic spellcaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
