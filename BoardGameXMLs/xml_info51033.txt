			<description>This is the scenario &amp;quot;Tatterdemalion&amp;quot; from Chaosium's &amp;quot;Fatal Experiments&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated content description from the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;It start with with an invitation to an innocuous fancy-dress ball. But all too soon the happiness on this famous Berlin directors and stage writers party becomes a murderous farce. One guest after the other becomes a victim of a mysterious murderer. A inhuman terror follows, as the King in Yellow himself demands sacrifices. The only rescue might be to meet the King himself, but he doesn't reside in our world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was published 1992 by Laurin and later, and in 1995 by &amp;quot;Ars Ludi&amp;quot; in cooperation with Queen Games as a reprint. Ars Ludi didn't have a license though, so Chaosium forbid them to sell the already produced supplements. That was the end of this project, but it was many years later that the already produced books somehow started to appear on the market and got sold normally and unoffended by Chaosium in german RPG shops. &amp;quot;Narrenball&amp;quot; is one of these curiosities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
