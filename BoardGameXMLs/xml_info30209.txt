			<description>Danger Zones is a board game intended to teach children about safety.  Players roll the dice and move on a board to various colored spaces and attempt to answer corresponding questions.  The questions are directed at educating and testing children's knowledge on various safety issues such as water safety, strangers, bicycle/vehicle safety, etc.  When a player answers correctly, he receives a black velcro piece representing a jail bar that is affixed to the player's card.  When the player has accumulated sufficient jail bars to lock up &amp;quot;Wacko Weasel&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pud Possum&amp;quot; (pictured on the cards), he wins.  A player may also be sent to a &amp;quot;Danger Zone&amp;quot; space which requires the additional answering of a question or other penalizing action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has an interesting feature which allows children to play even when there is not an adult available--a cassette tape which has a voice reading questions and answers than can be used instead of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
