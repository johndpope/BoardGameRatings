			<description>A set of nine multi-purpose dice featuring Hello Kitty and friends.  Use the dice for learning activities or memory and story-telling games. Similar to Rory's Story Cubes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn a word:&lt;br/&gt;In this most basic play, players roll the dice and call out who or what they see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build a Sentence: &lt;br/&gt;On your turn roll any two dice and make up a sentence that uses both images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell a story: &lt;br/&gt;Roll all the dice. The youngest player takes any die and starts a story that uses the image on the die. Moving to the left, each player takes any remaining die and adds on to the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory: &lt;br/&gt;Roll all the dice. Players look at the face-up images for 20  &lt;br/&gt;seconds; the dice are then hidden from the players&amp;rsquo; view. Players call out the images they remember while the host tells whether they are correct or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past/Present/Future:&lt;br/&gt;For older kids &amp;ndash; players roll one or more dice and build a sentence using a variety of tenses.  &amp;ldquo;Hello Kitty scored a point playing soccer.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s sunny tomorrow, Hello Kitty will play soccer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;9 Story Telling Dice, &lt;br/&gt;Storage bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
