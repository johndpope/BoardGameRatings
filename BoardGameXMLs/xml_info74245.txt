			<description>This game has been designed with Nascar and Indy fans in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a huge 4-lane oval racing track (98&amp;quot; x 50&amp;quot;) that has been designed to fit 1:64 scale cars like NASCAR diecast, Hotwheels, Matchbox, etc. (cars are NOT included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It doubles as a great board game when played with dice (2 included in the shipping box). The rules of the game make it feel like a real Nascar race, with accidents, wrecks, a draft effect, turbo accelerations, yellow flag formations, and so on. It is a really exciting game and all my son's friends are now converted as well. Additionally the game has great educational value (kids learn how to add and multiply really fast with the dice) and offers a great fun factor with deserved wins and unlikely comebacks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 2 dice, up to 42 cars, and can be played by 1-15 players at the same time! Obviously, the mat can also be used as a support for imaginary races or any car game involving a racing track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mat is made of Vinyl and is weather resistant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
