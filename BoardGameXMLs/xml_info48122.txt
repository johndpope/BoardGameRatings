							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mirkwood: The Wilds of Rhovanion</name>
									
			<description>Cover/Jacket Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the Old Forest Road into the heart of Mirkwood and you'll find yourself in deep, dark woods once full of fish and game. How strangely quiet the woods are since Mordor cast its deathly pall across the land. Only the Giant Spiders seem content as they lie in their shadowy lairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bordered by the mighty Anduin River to the west and the Grey Mountains to the north, the wilderland includes rugged highlands like the Iron Hills and the ancient Mountains of Mirkwood, as well as famous waterways like the River Running and Long Lake. The Rhovanion plains east of the forest provide fertile farmland and pastures, but are threatened by tribes of Easterlings. Southern Mirkwood is already under the shadow. There, Dol Guldur, the Necromancer's mist enshrouded fortress, stands as the Dark Lord's outpost - from it emanates the stench of evil and blackness of death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirkwood is a wilderland as yet untamed by a dominant race or civilization. Here you'll find Thranduil's Wood-elves, rustic Wood men, the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, and the primitive Beornings, as well as many other sub-cultures of Northmen. Hardly hospitable, Mirkwood is a land where careless travellers often fall prey to Wargs, Trolls, Lesser Giants, and Giant Spiders. Adding to its ills, Smaug the Destroyer and his winged cousins have for centuries made their homes in the frozen wastes just to the north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These denizens warily await your arrival, so welcome to Mirkwood, Adventurer! May your sword be quick and your senses keen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIRKWOOD features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 giant 16&amp;quot; x 21&amp;quot; full-color maps detailing all of the Mirkwood region&lt;br/&gt;Full-color maps of Dol Guldur, Woodmen-town, and Buhr Ailgra&lt;br/&gt;Major B&amp;amp;W layouts of Dale, Esgaroth on Long Lake, Dol Guldur, Lair of the Seer, the Halls of the Elven-king, and Erebor, the Lonely Mountain&lt;br/&gt;Complete descriptions of the many races inhabiting the region&lt;br/&gt;Descriptions of Radagast, Sauron, and other famous figures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE 1: Most of the material in this product was previously published under the titles Northern MIRKWOOD (1983, 1984) and Southern MIRKWOOD (1983).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE 2: This product has been replaced by the 2nd Edition MIRKWOOD (1995) Realm module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
