							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roastmaster General</name>
									
			<description>A card game in which one player at a time is roasted. A Roastmaster reads a Personal Statement card and then all players/roasters use a single or combination of Response cards they have been dealt to fill in the blanks of the Personal Statement. The Response cards played to complete the Personal Statement should be tailored to fit the player being roasted on that turn. After each Roaster response is read, the players vote for which line they think is best, the new line or previous line. The Roaster with the last line standing at the end of the roast competes against the Roastee to win the hand. Play continues until the number of rounds chosen at the start of the game have been played. A round is complete when all players have had a turn being roasted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
