			<description>Shoulder of Orion is a fast paced starship boarding action game. Two players will construct a modular board that is unique from game to game.  One player takes the role of the attacking forces and other the defender.  Each takes turns exploring the board and coming into conflict with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a limited set of moves and military pieces they may use during the game. The attacking player is trying to win via the listed victory conditions before a set number of turns elapses.  The defender is trying to prevent this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn sequence is broken into three phases (Command, Movement, and Firefight) and each player completes his turn fully before it is passed to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules are provided which gives players access to a set of six fleet cards with unique abilities that will alter their play-style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoulder of Orion is part of a series of print and play boardgames published through Bell of Lost Souls.  This series is provided as a downloadable pdf which includes everything needed to play except dice.  Players may download, print out the pieces, and start playing.  The game is designed to be enhanced with common playing pieces found in other games for those would prefer to not use counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHOULDER OF ORION is available FREE at BoLS Board Games: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.bolsboardgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.bolsboardgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
