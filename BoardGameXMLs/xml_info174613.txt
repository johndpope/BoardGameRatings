			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like fairy tales, fantasy, horror and mythology? Then MYFAROG is the game for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play MYFAROG you only need this book, pencil and eraser, paper and somewhere to play. You also need at least three normal 6-sided dice. Finally you need a creative and inventive myth master (a game master) and at least one player. You have everything you need in this book to make your own adventures and campaigns, meaning you can play the game for as long as you like without further purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MYFAROG is a game where a myth master leads one or more players through a story. Each player takes the role of a made up individual, a player character, and to a large extent decides how the story shall go. The game is similar to child's play, where you dream and pretend and play in an imaginary reality, but MYFAROG gives this play structure and frames, via the myth master and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
