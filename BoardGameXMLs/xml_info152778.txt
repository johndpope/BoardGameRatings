			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. &amp;ndash; Winston Churchill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are those who fight wars and there are those who lead these warriors. Amora Game presents &amp;quot;Commander and Centurion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commander: Many train with arms and armor, some preferring to master one weapon, others picking wider selection of skills and talents. Then there are those who are put in charge of overseeing the battlefield. Commanders are dedicated to leading and directing assaults. Knowing that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, they coordinate and inspire allies to work together to strengthen that chain. A skilled commander can even turn the tide of battle, from near defeat into victory. They also learn how to handle situations beyond the battlefields, for a good commander tends to his men in times of peace as much as in times of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centurion: Most people fear the sounds of war drums in the night. For this sound foretells death and destruction, fields left to rot because there are not enough hands to bring in the harvest. But for a centurion this sound holds no fear. Men and women raised on the battlefield, capable of mastering the chaos that they name the fog of war. For this select few, the sound of the war drums is a calling that centurions cannot refuse. There duty is to take up arms to defend those that cannot defend themselves and to march proudly into that rolling thunder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes: 1 Commander base class, 1 Centurion prestige class, 5 feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
