			<description>Adult party game sure to add color and vulgarity to your next game night. Gameplay is as easy as A-B-C. One player poses a question using a Black Card, and the remaining players respond with their most amusing White Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Create the most unique, hilarious, and downright devilish combinations of black and white cards. Setup: Each player is dealt ten white cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: One player (the judge) flips over a black card. The remaining players place their most hilarious white card facedown in a pile. The judge reads the combinations aloud, and awards the black card to the player with their favorite match. Rotate the judge each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning: After all cards have been played, the player with the most black cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4-Volume set. Includes 440 cards, 120 Black Cards and 320 White Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
