			<description>A remake of the game The Great Safari and produced under license from White Rabbit Games, the Big Eyes, Small Mouth Anime Card Game is a hearts variant for three to six players. The deck consists of 55 cards in five suits; four of these suits contain twelve cards and the fifth suit contains seven cards. In addition to suit and rank, every card also has an employer allegiance and a point value when taken in a trick. Some cards also have special abilities described on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box contains 55 poker-sized playing cards and a double-sided rule sheet. The art on the cards is taken from the Big Eyes, Small Mouth anime roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
