							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terror In Tarracina (City State Module CS1)</name>
									
			<description>From The Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS1: Terror in Tarracina is the first module published in the Tarracina Port state module series. The city state series of modules are independent modules which all take place entirely within Tarracina Port. These modules cover various genres including: mysteries, espionage, action, adventure, horror, quests and suspense. All modules are appropriate for AD&amp;amp;D's mythical medieval setting. Ownership of Tarracina Port is required to fully appreciate these modules. CS1: Terror in Tarracina is a 40 page murder mystery with a horror twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS1: Terror in Tarracina has been designed for 6-7 characters of 10th level and above. A party wishing to survive this adventure should have a couple of fighter types, a mage, cleric thief and possibly a druid or illusionist. For the best results the party should be equipped with magical items equivalent to their level. The average playing times was around 22 hours. IF YOUR PARTY IS NOT YET READY, BY ALL MEANS PUT ASIDE THIS MODULE FOR LATER, and introduce them to the city and it's inhabitants. Many exciting and enjoyable adventures and mishaps await, for any DM thoroughly knowledgeable about the city and the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons system. No pre-generated characters have been provided because this module has been designed for campaign use. CS1: Terror in Tarracina includes sections with new monsters, encounter tables, victory conditions, and rules for adjudicating illusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
