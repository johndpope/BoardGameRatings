			<description>During the 2 billion year time period before the evolution of man, many different alien species, races, and entities have made Earth their home. Of these, there are six groups who stand out as being the most numerous and most powerful. These groups of colonizers include:&lt;br/&gt;1. The Elder Things&lt;br/&gt;2. Cthulhu and his Spawn &lt;br/&gt;3. The Flying Polyps&lt;br/&gt;4. The Great Race of Yith&lt;br/&gt;5. Mi-go, the Fungi from Yuggoth&lt;br/&gt;6. The Serpent People&lt;br/&gt;All of these races fought each other for dominance on the planet. Often they would summon beings from other places, times, and dimensions to help them fight their Wars.&lt;br/&gt;Elder Things and Outer Gods is a card and dice game where the various races (players) try to eliminate each other from existence. A free copy of the rules is available at: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.com/games2/warpspawn/ETOG.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/games2/warpspawn/ETOG.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
