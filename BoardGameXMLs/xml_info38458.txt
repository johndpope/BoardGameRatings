							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Severiano</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Super Juegos&amp;quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Severiano&amp;quot; (named after the famous Spanish golf player Severiano Ballesteros), was included in issue 2 and was obviously a golf match simulation. Players had to provide two counters (representing balls) and two dice, plus pencils and paper to note scores. Dice rolling determine the movement of the counters, while several terrain features affect movement in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
