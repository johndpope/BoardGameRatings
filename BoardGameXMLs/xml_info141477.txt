							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Boy Scouts</name>
									
			<description>An old track game that depicts the players rise through the Boy Scouts. Players start at &amp;quot;start here&amp;quot; location on the outer circle track. After spinning, player move the indicated amount. The first player, reaches the center space on the board win the game.&lt;br/&gt;Beautifully color illustrated 18&amp;frac12;&amp;quot; x 18&amp;frac12;&amp;quot; game board, with four colored wooden pieces and two cardboard spinners with metal arrows. The original instructions were printed on the underside of the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board contains 100, 1-3/8&amp;quot; colored circles, most showing boys working their way up from Tenderfoot through the stages of Scouting. The term &amp;quot;Eagle Scout&amp;quot; badge was in existence for only one year before this game was issued which is probably why it's not listed. 57 Merit Badges were available to choose from. These are listed in the text-circles. Each corner provides a detailed illustration of some facet of scouting. The exterior of the board is pressed with scrollwork in all eight corners. &lt;br/&gt;The 20&amp;quot; x 10&amp;quot; box itself is wooden and lined with a textured leather-like material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
