							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nemesis Crown</name>
									
			<description>The Nemesis Crown was a global narrative campaign created by Games Workshop for their Warhammer Fantasy setting, that started in late June 2007. The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team led by Mark Havener authored the supplement. It was last official Mordheim expansion featuring some of the game's original contributors to be published digitally by Games Workshop. It followed the same story composed by Andy Hoare for Warhammer, through a series of campaign scenario concepts designed by Stuart Cresswell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Great Forest where the race for the artefact known as the Nemesis Crown has begun. Lying deep within the heart of the Empire, the locale presents a problem for the Vampire Counts, the Skaven Lords, the Chaos Champions and the other warlords who would search for the fabled relic. Marching an army roughshod through the lands of the Empire would be a foolish and inefficient use of resources. If these races are to scour the very heart of the land then stealth and subterfuge will be required. And being a dark, dense, tangled and vast area of wilderness, the Great Forest contains many areas too wild and remote for even the Empire's own armies to access. Thus the responsibility for scouring for clues will often fall to small foraging parties, operating beneath the gaze of the armies who march upon the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mordheim Nemesis Crown development team were; Ian Davies, John Severn, Chris Templin, Mark Havener, Mike Kitch, Stuart Cresswell, Terry Maltman &amp;amp; Tommy Muller. Story-telling by 'Rev' David Warrington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artist credits for the Nemesis Crown global campaign; Markus Trenkner, Alun Davies, Alex Boyd, Paul Dainton, David Gallagher &amp;amp; Nuala Kinrade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
