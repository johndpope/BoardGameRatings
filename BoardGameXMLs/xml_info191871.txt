							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Dynasty</name>
									
			<description>In American Dynasty you will play as one of the grand American political families: the Roosevelts, the Kennedys, the Bushes, or the Clintons. To assert your family&amp;rsquo;s supremacy you will employ the time&amp;shy;-honored tools of civic discourse, such as manipulation of the media, tactical legislation, calling in favors, back&amp;shy;stabbing, stabbing, and the accumulation and distribution of money. You must build your political engine, sabotage your opponents, and bully and barter your way into the hearts and minds of the American electorate, ignorant of the closed door meetings, and deliberately impassioned by carefully orchestrated media events. By getting your candidates elected to congress, passing bills, and hopefully becoming president, you will crusade against your rival dynasties, sacrificing resources and morality in equal share. Anything, for the good of the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY: The game is played over the course of 5 Terms, and the goal of the game is to collect the most Electorals by the end of Term 5. Each term, players take turns taking 2 actions each (playing Core Action cards or Media Event cards, introducing Bills for voting, and other special) until an Election is triggered. In an Election, players with competing candidates roll dice and add on bonuses they prepared before the Election to determine winners of each vote. Winning candidates then take office and can vote on Bills and other issues. Electorals can be gained in multiple ways, including winning elections and passing bills. Negotiation, trades, bartering, bribes and table-talk are strongly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
