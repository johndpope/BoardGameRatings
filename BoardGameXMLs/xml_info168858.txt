			<description>A street racing deck-building game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a unique vehicle with varying strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players will try to have more power than their opponents so as to get a better trophy. However, they must simultaneously strive to have sufficient handling in order to avoid taking damage, which not only saturates your deck with useless cards, but also decreases your overall score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once one of the three trophy card stacks (Bronze, Silver, and Gold) is depleted, the game ends. Players count their total score from their trophies and then subtract one for each damage card in their deck. Whoever has the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
