			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aquila is a game of explorations and discoveries, a game of politics and allegiances, a game of adventures and treasures, but most of all, it is a game about your character and his future in the colony of Aquila. Starring yourself and a few of your friends, the game will first start with your first colonist and his journey into this new land. Factions will rise and falls as he lives his life the way you want him to and soon, he will need to let his son take his place as his life will be nearing its end. Your story won&amp;rsquo;t end here however, you will continue to play as your character&amp;rsquo;s son or daughter and shape the world around you. You and your friend will create a story not only about individuals, but about the whole colony and the world beyond the ocean. This story may span decades or even centuries, the only limit is your group&amp;rsquo;s imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
