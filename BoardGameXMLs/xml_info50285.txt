			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth has been ravaged by viral pathogens, the death of billions observed by the orbital colonies and deep-space habitats that were largely unaffected by the Outbreak. Terrified of infection, nobody came to help. Less than 30 percent survived the first few weeks. Then came the 2nd Wave of infection, spreading steadily outwards from the impact points, and that was when the horror really began...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YELLOW DAWN: This book is crammed with everything you will need to create characters, run scenarios and experience horror and adventure in the fictional world of David J Rodger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES: High-tech and Low-tech weaponry, equipment and armour. Zombie surges. Computer hacking and drug abuse. Non-human characters. Scavenging Dead Cities for resources and raw components to build whatever you need. Enhancements through cyberware and bioware. Complex political, corporate and quasi-religious tensions. Schools of Elemental Magick, occultism, demonology, many NEW alien horrors of the Outer Chaos - the Cthulhu Mythos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
