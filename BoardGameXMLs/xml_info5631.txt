			<description>In Trespass both players set up large plastic numbers (0 through 9) on the first two rows of a 5X6 grid then each player secretly selects one of the numbers.  The object of the game is simple... get your selected 'secret' number to your opponent's first row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces may move, on a clear path, as many spaces that are open or make single or multiple 'jump' moves (similar to Chinese Checkers) or combine a move by sliding and then making a jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate moving pieces with the only restriction being that they can't move a piece that was just moved by their opponent... moving your opponent's colour is allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your secret number is moved to your opponent's first row, you win (whether you made the move or not).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
