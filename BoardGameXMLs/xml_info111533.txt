							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pairs Up</name>
									
			<description>An action and memory game.There are 20 pegs which fit into the board. One end of the peg indicates a shape and, when placed into the board upside down, no-one knows which shape is where. Set the timer and start drawing and looking at random pegs. You are looking to find a pair of shapes. You can only look at the pegs one at a time. Memory comes in to the game because non-matching pegs have to be placed back into the board. If you find a pair, you put both pegs at the bottom end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the timer runs out, the pegs still in the playing area fall through their hole and inside the game, where they can be retrieved by the next player to set up his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games can be as long or short as you choose. Have one turn each or ten turns each, it is up to you. Allocate points for every pair found. When you have finished, the one with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
