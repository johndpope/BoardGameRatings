			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don't show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nobody knows where the pirate island is. Some old seawolves tell that the island is permanently surrounded by a dense fog allowing only ships provided by a special, magical, compass are able to sail to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island itself is very small and it is home to pirates from centuries. Only one bay is suitable for large ships and it has a very small entrance. Moreover, one who doesn't know the underwater surface may hit dangerous dry ends. Just beside the bay there is the most renowned inn of the seven seas: the Drunken Skull Inn, where a colorful crowd of pirates, buccaneers and any sort of sea scum get together late at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just above the inn looms the house of the pirate chief. Sea tales tell that only one pirate over all has the right to dwell in that house. Actually somebody tells that a secret bloodline of pirates do exist, as the Shrine of the Old Blood witnesses. The Shrine is a very small shrine on top of a small mound overlooking the Black Bay. Old buccaneers whisper of a secret crypt under the shrine, which hosts all the tombs of the Secret Bloodline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island has many other features such as a Treasure Cave, a smugglers hideout and a small wood on top of the sole hill that dominates the island.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Blueprint you will find the following maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Pirate Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Drunken Skull Inn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Shrine of the Old Blood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The House of the Pirate Chief&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Treasure Cave&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
