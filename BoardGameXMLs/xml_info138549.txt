							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pax East Wizard Duel</name>
									
			<description>Wizard Duel is a card game being played at the 2013 Penny Arcade Expo East. Players join one of 3 schools and roam the convention looking for other wizards to duel, and fight with a deck containing Bolt, Burst and Shield spells. &lt;br/&gt;When you meet a rival wizard, call out a gravitas-laden challenge that will shake the heavens with it's fury (but not too loud). Each wizard will then select a card from his or her deck and reveal them dramatically at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bolt is a quick spell that strikes first to defeat the more complex Blast.&lt;br/&gt;A Blast effects a large area and will easily circumvent a Shield&lt;br/&gt;A Shield spell creates a wall of force that can ward off any Bolt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wizard with the victorious spell is... victorious! If wizards cast the same spell, they strike each other in an explosion that would easily deplete any special effects budget. The wizards then pick a new spell and the duel continues until one is defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The triumphant wizard claims all cards his or her opponent used in the duel. After Pax, the points are tallied and one school is crowned champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
