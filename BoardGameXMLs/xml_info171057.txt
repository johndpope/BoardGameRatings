							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atomic Mutants from Out of Space (The Role-Playing Game)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Mutants from Out of Space is a re-usable WaRP adventure set in the golden age of the 1950s monster movies. It is designed to be picked up and played with minimal preparation or effort, and replayed again and again with a different story each time. It is based on the 1950's genre of monster movie, and is inspired by classic schlock horrors such as The Thing from another World, Them, The Fly, It Came From Out of Space, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, This Island Earth, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Tarantula, among many others. Try and watch a few of these for inspiration before you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
