			<description>Memory-matching card game to match bible quotes with bible characters. Very attractive artwork. Three other play methods, including Guess Who, and Fill in the Blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who said what in the Bible? If you know, you win! If you don't, you learn! And if you're just a kid, you match the pictures! You can use the cards according to game instructions, or you can make up games of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individuals and families will love matching up their favorite Book of Mormon characters with the memorable things they said. Popular artist Val Chadwick Bagley has created dozens of charming, colorful drawings that bring these characters straight out of history and into your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect for:&lt;br/&gt;-Family Home Evenings&lt;br/&gt;-Sunday Activities&lt;br/&gt;-Whenever you're in the mood for a great time!&lt;br/&gt;-Primary and Sunday School Classes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
