			<description>From the publisher: &amp;quot;The wise ones of a small tribal village have gathered everyone around the campfire. 'We are searching for the most able tribes person in the village. They will be chosen as our tribal champion!' The tribes people work hard to impress them. They recount stories they were told as youngsters, hunt bison, gather berries and defend the village against rival tribes. Soon they will find out which one of them will achieve the most glory and earn the respect of the wise ones.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triba Vivo is a simple card game with an Esperanto theme, as componets are written in this language. Players try to get the majority of the cards of one of four types in order to get victory points. The point values for each type range from 0 up to 3, and this is defined randomly at the begining of each round. The game lasts as much rounds as needed until one player gets 12 victory points, who then wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round has two phases. First, each player gets 5 cards. Then 1 card is drew from the deck and put face up at the end of each point of a five-point Esperanto-Star depicted on the gameboard. Next players alternately select 1 card from their hands and put it in one of the 5 points of the Star (up to a maximum equal to the number of players plus one), not covering completely the card below. The player also has to put one of his/her playing pieces in anyone of the numbered rondels along each arm of the Esperanto-Star. At the end of this phase all cards and pieces will have been set upon the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now comes the second phase. Beginning with the star arm marked with a small white star, each star arm is resolved clockwise in the following manner. The player who has a piece of his/her color in the highest rank, as defined by the numbers on the rondels (lowest numbers are highest) is the first to take one of any of the cards on that star arm. Then the second highest player selects one of the remaining cards, and so on, until each player took one card. There will be one card left behind on the star point. Remaining star arms are resolved in the same way. Victory points are then scored according to the rules described above. If none achieves 12 points, a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
