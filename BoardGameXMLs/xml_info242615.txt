On the bottom of one of the yellow bases is a sticker of the net, the rest depict an X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you look at the bottom of a base, mark on your detective sheet the knowledge you gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to determine who stole the net (the character whose base has the case for the net), at what time of day (the only time that won't be crossed off), and where they left it (the item whose base had the sticker for the net).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of your turn, if you can correctly answer the above questions, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
