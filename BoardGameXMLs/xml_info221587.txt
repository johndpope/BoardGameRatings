			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I like Tabletop Role-Playing Games. To me, the best Tabletop RPGs are the ones that emulate the game we all played as kids, &amp;quot;Let&amp;rsquo;s Pretend.&amp;quot; There were few, if any, rules, and what rules there were only made the game more adaptable, more free-form, more intuitive. I feel like we&amp;rsquo;d hit the Holy Grail of role-playing back then, and RPGs should strive to capture that magic again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also like Poker. It&amp;rsquo;s fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I read through game manuals, I started thinking about an RPG that would use Poker rules instead of dice or charts; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything like that, so... I made one. And here we are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
