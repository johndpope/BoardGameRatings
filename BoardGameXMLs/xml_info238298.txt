							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Political World</name>
									
			<description>Politics is our life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My vote, my voice, my beliefs determine my daily life and decide my life. When you make the right choice, the world moves in the right direction. The more I have more interest, the more transparent the politics. If we want a world where common sense is common, we must respect the importance of politics. And a small board game, Political World, that moves such a politicized book into a real sense of humor can make it easier and more fun for people to come into politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic rules&lt;br/&gt;Polytical World is basically a marble type game that moves on a dice and can be played from a minimum of two to four (recommended). All players start as members of parliament. The board includes a total of 24 arcades including starting lines and TV discussions, including districts that reflect real politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20% approval ratings in 5% increments will be substituted for currency and can be obtained using event cards and power cards. The approval rate certificate is held by the NEC, which replaces the bank, and when the NEC declines, it begins to take over and take away from other players. If you are in prison and lose your approval rate, you will be eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;The event card is the core of the game. It is a 72-card that combines the political and social issues of Korea with satire and humor. There is a variety of events and humor, including the approval rate certificate, loss, and imprisonment. The latest issue is updated every year for each edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the presidential election comes back every 12 months during the contest, the person with the highest approval rating is the president. The president has powerful power and gets the rest of the rest of the players.&lt;br/&gt;The victory condition is to win the president three times in succession, to become the president, to purge the remaining players, or to become the president and have a 100% approval rating.&lt;br/&gt;It may be strange at first, but once the game is started, you can find yourself embroidering a chopper to become a president and defeat another player. This is because, unlike the conventional possessive games, the three-dimensional and extraordinary feelings of power and dominance can be felt.&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one last winner is left. There are a number of factors, including the rules outlined above, the remorse of the conscience, and the privilege of the president. Please feel it directly at the Polytical World 2016 edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
