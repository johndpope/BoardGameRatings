			<description>British card game from the 1950's. The cards all feature famous people and are extremely weird. Then you realise they are photographs taken at Madame Tussauds of some of their waxwork figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player contributes one unit into a kitty.&lt;br/&gt;2.The dealer deals the players seven cards each, then places the remainder of the pack face down in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;3.Each player in turn takes a card from the top of the pack and discards one unwanted card from his hand, laying it down face up by the pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who collects either&lt;br/&gt;(a)    two runs,&lt;br/&gt;(b)    a run and three or four of a kind,&lt;br/&gt;(c)    two sets of three and four of a kind,&lt;br/&gt;(d)    a complete run,&lt;br/&gt;and lays them face up on the table, wins, and receives one unit from each player.&lt;br/&gt;The first player who collects the cards &amp;ldquo;HAVE A GO&amp;rdquo; and lays them face up on the table takes the kitty and collects two units from each player.&lt;br/&gt;4. A run can only consist of cards of the same colour, e.g. brown CDE or brown CDEF.&lt;br/&gt;5. If a player wins by completing a run of all cards in his hand, as in rule 3 (d), then each player pays him two units.&lt;br/&gt;6. The card which has been discarded by the last player can only be picked up by the next player if it enables him to finish, otherwise he must take one from the top of the pack.&lt;br/&gt;7. When all cards in the pack have been picked by the players and no player has yet won, the pack of discarded cards are shuffled and stacked face down, play proceeding as before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
