			<description>Propaganda Pamphlet adventure for Weird War Two dual statted for D20 levels 5-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A covert mission in the Ukraine goes awry . Horror with supernatural elements. Three years ago, a group of Ukrainian soldiers laid their guns down before invading SS troops bent on the defeat of the Soviet Union. The Ukrainians expected to be treated with dignity and to spend the war working hard labor for the Third Reich. Annoyed by the delay, Obersturmfuhrer Stauffen ordered the prisoners gunned down. Their bodies were thrown into a lake. Now the Ukrainians have two enemies. Partisan groups, like the OUN, fight the German occupiers. Stalin and his Red Army, while pushing back the Germans, are not welcome to the Ukraine. The heroes have been assigned to parachute into this chaos and meet with these partisans. The drop zone is near the lake where a memorial stands for the fallen...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the Weird War Two: Crusade for Europe RPG system  but also contains conversions for the d20 SRD system. They can also be used for any WWII-themed game system. Each is 16-page pamphlet containing everything a GM needs to run a single-session adventure. They also include a variety of new equipment, monsters, and technology for the WW2:CFE game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
