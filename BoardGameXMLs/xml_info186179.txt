			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imaginality is intended to be a generic, universal system that can be used in any genre.  The core rules detail a method of card handling that is used to resolve all actions (opposed or unopposed) and combat.  Every rule besides the Card rules is considered optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card game has a deck and a discard pile for played cards.  Characters start the adventure with seven cards.  Cards in standard rank, ace high, are scored 2 through 15.  A joker, when played, results in two cards drawn from the deck and summed to provide a score--then all three cards are discarded; e.g., results may be really good or really bad.  The GM also has a hand for NPCs.  Resolution first establishes a difficulty and then cards of those involved are played face down and revealed simultaneously.  The action may require another card draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imaginality uses the hackneyed concept that characters are intended to be &amp;quot;yourself&amp;quot;, or, the player.  From this basis Attributes can be defined and advanced through game experience, represented by the gaining and spending of Character Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
