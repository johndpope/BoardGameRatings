							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atari 400</name>
									
			<description>The Atari 400 was one of the first two (along with the 800) systems in the Atari 8-bit family of home computers.  Its name refers to its planned 4KB of system memory versus the 800's 8KB, however both systems eventually sold with more memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many games were ported to the Atari 8-bit computers, and the Atari 400's cartridge format was the most popular early format, since it was supported by both the Atari 400 and the Atari 800.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: user summary (walkie).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
