							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terrors of London</name>
									
			<description>Terrors of London is a competitive deck-builder with a Victorian horror theme. It has four factions: Undead, Beast, Mortal and Spirit. Each faction has two Overlords from which to choose from. Each Overlord has a unique ability as well as two Influence cards to add to a player's starting deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players will purchase monsters and powerful item cards called Relics from a central market. As a player&amp;rsquo;s deck becomes more powerful, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use Terrors of London&amp;rsquo;s unique Horde system to combine multiple faction monsters together to create powerful synergies to defeat their opponent. The first player to defeat their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Overlord wins the game.&lt;br/&gt; Terrors of London is intended for two players but comes with a four player variant included in the core game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrors of London is a complex but simple to learn card game that plays in under 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
