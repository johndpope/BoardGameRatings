							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Redux Beta: Variant Designs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue presents three new additions to the Future Armada universe &amp;ndash; each an obvious decedent of an existing ship or piece of equipment. Based on previous designs and built to add depth and realism to your campaign, these additions should seem both familiar and new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The first ship presented is Telemon &amp;ndash; a variant of the Ajax design, which is itself a reworking of MisFortune. Where Ajax relied on customized cargo containers to fulfill vital roles, Telemon provides dedicated space for crew quarters and other necessities. A version with cargo bays rather than containers is also provided.&lt;br/&gt;    Next is a set of HMT 337 cargo containers customized to serve as prefabricated structures for a fledgling colony. To efficiently move these colony pods into place is the Tri-TOAD &amp;ndash; a more powerful version of the boxy VTOL craft.&lt;br/&gt;    Finally, Future Armada ends up where it started with a variant of the CSS Morningstar &amp;ndash; the flagship of the series. Starlance is a Fenris-class warship reworked with an mercenary or adventuring group in mind. It has fewer bunks but tons of extra space for fighters, a shuttle, and a lot more cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to add a sense of continuity to your universe by providing an evolution of some well known vessels. Existing ships are repurposed and proven designs are reworked to fill a new niche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ship is presented independently with its own document, maps, and art within the &amp;quot;Redux Beta&amp;quot; directory. The .zip file contains the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Overviews&lt;br/&gt;        15, 15, and 18 pages for Colony Pods, Telemon, and Starlance respectively.&lt;br/&gt;        Each is a PDF file detailing the ship or station, interior areas, and crew.&lt;br/&gt;        Open Game License stats are provided for reference.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Map Books&lt;br/&gt;        A total of 73 pages containing complete interior maps and deckplans.&lt;br/&gt;        10, 26, and 37 pages for Colony Pods, Telemon, and Starlance respectively.&lt;br/&gt;        Miniature-scale (1 inch = 5 feet) maps for tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;        One inch grid built cleanly into the art.&lt;br/&gt;        Broken into pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Printer friendly, black and white versions of the map books (so 146 pages total).&lt;br/&gt;    Art&lt;br/&gt;        Large, single-image maps of the ships are provided.&lt;br/&gt;            These are 150 dpi, color JPEG images.&lt;br/&gt;            The Tri-TOAD is 15x17 inches. Telemon is 34x64 and Starlance is 36x60&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;        Additional rendered images of the ships and station are also included.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
