							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chrysalis Revolt: 2709-2710</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be feared, ignored, or dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drudgers. Genetically modified alien insects that do all of the labor on the planet Chrysalis. Are they intelligent? Do they have feelings? Do they feel pain when we whip them for making mistakes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who cares! As long as they bring you your wine (and it had better be the correct vintage this time!) and allow you to live a life of aristocratic leisure, there&amp;rsquo;s really no reason to even think about drudgers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except that they are secretly planning a revolt. Very soon, they will rise up and slay most humans on the planet. Some humans will survive: those whom the drudgers fear too much to fight and those whom the drudgers have so little respect for that it's not worth their time to kill them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chrysalis Revolt: 2709-2710 is a parlor narration roleplaying game. Players take roles as aristocrats in a futuristic society and tell stories based on their characters. By challenging other players while they tell their stories, you can move their character closer to survival or death - and they can do the same to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
