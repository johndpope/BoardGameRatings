							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crown the Queen</name>
									
			<description>The object of this card game is to be the first player to crown the queen. This is accomplished by laying down cards to form the queen's procession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt three cards and the remainder of the pack is placed face downwards in the centre of the table. Players look at their cards and the one on the left of the dealer takes the top card from the centre pack. He then sees if he has a police-card in his hand. If so he can start the preparations for his procession immediately by laying this card on the table in front of him, face upwards. Each player makes his own procession. There are eight cards in a complete procession. If he has no police-card he passes one card, face downwards, to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;If he has been able to play a police-card he takes another card from the centre pack and, if able, plays a FORCES card on to his procession and so on. When unable to add to his procession he passes any one card, face downwards, to the next player, leaving himself with three cards as at first.&lt;br/&gt;Cards must be placed in a line in the following order: policeman, 3 different forces cards in any order (soldier, sailor, airman), royal coach, page, archbishop, and queen. Each processional card placed in front of a player scores 10 points and the queen-card scores 30 points, giving a maximum of 100 points per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game is completed when one player has presented the Queen for crowning or the last card of the centre pack has been taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 54 cards in the deck:&lt;br/&gt;7 x Policeman cards&lt;br/&gt;5 x Soldier cards&lt;br/&gt;5 x Sailor cards&lt;br/&gt;5 x Airman cards&lt;br/&gt;5 x Royal Coach cards&lt;br/&gt;5 x Page cards&lt;br/&gt;4 x Archbishop cards&lt;br/&gt;4 x Queen cards&lt;br/&gt;14 useless cards (1 each of Trumpeter, Royal Arms, Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Marble Arch, Hyde Park, Union Jack, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Ceylon.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
