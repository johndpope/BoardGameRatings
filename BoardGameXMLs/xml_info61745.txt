			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insomnia is a black ops organization secretly funded and supported by many sources, both within government channels and without. Its mission is to keep the world as safe as it can and it does so by any means available. It knows no borders and recognizes no authority but its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assassination, protection, counter-terrorism, drug wars and espionage all fall within its mission goals. Whenever something needs doing that local law enforcement cannot deal with, Insomnia will step in. This adventure is a rescue mission. Characters must infiltrate a drug processing camp deep in the Colombian jungles, and bring a valuable informant out alive and back to US soil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Campaign Level for this adventure is Cinematic. GMs should refer to the appropriate sections of the Action! System Core Rules for relevant issues regarding character creation and game play. It is suggested that players choose skills from the Modern/Espionage skill lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
