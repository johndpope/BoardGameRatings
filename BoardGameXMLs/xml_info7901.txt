			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all go to a Yard Sale, looking for bargains. We help each other fill the Family Minivan with as much stuff as we can find and not let the Truck take away any unclaimed items to the Dump. Each player turns up two cards from around the Yard, looking for two that match to make up a complete item. Maybe a table top in one place and its legs somewhere else. A wagon here and some wheels over there. Maybe we invent how two parts could work together! Some funny matches could happen. Unmatched items can fill the Truck quickly if we don't help each other find as much stuff as we can! What will we manage to save from getting thrown away?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
