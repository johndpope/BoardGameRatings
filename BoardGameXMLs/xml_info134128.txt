							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wargame Gettysburg</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle of Gettysburg was fought over 3 days from July 1st-3rd 1863. It is considered the turning point of the American civil war, showing that the Confederates were not invincible, halting the invasion of the North, and providing the political popularity for Lincoln to be re-elected as president.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This wargame allows you to play either side against the computer, or hotseat against another player. There is a map of the Gettysburg battlefield divided into hexagons, each representing about 500 yards across. The combat units are brigades, with each figure representing 100 men or 10 guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved by the capture of flagged areas on the map (the flag indicates ownership) and also inflicting more losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with fog of war on or off, and options can be set for when the tardy Confederate cavalry commander, General Stuart, shows up (although this will also affect his Union cavalry counterparts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game copyright Dave Kershaw, DK Simulations Ltd 2012.&lt;br/&gt;Artwork by Gonzalo Santacruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
