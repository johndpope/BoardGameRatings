			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Generations ago, starships carrying a large group of human exiles crash landed light-years away from Earth without any means of communicating with the homeworld.  Over the decades, this rag-tag group of Terrans built thriving societies upon a handful of planets in the Koprulu Sector.  Believing themselves masters of that region, the Terrans were little prepared for the arrival of more advanced alien species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, unbeknownst to the Terrans, a voracious race of genetically engineered beings, known as the Zerg, managed to infect a few Terran colonies with their spores.  Then, a highly advanced, psionic race called the Protoss appeared and eradicated all forms of life upon the infected colonies in hopes of wiping out the Zerg.  Suddenly, wedged between the savage Zerg and the brutal Protoss, the Terrans have found themselves struggling to survive in the reaches of deep space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, in the Koprulu Sector, these three species vie for dominance, their very existence hanging in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
