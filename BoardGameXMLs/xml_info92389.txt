			<description>From the box cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golfers&lt;br/&gt;Get your favorite foursome together and discover the fantastic entertainment in eighteen holes of golf, played with cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played using cards, each player is dealt a hand of cards representing the number of strokes scored for a given hole.  Each player chooses the card that they want for each hole, with the winner of each hole playing last on the next hole.
