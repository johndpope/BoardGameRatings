							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horcrux Hunters</name>
									
			<description>A card game for 2+ players based on the Harry Potter universe. Voldemort has created 7 horcruxes, each one containing a piece of his soul. In order to defeat him, you must destroy all his horcruxes first. &lt;br/&gt; Players share a common deck comprising 4 types of cards: Horcrux, Action, Character and Special.  Each player starts with 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Destruction Phase&lt;br/&gt;         If you have a horcrux in play, you may play the cards needed to destroy it (each horcrux requires a specific combination of character, action or special cards to destroy it). The horcrux card then goes into your victory pile. The non-horcrux cards used do not produce their other effects.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Horcrux Phase&lt;br/&gt;         You may play a horcrux card from your hand.  Place it on the table face-up in front of you. It is in your possession. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;         You may play up to 3 action, special or character cards from your hand for their special effect (e.g. draw extra cards, search deck, steal cards etc.) &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;         Fill your hand to 5 cards if it contains less than 5. &lt;br/&gt;         Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that kills Voldemort after all 7 horcruxes have been destroyed.  If you killed Voldemort but did not destroy the most horcruxes, you must share the victory with player who did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
