			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These acrylic Speed Tokens make an excellent replacement or upgrade to the cardboard tokens that come in the game.  Laser engraved on both sides for the highest of quality, these tokens will last as long as your miniatures.  Each package includes two full sets of Speed Tokens: 1x Fast, 1x Slow, and 2x Blank, allowing you to play with the Advanced set of rules with two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add more realism to your games with special Climb and Dive Speed Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included for each set is a pair of Climb and Dive Speed Tokens.  No longer will your WWII plane be restricted in to climbing and diving in a straight line!  The special climb token has a short arrow and plus sign on it.  When played with a turn maneuver, this will indicate that you are performing the maneuver and climbing at the same time.  The short arrow on it is a reminder that you exit the maneuver at slow speed.  The special dive token has a long arrow and minus sign.  Playing this token with a turn maneuver would indicate you are diving while doing the maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;As with normal climb and dive cards, any maneuvers executed with the special tokens would become Steep maneuvers and could not be played immediately before or after another Steep maneuver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACE (Advanced Component Equipment) tag in this product's name indicates that it is made with the highest quality materials available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
