							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Viking Shieldmaiden</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build amazing relationships between your heroes and NPCs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Viking Shieldmaiden is a proud viking warrior who must come to grips with the taste of dishonor and failure. With the PCs&amp;rsquo; help, she might come out the other side stronger than ever. The Viking Shieldmaiden is extremely competitive, reacts aggressively when she feels she is being disrespected, and often becomes confused when the ins and outs of viking honor aren&amp;rsquo;t as obvious to others as they are to her. However, she is fiercely loyal to her true friends and comrades, and she is never bitter about losing a competition fairly, merely excited to improve and try again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Relationships contains a system for relationships that provides a meaningful progression and story for the significant NPCs your PCs might encounter in the course of a campaign, including secrets to uncover as the relationship progresses, and hurdles for the PC and the NPC to overcome together. Unlike other relationship systems that bottleneck on certain skills, often Diplomacy, Ultimate Relationships allows everyone to progress and reveal the NPC&amp;rsquo;s story at their own rate; it just might take some characters longer than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains a set of core relationship rules for making these kinds of interactions between PCs and NPCs a rich and vibrant part of your campaign. They are suitable for use in any campaign, but for groups playing in the official published Adventure Paths we will also be releasing a series of modules featuring the core NPCs from those Adventure Paths, as well as new NPCs introduced in the respective Adventure Path Plug-Ins from Legendary Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
