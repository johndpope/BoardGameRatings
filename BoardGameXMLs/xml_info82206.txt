			<description>In 1990, Capcom released a video game version of Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a platform game featuring single and 2-player cooperative modes, allowing players to choose which levels to access via a map, giving them access to various locations in the city. Each individual stage is set-up as a side-scrolling action game where Chip and Dale can walk, jump, duck, and pick up objects such as acorns, crates, and barrels to throw at enemies and bosses. In the game, the Rangers must stop another of Fat Cat's schemes, only to have his kidnapping of Gadget send Chip and Dale to the rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second NES game, titled Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2, was released by Capcom in 1993. The sequel features additional incentives for cooperative play, such as mini-games that can only be played by two players, and the ability to throw one's partner as a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
