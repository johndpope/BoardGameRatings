							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bubble Up Pup</name>
									
			<description>This is a kids game that appeals to a child's love of bubbles. The game board is a vinyl mat (for obvious reasons) on which is placed a battery operated bubble machine shaped to look like a puppy in a bathtub. On your turn, you spin the spinner and follow its instructions...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number: If you spin a 4, 6, or 8, press the tub faucet knob and try to catch that many (4, 6, or 8) bubbles in the Bubble Bucket. Move your pawn the number of spaces equal to the number of bubbles you caught, but not more than the number that you spun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pop Pop!: Press the faucet and All players pop the bubbles that come out, then All players advance to the next yellow Bubble Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go To Front: Pick up your pawn (which also acts as a bubble wand), dip it in the reservoir, and blow as many bubbles as you can. Then move your pawn to the space in front of the leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soap: Slide your pawn back to the space behind the leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the bathtub Finish space, and turn over a plastic &amp;quot;towel&amp;quot; with the pup's picture on it, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
