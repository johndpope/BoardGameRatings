							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Anghar</name>
									
			<description>From the Cosmology:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Anghar exists in a system of eight planets. Each of Anghar's neighbors corresponds with one of the Seven Spheres of Magery and is viewed by the inhabitants as being the seat or throne of one of the Seven Servants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Anghar is a complex, unique setting developed specifically for use with ARG: The Adventure Role Play Gaming System though it could be used with nearly any fantasy system.  The setting is available freely and consists of ten major HTML pages, including:  WOA Index, World of Anghar, Anghar's History, The Hierarchy, Dragons, The Eight Races, The Demi-Humans, The Dark Races, Neebo's Landing, and Miscellaneous (Slavery, Money).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eight Races include Aishen, Hrtryn, Rahidyn, Ruakyn, T'howmin, Tlassi, Tzorvyn, and Voshin.  The Demi-Humans include Mann, Booka, Duergar, and Faeyn.  Each species is thoughtfully linked to an audio file that gives the correct pronunciation of the species name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neebo's Landing is a large market town and is developed fully, with maps, keyed locations, and NPCs.  Most campaigns are apparently intended to originate (and be based) here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
