			<description>Bibber Blabber: &amp;quot;Where Blinglish is a Second Language&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blibber Blabber is another family word game from Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns replacing the first sounds of all the words you want to say with a specific letter sound and see if your team can guess the Blibber you are blabbing. It's a tongue-twisting game of funny sounds and phrases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, spin to find out which letter sound will be used to describe the words on the Blibber chip you have drawn. For example, if your Blibber is &amp;quot;Penguin,&amp;quot; and you spin &amp;quot;B,&amp;quot; you must begin all your words with the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; sound. You might want to say, &amp;quot;This animal lives in the Arctic,&amp;quot; but instead would have to say, &amp;quot;Bis Banimal Bivs Bin Be Barctic.&amp;quot; If you spin the letter combination &amp;quot;SH,&amp;quot; it would be, &amp;quot;Shis Shanimal Shivs Shin She Sharctic.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can pass if your team gets stuck, but then you risk losing the Blibber chip to your opponents. Also, if you blab using an incorrect sound, the other team gets your chip. Continue collecting Blibber chips and describing words to your teammates until the 60-second timer runs out. The team with the most Blibber chips at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
