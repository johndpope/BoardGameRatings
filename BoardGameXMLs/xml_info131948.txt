			<description>From the front page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theocracy of Elturgard was changed forever when army of plaguechanged monsters nearly destroyed the city of Elturel. All seemed lost, but heroes turned the tide and destroyed a terrible abomination of pure Spellplague energy. The forces unleashed during and after the battle transformed what had been a small local plagueland into the massive Chaos Scar. One of the city's most ardent defenders has recently discovered that uncontrolled magical energy is once again building up along the boundary of the plagueland. What will you find on the other side? A Living Forgotten Realms adapted adventure set in Elturgard for Adventure Level 2 (which allows character levels 1-5). This adventure is the beginning of the Chaos Scar Adventure Path, which encompasses multiple Major Quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need a legal copy of the original published adventure to use this adaptation document. The adventure is found in issue 171 of Dungeon online, part of D&amp;amp;D Insider. Dungeon adventures may be downloaded by subscribers from the Wizards of the Coast website. At least one person at the table (either a player or the DM) must have an active subscription to D&amp;amp;D Insider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adaptation document does not present adjusted stat blocks for multiple tiers; you may only run this adventure at AL 2. However, we have updated all the stat blocks from the published adventure to MM3 damage expressions in this document. The DM may use either the original stat blocks or the updated stat blocks, bearing in mind that the goal is to give the players a challenging but fun experience. Any legal AL 2 table can play the adventure, but please bear in mind that the stat blocks were written for a party of level 1-2 characters. Tables of all level 4-5 characters might not find this adventure challenging. This adventure should easily be playable from start to finish in the span of a single four-hour LFR game session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
