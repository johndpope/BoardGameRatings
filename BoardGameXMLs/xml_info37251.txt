			<description>An antique board game for two, three or four players. The game consisted of a 10x10 inch box and 24 wooden pawns (divided equally into four different colors.) The instructions are printed inside the box cover. The bottom half of the box serves as the game board. The playing area is a circle divided into four pie-shaped quadrants, each of which has six holes into which the pawns may be inserted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
