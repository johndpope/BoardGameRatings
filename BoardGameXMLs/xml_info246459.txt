							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Warriors: Fate of Ophidian</name>
									
			<description>Galactic Warriors - an arena combat game that pits futuristic gladiators against each other using unique and thematic mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player brings a team of up to four gladiators to the table, along with a customized deck that's driven by the selected gladiators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay revolves around a momentum-based system that allows the player with the momentum to continue to take actions until they lose momentum, at which point their opponent picks up and continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use resources to supply their gladiators with equipment and minions (support characters). The crowd gets involved through cheer and also provides an alternate victory condition. Win the crowd, and you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes drafting, and the game has solitaire and cooperative options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of cards come with this game, including over 8 playable decks.  Don't miss it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
