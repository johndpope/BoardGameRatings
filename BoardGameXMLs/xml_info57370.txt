							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Personnel Files 2: The Meme Team</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Transhuman Space presents a rich and varied background that is excellent for near-now science-fiction gaming. But it's so rich in detail that it can be difficult to know what to do with it. That's where Personnel Files come in handy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Transhuman Space: Personnel Files 2 -- The Meme Team presents a group of professionals who specialize in researching the patterns of thought that run the world. If you've got a problem relating to memes, then you need to call Patel Memetics -- The Meme Team. Get ready for a Transhuman Space campaign that's part private-detective show and part legal drama, with enough business plotting and melodrama to keep the players tuning in week after week!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This supplement presents five members of this organization (and their AIs). They can be used immediately as PCs, templates for new characters, or rivals in the world of memetic investigation. The book also includes campaign ideas, a sample scenario, and adventure seeds to keep Patel Memetics -- or a group like it -- busy for many adventures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
