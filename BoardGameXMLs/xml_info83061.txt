			<description>From the box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU'VE MASTERED THE DESERT SKIES. NOW TAKE ON THE FAR EAST.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 NEW THEATERS FOR FALCON 3.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for even more thrills. More excitement. And more heart-pounding action when your squadron does battle over Japan, Korea and Pakistan/India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Japan, the Russian navy is at war in the Kurile Islands. Your job is to stop the full-scale beach assault. Only this time, you'll contend with aircraft carriers, battle cruisers, hovercraft and a host of other ships that want to destroy you. You'll be piloting an advanced Falcon FSX, which adds a whole new dimension to the Japan theater of action. But your enemies are also equipped with the latest: MiG-31 Foxhounds, Q-5 Fantans, Mirage 2000s, and the ultra-secret UMF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shift the fighting to Korea, and you're in for explosive ground action. You'll encounter helicopters, heavy AAA, plus dug-in tanks returning fire. A barrage of activity guaranteed to keep your adrenalin pumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still hungry for more? How about some daredevil flying over Pakistan, where you'll face a combination of ground and air action. Maneuver through the dangerous Himalayas in a real cat and mouse game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terrain is so realistic, you'll swear you're overseas. So if you're prepared for more intense combat, test your courage in Operation: Fighting Tiger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fly over more than 270,000 square miles of real-world terrain in Japan, Korea and Pakistan/India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Use your new AGM-84A Harpoon anti-ship missiles to blow the ballast out of an enemy ship&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fly new mission profiles including SEAD (Supress Enemy Air Defenses), beach assault and reconaissance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Track enemy ships with lethal accuracy using the new SEA radar mode in the advanced FSX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
