			<description>This card game is designed to help players learn facts about the features, history, people, countries, and capitals in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. The game includes 100 cards divided into 5 separate subdecks: Western Europe, Russia and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Far East, and South Pacific and Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round of the game is played with one subdeck. Each card features a question, the answer to the matching card, a map of the country, and an illustration accompanying a fact about that country. Players take turns asking each other for cards that answer questions on the cards in their hand. When they ask for a card with an answer that correct answers their question, the pictures on the two cards will match. The object of the game is to have the most card matches when play is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
