			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for the World Wide Wrestling Roleplaying Game is a deck of individual cards containing the Role Moves that are used consistently during play. This player resource enables everyone to reference their Role Move whenever they need it, and then simply turn their card over to signal their dramatic Turn to the opposite role!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Role Deck contains 24 premium poker-sized cards, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 Cover/Credits&lt;br/&gt;    10 Doublesided Basic Role Moves (Babyface/Heel)&lt;br/&gt;    7 Doublesided Lucha Libre Role Moves (Tecnico/Rudo)&lt;br/&gt;    6 Doublesided Advanced Role Moves (Celebrity/Icon and Legend/Part-Timer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for the World Wide Wrestling Roleplaying Game and requires that game to use. This set of Role Cards is also included in the WWWRPG Move Deck, along with 97 more cards containing the individual Moves that your wrestling characters could potentially gain as they advance and gain more skills in and out of the ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
