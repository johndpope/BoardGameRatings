			<description>Blockade is a game that is played with Icehouse Pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blockade is a roll-and-move race game played in two dimensions.  Each player is assigned 2 colors in a 5x5 board, and are trying to arrange their pieces in formation first.  However, as pieces arrive at their destinations, future piece movement by friend or foe is restricted.  Players will need to cleverly jockey for position while leaving themselves more options and blocking the opponent's movement paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published online at the Looney Labs website since 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Icehouse Pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
