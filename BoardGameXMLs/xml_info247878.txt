							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">That Business in the Aldani Basin</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chult has always been a dangerous place but with the Death Curse in full effect it has only become more deadly for your adventurers!  Low level characters are especially suseptible to sucumbing to the hazards of the jungle and more than likely you'll need to find creative ways to introduce new characters into the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's where That Business in the Aldani Basin comes in.  This adventure is designed to be a short side quest to introduce a new character into an existing party while providing additional story elements to both help and hinder the party.  During the course of the adventure, the party will assist a new character in escaping the predatory designs of two unscrupulous guides while potentially securing treasure and passage through the Aldani Basin.  This adventure is based in the Tomb of Annihilation adventure but can be adapted for a number of other campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
