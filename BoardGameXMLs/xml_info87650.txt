			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings and thank you for purchasing Fifty New Ways To Blow Things Up: Starlanko the Magnificent&amp;rsquo;s Book of Evocations. I, as you may have guessed, am Starlanko the Magnificent. This book is sort of a culmination point for me. After years of selling spells on a one-to-one basis, I am finally able to reach the broad market I had always hoped to and bring you the greatest spell-related tome ever written!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instrumental to this tome is a new technique of spell scribing developed after years of research that allows you to prepare spells directly from this book, even if you have never seen the spell before in your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all goes according to plan, this spellbook will be the first in a series of Fifty New Ways to... spellbooks. Each will focus on a different school of magic, each one as good, if not better, than the one you hold in your hands. If you enjoy this book or find it useful, please be on the lookout for further volumes. Feel free to scribe me a letter or contact me via sending as I&amp;rsquo;m always eager to hear the opinions of my fans. Or better yet, tell let all of your friends about the book; word of mouth is the greatest form of advertising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
