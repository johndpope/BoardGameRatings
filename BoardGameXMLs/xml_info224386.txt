			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holiday of Winterfeast is approaching in the city of Summerfort.  It is a time for celebrating and gathering with families, taking some time off to break up the early winter doldrums. Adventurers rarely have down time, and sometimes when they do, trouble seems to find them anyway...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A villager bursts into the inn, eyes wide and out of breath. &amp;ldquo;Monsters! There&amp;rsquo;s monsters!&amp;rdquo; he cries, and his eyes lock on you. He rushes forward, pleading in his eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bartender speaks up, &amp;ldquo;Artwer Landerson, what are you doing, storming in here and scaring my customers to death. Why I ought to...&amp;rdquo; he is cut off by a panicked look from the man who burst into The Wanderer&amp;rsquo;s Rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please! Help! They&amp;rsquo;ve got my daughter!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers are spring-boarded off onto this quest, their feet hitting the ground running, and they are not allowed to rest until they solve the mystery! Something is causing magic to go awry in the Whitewood Forrest, and with some help from an archmage, Master Nicholas, the PCs are flung into a quest to find and end this source of Wild Magic. There are people better equipped in Summerfort, people more able, but time is short, and if the source of corruptive magic isn't stamped out, it will radiate like a plague and it may engulf Summerfort!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your gear and get in the fight! There's not a second to lose to save the Whitewoods, and even Summerfort itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
