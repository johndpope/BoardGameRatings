			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most ambitious old school treasure system, at your fingertips ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you weary of plopping down unimaginative treasures that read &amp;ldquo;1,000 gold pieces&amp;rdquo; or something similar?  More detail would be great, but how do you get there?  Do you have enough game and historical information to provide your players with intricate details on acid types, unholy symbols, perfume types, and realistic spices?  Can you provide enough variety to fuel an entire campaign replete with hundreds or thousands of different treasure hoards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is a daunting one.  How can you keep your players intrigued and exploring the endless intricacies of your world if every lair they visit is a predictable slot machine with only four vending bins for coins, gems, jewelry, and magic items?  The game&amp;rsquo;s treasure system is set up to provide you with easy and hackneyed results, but it hints at so much more.  The problem with those hints however is that they&amp;rsquo;re vague, scattered, nebulous and conflicting.  Very few Game Masters take the laborious steps to turn those hundreds of hints into a working cohesive set of interlocking systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, I have good news:  I&amp;rsquo;ve done all of the hard work for you.  This deluxe supplement features tens of thousands of non-magical treasure entries through 219,000+ words and nearly 800 pages.  Herein you will find details for acid vials, armor, books, clothing, dyes, furs, gold nuggets, healing herbs, holy and unholy symbols, incense, ingots, inks, ivory, parchment, perfumes, poison flasks, rare coins, shields, silks, spices, statuettes, treasure maps (to the nth degree), weapons, wine barrels, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OLDSKULL TREASURE TROVE has been developed over the last 15 years from my own FRPG campaign.  My complete system runs to nearly 3,000 pages, so this first tome comprises only coins and miscellaneous non-magical treasures.  Book II, detailing gems and jewelry, is in preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
