			<description>&amp;quot;...it's not what you say... ... it's what you hear!&amp;quot; (TM)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the precursor to Mad Gab. The basic premise is that you are given a string of words that are meaningless, but sound like another phrase or title. &amp;quot;Ache Leans Late&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;A Clean Slate&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this version, 2 to 4 teams compete to collect cards while advancing toward the center of a board. On a team's turn, one player gives clues for the words in a puzzle (e.g. &amp;quot;What you do when you're sore -- ache&amp;quot;). That player's partners guess the words, and then try to figure out the puzzle. If the timer runs out before they've solved it, then the other team(s) can steal the card. Each card is worth from 3 to 7 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one team is in the middle, they can play for double points on their turn; however, if they lose the card, they're sent back a few squares, and the team that gets the puzzle gets the double points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all teams are in the middle. Whoever has scored the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
