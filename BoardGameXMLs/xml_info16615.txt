			<description>Questillo is a game of crossword building - each player has a grid on a sheet of paper, and adds words to it to make a crossword type layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The words added are based on clues, which come from cards drawn from a box.  So a clue might say 'A great game', and each player has to get the name of a great game added to their existing set of words on their grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of a cross between 'Pictionary' and 'Scrabble', and you're nearly there...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are achieved for words accepted by everybody, and can be doubled or tripled on certain bonus squares.  Most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
