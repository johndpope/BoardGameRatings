							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hecse Fyre Field</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Moon is blood red, the villagers lock their doors and bar their windows, praying that they won't hear a bang on their door. For if they do, it means the Witches of Hecse Fyre Field have come to claim a new victim!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hecse Fyre Field is a printable battemap compatible with any RPG game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hecse Fyre Field is a day &amp;amp; night set, comprising two 20x20  battlemaps. One map depicts a rural farm field in the day, with a huge ritual symbol scorched into the stubble of a wheat field. Chained at the centre of the scorch are the blackened bones of a victim. If the party visit at night, they may see the ritual taking place, as huge flames leap into the air and paint the landscape in vivid shades of blood red orange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hecse Fyre Field is ideal for spooky Halloween adventures. Perhaps the party witness the ritual at night, and then return the following day to look for clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pack includes an A4 pdf document with 300dpi gridded versions of each map. Also included is a set of gridded and gridless 300dpi full size jpgs, for poster printing or VTT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
