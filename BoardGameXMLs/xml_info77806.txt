			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an unusual entry in the long running and popular 'Bomberman' franchise, in that it does not have a single player mode (though you can play the standard multi-player game with the AI controlling the other characters). This release concentrates on multiplayer, with up to 8 players on a single PC, and up to 10 when playing over a network!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay follows the standard Bomberman style - drop a bomb, run away before it explodes. When setting bombs, the early aim is to blow up destructible portions of the arena, which would then drop power-ups. These range from giving you extra bombs, and larger explosions, to the ability to pick up bombs or to set off your bombs by remote control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have built up a decent arsenal, your focus switches to trying to blow up your opponents. The last man standing on the level wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as powerups, sometimes 'diseases' are uncovered by your explosions. These include 'Short Fuse' where your bombs explode more quickly than normal, 'Molasses' where your bomberman is slowed to a crawl, and the highly frightening 'Diarrhoea' where you cannot stop dropping bombs! These diseases can be passed on to other players by touching them, providing an additional dimension to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you not familiar with the Bomberman experience, I will spare you the details. The dynamics of the game are as easy as 1-2-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Drop a bomb.&lt;br/&gt;2. Run like hell.&lt;br/&gt;3. Watch your back (and your front, your left, etc. Just watch out.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
