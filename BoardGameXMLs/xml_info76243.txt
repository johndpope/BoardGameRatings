			<description>Napoleon in Germany, 1813&lt;br/&gt;Napoleonic 20 #9 (Germany 20 #1) Expansion Kit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After defeating the Allies at Dresden on the 27th, Napoleon was sure they would continue the battle for a third day. But that night the Allies began a confused retreat, leaving the French scrambling to mount a pursuit the next morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Already poised behind the enemy right, the French I Corps was in the best position to block the Allies. Ordered to proceed via Peterswalde to seal the exits from the mountains, Vandamme was to act as anvil to Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s hammer, crushing the Allies between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a clever plan &amp;ndash; one that might have broken the Coalition had it worked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kulm 20 is based on the battle that occurred during Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s final campaign in Germany, on 29-30 August, 1813. One player commands the Coalition forces under the Austrian Field Marshall Karl Schwarzenberg, while the other player commands the French army, nominally under the command of the Emperor Napoleon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note, Kulm 20 is not a &amp;lsquo;stand alone&amp;rsquo; game. You must own a copy of Dresden 20 to use this expansion kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 4  on a 9 scale.&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 5 on a 9 scale.&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 1000 meters, and each turn is roughly 3.5 day hours (or 10 night hours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One 4-page Exclusive Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 12 Random Event cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One 11&amp;rdquo; x 17&amp;rdquo; color game map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One 8.5&amp;quot; x 5.5&amp;quot; color map extension&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
