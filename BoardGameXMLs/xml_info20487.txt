			<description>Simple sooccer game, from 1950-1960, played on a field of 21 X 28 squares. Every team has 11 players represented by plastic minitures. On your turn you roll a special die that determains how far you may move your players. If you get two numbers you can move two players otherwise you can move just one. The players steal the ball by moving past it. If you end up on the square next to the ball carrier you risk a penalty for roughing. If you complete a pass play you may roll one extra die and move again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
