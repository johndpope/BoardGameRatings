			<description>Tired of having to choose what game to play? Why not play more than one at the same time? Sure, those other games are great. That's why Gameception wants you to continue playing those while you play it. It's the game that plays all day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From &amp;quot;The Singer&amp;quot;, which says &amp;quot;If someone else sings a song&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;The Power Gamer&amp;quot;, which says &amp;quot;If someone else tells a player what to do on their turn.&amp;quot; Get someone to slip up and score your card! Draw a new card each time you score one and at the end of gameday tally all the cards you scored. Winner is the one with the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
