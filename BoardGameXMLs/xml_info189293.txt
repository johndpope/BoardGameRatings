			<description>Designer's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honour by Day was written for Game Chef 2009 and since then has seen further playtesting and refinement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a competitive GMless RPG that shares a lot in common with board games. You each play medieval knights competing in various scenarios for a series of rewards. The game is as focused on plots and schemes as it is on honour and chivalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two scenarios are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Tournament of St George: A jousting match, fighting for the hand of a fair princess. This is the original scenario an the most complete.&lt;br/&gt;     The Battle of Sterling Bridge: You are all generals fighting a war against he barbarians from the north, vying for power within your own ranks. The scenario is complete, but has some balance issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
