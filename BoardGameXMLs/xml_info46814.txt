			<description>The Sun turns around and starts counting: each player draws a card from the draw pile and mimes the movements described, before giving it to his neighbour by going: over the head, between the legs, blindly backwards... All players play at the same time and pass the cards to each other as long as the Sun player keeps counting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At count of 20, the Sun returns: all drawn cards will be kept by their owners until the end of the game. Person who has the most cards loses the game. And look out for players still trying to pass cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special cards: &amp;quot;Parasol&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sunscreen&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Cloud&amp;quot;. They protect from the Sun, make it disappear or require players to hide their cards immediately.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insanely fun, find this recess game transformed into a card game for children and adults!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
