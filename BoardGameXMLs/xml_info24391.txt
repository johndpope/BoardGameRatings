			<description>From the Rules of Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STARGO is a fun and engaging way to introduce kids to the basic concepts of stars, galaxies and constellations. There are two ways to play, and both are based on Bingo. Version &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; uses basic number and color concepts as players search for stars on one constellation. Version &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; uses basic visual and memory skills as players enjoy traditional Bingo on a grid featuring 24 constellations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version A:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 30 large glossy cards, each featuring a constellation with numbered, colored stars (that glow in the dark!). Each player selects one. Colored and numbered stars are selected from the bag and called -- first to complete his constellation wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version B:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the flip side of the constellation cards is a traditional Bingo grid of constellations. Constellations are selected from a deck (each has information about that constellation on the back). First to complete five in a row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The constellation cards feature glow in the dark stars and an orienting arrow. Combined with the included compass, they can be used to help find those constellations in the night sky. The smaller cards contain facts about the constellations and the stars within them. The rulebook also contains information about stargazing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
