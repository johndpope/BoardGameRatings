			<description>Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life sucks.  Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring   which you've spent delivering pizzas.  This afternoon has totally been         dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine.  You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.            &lt;br/&gt;                                                                               &lt;br/&gt;Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter.  There's only one   more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here.  Go home,   watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new &amp;quot;Surfers Monthly&amp;quot;          magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.                                  &lt;br/&gt;                                                                               &lt;br/&gt;Shyeah, right.  That's what YOU think.                                         &lt;br/&gt;                                                                               &lt;br/&gt;REVERBERATIONS                                                                 &lt;br/&gt;A Hectic Voltairian Adventure                                                  &lt;br/&gt;Copyright (c) 1996 by Russell Glasser.                                         &lt;br/&gt;Release 1 / Serial number 961015 / Inform v1502 Library 5/12 D      &lt;br/&gt;IF Comp 1996: 13th place of 27 entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
