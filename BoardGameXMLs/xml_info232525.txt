							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NYX</name>
									
			<description>NYX is a highly portable asymmetric card-lapping game for two players or for four players.  With four players, NYX plays as two partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In NYX, you assume role of an immortal Scion locked in an eternal struggle to influence mortal thoughts.  Take the side of Morpheus, God of Dreams and bearer of prophetic visions.  Or take the side of Morpheus&amp;rsquo; menacing brother, Phobia, bringer of phantasms and nightmares.  Use your powers of prophetic dreams, nightmarish phantasms, powerful rifts, and enchanted cloaks in a clash for control of the ancient realm known as the Dream Plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of NYX is to gain the most Victory Points.  You earn Victory Points by composing Divinations to collect Poppies and by building connected territories on the Dream Plain of either Nightmare or Prophecy.  Final scoring is based on the amount of area controlled and the number of Poppies cached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of NYX is inspired by the legend Morpheus and Phobia.  They are brothers and scions of ancient gods:&lt;br/&gt;Their father is Hypnos, the gentle, black-winged God of Sleep; twin to the Lord of Death; and &amp;lsquo;balm to the mortal soul.&amp;rsquo;  Their mother is Nyx, the frighteningly fierce and powerful primordial Goddess of Night borne of original Chaos, her overwhelming might revered and feared by all other gods...even Zeus himself.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The sons of Nyx and Hypnos dwell within an immense cavern buried in the deepest chasm of the Underworld.  Each night, Phobia, always envious of Morpheus&amp;rsquo; renown, wages a great war with his formidable brother.  Since the beginning of time, while mortal men slumber, the two scions have been locked in an eternal struggle vying for absolute control of mortal visions and dreams.  At sundown, the two race from the depths of the Underworld as a cyclone rising like a smokey mist of bats. The two brothers hurtle towards their battle and their destiny on the Dream Plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
