			<description>The game re-themes Funny Bunny with groundhoges, who have to hide from an eagle. Groundhog-pawns are moved heading to the finish and number of spaces are determined by a deck of cards, just like in the original. What distinguishes this game is, that multiple pawns have to be brought to the end spaces, and that a speed element is added to the game. Whenever an eagle card is revealed, a button is pressed, which randomly might activate the eagle. Players are supposed to only hide their groundhogs, if the eagle takes off from behind a bush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
