							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crawl! (Issue 1 -  Apr 2012)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Crawl! fanzine is a zine for Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG. It's made by fans, for fans, in the classic style of punk-rock zines found in record shops and info-shops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zine will be exclusively a printed, folded &amp;amp; stapled product. That's the point and it's charm. Each issue will be locally printed and snail-mailed or available at select FLGSs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each creation, submission, art &amp;amp; what-not, belongs to their respective artists &amp;amp; authors. Credits and contact information will be made available for each contribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crawl! is created to support the DCC RPG and its community of players and judges. This also includes publishers and developers that support DCC RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every issue will be the designed, refereed, Judged, mastered and published by me, the Reverend Dak. Paper is expensive, but nothing beats a physical book in your hands full of useful stuff to make your game awesome at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
