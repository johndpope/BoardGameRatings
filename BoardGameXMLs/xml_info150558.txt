			<description>The seaside would not be the seaside without donkeys on the beach! This wonderful game from the height of the Victorian era is full of superb graphics and of course is great fun to play as well. It will provide hours of fun as you learn the antics of the donkeys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is spin/move. Players spin the indicator and may not move initially until they obtain a &amp;quot;donkey boy.&amp;quot; Whenever a player spins a 6 or &amp;quot;donkey boy&amp;quot; they get another turn. Every few spaces there are different circumstances to overcome on the game board. To end the game a player must spin the exact amount of spaces necessary to move to the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
