			<description>ReefGame: a role-playing game to explore livelihood alternatives in traditional fishing communities in Bolinao (Philippines)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Ten] paired players are allocated on each [virtual coastal area] and take the role of fisherman and head of family. Players' profile includes number of members in his household, income needs and boat type. Each player's objective is to provide enough food for his/her family through fishing and/or extra activity incomes.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The game is supported by two identical boards representing a virtual coastal area with an offshore island. Information available on the board is: the natural habitat (mangrove, seagrass, and coral) and the players' home. An Agent Based Model of the game is run during the playing sessions to compute and deliver fishing catches, players' incomes and habitat transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
