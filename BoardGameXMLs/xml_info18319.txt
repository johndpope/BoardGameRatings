			<description>A GAME OF ROOTIN'-TOOTIN'-MARBLE SHOOTIN'!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a main plastic play area divided into four sections.  Each section has 2 compartments with a hole in each.  A crude trigger mechanism is used to propel marbles through the holes &amp;amp; into the compartments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 5 marbles.  The first player to get two marbles in each compartment wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can pre-decide the number of rounds that will comprise any given game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
