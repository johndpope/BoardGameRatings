			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the morning of November 30th, 1939, the Soviet Union unleashed its vast military might on its defiant neighbor. Soviet medium bombers attacked the Finnish capital of Helsinki, and immense Soviet resources in men and material surged across the entire length of the border in an attempt to crush the overmatched Finnish military.

Instead of fleeing from the vast Soviet onslaught, the Finns fought bravely, using their knowledge of the land, and pulling from their fierce national pride and  to inflict massive casualties on the invaders, and earning themselves the nickname of The White Death. The Winter War had begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
