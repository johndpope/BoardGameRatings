			<description>The Rabbids uses a time machine (which looks like a washing machine) to go through different times to change the history of time, first they go to caveman times to help a caveman discover fire, but end up giving him a lighter. Then they go to middle-aged Egypt to disturb work on the shpinx and make the nose fall off. And last, they go to Medival  times but they end up underground holding a sword when arthur tries to pull it, when they leave, Grannie ended up pulling the sword instead of Arthur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay will revolve around several minigames for up to four players (with computer AI controlling unused players) set during various segments of time. Some levels will feature co-operative play, such as a level where two players are tethered by toilet paper. Ubisoft has stated this game intends to be 'waggle-free', and rather than having games shake the controller as hard as they can the designers hope to create mini-games with more depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rayman Raving Rabbids: Travel in Time,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
