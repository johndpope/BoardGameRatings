			<description>Besieged is a shed style card game for 2-4 players taking approximately 30 minutes after learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of Commanders of an army retaliating against the villainous Agean Empire. The first to defeat three Agean officer cards wins the game. To do this, players take turns deploying legion cards that exceed the power level of the active card in play. Players have a set of Command Tokens they may spend on using a customizable set of abilities as well as playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has played all the cards from their hand and Captain tableau, they can challenge Agean Officer cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
