							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Enchanted Tower</name>
									
			<description>This is a fantasy-themed roll-and-move game with a three-dimensional board. The board comes in three segments: two of these form a colorful truncated pyramid when pegged together, and the third forms a square ivy-covered stone tower that fits into the top of the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side of the pyramid has 35 holes for pegs on a winding path up to the tower; each side of the tower has a further 11 holes leading to the window where the princess presumably awaits rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls a die to climb one side of the pyramid and then up the adjacent wall. There are no shortcuts up, but eight spaces have slides back down. First player to rescue the princess wins. The rules suggest a party variation, in which four &amp;quot;prizes&amp;quot; are placed in the tower, and players get to choose a prize in order of finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is not dated, but the game is listed in the 1946 Catalog of Copyright Entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
