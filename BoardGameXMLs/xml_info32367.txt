							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spinjas</name>
									
			<description>Spinjas is a ratcheted spinning top game created by Parker Brothers in the late 1980s. The game set was sold as a Battle Stadium plastic arena with two Power Winder launchers and two Spinja characters enclosed within the clam-shell designed arena. More characters, launchers, and an oversized playing arena were also made available separately. The objective of the game is to load your chosen character into the ratcheting launcher and each player would launch their top into the arena at the same time. The tops would ricochet off of each other until only one remained spinning or within the arena and that player was declared the winner.The tops are not customizable and are not associated with any other licensed properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
