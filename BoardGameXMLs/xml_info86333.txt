			<description>Dark Legions is an action based strategy game. The player may play against the computer or another human on a strategic game board. In the beginning of the game, the player buys their forces with a predefined number of credits, and may purchase any of the 16 characters along with various kinds of traps and even rings of power to upgrade their creatures. One is chosen to be the &amp;quot;Orb Keeper&amp;quot;. The Orb Keeper is like the King in chess: the game is over if he dies. Then players set up on a chosen map and start to move turn wise. When one player moves a piece into the same square as an opponent, the action is instantly transferred to another board map that represents the terrain upon which the two pieces occupy. Each player starts with their single piece on this &amp;quot;melee map&amp;quot; and must fight using their figures. The fight is simultaneously controlled in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dark Legions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
