			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fehr's Ehtnology: Xesa profiles the xesa race for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The xesa (singular and plural) are a curious race from the deepest parts of the unexplored jungle. Their origin harkens back to a human jungle tribe that increasingly fell prey to a species of man-eating jungle plant; the plant developed strong pheromones that, unfortunately, the humans became addicted to. Small groups of them would gather around a plant, waiting for it to eat one of their group; the rest would have a few hours of ecstasy while their fellow was digested. The tribe would also eat the seeds of the plant as their main food source. Eventually this symbiotic relationships evolved into a hybrid creature with characteristics of both species; the xesa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     ecology of xesa&lt;br/&gt;     racial characteristics for xesa characters (including alternate racial characteristics)&lt;br/&gt;     a selection of racial feats&lt;br/&gt;     traits for the xesa race (if you use traits)&lt;br/&gt;     sample xesa 1st level character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
