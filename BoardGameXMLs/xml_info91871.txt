							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Survivor</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old Abbey is said to be haunted. It is also said to be filled with hidden treasures. A young man named Angus sets out to explore the 1008 rooms and loot everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Survivor is an action/exploration game. Angus must explore each level, looking for gold and traps to disarm. He can only move to the next level when all exploding traps have been disarmed. He also must avoid or destroy the evil spirits infesting the place, but ammunition is scarce and some spirits are only vulnerable to the bomb, a special attack that costs Angus energy. Some rooms contain extra ammunition, bottles of elixir to replenish Angus' energy bar or extra bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed by Paul, Alan and Adam Shafi, with music by Andrew Edmond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
