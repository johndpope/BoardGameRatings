			<description>A One-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally your long journeys have ended. You are brought through the swinging maze of rope bridges and springy boughs to a central tree whose bole surpasses anything you could even imagine. Seemingly from the tree itself emerges an attractive elven woman who motions for you to follow and proceeds up a series of tiny limbs before passing through a screen of giant leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After passing through onto a wooden platform, you see an entire town stretching out into the neighboring trees, all screened from below by well-pruned branches. Your guide quickly leads you to a sprawling structure that extends upward into the canopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon entering, you are all ushered into a private audience with Lord Miriander. He is a very tall, painfully thin High Elf with a drawn, weary countenance. He addresses you immediately. &amp;quot;Ah, at last you have arrived. My realm requires the assistance of a few seasoned adventurers such as you represent. If you will assist us, please follow me to private chambers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Miriander then rises and exits by way of a rope ladder up into the next level and another and another, until finally you stand upon the uppermost parapet overlooking even the canopy. From here it is easily noted that several of the nearby trees, including the one you are in, appear to be ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Miriander begins, &amp;quot;My friends, you can see about you my problem; however, that is only the beginning. My treekeepers tell me that whatever is killing our homes is not magical, but it is highly toxic. The skills of my invaluable herbalists are being utilized to slow the progress of the toxins, but until it is discovered and stopped at its source, a reversal of the damage will be impossible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
