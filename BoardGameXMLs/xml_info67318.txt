			<description>As part of an advertising feature for the reprinted version of Talisman (third edition) in 2003, Games Trade Magazine (a publication of Alliance Distributors) published two Characters for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Characters were the Vampire and Swordsman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards featured miniatures taken from GW's tabletop game, Mordheim: City of the Damned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vampire and Swordsman had previously been released in GW's house magazine, White Dwarf #186.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thief from White Dwarf #177 and the Dark Elf from White Dwarf #179 were due to printed in the next issue of Games Trade Magazine, but due to constraints of space this did not happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
