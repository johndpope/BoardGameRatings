			<description>&amp;quot;Putt-Putt Joins the Circus&amp;quot; is the sixth Putt-Putt adventure from Humongous Entertainment. In this game, Putt-Putt (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) and his dog Pep go to see BJ Sweeney's Big Top Circus (a reference to Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus) in Apple Valley. They hopped on Roll-Along Cassidy, a circus train. When they reached Apple Valley, everything was in chaos The circus' five main acts, Honko the Clown, The Flying Porkowskis: Herb, Pearl and Hammy, Phillipe the Flea, Reginald Cornelius Andronocles III the Lion, along with two tiger sisters, Terri and Marie, and Katie Cannonball; and all the minor acts, Marvin the Marvellous, Eunice the Unicycle, Francine the Hippo High Diver, Ivan the Semi-Strong Van, Sebastian the Juggling Seal, and Belobrodnik the Ballet Dancing Bear, are having serious problems. Putt-Putt and Pep also meet new friends like Lester the Flea Janitor, Bart the Peanut Cart, Hank the Security Car, and Bette Bandwagon, along with Baby Jambo and Mama Mombassa (two elephants from Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo). Putt-Putt must help all his new circus friends, so they will practice and finally perform under the big top in the opening night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Putt-Putt (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
