							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lords of New York</name>
									
			<description>It's 1925. Prohibition is in full swing, alchohol is forbidden and business is booming for the mafia. Speakeasies and jazz clubs are packed every night. New York City is alive with a new-found freedom where anything is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of New York is an adventure RPG game where you follow the story of one of three high stakes poker players as they pursue their life's ambitions and become one of New York's elite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has unique gameplay, end goals and poker style (cheating, intuition or statistics) all designed to support a compelling story arc. While the paths of their stories may cross, they are completely different, increasing the game's replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Kickstarter Page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
