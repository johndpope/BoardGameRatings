							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hydra</name>
									
			<description>Hydra is a game for two players to test their mental ability and logical thinking against each other. With a look and feel of game that could have been played by men of the Norse whilst they drank and feasted in their Mead halls or even taken on the raiding trips and played at sea.  Hydra is a completely new game of intelligence and cunning, you must create an unbroken line of tiles from one side of the board to the other whilst stopping your opponent from doing the same. The first person to do so wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of Hydra is that it is played East to West and North to South or it could be West to East and South to North. The game gets its name from the style of play of creating lines that get broken like they have been cut and then you must start a new one, just like when Hercules cut off one head of the Hydra another new one or two grow back. The game mechanics are very simple with only three different types of tiles and a single hand count of rules to beat your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play can take just a couple of minutes when you first learn to play, up to tens of minutes or more as you and your opponents learn the subtle flow of cunning tactics that are wrapped in Hydra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
