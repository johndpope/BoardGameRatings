			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archdruid is dead! Now is the time to reclaim the world for civilisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Akharon is a world scarred by a magical druidic war and overflowing with monsters. Much has been lost, waiting to be reclaimed by those bold enough to set foot outside of civilisation's last bastion, Stronghold. It is a world besieged by malevolent forces who channel the planet&amp;rsquo;s own dark magic and direct strange otherworldly creatures with malicious intent. It is a world where death and mystery wait around every corner, behind every tree, and in every rocky crag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it is also a world of hope. The war that has lasted a generation is over, and the denizens of Stronghold have begun to step out into the w orld once again. What awaits them is a v ast, unexplored land, overgrown and full of grand treasures and lost magic waiting to be re-discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the evil druids and the f orces of the dark goddess, Neph, are still out there in the wilds, plotting their next move. They may have failed to conquer Stronghold, and their Archdruid lies dead, but they will not stop their campaign until all civilisation on Akharon is extinguished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races who took up residence in Stronghold - the Kaltorans, Legion, Remnant, and Tolatl - are once again free to spread civilisation across the face of Akharon. As Stronghold struggles to support its growing population, and food rations grow thinner, the time has come for bold adventurers to leave and reclaim the wilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    You will need the Fragged Core Rule Book.&lt;br/&gt;    3d6 Resolution System.&lt;br/&gt;    Nonlinear Progression.&lt;br/&gt;    Best for Long, Sandbox Games.&lt;br/&gt;    Tactical Miniatures Combat.&lt;br/&gt;    PC Vocations.&lt;br/&gt;     *New* Crafting rules.&lt;br/&gt;     *New* Establish your own holding/city/nation.&lt;br/&gt;     *New* Combat Momentum rules.&lt;br/&gt;     *New* Optional: Mass combat rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Nature vs civilisation.&lt;br/&gt;    Religious tension.&lt;br/&gt;    5 playable races (Kaltorans, Legion, Remnant, Tolatl, Twi, Half-Bloods).&lt;br/&gt;    Exploration.&lt;br/&gt;    Set within the Fragged Empire universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
