			<description>A dexterity game in the same vein as Mr. Mouth. A basketball backboard with baskets on both sides is placed in the middle of a turntable. While the backboard spins around, up to four players try to launch balls into the baskets using small catapults. The first player to get all six of their balls into the baskets is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
