							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Superior Colonies</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three colonies on the vanguard of civilization!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Superior Colonies are the most recently settled worlds of the Clement Sector.  In a sector already separated from the cradle of human civilization, the inhabitants of these worlds felt the need to divest themselves from the new status quo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superior - Home to an outcast genetic scientist and his followers.  A colony dedicated to creating better humans at any cost!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tupolev - A lawless frontier fuel stopover where anything can be bought for the right price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brunson - The promised land to a group of devout pilgrims being led by a man claiming to have ancient knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Superior Colonies comes with detailed descriptions of each of these settled worlds along with information concerning the remainder of the Superior subsector.  Random encounters and adventure hooks are included for each world to get your characters into the action with a minimum of preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Superior Colonies can be used as part of a continuing campaign within Gypsy Knights Games' Clement Sector background or as part of any Traveller or science fiction setting.  These worlds can be used in concert or be taken one at a time for your own Traveller universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure awaits in the new colonies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
