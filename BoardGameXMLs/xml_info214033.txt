							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Brimstone: Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The Temple of Shadows was once the home of an ancient and powerful order of Yamabushi monks, dedicated to battling supernatural creatures throughout the land. It was foretold that one day the Great Dragon King, Sho-Riu would return to destroy the Earth, and only they could stop him. When the meteor came from the heavens and devastated the mountain, the Dragon King came with it. For generations the monks had been training for this moment, and as Sho-Riu descended on the temple, they gathered their strength and prepared to fulfill their destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But their victory was not to be. Reigning down death and destruction, the Dragon King broke through the monk&amp;rsquo;s defenses and utterly destroyed the order, devouring their souls and bringing Darkness and shadow into the sacred temple. Those few that survived were scattered and leaderless, but they would not sit idle. Traveling the roads and countryside, the last of the monks dedicated their lives to finding new Heroes that could one day fulfill the prophecy and reclaim&amp;hellip; the Temple of Shadows!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the themes from the Forbidden Fortress Core Set, the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion adds a ton of new content for the Feudal Japan setting and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld. This boxed set includes:&lt;br/&gt;4 New Hero Classes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enforcer &amp;ndash; An outlaw and a gangster, the Enforcer is an anti-Hero renegade who favors brute strength and intimidation over elegant fighting weapons and technique. His tattooed body is hardened and scarred from a lifetime of brutal brawling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geisha &amp;ndash; Beautiful but deadly, the Geisha is a cunning and stealthful fighter. She employs deception and trickery to evade and confuse enemies, while slashing with her hidden blade from behind. Her comforting presence can heal the Heroes, both body and soul, to keep them in the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldier &amp;ndash; The Soldier is a veteran of warfare who has seen many battles and is an expert marksman with his Rifle. Though he does not have the style or family heritage of the Samurai, he is a hardened foot soldier that has access to a variety of different weapons and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kitsune &amp;ndash; A guardian spirit, the Kitsune has come forward to defend this world against the demons and creatures that would threaten to destroy it. Taking on a human-fox form, the Kitsune uses supernatural tricks and auras to protect the Heroes, while darting between enemies to deliver killing blows with her deadly blades.&lt;br/&gt;4 New Enemy Types&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chochinobake &amp;ndash; These demon-possessed, animated lanterns swarm the Heroes, relentlessly biting and burning them with terrifying speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Takobake Warriors &amp;ndash; Once a noble clan, the Takobake have embraced the power of the Dark Stone. Using its energy to grow in strength, they have become mutated into tentacled monstrosities, twisted and evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skin Crawlers &amp;ndash; These large, parasitic creatures burrow through the flesh and muscle walls in the Belly of the Beast, rising up from the pools of sticky mucus to assault any Heroes foolish enough to enter into their feeding grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fallen Shogun &amp;ndash; This dreadful leader of the Takobake clan was one of the first to discover the magical properties of the Dark Stone. Weaving it into his armor, and forging it into weapons, he has gone mad with power, mutating into a giant among men! Declaring himself Shogun, he now sweeps across the land with his legions of mutated soldiers, conquering any who would stand in his way.&lt;br/&gt;New Material for the Forbidden Fortress and Belly of the Beast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion also features 4 new double-sided Map Tiles with new rooms for the Forbidden Fortress on one side and the Belly of the Beast on the other, 6 New Missions for the Temple of Shadows, loads of new cards and counters, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
