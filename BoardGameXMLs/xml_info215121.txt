							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of the Ascendants</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Voice of All spoke three times before falling into silence. The first time to give shape to the Ancients. The second to give them the world as their domain. The third to build the TOWER for the war that was to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And war did come. The Ancients, primordial warriors charged with protecting the world, were subverted by three great crusaders, vindictive and powerful. The Ancients were stripped of immortality and cast from the heavens to serve and suffer with the rest of humanity. The crusaders claimed new bodies for themselves, and became the Triumvirate, god-tyrants of all realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long line of descendants of the Ancients is dwindling, along with humanity&amp;rsquo;s last hope. What few remain have gathered to enter the TOWER OF THE ASCENDANTS. Crumbling stone tablets of ages  forgotten say that a mortal who ascends the TOWER that pierces the heavens and slays the gods who dwell in its highest bower will reclaim lost immortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
