			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does 4th level mean to your character?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the fantasy worlds woven in traditional tabletop gaming the idea of level-based titles is anything but new. It has, however, been left behind in recent years. Ranks and Titles will restore this tradition in any fantasy campaign world run in any system. This information is useful for establishing an in-character analogue for advancement both in character level and social rank. A player character would have no logical knowledge of character class levels, but he might well know that, as an expert, he has little hope of defeating a well-trained yeoman. In the more formal ranking systems this information serves as a valuable role-playing tool by establishing a merit-based pecking order that player characters and non-player characters alike must deal with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     28 rank systems for martial characters, monks, priests/clerics, bards, magic-users and thieves of all stripes 28 rank systems.&lt;br/&gt;     Each of the rank systems included presents twenty ranks/titles to help measure the progress of a character regardless of class or profession.&lt;br/&gt;     Works with d20 classes or any other fantasy role-playing background.&lt;br/&gt;     Multiple rank systems for each traditional character class/archetype to allow for specialization based on character background. A stealthy rogue and a thuggish highwayman may use the same game mechanics in your campaign but they have unique rank systems to differentiate between the two styles of thievery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
