			<description>Triple Flips 6 includes Championship Boxing, Motorcycle Jumping, and Olympic Biathlon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Championship Boxing is a 2-player game in which the players attempt to maneuver about the ring and punch one another when in range.  There are KO spaces along the players' punch tracks by which a player can hope for an early knockout of her opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Motorcycle Jumping is a 1-player game in which you try to jump as many buses as possible, based on your trajectory and height.  Most of your jump is determined by rolls of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Olympic Biathlon allows 2-4 players to cross-country ski and shoot their way to victory.  When you get to the shooting range determines the length of the path you take back to the main course once you've shot the target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
