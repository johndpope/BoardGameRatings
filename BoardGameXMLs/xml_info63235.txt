							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chip In</name>
									
			<description>Variation of a rather old game concept. Each player has a board with numbers from 1-11 (but no 7). On each of these, a chip is placed. The player rolls two dice and can take a chip if one of the fields with a number he/she rolled or the one with the sum of the two dice still has a chip on it. If not, he/she adds a chip to any of the fields. If he/she rolls a seven, he/she has to put one chip into the middle of the table. The first player to completely clear his/her board gets all the chips from the table and those remaining on other players' boards. After several rounds, the player with most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
