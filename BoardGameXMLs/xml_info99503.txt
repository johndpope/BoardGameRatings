			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find yourself slowly meandering through a large leafy forest on a hot summer's day. The woods you seem to be exploring are always welcoming, more so during the height of summer; and it was certainly that blessed time of year! The trees surrounding you stretched on endlessly. They seemed young and strong, and had a healthy canopy of rich green leaves surmounting them. The grass at your feet is thick and lightly dipped in morning due. Above you, streaming through countless branches, lays the round of the sun, as it climbs peacefully into the bright blue sky. You walk on through the trees, breathing in fresh air scented with roses and other wild flowers that just sway lazily about you. A slight sound catches your ear and, upon locating its source, you discover it to be a pair of bees gently floating through the air. Then you notice the other sounds about you: birds singing, crickets playing their strange tunes and even the odd frog doing its best to add to the forest chorus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things change after a few moments though: the birds cease their calls, as do the insects; even the wind seems quiet. Then the forest around you quickly darkens and chills you. The wind becomes much stronger and dislodges a hail of leaves from the dark woods surrounding you; as if the trees themselves were crying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So there you stand, alone in the dark, and being taunted by a biting wind and an insurmountable whirl of leaves. Then a cold fear sweeps over you as you notice five dark figures standing silently in the undergrowth ahead of you, and each one of them has their shadowy face tilted in your direction. You stand rooted to the spot, terrified of the nonspeaking forms watching you. You notice that the middle figure stands slightly ahead of the others - perhaps he is their leader? Although you are afraid and seem unable to run or even turn away from the silent group facing you, curiosity still forces you to make a cursory examination of them. None of them appears particularly tall, though they do all seem to be of roughly the same height and, in fact, roughly the same build too. It is about now that you make a chilling discovery because, although the silent group are shrouded in shadows, you can still make out some sort of metal glinting on both their hands and their faces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You awake bathed in sweat and visibly shaking. You look about you and are glad to find yourself back in the familiar surroundings of your dark bedroom, replete with wardrobe, chest of drawers and, of course, your bed! You sit up and examine the clock beside you - 12:01 am. This is unusual; you have only been asleep for a solitary hour, yet you don't feel remotely tired. You decide to get up, throw some clothes on to protect you from the winter's cold, and head down stares for a little something to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once down stairs you grab a little snack from the fridge and walk through your dark lounge to turn your TV on, but the only thing that lights its screen is static - on every stinking channel! The aerial must be down, you muse. Never mind though, there's always the good old radio. So you quickly locate it and switch it on, only to be met by white noise - on every blasted channel! What the heck is going on? You flit to the light switches to help illuminate matters, but none of the bulbs seem to work! This is getting ridiculous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You grab your snack and head back through the shadows, upstairs to your bedroom. Once there, you greedily wolf down the meagre offerings you had previously discovered, then decide to let in a little moonlight by opening your curtains. What you see makes you gasp in shock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
