			<description>There are 120 of the 1/2&amp;quot; counters, map sheet with hex grid, rules, charts.  Turns represent half-day turns from AM Sept. 17 - AM Sept. 29, 1944.  Features airborne units and air bombardment, artillery and engineers rules.  Allies get 3 victory points (VP's) per turn for control of the Arnhem Bridge and 2 VP's per turn for the pontoon bridge near Arnhem (if it&amp;rsquo;s not blown).  XXX Corps units that leave the north end of the map in supply get 2 VP's per factor.  The Germans get 4 VP's for each turn they hold Arnhem Bridge plus 2 VP's per factor for destroying Allied airborne units while only 1 VP for other Allied units, per factor destroyed.  Isolated units (including airborne) can still attack for two turns after that they can only defend.  Side with most VP's wins.  Allies have secret drop zones at the start of the game that they must commit to irregardless of German units present in the hex with only the Polish brigade being able to alter their landing zone.  A rare game to find as it was published in Panzerfaust as a mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
