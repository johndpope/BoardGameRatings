To defeat these spectres players will collect items during the daylight from the freak shop, drink moonshine at the speakeasy to boost courage and rip out pages from sacred books in the library, all before the week is up, or the hotel will be forced to close!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is split into two phases, the daytime phase and the nightfall phase. &lt;br/&gt;On every turn, do the following things in this order during the daytime phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.Manage the hotel.&lt;br/&gt;2.Choose a starting location.&lt;br/&gt;3.Take up to 4 actions (move-buy-share-cleanse)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daytime phase:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage the hotel - Relocate guests - If possible relocate terrified guests to any vacant room and then add 2 guests tokens to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.
