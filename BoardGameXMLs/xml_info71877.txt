			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed by tri-Crescendo, the studio behind Eternal Sonata and Fragile, Blue Dragon&amp;trade;: Awakened Shadow is an epic action role-playing game in a fictional open-world environment, the sequel to the critically acclaimed and successful Xbox 360 title. The player joins a young boy named Shu and his friends. The main character possess the power to control phantom shadows that mirror the actions of the master which brings different powers to the owners. Encountering various people on a planet where numerous ancient ruins remain, the characters and their shadows travel through a world full of mysteries and illusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After two years past since the first adventure of Shu and his allies,a new threat is about to emerge. Awakened from a long slumber, the new enemies bear some resemblance to Nene, the defeated adversary of the first game, a conundrum which leads the player, Shu, and his friends into a terrifying fight to reclaim the lost shadows and restore balance to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
