							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aux Sabords Kartenspiel</name>
									
			<description>Expansion for Aux Sabords. This set of cards offers two sets of rules. Both require the basic game and the expansion.&lt;br/&gt;In the first game, the players try to collect and lay down sets of cards including a ship card, a captain's card, three item cards and four crew cards (in a certain order). In a basic move, a player draws a card and can play one to his/her display. Alternatively, s/he can attack other players with combinations of cards, forcing them to discard or hand over cards, etc. Afterwards, the hand is filled up to five cards again. The first player to complete a display is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game is similar, but includes entering enemy ships. So attacks are directed at a player's display, and entire ships can be sunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
