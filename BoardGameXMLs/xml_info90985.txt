			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GP 500 is a motorcycle racing game for the PC. It is based on the 1998 Championship of the World Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title includes 24 licensed riders from the &amp;rsquo;98 championship, including Mick Doohan, Alex Criville, and Max Biaggi. Players could choose from 6 different 500cc motorbikes and race on the 14 official tracks from the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a racing simulation, meaning that the bike physics are kept as accurate as possible. As a result, the learning curve is very steep. An &amp;quot;Easy Handling&amp;quot; mode is included to introduce beginners to the game. There is a large amount of fan-created content available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
