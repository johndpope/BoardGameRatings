			<description>Each player opens several shops in desirable locations and tries to lure as many as possible customers in its shops. Storytellers also lure customers away, complicating strategy.  Experience the bazaar with its close lanes and colourful goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an expensively produced update to Marracash, featuring 111 semi-precious gemstones and 4.5 kg of wood.  Auctions and money have been removed, but new features have been added.  The game is also known as Agadir (the site of a major gem bazaar located near Marrakesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
