			<description>A self-experience game for children and adults with tarot and oracle elements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a travel through the inner self. In this game, you are made aware of your experiences by means of the symbolicism of a fairy tale. The inner spaces of the conscious and unconscious self are represented as different storeys in a big house. The levels, from the deepest cellar to the attic symbolise the different levels of consciousness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the way up, a players will encounter different archetypical persons, who represent different sides from his personality. Those are the fairy-tale characters who live in the house. Connected to these characters - Dwarf. Witch, Prince, Princess, Giant, Queen and King - are different feelings. The persons will ask questions connected to such feelings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interaction between players occurs when the answer a player gives is not the answer others think he ought to give - in other words, when someone perceives himself different from how others perceive him. This should lead to a discussion to find the true answer (and the true personality).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allthough the actual game is a race to the attic, this interaction between players is the most important part of the game. Discovery of self and development of social actions is the main goal of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
