			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortress, Tomb, and Tower: The Glain Campaign is an adventure series for the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game. The adventures herein are intended for 4 to 8 player characters. The levels of ability vary, and are noted below. This module includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortress of the Iron Duke: The valley of Freestead was once green and pleasant, and the humans and dwarves who lived there revered their leader, Duke Vadarin. He was betrothed to the beautiful Lady Kylenne the Courageous, who arrived in Freestead on the back of a white dragon. On the day before their wedding, an explosion engulfed the Palace, and almost overnight the valley fell into ruin. An adventure for characters of level 2-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomb of Karsma Megalos: The proud Serenhai people were ruled long ago by a seemingly immortal hero, Karsma Megalos. He disappeared in the Cataclysm, and not long after his people were defeated by armies from the north. No one knew where the hero was buried... until now. An adventure for characters of level 5-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
