							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heads Up</name>
									
			<description>Heads Up is a &amp;quot;Bop It&amp;quot; type game for young children. The game itself is a silver, robotic looking head with moving facial features. To play, you press the Start button and as one or more buttons pop out of place (the ears, jaw, hat, nose etc.) quickly press or turn them back into their proper position. If you do it fast enough you'll earn points. If your too slow a buzzer sounds and the game ends. The game announces your score at the end of each round. The game can also be played with other players. This is done the same as solo play but the game will announce, &amp;quot;Next Player,&amp;quot; and is then passed to an opponent. If you get buzzed, you are eliminated. The last player in wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
