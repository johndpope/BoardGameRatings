			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players must move on an 8x8 board as Chess knights - used spaces will be unavailable for the rest of the game. The last player who's able to move wins. It's more or less an adaptation of Alex Randolph's Knight Chase for several players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has got an own symbol (dot, circle, square, cross) and starts from one corner on the board; before anyone moves each player will fill in a square on the board, which will be unavailable from then on (it's not allowed to block a player before their first move). Players then move in turn following the rules for a Chess knight, ticking the corresponding free space on the board with their symbol and filling in the square they departed from. If a player can't move the turn will be forfeited. The last player who can move wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
