							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moraff&#039;s Dungeons of the Unforgiven</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moraff's Dungeons of the Unforgiven is the third and Final game in the Moraff rougelike series.  Once again the player's objective is to journey to the bottom of a dungeon and defeat the boss.  Depending on the difficulty setting, the player will have a certain number of modules open to them, each with its own boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player advances through the dungeon in a first person perspective, and looks at the dungeon at different height levels depending on the race chosen.  The graphics are again much better than the previous game in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
