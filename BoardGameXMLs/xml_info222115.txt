							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raid on Chinatown</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone the players care about has been abducted by the nefarious highbinders of the Hip Sing tong and taken to the steaming, rat-infested heart of New York City&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown. Time to rescue them - before it is too late! The map shows the block between Mott &amp;amp; Bowery west to east and Bayard &amp;amp; Pell north to south, in New York City. The letter or number in each building is located at its primary entrance, but each structure has an alley exit and a connection to one adjacent structure. The walls are also flimsy! The victim could be anywhere, and will likely be in the last place they look. Keep the pressure on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
