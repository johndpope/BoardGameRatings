			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Manor&amp;quot; is the universal filling of background medieval fantasy setting, a system basis for improvisation of DM. It consists of a description of a typical nobleman's hamlet (of knight, of the hamlet owner): plans, information- which NPC where and how lives, what amount of money is needed to bribe a guard and how much, in contact with him, you can roll on diplomacy, bluff, intimidate, disguise. You know what powers a local ruler holds and how he reacts for the crime. You can play &amp;quot;Manor&amp;quot; as the strategy game playing role of a knight, who in the next three parts of the series &amp;quot;Strongholds&amp;quot; is promoted to baron, count and duke. The economic and demographic systems are easy, tested and suitable for PHB, DMG and the realities of Middle-Ages. The magic, heroes, beasts from MM are the integral part of economy and warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forge Studios presents and represents a new quality in game's accessories combining 'art' packs and ordinary gaming material.&lt;br/&gt;Every PDF from The Forge Studios consists of two parts.

In it you can find exact plans, visualizations, ideas, and adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is a set of visual aids which can be easily printed or presented to other players during a session, in order to enrich the description and create a more precise presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Manor&amp;quot; consists of:&lt;br/&gt;- 25 pages long description&lt;br/&gt;- 1 hamlet map&lt;br/&gt;- 4 floor plans of donjon&lt;br/&gt;- 8 view drawings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
