			<description>A children's dexterity game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: &lt;br/&gt;- two wooden crocodiles&lt;br/&gt;- two ring-shaped nests&lt;br/&gt;- one egg (a little ball that has a blue and a red half; it's not completely round so it always lands with either the blue or the red half up)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: Being the crocodile mommy who first succeeds in flicking the egg into her own nest. Or, if the game is played in multiple rounds, being the one with the most point (one point for each time the egg lands in our own nest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Each player gets a crocodile and the nest of the same colour. The crocodiles are placed about 50 cm apart. The egg is placed in the middle, at equal distances from each of the nests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamplay: The starting player places his/her crocodile next to the egg, so that the tail is very close to the egg. He/she then touches the crocodile's head and turns it so that the tail hits the egg and the egg starts rolling. If the egg stops moving with the same player's colour up, he/she gets another turn and flicks again. Otherwise it's the other player's turn now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the egg ends up in one of the nests. This player wins the game. (If players have agreed on playing multiple rounds, the game ends after the agreed-on number of rounds.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty can be adjusted by putting the nests closer together.&lt;br/&gt;The instructions also include suggestions for a few variants/other activities with the game materials:&lt;br/&gt;- Which player needs the fewest attempts to get the egg into his/her nest?&lt;br/&gt;- Which player can kick the egg more often with his/her own colour ending up on top?&lt;br/&gt;- Which player can kick the egg the furthest in one go?&lt;br/&gt;- Threads can be used to set a racing course. Which player gets the egg to the finish line with the fewest kicks without the egg leaving the racing course?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
