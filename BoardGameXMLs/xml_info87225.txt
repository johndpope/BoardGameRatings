							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guardian Universe II: Power Overwhelming</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth is at its breaking point. Magic, CHI and cybernetic monsters have torn apart most of humanity. No one is safe and the Guardians that once protected them are powerless. In an act of desperation a group of heroes awakens Guan Di, Chinese God of Soldiers and also the last remaining God of Mythology on Earth. Seeing no choice, Guan Di uses the Dragonfire, an ancient cosmic power, to change it all. In a matter of seconds the Guardian Earth is transformed into a new world. All the misery and loss is gone. No one remembers the original reality at all. Remnants of the original Guardian Earth are hidden away. Space stations, cyber monsters, secret bases, and more just swept under the rug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game brings players and GMs a streamlined system and a deep setting.
