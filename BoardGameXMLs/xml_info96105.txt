			<description>Quad Doku is a tile-laying word game played on a 4x4 grid with a 2x2 hole in the middle. Players take turns laying tiles with letters on them to form four 4-letter words around the frame, with the goal of making a doku, a four letter word whose points add up to 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is much like upwords, in that you can place tiles on top of the tiles already on the board, but different in that each letter is worth a number of points; sometimes the same letter has different point values on different tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenging word game of four letter words!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with letter tiles on a matrix of four intersecting words. the goal is simple, just form as many &amp;quot;dokus&amp;quot; (4-letter words) as you can.
