							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hollywood Squares</name>
									
			<description>Hollywood Squares is a puzzle game based on the television game show of the same name. Players have to either agree or disagree with fictitious celebrities to earn squares and make tic-tac-toe. Much like the TV series, winning one of the first two games is worth $500, the third game is worth $1,000 and the second game is always the &amp;quot;Secret Square&amp;quot; game. The winner then goes on to the bonus round, where they have to choose one of five keys and insert it into the proper car among the five offered. This version was based on the 1980's version hosted by John Davidson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versions were released for NES, MS-DOS, Commodore 64 and Apple II home computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The photo of the set on both the NES and computer versions is from the 1985 series pilot (the actual show had no gold stars on the studio floor and more elaborate risers for the cars).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hollywood Squares (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
