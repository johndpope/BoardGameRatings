			<description>From publisher's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sins of the Past is an adventure for the sci-fi horror role-playing game, Abandon All Hope&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having survived Perdition and managing to keep themselves alive since, the player characters find that there&amp;rsquo;s more at stake than just survival. Various forces are moving towards an enigmatic goal, one which seems threatening at best, apocalyptic at worst. With the help of old allies the characters begin to set in motion a plan to build strength, so that when the enemy&amp;rsquo;s schemes come to fruition there will be at least some show of resistance against the powers of the Nether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sins of the Past the characters will face new and difficult challenges; their ability to problem solve will be tested in their dealings with former friends, their level-headedness will be vital to preventing unnecessary bloodshed, and their ability to survive in the wreckage of a ship that is slowly turning into an alien landscape both cold and dark will pit them against foes both alien... and hauntingly familiar.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
