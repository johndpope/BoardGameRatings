							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Runes and Bones</name>
									
			<description>Runes and Bones have been sources of power and divination for Tribal Orc Spirit Talkers for countless generations. As the wisdom of the few remaining spirit talkers fell to the blood lust that consumes the race, the Runes and Bones once used to guide the strategy of the warriors now serve only to entertain them. What once was an honored system of divination, now serves as a campfire game for Orcish warriors everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Creator:&lt;br/&gt;Runes and Bones was created in the summer of 2006 as I was preparing for a 10 day trip to meet up with my Orcish horde for Ragnarok XXI.  Ragnorok is the most popular annual event for Dagorhir Battle Games Association.  It is a week of camping, characterization, and warfare.  I wanted something that felt tribal and could accommodate many players, thus, Runes and Bones was born.  I have created many sets since then for other camping trips and cons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;When playing Runes and Bones you go around the circle and bid bones in exchange for runes from the bag, which you then play to attempt to win the pot.  Runes have a variety of characteristics which determine which runes they beat and vice-versa.  You are also able to barter runes and/or bones from other players on your turn.  If, on your turn, the rune you played last turn is still the winning rune, you win the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
