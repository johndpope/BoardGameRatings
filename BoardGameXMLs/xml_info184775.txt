			<description>Use The New Rock, Paper, Scissors Mechanic To Score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can travel down life through good deeds or bad deeds, but karma will follow you either way. In Elemental Battle, your best tactic is to collect that bad karma now and give it to your opponents to get the win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 4th entry into the Karma Crystals game collection adds a rock, paper, scissors mechanic that works with SIX elemental icons for a whole new dimension to the game. You also get 11 new monster elemental cards for your collector&amp;rsquo;s deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect elemental battle shards into your ACTIVE area, then use them to battle your opponents through ONE of THREE battle actions. You can CAPTURE their ACTIVE battle shards into your SCORE area, MOVE their ACTIVE battle shards to your ACTIVE area, or TRANSFER battle shards from their SCORE areas to the general SUPPLY area, accessible to all players. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;hellip; you can still pass your bad karma to other players. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be Karma Crystals without Karma Crystals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will either roll or battle on each turn. Roll dice to match with a monster elemental card and collect elemental battle shards that match your dice into you ACTIVE area, or battle to score shards. If you score 11 or more elemental battle shards, that triggers the end the game and a winner is determined at the end of that round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 20 minutes to play. No paper score cards and pencil needed - the 96 elemental battle shards are all you need to battle your opponents and build your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
