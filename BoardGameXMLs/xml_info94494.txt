			<description>Goal: Become the mayor of a new city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuild ('convert') an old military area near Potsdam to a new town district with all infrastructure needed. Invest your money into different projects like area development, construction projects, parks ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start with a zoning map, but be active within common tasks, too; your different activities should be driven by yield and votes 'values'. Combined with the (luck) element 'die' it's just an 'in time investment', when evaluation takes place. You may build alliances, which can reduce the influence of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play: &lt;br/&gt;Everything is driven by the die; if you roll a:&lt;br/&gt;1 - you possess parts of a park or get a zoning map&lt;br/&gt;2 - everyone earns money (yield from all of your investments)&lt;br/&gt;3 - draw and execute an 'action'card &lt;br/&gt;4 - draw a 'chance'-card&lt;br/&gt;5 - everyone earns money (yield from the housebuilding)&lt;br/&gt;6 - everyone earns money (yield from commercial buildings)&lt;br/&gt;The money you earn should be reinvested to increase your income&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
