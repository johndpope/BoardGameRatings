			<description>2 or 3 players play on a six-sided board, moving their twelve pieces from their Base Line toward their King Row.  The object is the same as checkers: to eliminate the playing pieces of the opposing player(s) by jumping or cornering them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treckers comes with five levels of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 1 - Players move only away from their Base Lines (not sideways or backwards) until a piece is made a King, in which case it can then move any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 2 - Level 1 rules plus single pieces can move sideways (in addition to forward).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 3 - Level 1 rules plus players may jump their own pieces, thus allowing quicker movement across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 4 - Level 3 rules plus single pieces can move sideways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 5 - Players take opponents' pieces by capture, not by jumping (like in chess).  Also, pieces can move one or two spaces, but two spaces only if moving toward the King Row and not sideways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
