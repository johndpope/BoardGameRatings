			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sv&amp;aacute;zan&amp;yacute; Rukojemn&amp;iacute;kov (Bound Hostage) is a story roleplaying game about life in a shell-shocked city of historical merit, caught between two warring armies. The front line of the battle has shifted back and forth through the city numerous times, leaving the townspeople to be rescued by one army, only to have the city invaded and occupied by the opposing force in a recapitulation months later. With no end to the bloody war in sight, the city has become a refuge for those who traffic illicit goods, while its citizens trudge through their shattered lives, bearing the final cost. The only constant is war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
