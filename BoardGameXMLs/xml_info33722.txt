			<description>Hime-mekuri = Princess-flip. A home made card game based on the classic Japanese card game &amp;quot;monk flip&amp;quot;. All cards are amateur art of existing anime characters, and a fair number is pretty erotic.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing cards, and playing cards. Some cards allows you to add the play pile to your collection, others to steal some cards from the collection of others, and some cards are weird chain reaction that forces cards out of other players' hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
