							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trilania</name>
									
			<description>A fast-paced, multiplayer, strategy war game that utilizes custom dice. Assemble your army, build, develop, and conquer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the realm of Trilania, a world that has been ripped apart by magic in many ways...&lt;br/&gt;First, where once the planet was whole, a disruption in the balance of magic caused it to be divided into three layers: the Lowlands, which is the main land; the Midlands, and, suspended by magic above the Lowlands, the Highlands.&lt;br/&gt;Second, the land has been divided by war for over a century. Many of the Highland races believed their gods set them above the rest of the world, and it was their destiny to rule the lower races. Most of the Midlands strived for neutrality, seeking to open trade with the Highlands and the Lowlands. The Lowlands were divided into two main groups, those who sought only equality, and those who wanted to overthrow the Highland races. Some races, with the use of magic, altered themselves to resemble their animalistic gods, and the other races, realizing that this gave them physical and tactical advantages, followed suit. You must now choose which race or races you will command, lead them into battle, and form temporary alliances as you see fit. But choose your allies wisely and watch your back, because in the end, there can only be one victor. Always remember, the best laid strategy can sometimes go awry. Let the Dice Fly High!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play is pretty simple. Choose the team of dice which is kind of like building a typical card deck, except with dice. Each dice costs a certain amount Team Points (TP). You have 140 TP to build your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Teams consist of 2 types of dice Units and Buildings:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units - units do not have a TP cost. Each unit is worth 'X'amount of Man Power (MP)'X' is equal to the units level. MP is used to build addition buildings and upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;Level 1 units: Tend to be your weaker men&lt;br/&gt;Level 2 units: Are stronger then level 1 units of course&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buildings &lt;br/&gt;War Camps: produce level 1 and 2 units&lt;br/&gt;Secondary Buildings: give you various advantages through upgrades and elite level units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:  build units to destroy your opponents ability to produce troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
