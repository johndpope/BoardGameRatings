							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Bible Questions</name>
									
			<description>This 36-card deck is organized like a Happy Families deck into nine &amp;quot;books&amp;quot; of four cards each. But its play is based on answering questions about the bible, not on simply asking for cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card indicates which &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; to which it belongs, a topic word (such as Matthew or Calvary), two questions with Bible chapter and verse references, and one answer to another card in the same book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt six cards. Each in turn asks another player one of the questions on one of his cards. If that person holds the answer card, he hands it over; if not, he becomes the next questioner. If a player holds the answer and either doesn't realize it or refuses to give it up, he must hand over all of his remaining cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player completes a book, it is set aside and the one with the largest number of books at game end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
