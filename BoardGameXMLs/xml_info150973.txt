			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first installment of the Spell Works Compendium. We at the Spell Works have sought out some of the finest Arcane minds in the realm&amp;mdash;including the world renown Arch-mage Dimden and famed warlord Foegel&amp;mdash;and to come up with new and innovative spells to assist any adventurer to be more productive and effective out in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this installment we look at spells that temporarily grant the spell recipient with enchantments mimicking well known Feats. With the assistance of your local mage, you can now feel the excitement and thrill of firing a bow just like a professional archer, wield a long sword like a knight of the realm, or become the top dog in a bar fight at your local tavern. After all, if you can&amp;rsquo;t beat them, why not join them (at least in power)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you find this selection of spells enjoyable and profitable in your daily adventures and endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always wish your character had taken a different path when it comes to Feats? Well, our new Feat emulation spells allows char-acters to temporarily gain the effects of other Feats usable by most casting classes. Whether your character had archer envy or wished to have the brute ability of the local dragon slayer, now it is possible to at least taste some of those awesome abilities through the incredible wonders brought to you by the Spell-Works Compendium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spell-Works Compendium offers over fifty spells for the Pathfinder game system.  This tome offers spells that grant the effects of various Feats and includes rules to help keep them balanced within the game.  The main purpose of these spells to offer limited access to feats characters may not normally have access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
