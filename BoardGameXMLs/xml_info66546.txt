							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fisher Theatre Game</name>
									
			<description>A roll-and-move local interest game themed around the Fisher Theatre in Bungay (Suffolk, UK).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die to move around a board. If they land on an action space, they draw a card and then spend 10 seconds acting out the role described on the card. The remaining players vote on the act using counters. Depending on how the act is received, the player earns or loses audience tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to receive 21 audience tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
