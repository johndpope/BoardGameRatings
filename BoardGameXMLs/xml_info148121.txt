			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;There is a dungeon in the kingdom and each of the players represents a party of adventurers who has stumbled upon one of its entrances. Players take turns exploring their dungeon or throwing obstacles in the paths of their rivals. It's a race to the treasure room, while managing the finite resources of adventurers in your party. Cards represent dungeon rooms with different door patterns which can be placed in a labyrinthine manner until you have a 10-card dungeon path with no lurking creatures and no unexplored paths... as long as you have a hero left to claim the treasure, it's yours, and you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 126 cards, 12 hero pawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
