			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a damp, overcast Sunday in June 1815, twenty years of continuous warfare the Napoleonic Wars came to a violent and bloody conclusion on a rain-soaked field in Belgium. These wars were truly a world affair, with European powers fighting battles not only on the mainland of Europe but as far as India, Egypt, the Caribbean and America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest generals of the age finally faced each other on the field of battle; The Duke of Wellington, rooted to a little-known ridge, faced, the Emperor of the French. Napoleon Bonaparte, master of the attack, opposed brigades of British, Germans, Dutch and Belgians; brigades of an infamous army that, despite horrific casualties, clung to the ridge for over nine hours to ensure that the arrival of Bl«¨cher's Prussian army would put the Duke victory beyond doubt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Waterloo became a true landmark in military history, one that will never fade, and nothing on such a grand scale would be seen again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new starter set for Black Powder contains everything needed to start your campaign for victory at Waterloo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
