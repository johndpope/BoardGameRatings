			<description>In this issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, after our appearance on the front of RPGNet, our hits have gone through the roof lately, so welcome to all our new readers! Our fabulous June issue has heaps of good advice for GMs. Kevin kicks us off with tips for convention running, followed by Steve's advice on improving your action scenes, and then Richard reminds us of the hidden potential of dwarves. Meanwhile, Dan takes a reflective look at how both he and the industry has changed over the years in Once Upon A Time. And check out the Highlights because there have been a lot of exciting events in the industry of late, plus we feature the results of our reader survey. And congratulations to Shane Russell, winner of the set of Over the Edge cards, just for filling out his survey. Thanks to all who took the time to do the same, and keep the comments coming in!
