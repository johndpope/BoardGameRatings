			<description>This collection contains cards, dice, a 2-sided board, counters, and a 72-page book with 106 puzzles and answers, as well as rules for the following games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Number Nightmare: Number counters are randomly laid out on the squares of the checkerboard.  A number card is drawn and players look for 3 adjacent numbers on the board that can be combined in an equation to equal the card's number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Puzzle Piracy: Parchisi with squares that require you to answer a randomly-drawn puzzle card to progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Word Wizard: Like the Memory game, except that you are trying to combine a word on a card with one on a die to make a valid compound word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Syllable Storm: Players try to make words from the syllable cards in hand and letter counters drawn from a bag, scoring the total of the values on the counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The traditional dice games Craps, Rounders and Mexican.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
