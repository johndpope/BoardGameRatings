			<description>If you like games where a player suddenly sticks his tongue out to another player, where another player answers by flapping like a bird and where the players growl, squeak and grunt; where they moo, break wind(oops!) and pull their noses, then you'll love Crazy Harry, an outrageous card game with simple rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;One by one each player puts a card down on a stack in the middle with 2 drawings one them. The player who puts the card down chooses which drawing he impersonates and the other player must do the other one. If a player misses or is to soon, he must take the complete stack. their are a few exceptions like the fish (only the fish gets impersonated) and crazy harry (everybody must lay his hand on the stack, the player whose hand is on top, must take the stack). The player with no cards left, wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;with: 55 playing cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
