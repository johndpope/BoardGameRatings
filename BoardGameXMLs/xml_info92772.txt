							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tomb of Sigyfel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tomb of Sigyfel is a quick play adventure for the Labyrinth Lord fantasy role playing game, and is fully compatible with other Basic Edition games. It is intended for 1st to 3rd level characters. The adventure can be completed in a few hours of play, and is written and presented in the old-school tradition of classic dungeon crawls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The location presented may be placed near any settlement in the Labyrinth Lord's campaign world. This is an old-school dungeon crawl ripe with danger, wealth, and glory for those who navigate it successfully. The careless will join the dead within the evil tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally provided as a free insert with the convention bags at Gamicon Rho in Iowa City, Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
