							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Voldaria: The Midlands (Map Set)</name>
									
			<description>From the product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with all fantasy role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poster size player &amp;amp; GM maps for Voldaria Midlands. Maps detail the location of various cities, towns, and towers by size, plus roads, rivers, bridges, waterfalls, etc. This map is supported by AoV Kingdoms, AoV Dungeons and &amp;quot;Volondar: The City&amp;quot; maps sets. (Over 100 unique Castle &amp;amp; Dungeon Floor plans.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map set is designed for use with all fantasy role-playing game systems where travel out of doors is required or desired. To get from one place to another most people need to know where they are, and where they are going. Since the dawn of time, intelligent creatures have used maps for this purpose. The Midlands map set of Voldaria, details a little over one million square miles of terrain. (Eight 8x10 color drawings to form two 16x20 inch regional maps.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's map depicts the location of major cities, roads, rivers, bridges, landmarks, and unusual terrain features. The GM's map also includes hidden cities, isolated places, and the entrance location to several dozen dungeons. Several different icons are used on maps to denote size and type of city, fortress, temple, tower or dungeon. Icons used are not in scale with map, but intentionally enlarged to allow players and GM to quickly see what is where.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
