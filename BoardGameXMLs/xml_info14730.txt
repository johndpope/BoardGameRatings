			<description>Reality - &amp;quot;Sveriges farligaste spel&amp;quot; (the most dangerous game in Sweden) is a game featuring the all day life of a couple of petty criminals and junkies (the players' characters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook (translation):&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Reality is really easy to play. Basically, all you have to do is keep walk around and around, much like the inmates of the mental institution in the movie &amp;quot;Midnight Express&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you should raise enough cash to buy a one way ticket to India or simply kill the rest of the players. The most obvious way to make money in the game is by dealing drugs and making burglaries, but there are also legal and less violent ways... but they are quite few... It is also possible for the players' characters to start doing drugs themselves, which in the game mostly has positive effects (doing speed allows you to roll two dice for movement instead of one, for example). Not surprisingly, the game has received a lot of criticism for glorifying drug abuse. So... avoid the police, getting shot, getting AIDS and becoming a heroin-addict and you might just make it to India!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
