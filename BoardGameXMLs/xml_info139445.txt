			<description>The third game in the F-22 series of PC combat flight simulation games from NovaLogic. It has gameplay that is more accessible than some of its contemporary rivals such as the Falcon series, and is not so much an all-out simulation but more of a combat flying game for more casual players. The F-22 series gained legitimacy through the endorsement of Lockheed Martin, the makers of the real-life F-22 fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is not developed as a full-fledged simulator, it has included the &amp;quot;emcon&amp;quot; (emissions control) issues. For example, mounting weapons externally will cause the SAM radars to track the plane more easily. F-22 Lightning 3 features a host of real life F-22 weaponry such as AMRAAM missiles, Sidewinders, the 20mm Vulcan Gatling gun, HARMs, JDAMs, various types of iron bombs, and the B61 10-kiloton tactical thermonuclear free-fall bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six campaigns, with a total of 46 missions split between them (each campaign features either seven or eight missions, which must be played in order). The campaigns cover various hot spots around the world including Libya, Chad, Indonesia, Syria and the Kola Peninsula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-22 (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
