			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StuntMANIA Reloaded is a fast-paced 3D car stunt driving game that makes up for its complete lack of reality with an awesome arcade design and playability.  You will be placed behind the wheel of small cars on tracks full of jumps, loops, and all kinds of hazards. Among the vehicles you can drive are a taxi, a truck, a police car, a military jeep, and even a flying saucer!  The game also includes power-ups that you can collect during the races that give you the ability to teleport, jump farther, and speed up or reduce the gravity of the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
