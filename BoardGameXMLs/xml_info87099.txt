			<description>Hansel is too greedy and wants to eat all the cookies from the roof of the witch her house.  But he has to be carefull because the witch who is disguised as a pigeon will prevent him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board looks like a house with on top 3 places to put a card.  Shuffle the deck of cards and put three cards on these locations.  Then you put a pigeon figure on the roof in one of the three slots above a card.  There is also a Hansel figure, place this on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At his turn a player may turn over a card from the deck.  If the card doesn't match the card under the pigeon nothing happens and the player may take the card.  The player can turn over as many cards as he wants.  If he wants to stop he can take all the cards that he has turned over.  But if he turns the same card  that is under the pigeon then the player has to make the sound of a pigeon and take the pigeon figure from the roof to prevent the witch from coming down.  At the same time each other player may try to take the hansel figure.  The first person who does this gets the first card of the open pile, and all the cards go to a discard pile.  So the player who turned the cards lost all his cards (except maybe one).  The witch is then put in a slot on the roof again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player that took Hansel by mistake has to give in a card he won in a previous round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the drawing deck is empty the game stops.  The player with the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
