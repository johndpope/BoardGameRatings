			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A free game distributed on Game Market fall 2014, making a satire of the current meme that cool boys would impress girls by slapping their hand into the wall which the girl was leaning against, stopping her from simply walking away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action is called a &amp;quot;kabe-DON&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;wall slap&amp;quot;. Puru puru kabe don translates to &amp;quot;Trembling wall-slap&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a standee card with the picture of a girl, and four double-folded cards with the picture of a boy, holding his hand on the edge of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 1 folded boy card and one try each. The goal of the game is to tip the folded boy card so that it leans on the girl standee card, without the latter tipping. If the player succeeds, he gains 1 point. If the girl card tips, or the boy card doesn't lean on the girl card, the player scores &amp;ndash;1 points. If he refuses to try, he scores nothing. Play as many rounds as there are players, switching start player, and the player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
