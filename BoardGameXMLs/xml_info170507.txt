			<description>This game is about a competition between witches and or warlocks in the quest to find the greatest potion maker amongst them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing ingredients from the bag to use with ingredients already in the cauldron to fulfill recipes of all kinds. The board changes a lot during the turn instead of discarding unwanted ingredients back to the bag they are discarded to the cauldron. This burys ingredients that your opponent may need or burys ingredient(s) you are trying to make sure is safe for you to dig up later with a special Metamorph. Maybe you want to try and set up ingredients for a more complex potion hoping that it will still be there when it comes back around to you. Some of the potions allow it's maker to affect actions during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first witch or warlock to complete the required number of potions ends the game. Each person tallies up the points of the completed potions and subtracts the points of the uncompleted recipes in their hand and whomever has the highest score can claim victory as the world's greatest potion maker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
