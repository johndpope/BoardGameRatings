			<description>This game has been published by dV Giochi as a reward for winning the 2009/2010 edition of the Gioco Inedito &amp;ndash; Best Unpublished game contest. Powered by Lucca comics &amp;amp; Games and dV Giochi, the contest aims to identify the best new card game design from all prototypes received and to reward it by publishing the game in a fully professional and high-quality format, overseen directly by dV Giochi. All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published.&lt;br/&gt;For more information:&lt;br/&gt;giocoinedito@luccacomicsandgames.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.luccacomicsandgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.luccacomicsandgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to defuse a bomb by figuring out which wires to cut. The game ends when someone decides to defuse the bomb or when the timer runs out. The player who correctly defuses the bomb is the winner but if the bomb explodes, the player with the most agents out of the building wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
