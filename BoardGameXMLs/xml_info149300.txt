			<description>In ConSTARlations, players take turns using cards to place, move, replace and remove cards in order to make specific patterns on the board (as dictated by their secret pattern card). When a player's pattern appears on the board &amp;mdash; no matter whose stars are responsible &amp;mdash; they score the card and pick another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pattern cards are worth 1, 2 or 3 points depending on whether the pattern consists of 4, 5 or 6 stars. Players can score their pattern card during their own turn, but also during everyone else's! So they must keep their eyes on the board at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If either of the two Black hole cards are played, all stars on the board are removed and returned to their players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one of the piles of pattern cards runs out, everyone gets one last turn before players count up their scored cards to see who has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
