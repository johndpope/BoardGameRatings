							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Classes of Fantasy: Blooded Noble</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Civilized world breeds a different sort of Adventurer; Education and formal training to aid the running and management of lands crossed with circumstance has given rise to the Blooded Noble class. Motivated out of a sense of leadership, revenge or even pure boredom, the Blooded Noble heading out on the path to adventure does so with a much different perspective than most. Seeing the larger picture and motivations of others, the Blooded Noble has their finger on the pulse of what makes the world move. Rousing Speeches to aid their companions to greater heights of effort are the bones that make up the Blooded Noble class, while the ability to lead and inspire loyalty in others is its lifeblood. They are capable combatants, coming at war from a more theoretical and academic approach than some classes. Approaching life from an elevated social position has given the Blooded Noble the ability to shrewdly manipulate the merchant class in order to gain the best prices on anything they might need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
