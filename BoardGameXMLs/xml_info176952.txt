			<description>Players compete in building race cars. The cars are represented by physical models, which are assembled from a chassi, wheels, a seat, a steering wheel, and a variety of beams. Availability of car parts is decided by dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two, three, or four players can join in playing R&amp;auml;&amp;auml;cer Fr&amp;auml;&amp;auml;ser. Each player is to build his/her own racing car. The player who finishes building first will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To build, players roll dice. Each number on the dice correspond with a certain car part. 1 is the chassis (you have to start with this), 2 (which is required to come next) is the steering beam, 3 is the seat, 4 is the steering wheel, 5 are the beams, and 6 are the wheels (you need four of these). If a player gets a valid car part, he gets to roll again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is 100% luck but still brings some tactile fun assembling the cars. Of course, when finish, you can play with the built racing cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
