			<description>PrimePak - Four Card Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master multiplication, division and factoring skills while having fun playing card games with this unique deck of 171 cards. In all four games players form factor sets. Because 80 = 8 x 10, the numbers 80, 8 and 10 form a factor set. Factor sets can have more than three numbers. For example, the set 42, 3, 2 and 7 is also a factor set. Prime wild cards are used for prime numbers only. Adapts to 6 levels. For 1 to 6 players. Ages 7 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prime Challenge - Players in turn form factor sets from a 12-card (or 10-card) foundation. Challenges are made by opponents when a player overlooks factor sets or makes a mistake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prime Solitare - To win, a player must clear a foundation by forming factor sets. This must be done before going through the draw pile once, one card at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factor Rummy - Holding a hand of 11 (or 10) cards, players try to be the first to fill their hand with factor sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prime Canasta - A sophisticated Factor Rummy game. For serious game players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIX DECK LEVELS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PrimePak deck of 171 cards adapts to many levels by removing certain cards. Six deck levels are defined in the rules booklet. Players play with deck level 1 (then 2 and 3) until they have mastered the multiplication facts. They continue playing at level 3 until they learn to think of numbers in factored form. The rules booklet includes important divisibility rules and factoring strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
