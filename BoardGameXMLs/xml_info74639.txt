			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrek 2 is the video game based on the film of the same name. The player is able to play as Shrek or nine of his friends throughout the game, and travel through 11 levels, while being able to switch between the 4 characters available in each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrek 2 has a notably lower rating than the ESRB:T rating attracted by its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feature: Hero Time&lt;br/&gt;Hero time is the name given when only one character can complete a special task in a level. For example, Princess Fiona must capture birds for a pie by singing, Donkey must ride on Dragon to save Fiona in the carriage, sent tumbling down a hill by a spell casted by an evil witch, Little Red Riding Hood must fight the Fairy Godmother on conveyor belts as the others escape, Shrek throwing rioting peasants in the Police Patty Wagon, Gingy in Jack and Jill's Farm where he must climb the hill to fetch water from a well, Human Shrek and Horse Donkey in the mountain level where they must chase Fairy Godmother to save Snow White, Puss-in-boots must climb to the top of a waterfall, and Wolf must get a key to save Shrek, Donkey, and Puss-in-boots by surviving a Stairway of Doom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable&lt;br/&gt;Shrek special: Lift, Shrek can lift items and dazed enemies. He is the Ogre protagonist of the game and is forced on an adventure to save his wife, Fiona from Fairy Godmother's plans. He is willing to fight any monster to prove to Fiona's father King Harold that he is worthy to be her husband. His Hero Time is in Far Far Away, throwing rioting peasants in the Patty Wagon. Voiced by Michael Gough. &lt;br/&gt;Princess Fiona special: Time Slow, Time is slowed down to enhance her fighting, &amp;agrave; la The Matrix. Fiona used to live in a tower until Shrek rescued her for Lord Farquad. The two fell in love and by a curse of a witch, Fiona was turned into an ogre for her love. Now she is joining her husband to Far Far Away to meet her parents. Her Hero Time is in Shrek's swamp. She sings with the birds in such a high pitch they explode for Grandma's pie, a reference to &amp;quot;Shrek&amp;quot;. Voiced by Holly Fields. &lt;br/&gt;Donkey special: Burro Blast, A powerful bucking kick. Donkey is Shreks closest friend and although a bit of a coward, he is willing to help Shrek in any adventure. He helped the big guy in saving Fiona and now wants to help stop Fairy Godmother and save the marriage. He is married to Dragon who unknown to him, is pregnant with his Donkey babies. His Hero Time comes in the Witch chase level. Really it can be said it is Dragon's Hero Time as she is the one who chases and saved Fiona from a lethal fall in an out of control carriage as Donkey rides on her back. Voiced by Mark Moseley. &lt;br/&gt;Gingerbread Man special: Cookie toss, Cookies are thrown that attract enemies. Gingy is a Gingerbread man turned alive by his father the Muffin Man. He was captured by Lord Farquaad but now is ready to help his friend Shrek with his new adventure. In an attempt to help, he created a 20 foot little brother named Mongo. He got the group into the castle but slipped into the moat were Gingy is last seen morning his death. His Hero Time is in Jack's Farm where he must climb the hill to fetch water from Jack's well. Voiced by James Arnold Taylor. &lt;br/&gt;Lil' Red special: Poison Apple toss, Explosive apples are thrown. Red is a baseball pitcher who joins the group after hitch hiking with them to Far Far Away. Her Hero Time is in Fairy Godmother's factory. She uses her apples to hold back Godmother as the others escape. Voiced by Tara Strong. &lt;br/&gt;Dragon: Dragon used to be the guardian of Fiona's castle but after being defeated by Donkey has now fallen in love with him. They are married and Dragon is pregnant with Donkey's six babies. Dragon only appears in Level 2, Donkey rides her during his Hero Time. Voiced by Frank Welker. &lt;br/&gt;Puss in Boots special: Tightrope walking. Puss is an assassin paid by King Harold to kill Shrek. He is defeated and spared for help in the adventure. After all he ends up being one of Shrek's closest friends. His Hero Time is in the Road to the Farm level. He must use his tight rope special to bring the elevator down from the top of a waterfall. Voiced by Andr&amp;eacute; Sogliuzzo. &lt;br/&gt;Big Bad Wolf special: Huff n' Puff, Enemies are blown away with a gust of wind. This comes in particularly useful when the character is fighting on high places, as it can instantaneously kill enemies by blowing them away. Wolf is a little resentful at going through such danger for Shrek but is actually quite proud of his power. He is one of the creatures who helps Gingy in the jailbreak. His Hero Time is in the Jailbreak level where he must climb the &amp;quot;Stairway of Doom&amp;quot; to save Shrek, Puss, and Donkey. Voiced by James Arnold Taylor (and Aron Warner reprising the role briefly in the game). &lt;br/&gt;Tinkerbell special: Pixie Dust, Causes character to float. She helps Gingy plan the Jailbreak of Shrek, Puss, and Donkey and is quite quick to keep Wolf in line. Only seen in the Jailbreak level, she is the only playable character without a Hero Time. Voiced by Tara Strong. &lt;br/&gt;Human Shrek and Horse Donkey special: Charge, Shrek and Donkey run faster than usual and Shrek attacks the target with his sword. After drinking a Happily Ever After potion. The two turn into a handsome hero and a noble steed. The potion effects the love of the drinker as well so Fiona reverted back to human form and Dragon turned into an unseen Pegasus. Their Hero Time is in the mountain level where they must chase Fairy Godmother to save Snow White.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
