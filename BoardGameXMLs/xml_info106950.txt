							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pursuit of the Graf Spee</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game takes you back to the South Atlantic of 1939, where you command the Graf Spee in its deadly mission to sink enemy merchant vessels while evading the Allied fleet.  Or direct twelve patrolling British and French warships to search for and destroy this scourge of your shipping lanes.  The game provides complete ship ratings for speed and strength, fuel restrictions, and refueling capabilities.  Realistic rules such as varying weather conditions govern sighting and visibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've added a remarkable tactical combat system.  Like a real naval battle, firing is done from individual sets of guns, each with differing characteristics and accuracy.  Torpedoes are also at your disposal.  When it comes to calculating ship damage and its effect on firepower, communications and speed, you simply leave all the work to the unerringly fast computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's even a feature that nicely bridges the innovation of computer wizardry and wargaming tradition: You can resolve all battles by using your own World War II naval miniatures.  Just enter the results of your off-line combat and the computer will incorporate them into the strategic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains two scenarios, all played on a 19-by-19 square-grid map of the South Atlantic displayed in colorful Hi-Res graphics.  The first goes from December 1st to the 25th, which recounts the entire historic chase.  Here shadowing, pursuit, and elusive maneuvers are your primary concerns.  The second simulates the Battle of the River Plate, where the Graf Spee - already located - must deal with the Royal Navy's Exeter, Ajax, and Achilles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the solitaire scenario lets you match wits against the computer as it directs the Graf Spee.  At the end of the game, Graf Spee's path will be displayed, a pleasant elucidation and consolation for those who weren't able to locate this elusive prey.  We wish you the best of luck on your hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Joel Billings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
