							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Benjamin Bl√ºmchen: Lern das ABC!</name>
									
			<description>Four different game variants to learn the alphabet with Benjamin Bl&amp;uuml;mchen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color-Dominoes, where player have to match color-coded buffers of the waggons. If done right, the ape is in the first, the bear in the second, the chameleon in the third waggon and so on until the zebra in the last waggon. The player to match all of his waggon tiles first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color-Memo, where the train build in the first game is used again. Here, the waggons are turned on the other sid, where only a color and a uppercase letter is visible. All players use now the pawn showing Benjamin Bl&amp;uuml;mchen and a six-sided die to walk along the train. Where Benjamin stopps, the player must name the animal in the waggon. If correct, the player gets the matching card. When all cards are found, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A B C game. The waggons must be added in the correct sequence, the color-coded buffers are used for self-control. Can be played by one player or cooperatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where is my waggon? Each animal wants to find his own waggon. All the waggons are shuffled and laid out in the middle of the table, showing only the backside. The cards are also used again here. A card is drawn and the animal on it announced. The player to the right of the card drawer is the first to try to find the matching waggon. If he is correct, he gets the card, otherwise the next player tries it. When all cards are found, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
