			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a big fantasy setting for FATE, with the core FATE rules baked right in. Fate is a generic role-playing game system designed to offer the least possible obstruction to role-playing. Fate has a large number of innovative gaming mechanics. This game includes the Fate core rules and a fantasy setting in one integrated package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms (FATE Edition) is set on a fantasy continent, divided into realms. These realms include human city states, elven forest kingdoms, halfling mounds and dwarven halls. There are monsters roaming the wild places, and there is treasure too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This distinctive background, with a high-fantasy feel, integrates beautifully with the Fate rules to create an immersive setting where the GM's and players' imaginations can run wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF includes everything needed to start playing, with character creation rules, a bestiary, descriptions of realms and religions, gear, and some gritty detail on the advantages and disadvantages of various weapons and armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So start exploring this fantasy version of FATE now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
