			<description>Renegade Frontier is a designer card game for 2 to 4 players. Each player controls one of four factions (Cyborg, Genetic Elite, A.I. or Dolphin) vying to extract resources from the planets of various star systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a deck with cards numbered 3 to 10 in four different suits: warships, miners, explorers and smugglers. Explorers add planets to systems while smugglers take them away. Warships can destroy other players' cards and miners let players collect resources from planets. Resources are used to claim scoring cards, each worth a different number of victory points.  Additionally, there is a tech tree which grants players special abilities for the various suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are inspired by classic trick-capturing games such as Spades, combined with elements of European-style strategy games like Race for the Galaxy, Dominion and Basari.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
