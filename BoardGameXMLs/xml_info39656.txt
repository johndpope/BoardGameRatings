							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Stakes Fast Action at the Track</name>
									
			<description>High Stakes is a game of thoroughbred horse racing. There are 11 horses in the race, along with four other &amp;quot;scratch&amp;quot; horses. Four &amp;quot;scratch&amp;quot; cards are drawn to remove 4 horses and replace them with penalty horses. The deck is then reshuffled and players are dealt a hand of cards from the 44. Players are given an equal amount of 5 point chips, and they each ante into the Winner's Circle. Roll the dice and move that horse forward one space, if you roll a penalty horse you pay the penalty in chips. The race is over when one horse crosses the finish line. Every player with that horse's number takes an equal share. If you hold more then one, you get multiple shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
