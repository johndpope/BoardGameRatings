			<description>Klymo is played by two to four players, each with his own identical small board and six pieces.  The boards are comprised of a 6x6 grid of squares in three alternating colors, with a row of six squares on opposite ends marked.  The board is positioned so that one row, the starting row, is closest to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a six-sided die with three colors on it to determine placement and possible movement of their pieces on the board.  Placements are limited to marked squares in the starting row, of the same color rolled on the die.  Movements are limited to adjacent squares of the color that is rolled on the die, and only in a forward direction.  The first player to move all of his pieces to the marked squares on the opposite side of his board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
