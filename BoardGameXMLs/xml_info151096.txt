							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Half-Elves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Culturally, environmentally, philosophically, elves and humans are very different. Physically, they are similar - comparable in size, facial structure, and skin tones. Genetically, they are compatible. Given the basic physical similarity of humanoid races and creatures, elves and humans are among the few who can successfully procreate together. It is the fey defiance of mortality that is the cause of most of the problems of the elven-human bond...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An elf and human coupling is destined to be short lived or to end in tragedy. If the differences&lt;br/&gt;in culture do not end the relationship prematurely, the differences in lifespan leave elf widows and widowers. Legends abound of human heroes and elven princesses overcoming great obstacles of evil and tyranny, only to enjoy only a brief moment of happiness in their incongruent lifespans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half-elves embody the tragedy of their parents. Most half-elves grow up in broken homes, misunderstood by their parents. Half-elves reach adulthood slightly later than humans, but they reach merely middle age by the time humans are coming to the ends of their lives. When elf parents of half-elf children leave on decade-long campaigns, they return to find they have missed their children&amp;rsquo;s formative years. Human parents of half-elf children become convinced that their children have developmental disabilities, taking longer to acquire basic skills despite the elf reputation for genius intellect. Half-elves invariably grow up marginally aware of a missing component to their childhood, nicknamed the &amp;lsquo;soulheart&amp;rsquo;, and are frequently frustrated by their inability to identify it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rarely, a half-elf is born of two half-elf parents. Half-elves get along together in short spurts. Unless each half-elf fulfills the other&amp;rsquo;s soulheart, the awkwardness in one tends to provoke painful memories in the other. The most successful half-elf couplings are between a half-elf raised by elves and a half-elf raised by humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented here are several options for your half-elf characters, including new racial variants,feats, flaws, and equipment. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
