			<description>Publisher's description from website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;The object of the Q game is for each player to make a path of the specially designed pieces from the centre of the board to the two opposite ends. Of course, it's not as simple as it sounds. Your opponent will be trying to block you all the way! There are three different levels of game, Standard for the very young, Advanced and Tournament. The game grows increasingly complex as new pieces with special properties are added at the Advanced and Tournament levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;The quality is superb. Each game includes 106 pieces, a velvet bag, a game board, a book of rules, 4 racks, a score book and a timer. The board is strong, the playing pieces and racks are chunky and solid, and the velvet bag lined in satin is quite special. The Q game is designed to be used again and again and to last for many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT'S IT LIKE TO PLAY THE Q GAME?&lt;br/&gt;It's Fun! Addictive! Competitive! Sociable! The Q game requires strategy, logic, cunning and a little luck. It's easy to learn and you won't need a dictionary or a degree to play it. Every game is different and presents a new set of challenges. The more you play the more expert you become and the more challenging the game becomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
