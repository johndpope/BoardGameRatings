							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fifth Edition Monsters #02: Pustule Serpent</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Browsing through the Monster Manual, I realized that there are only three monsters in that book with a CR 12. Even with the tendency of having less high level monsters than lower level ones, I thought it would be nice to have some more variety - after all, two of those three available creatures are spellcasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I came up with this new monster, caled the Pustule Serpent. It is a venomous snake-like creature (albeit not really being reptilian, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a lot of difference). One key mechanic of this adversary is that a failed attack against it may spawn of its young right into combat, by rupturing one of its poisonous gestation sacks. Poison damage and more danger ensues!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other than the adult Pustule Serpent of CR 12 a younger version is also presented, having a CR 6. The key difference between them is that the older serpent has a poison spit attack and more damage resistances, making it a lot deadlier and also harder to defeat. Additionally the creature&amp;rsquo;s venom can be distilled into the highly dangerous blister poison, whose rules are also contained herein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
