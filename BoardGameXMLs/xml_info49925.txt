							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">No Cure for the Paladin Blues</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaving the dungeon probably seemed like such a good idea at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of the Stick: No Cure for the Paladin Blues continues the comic strip adventures of six stick-figure heroes as they leave the dungeon behind (they blew it up anyway) and explore the great outdoors in more than 200 full-color comic strips. In this second volume collecting Rich Burlew's smash hit webcomic, comedy and action collide as the unwitting members of the Order of the Stick find themselves caught between the Good Guys and the Bad Guys in what turns out to be kind of a big universal struggle thing. It's complicated, but there are crayons involved. As you've come to expect, The Order of the Stick delivers strip after strip of hilarious satire of roleplaying games and the fantasy genre in a world of spoiled teenage sorceresses, uptight paladins, and a small white cat named Mr. Scruffy. Your copy of our first book sits alone on the shelf and cries, pining away for the soulmate it might never know if you don't shell out the cash for this book. Are you so cold and unfeeling as to let its cries fall on deaf ears?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
