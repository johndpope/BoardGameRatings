							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NASCAR 99</name>
									
			<description>NASCAR 99 is a racing simulator video game game developed and published by EA Sports and co-developed by Stormfront Studios. Released for Nintendo 64 and PlayStation, it was the second game in the EA Sports NASCAR series of video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASCAR 99 received mixed reviews upon its release. The game was praised for its realistic graphics regarding the cars, although critics felt that the other graphics were &amp;quot;lacking&amp;quot;. Also, critics stated that the game was &amp;quot;repetitive and boring&amp;quot;, mainly because of the 17 tracks included in the game, only 2 are road-courses (Watkins Glen and Sears Point), and the rest are a mix of ovals, tri-ovals, quad ovals, and short tracks, which accurately reflected the mix of real life NASCAR tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NASCAR 99&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
