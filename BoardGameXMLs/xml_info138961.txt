							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Megadungeon!: The Catacombs of Chaos</name>
									
			<description>Designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Megadungeon! is a monster-slaying, treasure-looting dungeon delve suitable for the whole family.  Each player selects one of three characters, warrior, sorcerer, or thief. Each player, on their turn, draws a random dungeon tile, places it and moves their character into it.  Thus, you are able to explore a completely different dungeon every time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been nearly a year in the making, with nearly ten months of playtesting and revision, and the end result is, in my own biased opinion, a fantastic, family-friendly boardgame reminiscent of great old games like TSR's Dungeon! and SPI's DeathMaze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
