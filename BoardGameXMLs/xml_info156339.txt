							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brick by Brick: Doors</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every dungeon has doors. Each door has a story. More than that, every door offers a transition from one thing to the next. Some transitions are easy (no door at all or it's unlocked). Some transitions are hard (locked or trapped). Some turn out to be dead ends (blocked or jammed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brick by Brick: Doors offers a 14 page PDF to help guide you through creating more intricate doors as well as a one page worksheet you can use again and again to use as much or as little of the process as you desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you ever find yourself designing a dungeon or scenario and wondering what to do with the doors? Aren't they important? Most buildings have them. Yet as a game master, except for a few special occasions, I can hardly remember spending more than a second or two on any door. If it opens, shuts, and locks, that was typically good enough for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what about those cases where you want something unique but don't have any inspiration?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's where Brick by Brick: Doors comes in. Whether you walk through every single step in the book or just pick one, you roll a few dice and can see where they lead you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From beginning to end, we work through various stages or questions of design. Pick and choose which pages to use depending on what you're after. You might go through all of them while designing a particular door for a dungeon if it's a particularly important one, or you might just pick one or two to add a bit of color or uniqueness where you'd like it to appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just remember... Your door has a story to tell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
