							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lady Winter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Winter is a story roleplaying game about the land of Fey and the mysteries of the unknown. As druids, fey, sidhe, witches, and all manner of creatures prepare for the arrival of Lady Winter, the sky grows dark and the air cold. Characters take on the role of community leaders charged with bringing gifts to Lady Winter, in the hope that she bestows kindness upon them. But Lady Winter is fickle and her temper unpredictable. Will she bring salvation? Or will she toy with the land of myth until the thaw of Spring?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White as snow, cold as death&lt;br/&gt;Lady Winter comes&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Lo to those who refuse to bow before the coming tempest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
