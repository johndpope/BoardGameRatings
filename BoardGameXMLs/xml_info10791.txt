							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crown Red</name>
									
			<description>Crown Red  is played on an eleven by eleven board. Each space is either a white or black circle. The goal is to be the first player to move their crowned king onto the red home space opposite from where it started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with one uncrowned king and two pawns. On each turn a player moves one piece 5 spaces in order that the gravity selector shows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gravity selector contains ten black or white marbles in a clear column with a red base. At the beginning of a turn the player inverts the gravity selector and then returns it to its upright position. For example, the selector shows WBBWB. A piece must be moved first to a white circle. Next to a black circle and so on. A piece can be moved forward, backward or sideways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before a king can moved home, he must possess a red crown (small red marble). A king earns a crown when the player captures an opponents piece. Kings can be captured which results in the king losing its crown and returns to its start position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
