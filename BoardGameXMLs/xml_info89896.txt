			<description>Sonic Drift 2 is the sequel to Sonic Drift. It was released in Japan for the Sega Game Gear on March 17, 1995. The European version was released that same month as Sonic Drift Racing, and the North American release in November 1995. It added three characters: Knuckles, Fang the Sniper, and Metal Sonic. Sonic Drift 2 was the first game to feature Metal Sonic and Fang the Sniper as playable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, Chaos Emeralds are awarded for winning races. If Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Amy collect all six in the Blue GP, they will face Eggman (Robotnik's alias) in a final race around the Death Egg. If Eggman, Metal Sonic or Fang collect all six in the Blue GP, they will face Sonic in the final race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike its predecessor, this game was released internationally, and Sega Europe renamed it to Sonic Drift Racing, replacing the '2' from the title and releasing it as a stand-alone title. But only the name on the packaging was changed to Sonic Drift Racing, the title screen itself still used the name Sonic Drift 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sonic Drift 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
