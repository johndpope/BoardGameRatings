							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Acid Beth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing more deadly than her beauty is her touch&amp;hellip; Acid Beth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 10 Rogue, Acid Beth is the kind of woman every mother warns you about. Acid Beth is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acid Beth's file is designated &amp;quot;Red&amp;quot; to represent her innate power to disintegrate anything she touches. What makes her truly dangerous, however, is her modus operandi. She enjoys bending others to her will and then throwing them under the bus when they start to get wise to her. A thrill-seeker to the bone, she gravitates to power and is often encountered acting as a &amp;lsquo;lieutenant&amp;rsquo; to ambitious criminal masterminds or super-crooks. As a nemesis, she may mark one of your heroes as her next conquest, or for revenge if they get the better of her. Either way, she has left a trail of misery in her wake and will continue to do so until someone manages to stop her!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
