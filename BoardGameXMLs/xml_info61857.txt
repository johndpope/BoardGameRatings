			<description>&amp;quot;Diamond Mine is a game of diamond hunting for 2 or 4 players, utilizing Opaque pieces for hidden information, simultaneous programmed movement, and color dependency for scoring as notable mechanics. Players will set up the board by taking turns placing a large opaque piece that has been randomly filled with a medium and small colored piece onto the chess board. The players having placed the hidden information stashes on the board will then each turn place a card facedown on the table to represent how many spaces they would like to move. All players reveal this number simultaneously and may move any direction at that point but they MUST move that many spaces. If they cannot move that many spaces (due to board edges or exhausted veins or other players) they may not move at all. Players move to 'veins' and search for colored diamonds. Diamonds of their own color will be worth extra points at the end of the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond is an Icehouse game designed by Sam Zitin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, players will need 6 Icehouse stashes (2 of which must be opaque), a chessboard, three cards designating 1, 2, or 3, and an opaque bag or hat from which to blindly draw pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond Mine placed 4th in the Spring 2009 Icehouse Games Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond Mine was redeveloped into Iceminers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
