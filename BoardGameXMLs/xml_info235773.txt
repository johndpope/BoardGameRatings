							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Janus Womb: Pirate Base of the Splinter Moons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exilium Mission Shard: Janus Womb&lt;br/&gt;Location: The Splinter Moons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A human outpost orbiting the mighty gas giant Ocean, Janus Womb  was once just another of the small pirate operations of the Splinter Moons, preying on fuel supplies bound in-system from Mist.  Embedded in the shadowed crater of one of the rotationally locked rock and ice moons that orbit the planet and home to a small population, Janus Womb was home to pirates that were noted even among their ruthless peers for their daring and risk taking. But recently something has happened &amp;ndash; a mysterious and catastrophic attack from Unity has seemingly silenced the base. With its location known to Unity is now shunned by their fellow pirates, and the mystery of what rendered the base inoperable can only be guessed at. But that is all about to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
