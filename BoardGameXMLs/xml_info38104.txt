			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 2 or more players. Players are medical professionals working in a hospital psych ward. Match drugs to diagnoses to score points.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Decks: Players share two common decks: The Patient Deck, and the Treatment Deck.&amp;rdquo; Each of the 33 cards in the Patient Deck represents a patient. A Patient Card describes the patient&amp;rsquo;s diagnosis and treatment requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treatment Deck contains two types of cards &amp;ndash; Drug Cards and Contraindication Cards. The Drug Cards, a few of which describe &amp;ldquo;non-pharmacological treatment options&amp;rdquo;, are used to treat patients. &amp;ldquo;Contraindication cards represent ADR&amp;rsquo;s (Adverse Drug Reactions), Side effects, Co-morbid disease states, Drug interactions, Kinetics, Dynamics, Dosing, and Administration errors that would result in therapeutic failure.&amp;rdquo; The Contraindication Cards are used to negate Drug Cards played by opposing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Setup: Each player starts with a hand of 5 random Treatment cards. Determine Turn order (the player with the longest name goes first).&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Objective: The game ends when all patients have been successfully treated. The player, at the end of the game, with the most patients in his file is the winner.&amp;rdquo; A Patient Card is placed in a player&amp;rsquo;s file when the player completes the treatment of the patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
