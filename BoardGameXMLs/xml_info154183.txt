			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the End of the World, so Here's the Final Battle (#1 of 12)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least it will be, at some point during 2012 if the Mayans are to be believed. But they kinda forgot to give us the exact date, so we here at NUELOW Games will be offering 12 different Final Battles for the ROLF! Rollplaying Game. (Well... we hope it will be a maximum of 12. Who knows how far we'll get before we all die/transcend/become Republicans?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what better way to start a series of products marking the Mayan-predicted End of the World than with one featuring a Mayan Goddess? If there is one, we can't think of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grim Reaper vs. the Fertility Goddess: The Final Battle #1 contains three pre-generated characters (Ix-Chel the Mayan Moon Goddess, the Grim Reaper, and, making his second ROLF! appearance, Chuck Norris. It also features Traits, Combat Maneuvers, and a deadly new Spelling. And. last but not least, there are three exciting Battle Scenarios that see Ix-Chel and Chuck Norris battling Death, and Ix-Chel having to fend off an amourous Chuck Norris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mayans Predicted It! NUELOW Games Wants to Exploit It!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
