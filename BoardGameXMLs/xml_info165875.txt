			<description>In 3-Wide you decide how far to push your drivers abilities and the endurance of your race cars as you plot the strategy for a team of race cars.  Winning a race requires a combination of speed, tactics, planning and skill.  You will have to play the right tactics at the right time to improve your track position.  Each race car driver needs to decide if they should throttle back and save fuel, or scorch their tires making a charge to the front.  Will you risk a wreck, or play it safe?  Will you try a bold fuel strategy, or pit with the rest of the field?  3-Wide puts you in the driver's seat, and on the crew chief's pit box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tire of each car has four levels of wear.  These tire wear levels in turn determine the custom colored dice that you will roll to determine the speed of your car.  As the team owner you have a hand of tactic cards which can be played on behalf of your team cars.  Successfully playing tactics is dependent upon the location of other cars around your car, and the timing of when the tactic cards are resolved.  Driver skills are precious resources that can be used to avoid a nasty situation on the track, or to exploit an opportunity on pit lane.  Pit stops become necessary as your tires wear away, and as your fuel gauge is nearing empty.  Planning a good fuel strategy can be vital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eighteen different race tracks are modeled in terms of configuration, braking zones, tactical card deck composition, tire wear, and fuel consumption.  Each track also features two different race lengths so you can play a short game or a long one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning is everything, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t come across the line first maybe you can console yourself with how well your team did overall.  You can also string together a series of races and have a championship season!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
