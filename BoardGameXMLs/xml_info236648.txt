			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the summer of 1985. School ended last week and summer vacation has begun. It&amp;rsquo;s a time to create new memories and hang out with your friends &amp;hellip; since this may be your last summer with them. Times are tough. Most people in your neighborhood, mockingly dubbed &amp;ldquo;Backwater,&amp;rdquo; are behind on their house payments and a large development group has convinced the bank to foreclose on them. If they can&amp;rsquo;t scrape together the money to catch up on their payments by Friday, you&amp;rsquo;ll all be evicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As fortune would have it, you and your friends have stumbled onto clues to the vast buried treasure of Three-Leg Oleg, the cane-bound mob kingpin. Though it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that his treasure actually exists, it&amp;rsquo;s the only chance your family has to keep your home. Unfortunately, following the clues has led to you crossing paths with Oleg&amp;rsquo;s criminal descendants while they lay low from the law and they have no problem shutting you and your friends up permanently to keep their whereabouts secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
