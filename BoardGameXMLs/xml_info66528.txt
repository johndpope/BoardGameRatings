							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Raiders of Misty Ridge</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misty Ridge has been threatened by mysterious raiders that come at night and loot homes and businesses. Most who have crossed paths with the raiders have been slain without mercy. Those rare few who have survived an encounter with the raiders describe them as ferocious, gray-skinned creatures that blend with the mists and move with deadly silence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Regent of nearby Geldhart has been notified of the problem and he has sent the PCs to investigate and deal with the matter. Can the player characters solve the mystery of the Dark Raiders and restore peace to the once quiet retirement village of Misty Ridge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 1 new monster and 1 new character race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
