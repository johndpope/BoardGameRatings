							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Balls</name>
									
			<description>BigBalls represents an advanced development of EinStein würfelt nicht! and consists of similarly short rules. The neutral balls however do not allow to use the same successful strategies as in EinStein würfelt nicht!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wooden gameboard is triangular with 28 fields.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a color (black or white) with six stones each. In addition there are six neutral marbles, called Big Balls in the third corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it's your turn you may roll a dice and move an according numbered stone of yours upwards or sideways or you move one of the BigBalls downwards.&lt;br/&gt;You may beat (eliminate) own stones as this enables you to move faster. But this also bears the risk running out of stones that will cause losing the game.&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is the player who reaches first the corner of the BigBalls with one of his own stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
