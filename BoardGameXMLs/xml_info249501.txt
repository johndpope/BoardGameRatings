							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Things to Find in a Post Apocalyptic Survivors Backpack</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The post apocalyptic world can be a strange and dangerous one. What pre-apocalypse people may have thought of as everyday items can become the difference between life and death. Some items that are mundane to us now may acquire a far more grand status in the world that comes after us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is intended to help Games Masters by providing them with a list of 100 items that might be found in a survivors pack. Useful for your games of 'Pandora's Wake', 'Pandora's Fury!' or any other post apocalyptic RPG or miniatures skirmish game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every now and then GMs find themselves having to improvise this sort of detail and we all know how a mind can go completely blank at a time like that. We hope this product will be helpful to you. Please pay whatever you feel it is worth to you and happy gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
