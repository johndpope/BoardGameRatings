			<description>Crush Monster Rampage! is the sequel to the 2010 game, Smash Monster Rampage!. This expansion uses the same playing board, buildings, military units and dice but introduces a deadly new monster with new Monster Hit cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concept and Objective&lt;br/&gt;A huge multi-tentacled monster is attacking your city. From below!&lt;br/&gt;Mobilize your troops and exterminate the beast before every building becomes a heap of rubble. The victorious task force will score more hits and rescue more survivors than their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview&lt;br/&gt;Two players compete to rescue survivors and win the most &amp;lsquo;Monster Hit&amp;rsquo; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Monster Die&amp;rsquo; generates random actions for the Monster making the beast unpredictable and dangerous. It destroys everything in its path, moving effortlessly around the city on a tangle of amorphous tentacles. As it moves, the monster pushes tentacles into the ground, creating a network of tunnels beneath the city.&lt;br/&gt;Tentacles burst up through the ground grabbing tanks and helicopters and crushing whole buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns to move their Tank and/or Helicopter Units, players get into position to attack the Monster and its tentacles. Win &amp;lsquo;Monster Hit&amp;rsquo; cards by successfully firing at the Monster or tentacles and fulfilling the conditions on the cards. Act fast, If the city is flattened before the Monster is killed, the Monster wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
