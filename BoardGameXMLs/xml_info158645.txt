							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Olive: Gothic Line &#039;44</name>
									
			<description>ASLer and historian &amp;hellip; and Repubblic of San Marino  national, Gian Carlo Ceccoli has crafted a tasty bit of MTO history for you in GL44-OpOlive. &lt;br/&gt;The set combines a set of 16 historical scenarios set on geo boards from your standard collection-plus 3 historical maps provided in the set using the new lay-flat, hard boards. You also get a set of historical notes to bring the battle home to your gaming table. &lt;br/&gt;Gian Carlo poured his heart and soul into this effort-and researched it as only someone with on-site capabilities could. We kept the look classic and G.C. really shows a touch for straightforward, playable scenarios. You will NOT be buried in piece density. &lt;br/&gt;You WILL be buried in esoteric history! &lt;br/&gt;Includes a sheet of overlays, 3 maps, special rules, and a full scenario set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
