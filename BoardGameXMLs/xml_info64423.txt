							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Year of the Zombie</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;...are not the bodies of the dead returning to life, as rumor and public hysteria have claimed. These are victims of a bioterrorism attack, and any sort of vigilante killing of these victims are prosecutable as premeditated murder. In other stories, military atrocities in major urban areas continue as troops fire on unarmed crowds of demonstrators and panicked citizens. The President of the United States has asked for calm in this time of crisis, and assures the populace that the situation is well in hand. To recap the top stories...&amp;quot; - United News Broadcasting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It was stories like these that killed more people than even the six or so nuclear detonations around the world combined. People had no idea what they were really facing, no concern on protecting themselves, and lacked the degree of paranioa it took to survive those gruesome early days. Official denial, new coverups, blatant misreporting, and a lack of information killed tens of thousands, and those tens of thousands got up and killed. During all the initial savagery, you had to be savage to survive.&amp;quot;-From the Diaries of Becka&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chinese Zodiac contains many animals that years are named for. These animals have special signifigance for each year, each animal having a difference influence upon the events of the year. The Year of the Dragon, the Year of the Ram, the Year of the Rat, all of these have been repeated throughout history, and during each of them, the namesake of the year has had profound effect upon the year itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, however, is the year of something not mentioned on any zodiac. Something that will have a special signifigance, something that will have a direct influence upon not only events, but every living person in the entire world. Something that will bring about more than just a change in seasons, more than a change in the political climate. Something that did not care about religion, race, political leanings or personal philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, is the Year of the Zombie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year of the Zombie is a campaign template for d20 games set in current times or the near future, that can have slight effects that are quietly silenced and hidden from the general public, or world changing events that will forever change the lives of those who survive depending on the wishes of those participating in the campaign. Starting at initial infection and covering changes all the way through to fifty years later, and includes data on the human threat as well as environmental threats that spawn from the carcass of a dead civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year of the Zombie is recommended for Mature Audiences only, due to horror, brutality and profanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different types of Zombies in Year of the Zombie&lt;br/&gt;Specific classes.&lt;br/&gt;Military weaponry and equipment, as well as handling military equipment within Year of the Zombie&lt;br/&gt;Hazards other than zombies&lt;br/&gt;Changes to the world in general&lt;br/&gt;Rules on bartering in this dangerous new world.&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules for mutilating damage and horrific rules&lt;br/&gt;Adaptation of Bad Axe Games insanity rules to Year of the Zombie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
