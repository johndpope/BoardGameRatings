							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prime Suspect: Tajemnice Vileburga</name>
									
			<description>The authors of the game are proposing an alternative approach to detective stories. Passive watching / reading of a detective story turns into a dynamic boardgame, in which the players engage in searching out the evidence and investigating the complexity of the murderer's motives.  &lt;br/&gt;Each session is a contest of skill between the detectives and the Master of the Game in the role of the Prime Suspect. Exactly what happened and how? Who is the murderer and what was the motive of the crime? The choice is far from easy. Among the twenty suspects are respected citizens of Vileburg. Step by step the detectives follow the murderer's trail, carefully checking each trace, searching out anyone in any way connected with the case. The witnesses (once identified) are ready to testify. Their statements may help or further complicate the process of investigation. In this game everything depends on the deductive skills of the players: no one else will put together all the pieces of the puzzle into one coherent and logical picture.  And even when (and if) the criminal is finally caught (after the exciting chase phase of the game), it&amp;rsquo;s not over yet: the detectives try to deduct the motive of the crime, reconstruct the entire story from the scraps of data they have managed to collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
