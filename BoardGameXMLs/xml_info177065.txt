							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroic Hustle</name>
									
			<description>Heroic Hustle is a fully cooperative team-based experience for 2-4 players. The superheroes (that's you), lead the other heroes of the city into battle to protect a city on the edge of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wide range of threats will endanger the city every round, and it's up to the players to nullify them before they can launch an attack. By pairing up your heroic strengths to the weaknesses of your enemies, you'll be able to arrest the attacking forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These threats are only the first layer of danger, though. There's always a supervillain in the background working against Cascade City throughout the entire game. Even worse, the more progress you make towards foiling their schemes, the angrier the supervillain gets, and the more dangerous they become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As if all of that wasn't enough to keep your heroic hands busy, plot twists will change the way the game is played from round to round. One round might see the villains sporting shiny new weapons, while in the next your entire team might be turned into gorillas! As the supervillain's master plan unfolds, these dynamic events will force your team to work together and adapt your strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully, your elite team has plenty of resources to combat these threats. Some of the heroes in your team work better with each other and can join forces for massive, game-changing unite attacks! You can even summon entire supergroups to show the villains what havoc really means! Not only that, but the denizens of Cascade City are ready to fight for their homes. Whether it's the plucky news team alerting the populous of danger, the tireless repair crews rebuilding the city after vicious attacks, or the dashing Kelly Courier who risks life and limb to help your team get to where they need to be. And if all else fails, each player has their own special superpowers that they can unleash when the situation is dire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
