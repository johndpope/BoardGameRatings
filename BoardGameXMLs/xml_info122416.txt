							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Skyhome: Maztica and Spelljammer</name>
									
			<description>From the Intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Papa, Pachua told me the greatest pyramid of all time was found in Nexal, Axola said it can actually still be found deep in the Sands of Itzcala and Kapotli claims the greatest is in Far Payit. Who is correct?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your friends are fools. The greatest pyramid of all was once right above your head and is now lost to the ages. It is from whence came the gods in the ancient times, and some say it is both theirs and our own true home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-Poshtli of Tukan and Greatest of the Eagle Knights, to his daughter Chimalla in 1374 DR, the Year of Lightning Storms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAZTICA AND SPELLJAMMER?!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old timers really get it. Whether it was the Golden Age of D&amp;amp;D or not, anyone who has been in the hobby for at least the last two decades knows that the nineties was an era of exploration for the hobby. When dungeon crawls became clich&amp;eacute; and even some of the most cleverly written adventures became humdrum, discovering entirely new vistas in those fabulous boxed sets brought back a sense of wonder. The spirit of exploration was once again alive and kicking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Skyhome: Maztica and Spelljammer netbook revisits two of these wonderful settings and attempts to bring them together to enhance both settings. You will find both &amp;ldquo;fluff&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;crunch&amp;rdquo; in this book which can be used by gamers who dabble in one or both settings in their own campaign. Even those who have never heard of Maztica or Spelljammer could surely find something of use for their own private campaign in these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
