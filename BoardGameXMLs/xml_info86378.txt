							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planar Races</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this latest installment of the Secrets of the Planes series, Lion's Den Press tackles what is perhaps the most vital element of any plane, any setting, any world: the races themselves. Secrets of the Planes: Planar Races offers nine new player races, fully presented and ready for use. While their most obvious place is in a campaign focusing heavily on planar travel, they can easily be incorporated into more &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; settings as well, as travelers from far realms that most people could never dream of visiting. They might even, with the slightest of alterations to their origins, be made native to the world in question, perhaps being the result of magics run wild or maddened gods of elder times. Further, in order to enhance playability, none of these races has a level adjustment of higher than +1, and most are +0, ensuring that they can find use even in low-level campaigns. Discover the wonders of the planes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
