			<description>Animalball Melee: An OGL Gladiator Combat Game from Animalball Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Animalball Melee is a simplified d20 combat engine for quick and easy gladiator fighting. While it can be used for a full-fledged roleplaying campaign, Animalball Melee is intended for one-shot, pick-up-and-play combats. An homage to the Fanatasy Trip's original game, Melee, Animalball Melee is takes the d20 combat system and boils it down to its bare essentials to streamline combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Animalball is designed as a pick-up-and-play game. As author Mike Jones commented, &amp;quot;For players who are familiar with other d20-based Open Gaming products, Animalball Melee will likely be an experience that is simultaneously unique and familiar. The well-known Open Game elements are there, but everything superfluous has been stripped away until there is nothing left but pure physical combat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Animalball Melee is a 32 page stand-alone game of gladiator combat which utilizes a simplified d20 rules-set. Animalball Melee is suitable for two to six players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animalball Melee is a set of alternate man-on-man combat rules for the d20 system, heavily influenced by early Steve Jackson games such as The Fantasy Trip and Melee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
