			<description>A trivia game with a tactical component and direct confrontation (using cards to buy other questions/cards, stealing cards from other players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 300 question cards in five categories: geography &amp;amp; history, humanities &amp;amp; arts, science &amp;amp; technology, economy &amp;amp; politics, entertainment &amp;amp; sports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a player has to collect one card from each of the five categories. Each of the cards contain two or three questions. To win a card, a player has to answer all the questions (except for the &amp;quot;guesstimation&amp;quot; one) on a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and two cards are placed, face up, on the table. The front side shows the card's category and what types of questions it contains. Questions come in different levels of difficulty, and there are yes/no questions and &amp;quot;guesstimation&amp;quot; questions where a number has to be guessed. The active player chooses one of the two cards. If they can answer all the questions on it, they win the card, if not, the card is removed from the game. Then the pool is filled up so that there are two cards again, and it's the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can have more than one card from the same category. These extra cards can be used to avoid having to answer one particular question, or three from the same category can be exchanged for one from a different category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For questions marked as difficult, the active player can ask the questioner for a possible answer (which the questioner has to make up), turning it into a yes/no question. Not doing so, however, has an advantage as well: If a player can answer a difficult question without help, they earn an additional turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rule for the &amp;quot;guesstimation&amp;quot; questions (only when three or more are playing): Instead of trying for a new card from the pool, the active player can decide to &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; a player of his/her choice. The next player not involved in the attack reads the guesstimation question from the top card of the card stack. The attacked player has to state a number, then the attacker states his/her estimation. The player whose guess is closest to the correct answer may steal a card of his/her choice from the other player; that card now counts as one of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as one player has won one card from each of the five categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
