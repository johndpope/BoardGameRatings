			<description>Based on the PC auto racing game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A cardgame for 2 to 6 players. It tries to recreate some of the twists of the original PC game, but incorporates more than that: card management, timing of card play, bluff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The game is played on four regular rounds and a great Final Lap round. The regular rounds are the main moves of the race, where the players will struggle to better their positions on the race. The Final Lap round will be the outcome of all the tactics and choices made during the race . . . The winner of the race is the player which car has moved furthest on the track.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are in English, Italian, and French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
