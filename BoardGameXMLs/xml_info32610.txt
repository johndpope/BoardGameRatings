							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack Vector</name>
									
			<description>Attack Vector is a game of futuristic combat between ships in space. [The author has] attempted to add some realistic elements to the game, while keeping it fun to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack Vector is best when played with small fleets of ships, 3 to 5 per player. With more ships, bookkeeping becomes a problem. With less, strategic elements are minimized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack Vector is designed as a tabletop game. These rules assume you will be using measuring tapes as the only point of reference. However, if you would like to use a hex map, the same rules can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
