			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. Each deck (and surrounding water) occupy approximately 10x22 squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A carrack-style sailing ship. The top deck is shown both with interior and exterior views of the forecastle and aftcastle. The aftcastle includes the Captain's Quarters and stairs down to the lower deck. This deck has a mess room for officers and a large area for sailors. Below this is the hold, a dark area with barrels, crates and other stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Take your adventure across the sea, evading (or even becoming) pirates. Fend off sharks and sea creatures, seeking new lands and new treasures. The ship could even be in dock, and your party needs to sneak on board and stowaway without being noticed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    300dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map spread across 20 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    300dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing (gridded and gridless)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on VTT use - we have deliberately kept the quality of the file high, and you may need to resize the jpeg for use in your VTT software. Keeping the file size and resolution high gives you the flexibility to use the map how you want - crop out a particular section or use the entire map, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
