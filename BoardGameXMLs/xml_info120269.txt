							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red White &amp; Blue Racin&#039; Stock Car Action Game</name>
									
			<description>-From Plaay.com website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;RED WHITE &amp;amp; BLUE RACIN' sports simulation board game offers a unique way of re-creating a pro stock car race. Instead of tediously checking every car, every lap, the game uses a &amp;quot;highlight reel&amp;quot; method of generating exciting race action. You get right to &amp;quot;good stuff!&amp;quot; NO math exercises or constant index calculations and re-calculations--this game is NOT about crunching numbers. It's about high-octane thrills and super-charged race day drama! The result? A full race in as little as 45 minutes, packed with everything fans love about big-time pro stock car racing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;RED WHITE &amp;amp; BLUE RACIN' offers an assortment of different stock car experiences. The game comes with an &amp;quot;all star&amp;quot; set of driver cards representing stars of the past decade. For an additional charge, you can purchase a set of cards based specifically on last year's racing season, including everyone from the champion in the point standings to the drivers who ran only a race or two, and track cards for every racing venue at which a points race was held. There's also a &amp;quot;Stars of the 1980s&amp;quot; card set, allowing you to revive memories of racing's exciting past. Or create your OWN pro racing universe with a card set from our fictional pro stock car circuit, Stock Car Racing America--or SCRAM for short!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RW&amp;amp;B Racin' allows you to play through a race, including qualifying, with the use of 6 dice and a game chart.  Each turn a section of drivers, top, middle or bottom will be &amp;quot;highlighted&amp;quot; and drivers from the group will get a chance to move up in the race or maybe even take the lead!  But along with the excitment of the race comes &amp;quot;trouble&amp;quot; which can lead to a trip to the pits or even taking a driver out of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing a simple yet elegant system, each driver is rating on gas (passing), brake (defending against getting passed) as well as 6 racing skills.  Also represented is how good a driver is at qualifying as well as how good the pit crew is at fixing the damage along the way.  It is a quick system to learn, but you will be amazed at how it captures the essence of stock car racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information and for a more detailed description of a couple of turns, check out the Plaay.com website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
