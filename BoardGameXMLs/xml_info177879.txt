			<description>Harrie has eaten all your stuff. Try to pick them one by one out of his mouth. He's asleep. Watch out! Don't wake him, he'll grab your hand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the object you grabbed colored? Well done! Did you grab an insect or a black object? Ouch! You have to put the item back into Harrie's mouth and you lose one of your collected items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Harrie bites while your hand is in his mouth, you lose 2 of your collected items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 5 items, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a special scoring system for older children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
