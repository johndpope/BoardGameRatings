							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Berlin XVIII (Version Alpha)</name>
									
			<description>(Translated) from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item in in French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the alpha version of the core book for 4th edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been transfered to Berlin, the unofficial capital of Europe since the start of the war with the Great Russia, in 2037. And I have a good and a bad news. The good is that you are gonna lend into the presinct for sector XVIII. The biggest of the city, located in an old bunker built at the beginning of the war, when we feared the most. It is solid, with a lot of personel. The bad news? The &amp;quot;district&amp;quot; in question count 3 millions of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is in the title: Berlin XVIII, the RPG from the end of the 80s, will see the light in 2018 in a brand new version, using the Apocalypse World Engine. It will then be the first French game &amp;quot;powered by the Apocalyps&amp;quot;. Is it necessary to introduce the game ? I get a whisper that there are RPGers younger than 35.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
