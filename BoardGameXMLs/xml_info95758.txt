			<description>It is the age of iron.  Metal behemoths tame the wild frontier, leaving settled communities in their wake.  You are a captain of industry, seeking to expand your burgeoning railroad empire.  Your tools are the railroad cars produced by you and your fellow magnates.  Draw cards and place them wisely to earn big points.  Vie for control of public railroads and stock to earn extra bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Iron Horses, players compete to build the most lucrative railroad trains using a special deck of cards.  Each player starts with one train, consisting of a locomotive engine and a tender full of coal.  Players will add cars to these trains.  The cars themselves are produced by four manufacturing companies, each owned by a player.  Some types of cars (a passenger coach, a cattle card) are more valuable than others (like simple boxcars).  And adding cars to your train in the proper color order earns bonus points.  Don't forget about the public lines, though, which earn points for the players who have contributed most to their construction.  Finally, in multiplayer games you may purchase stock in other players&amp;rsquo; train lines, thus capitalizing on their successes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was developed for the Quick Print and Play Design Challenge:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/625604/quick-print-and-play-design-challenge-entry-thre&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/625604/quick-print-and-p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work-in-progress thread may be found here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6398031&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6398031&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
