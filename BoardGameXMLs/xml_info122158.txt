			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A space invaders clone. Destroy wave after wave of enemies while dodging their fire. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As the star ship SSF1D CUTLASS was moving out from Alpha Centauri and preparing for a warp jump to the planet earth in the year 2052, the ships communications equipment recorded oncoming signals on a wide range of frequencies. Captain King the chief officer, delayed the jump and the navigation computer spotted a whole fleet of strange looking alien ships, heavily armed with an assortment of lazer guns and nuclear weapons.&lt;br/&gt;THE PROXIMA WAR HAD BEGUN.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
