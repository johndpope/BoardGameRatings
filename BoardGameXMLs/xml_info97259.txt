			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You fumble with your backpack and retrieve the camera. This is it- these pictures are the proof you need to condemn the corrupt government. &amp;quot;Get a picture of the missile through the window,&amp;quot; Bjorn calls to you from across the room. &amp;quot;I can't believe it. That missile is powerful enough to destroy New York City!&amp;quot; you say in amazement. &amp;quot;You know what? I think I can disarm it,&amp;quot; Bjorn tells you excitedly. &amp;quot;I know your mission is complete if you get those pictures. But I think we have a chance to do more than is expected of us. It's up to you&amp;quot; Bjorn says. Working with the UN has trained you to be patient, thoughtful, and careful in your decision-making. But you've only used these skills debating from a podium with kids your own age. How will you react to the most important decisions of your life, made in the scariest parts of the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
