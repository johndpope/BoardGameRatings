			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many come to Poseidon to find their fortune, but end up eking out a living doing whatever they can to survive. The homeless and destitute abound; people without the skills to work in built-up areas, or survive out in the undeveloped wilds. Many die from causes both natural and unnatural, and missing persons reports are filed by the handful every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past several months, the amount of people reported missing in the areas around Haven and Second Try have jumped significantly. The jump in reporting coincides with the appearance of an illegal broadcast on CommCore. Somehow, persons unknown are hacking into various CommCore satellites and broadcasting bloody, gladiator-style fights from a location somewhere in the Haven Cluster. The people depicted in these fights don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be skilled or willing, and most fights end in the death of one of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEO, while stretched thin across the planet, can&amp;rsquo;t afford to ignore outright murder for entertainment. During the last broadcast, they finally managed to pinpoint the location to a small island in the Dolphin Reef area of the Haven Cluster. The GEO is looking for a group of individuals with different specialties to infiltrate the island, free those imprisoned, and stop the fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
