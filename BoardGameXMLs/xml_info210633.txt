			<description>MOTOSHIGE SPECIAL PURPOSE DRONE (&amp;ldquo;THE TABLE&amp;rdquo; IS THE UNOFFICIAL BUT VERY POPULAR NICKNAME FOR THIS MODEL) I LOVE THIS CHILD. NEVER LETS ME DOWN. SAFE, EFFICIENT AND CHEAP. THE INTERFACE IS SIMPLE, EVEN TO A CHILD. MY 8 YEAR OLD SON VISITED ME AT WORK. URCHIN WAITED UNTIL SOMEONE CALLS ME INTO THE HALL AND LAUNCHED DRONE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION USING THE SERVICE EQUIPMENT. MY GOD ALL THE ALARMS STARTED RINGING IN THE BUILDING ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOTOSHIGE MODEL IS VERY POPULAR BECAUSE OF ITS RELIABILITY. MICROMACHINES PRODUCED THEM IN THOUSANDS. IT&amp;rsquo;S PROBABLY 12 VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE. EVERYONE BOUGHT THEM ... UNTIL NOW WHEN NAKAMURA ENTERED ALL THE NEW DRONE MODELS. BUT I WOULD NOT BE TURNED. AS I SAID THEY NEVER LET ME DOWN. AND YOU CAN SIT ON IT LIKE A TIRED MAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PATRICK CHASEN - RAID44 SENIOR TECHNICIAN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
