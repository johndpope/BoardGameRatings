							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Game of Illustrated Proverbs</name>
									
			<description>This game of 63 cards uses proverbs with humorous illustrations as its teaching tool. The idea of the game being to collect the words that make up the proverb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twelve Proverbs are shuffled and dealt out to the players. The player on the left hand of the dealer commences the play by asking any other player for a card of any Proverb of which he holds one or more in his hand. If he obtains it he may continue asking until he asks for a card which the player asked does not hold. The right of asking in then transferred to him and he in the same way continues to ask till in like manner disqualified. When any player has obtained all the cards of a set forming the complete proverb, he turns them up on the table. The player who first completes all the Proverbs of which he holds cards at the commencement of the game, of which any cards remain to him as the game progresses, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
