							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warmonger (Fan Expansion to Dominion)</name>
									
			<description>This is a fan based print &amp;amp; play expansion to Dominion featuring 18 new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War and conflict takes its toll from land and men. Weary nobles fight over every piece of land, both by soldiers in the field, but also by deception and ploys. What yesterday was a fruitful part of your country might tomorrow be a ruined and burned land, or belong to another regent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warmonger focuses on player interaction with more added Attack cards and Action cards that mess with players in different ways. And then there are ways to interacts with Victory cards, both your own and your oppponents. Victory cards are no longer safe when they are in your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Breakdown (note that some cards are dual, so still just 18 cards)&lt;br/&gt;- 4 Victory cards (three supply; one basic, the 15VP Empire card)&lt;br/&gt;- 8 Attack cards&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Reaction cards&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Treasure card (in supply)&lt;br/&gt;- 15 Action cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the file section you will find the Rules PDF and the Card Sheet PDF; all you need to print &amp;amp; play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
