			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s pretty rare you see someone walking around that was alive before it happened. Sure, plenty of folks you meet look to be about a hundred, but it ain&amp;rsquo;t time that wore them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once in a great while, you may come across an old codger that came by his gray hair the old fashioned way &amp;ndash; by living a long time. Most of &amp;lsquo;em are obviously crazy, driven mad by who knows what part of the psychic feedback that rushes in at unguarded moments. Most of the rest have been crippled by mistakes (made by them or others) when they weren&amp;rsquo;t spry enough anymore to get out of the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are a few old-timers that remain nimble and seem to have held onto most of their wits. Along the way they&amp;rsquo;ve picked up some tricks that keep them breathing in the newly harsh world. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that they have some memory of the before times, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily willing to talk about it. No, they&amp;rsquo;re just trying to make their way, same as everyone else, relying on what they have and what they can get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
