							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BASH! Fantasy: Character Build Templates</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet contains 45 packages of 5 Character Points worth of powers that can be used to quickly generate a BASH! Fantasy character. To build a 25 Character Point character, just pick two Templates, buy your Stats, and spend any remaining Points to fill out your character. Each Template also includes some suggested Skills, Advantages, Disadvantages and starting equipment ideas to get you up and running in no time. Each Template also suggests other templates that make &amp;quot;Classic Combos&amp;quot; for some iconic builds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've also included two methods of random character building. You can roll on a table (with some Templates being rarer than others), or you can assemble a deck of the included printable cards. This is also really helpful for a Narrator to quickly generate NPCs. Stats can also be randomly generated for those seeking an especially &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the end, there is also an Appendix of new Powers, Equipment, and Options. This already appeared in the Folio of Magic Items, but we wanted to make it available here as well. Two of the Templates (Halberdier, and Skirmisher) use these options. The Energy &amp;amp; Armor Option also gets a slight update here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
