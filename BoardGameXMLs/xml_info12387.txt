			<description>Operation Badr, The Syrian Assault on the Golan Heights, Oct. '73 is a fast-paced game of the battles on the Golan Heights in 1973. Players learn to deal with the complexities of modern armies through playable rules that simulate the differences in doctrine and organization between the two sides as they strive for victory. The role of aircraft and of the antiaircraft missile is vividly portrayed through an easily mastered air power system. Engineers, artillery, fortifications, and supply each play their historic function in achieving victory or staving off defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;On October 6, 1973, the people of Israel gathered to celebrate Yom Kippur, the most solemn of Jewish holidays. At five past two in the afternoon, Jerusalem time, their tranquility was shattered by massive artillery and aerial bombardment along both Egyptian and Syrian borders. Syria's Operation Badr had begun. Across the so-called &amp;quot;Purple Line&amp;quot;, a Syrian torrent, spearheaded by some 1,500 tanks and 1,000 guns, poured across the Golan Heights. Against them stood two understrength Israeli brigades with a total of approximately 180 tanks and 60 guns. The Syrian intention: to drive to Haifa and cut Israel in two.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;300 Counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of play:&lt;br/&gt;1. Air Unit Assignment&lt;br/&gt;2.
