							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nova Race</name>
									
			<description>A racing game aimed at younger children, NOVA RACE has elements of classic games such as Chutes and Ladders, The Game of Goose and Sorry to name a few. It has a space theme in which each player represents a different company racing to be the first to reach the Nova. Simple roll and move mechanics move the player along, while various spaces on the board have differing symbols which represent a specific action. A guide is included to explain the meaning of each symbol. As in life, the players will encounter events which both help and hinder their race to the nova. Suggested   Ages 5 and up. Suggested number of players is 2 to 4. Estimated playing time is 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
