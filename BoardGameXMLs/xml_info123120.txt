							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Qalashar Device</name>
									
			<description>From the back page of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information gathered from a raid on a drug smuggling waystation near the village of Ashkashem has led Great Britain's Secret Intelligence Service to investigate an abandoned vehicle repair facility near the town of Qalashar along Albenistan's border with Afghanistan. It seems the abandoned facility is abandoned no more. Someone has occupied the base, but for what purpose? Worse, a letter recovered in the Ashkashem raid refers to a device or weapon that will 'strike fear in the hearts of the enemy and destroy their feeble resolve.' What kind of device could be hiding at the Qalashar facility? Fear of what this weapon might be and how it could be used has lead the SIS to reactivate the Increment unit that successfully completed the raid on Ashkasham. Their mission: discover who has occupied the Qalashar facility and neutralize any threat that might be posed by the Qalashar Device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Qalashar Device is an adventure for 4 to 6 character of levels 9 to 11 using the D20 Modern Roleplaying Game. This supplement can be used as a stand-alone adventure as as an introduction to the Albenistan Series. The Albenistan series consists of 3 adventure supplements from SEP Spec Ops line. The Qalashar Device was preceded by Raid on Ashkashem and will be followed by The Khorforjan Gambit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the adventure this supplement includes extensive write-ups for 4 &amp;quot;named&amp;quot; villains with histories, 2 SAS operators and sundry minor villains, statistics for 8 vehicles and 6 new heavy weapons as well as the Special Operations Marksman prestige class, information on the fictional country of Albenistan, 4 new or updated feats and entries on 3 organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
