							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhapsody of Blood</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An endless war against an evil castle from outside our world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every generation the blood moon rises, and the castle exalts a villain with its dark gifts. They shall command its legions, use its powers to twist reality, and seek the godlike power of the unholy grail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re here to stop them. Your bloodlines have fought the castle since its first emergence, and that legacy has granted you endless tenacity, strange powers, or unbreakable faith. Together, you will root out the wards of the castle where they have infested the mundane world, slay the acolytes of the castle&amp;rsquo;s regent, steal their dark power for your own and banish the regent and the castle with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the castle is immortal, and the blood moon will rise again. As generations rise and fall, what tales of heroic action and gothic bloodshed will you tell?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Blood-Soaked Action: The Powered by the Apocalypse ruleset has been finely tuned to suit the exploration of a nightmare castle and dynamic fights against memorable adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;     Generational Storytelling: An episodic game structure can take your story from the dark ages to the modern day, with the outcome of one generation affecting the dangers of the next.&lt;br/&gt;     Character Diversity: Five different Bloodlines combine with five customisable Explorer types to make every generation of heroes meaningfully different.&lt;br/&gt;     Ready to Go: With complete game rules, examples of play, GM advice and a prologue that teaches you the game as you go, this book has everything you need to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
