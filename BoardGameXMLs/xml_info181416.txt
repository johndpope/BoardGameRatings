			<description>[Taken from the site description.]&lt;br/&gt;While the denizens of the frozen north are divided by race and culture, the pantheon of 24 major gods is a universal concept. Though forbidden from direct interference, the gods are not removed from the world, making their presence felt through their paladins and priests, divine heralds, and natural events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether they pay lip service to many gods, attend infrequent ceremonies, have chosen a patron deity, have devoted their life without holy vows, or have taken vows as a member of the clergy, all citizens honor the gods in some way. To deny the gods is to deny reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded information on the clergy of the 24 major cults.&lt;br/&gt;     Details concerning over 90 major and 70 local festivals, any of which can be used as the backdrop to an adventure or to make the heroes&amp;rsquo; day more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;     Information on 12 major inhuman deities.&lt;br/&gt;     A tour of Godsheim, the realm of the gods, and the celestial sphere.&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the Abyss, including the Arcane Background (Demonist) and a sample of notable demon lords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is designed for use in conjunction with the Hellfrost Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
