			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the bank raging river Kyrne, where it narrows, priests keep a holy vigil in a storied spire, the Godswatch. Consecrated in the name of countless gods, the site of a great triumph for the god of the local river, the tower is sought out by pious pilgrims and frequented by inquisitive priests, for few have as much knowledge of distant or esoteric religions as its caretakers. Faith, the tower&amp;rsquo;s priestess, welcomes every traveller regardless of his or her purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the Godswatch is also a watchtower. Not only does it dutifully protect one of the few crossings of the river, it safeguards against the return of the evil vanquished by Kyrne long ago. Though they are welcoming, the caretakers are also watchful, ready to stand against anything that might break the peace they keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
