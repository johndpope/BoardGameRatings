			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faial is a simple RPG modelled after choose your own adventure gamebooks. The player leads the hero, a young knight eager for adventure, who soon finds himself unwittingly part of a sorcerer's plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with character creation. The character's abilities are randomised and are used to compute skill values (like climbing or dodging). Once a character is created, the game plays like a gamebook: the player picks a choice among several, the game describes the consequences, then the player picks a choice, and so on. Combat is automatic, and can only result in death for either the character or the opponent(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
