			<description>Taken from the description of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new and very comical game for two or three people. Metal Figures of darkies with moveable arms, racing along three poles. Their comical actions are very funny. All start at the same time and it is exceedingly amusing to see the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
