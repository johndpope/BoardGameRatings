			<description>Sei stark. Sag Nein! is aimed at teaching kids how to react to dangerous situations with strangers. It consists of cards in three colors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Red cards show a picture and ask a multiple choice question about how to behave in the corresponding situation. The player should give the right answer and also explain why she thinks it's right.&lt;br/&gt;    Green cards demand physical tasks of the players and are aimed at strengthening the physical self-conscience.&lt;br/&gt;    Blue cards train observing skills: The players see a picture and are asked questions about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing a card; a moderator poses the questions. Each correct answer or fulfilled task is rewarded by a point. After a pre-determined time, the player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
