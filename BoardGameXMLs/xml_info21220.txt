			<description>Powerball Das Spiel is played within a wooden frame that is assembled in two halves.  The playing surface or pitch slopes down from the middle to the two ends where the players stand.  In the center of the pitch is a small indentation.  A ping-pong (table tennis) type ball is placed in the indentation.  The players each have one or more wooden shoots under their control, which they use to launch ball bearings at the ping-pong ball.  In front of the shoots at each end is a bar or barrier.  This is suspended just above the playing surface so that there is sufficient room for the ball bearings to run underneath, but not the ping-pong ball.  In the center of the bar the gap is higher.  This is the goal area where the ping-pong ball can also run underneath.  The idea of the game is to launch the ball bearings at the ping-pong ball and direct the ping-pong ball into the opponent's goal.  Play can be to a specific number of  goals or for a particular time period, with one to three players on each team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
