							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Iron Bastion</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iron Bastion is the first of three major story arcs for the Sundered Realms setting. Characters start at 1st level. They should be approximately 7th to 8th level by the end of this group of adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is optimized for four to five characters. If there are more or less players in the group, the encounters should be easily adjustable to accommodate party size.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Over a century has passed since the Mithrendai were defeated and sealed away in the Maw of Oblivion. This, however, did not completely stop evil forces from attempting to harness the destructive force that once threatened to devour the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is subtitled Preview - Blight of the Bandit's Blade; it is a playable scenario that is intended to preview/introduce an adventure path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is provided in a &amp;quot;high resolution&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;low resolution&amp;quot; format, for screen viewing and printing, respectively.  They otherwise are identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
