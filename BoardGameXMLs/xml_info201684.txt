							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baantjer: Plaats Delict</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the Dutch TV series &amp;quot;Baantjer&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;There have been a number of killings in the city and you are put on the case as a detective. The case consists of a suspect, a motive, a weapon, a corpse and a trace. Gather evidence at the scene as quick as possible, and trace the fingerprints of the suspect. Subject your opponents with some hard cross-examination and try to discover important information. Write down your findings with precision and finish the crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you succeed as the best crime detective, you can call yourself &amp;quot;baantjer&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players play the role of a detective and a murder. The murder that everyone did consists of five hand cards. Those five cards are a suspect, motive, weapon, corpse and a trace. Every player tries to find out which cards the other players have in their hands. In a players turn, a player is allowed to ask a question to another player that can only be answered with &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. If answered with &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; you are allowed to ask another question, if answered with &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; the turn moves on to the next player. &lt;br/&gt;Asking questions is done with the cards laying face-up on the table with all the case items in a pattern. Every player writes down what he thinks is helpful for his investigation and tries to score points with the right questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is only one player left with cards in his hands and a murder that has not bin solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
