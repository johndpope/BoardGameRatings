							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fleet Street</name>
									
			<description>Fleet Street is a set collecting game based on buying and selling newspapers. The value of a set depends on how up market the publications are - lowest points are awarded for evening papers (6) then provincials (16), then dailies (24), then Sundays (32) then weeklies (40) then magazines (48). The players don't wait turns but on the word &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; from the dealer start shouting the name of the paper they want to sell by trading cards. The first to collect a complete set and lay them down shouts &amp;quot;Fleet Street&amp;quot; and scores the points for that set. The cards are reshuffled and dealt again. Winner is the first to reach 250 points.&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 48 newspapers/magazines have their own individual depiction of the front page - the magazines are especially colorful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
