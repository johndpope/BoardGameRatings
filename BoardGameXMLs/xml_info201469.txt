			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the near future, the world has gotten worse. Groups of kids, sometimes from the same town or school and sometimes from all over the nation, are kidnapped and put into grand arenas and forced to fight to the death on national TV. Some say it&amp;rsquo;s solely for entertainment, some say it&amp;rsquo;s to send a message, and others have even wilder theories. One thing&amp;rsquo;s for sure &amp;ndash; only the last one standing makes it out alive. The players play as these young people in their struggle for survival against overwhelming odds. Some may try to escape, others will embrace the battle, but ultimately what happens is up to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free version of the game is distributed as a ZIP archive including the HTML game document and several supporting PDF files, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Basic Moves (rules)&lt;br/&gt;- GM Moves (rules)&lt;br/&gt;- Blank Sheets (print-and-play components)&lt;br/&gt;- Contestant Set One (pre-generated characters)&lt;br/&gt;- The Volcanic Island (setting; combat arena)&lt;br/&gt;- Stern Researcher (sample character)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
