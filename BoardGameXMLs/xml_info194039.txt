			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Race is a fast paced drag racing game where each player tries to get to the finish line first! Pick a color, take the matching components and roll the dice. With a little luck you might become the ultimate racing champ!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Race features a fun dice mechanic where everyone rolls their dice at the same time and compares results to determine how their race cars move along the track. The Race is heavily based on chance, but uses a bit of strategy with a well timed boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a great filler game that can be played by nearly all ages. For shorter or longer games all you have to do is change the track length, so it's modular as well! Pick up The Race today and see who, among your friends and family, is the ultimate racing champ!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
