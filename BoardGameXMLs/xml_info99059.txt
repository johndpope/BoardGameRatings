			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         The information that BGG has on this item indicates that Cannonball Capture is a non-authorized version of Piratenbillard.  According to designer Reinhold Wittig, HearthSong does not have license to produce this game, thus it is set apart from the official entry of Piratenbillard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played on a board made of a wooden grid that has canvas or cotton cloth stretched underneath it.  Play consists of using mallets to strike under these grid spaces to move the wooden balls that are in the grid.  The general goal of the game is to capture opponents' pieces by making a player's own pieces land in a space with other pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
