			<description>&amp;quot;An exciting word game to improve spelling skills&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an educational board game for elementary school children. It is designed to be enjoyed by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three sets of cards (Letter, Spellbound, and Bonus) are placed face down and the players roll dice to move around the board. The contestant must then draw a card matching his or her current space on the board. Letter cards are relatively simple words while Bonus cards are more difficult to spell. Spellbound cards are simple vocabulary questions that also require proper spelling. A variable number of points are scored depending on the difficulty of the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total points awarded are recorded on an erasable score card. A round ends when the card is filled up. A session may consist of multiple rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes board, cards, pawns, dice, marker, and score chart. The rules are printed on the inside of the box lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
