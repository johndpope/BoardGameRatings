			<description>Two players face off in this unconventional turn-based, patent pending board game developed by late Hungarian inventor J&amp;oacute;zsef Vad&amp;aacute;sz. Exercising one&amp;rsquo;s spatial reasoning skills, this innovative game rewards a fine balance between carefully planned strategy and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hexagonal board with several rows of holes. Each player has two pieces. One piece contains five holes and is long enough to cover five holes in the board; the other piece contains three holes and covers three holes in the board.  Players take turns inserting a peg through a hole in one piece/board and then pivoting the piece into a new position. A player loses when one of his pieces is unable to make a move at the beginning of his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
