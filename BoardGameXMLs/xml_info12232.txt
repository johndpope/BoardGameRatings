			<description>Play the stock market with Wall Street Spin&amp;trade;, the fast-paced Award Winning stock market board game from FunSpin&amp;reg;! Experience the ups and downs of the market, without risking your shirt. You&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy the whimsical stock names, cheer when the spin goes in your favor and be on the edge of your seat wondering what the market will do for you (or to you) next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for ages 10 to Adult and 2-6 players, Wall Street Spin was made with fun and learning in mind. Basic math skills are honed, while newcomers to the stock market get to feel like Wall Street tycoons when learning and using market lingo. Adults and kids will both develop their own unique investing strategy while gaining an appreciation for how quickly fortunes can be built-up and lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple to learn and highly fast-paced with handfuls of cash being exchanged on almost every turn, Wall Street Spin&amp;trade; is fun for every aspiring tycoon, number cruncher, wheeler and dealer and haggler in your family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move around the board buying up stocks. The more stocks you buy in a group, the more valuable they all become. Land on someone else's stock, and spin the wheel to find out what dividends you owe them. Buy all the stocks in a group and you'll be rolling in the dough, but don't get too comfortable at the top; market events can break up those holdings and change your fortune in a spin. Bull and Bear News cards offer chance for a Hostile Takeover of another players stock or the loss of one of your own. Day trading can quickly multiply your investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games can last as short or long as you want, and time limit rules keep the game moving fast. Agree on a friendly hour long game or play a marathon session until one of you is in the poor-house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4Wall Street Spin5 homepage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
