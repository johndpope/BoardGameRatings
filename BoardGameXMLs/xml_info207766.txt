			<description>St. Michael is a city on the Great lakes. In it's industrial zone is a well guarded compound owned by a well respected multi-millionaire. The company is repute to be working on a covert Navy program and their security is formidable. There are several security checkpoints, video surveillance, and a well trained guard force. Our initial investigation has found no official confirmation of such a program, but this may be due to a bureaucratic mix-up. Unconfirmed reports of an alien craft within the compound have compelled us to authorize a mission to investigate what is going on. Is the activity within the compound a secret government program, or are there external forces at work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Xenoforce adventure module is recommended for 3-8 characters and is suitable for all experience levels. This module deals with violent situations and parental/guardian supervision is recommended to minors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
