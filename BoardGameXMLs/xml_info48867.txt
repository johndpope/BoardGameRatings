			<description>Bourre (pronounced &amp;quot;boo-ray&amp;quot;) is a trick-taking card game similar to Spades. It is widely played in Louisiana, particularly within the Cajun culture and on the off-shore oil platforms near the Louisiana Gulf Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bourre uses a standard 52-card deck. Players ante up and are dealt a five card hand. They may then &amp;quot;fold&amp;quot; or continue, swapping out up to all five cards (in some variants they will re-ante to play a hand). The rules are fairly straightforward:&lt;br/&gt; (from Wikipedia entry):&lt;br/&gt;   1. You must play to win. This goes beyond simply &amp;quot;playing a higher card&amp;quot;; if you know that no one else has any trumps, and it is your turn to lead, you must play trumps if you have them.&lt;br/&gt;   2. You must play on-suit if possible, even if your highest on-suit card will not beat the highest card in play. Even if a trump has been played on a non-trump lead, if you have a card of the suit led, you must play on that suit.&lt;br/&gt;   3. You must play a trump if you have no on-suit cards. You still must play to win; if the only trump played is a 3, you hold the 2 and the Ace of trumps but no cards of the lead suit, you must play the Ace of trumps.&lt;br/&gt;   4. If you have neither any cards of the lead suit nor any trumps, you may play any card. This is an off card, and is effectively lower than the 2 of the lead suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, the person with the most tricks, takes the pot. If there is a tie, the pot stays in for the next round. If one of the players who played a hand did not take any tricks at all, he is said to have &amp;quot;bourreed&amp;quot; and must match the pot as his ante for the next round. Needless to say, the pot can get quite large, especially with larger groups playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
