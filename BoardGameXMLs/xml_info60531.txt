			<description>From the rules:  The Nowhere Land Beach Ball Factory has blown its stack, scattering beach balls throughout the land.  The turtles of Turtle Coast have found many of hte balls and they are now hidden beneath their shells.  Travel throughout Nowhere land looking for the turtles and the missing beach balls.  Try to find the matching color ball under the turtle shell.  The player who finds the most balls and returns them to the Beach Ball Factory wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is related to Maggie and the Ferocious Beast according to an emblem on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
