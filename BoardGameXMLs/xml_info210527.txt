							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mad Duke</name>
									
			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Regional Scenario Set in the Nyrond Imperium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the city of Mithat the forces of Sewarndt have effectively taken control. Scarlet robes and Hextorian cloaks patrol the streets. Trade is strangled, as ships are often searched or seized and most refuse to run the harbor blockade. Citizens are questioned and many disappear &amp;ndash; never to be seen again. And through it all the Mad Duke Younard still suffers from his mental collapse of the night Rel Mord fell. A mere shell of his former self, the new government uses his mad ravings and periodic fits to issue whatever proclamations they desire. Now, as the resistance grows in strength, you have been sent to Mithat to see if the city can be saved. An intelligence-gathering mission for those loyal to Nyrond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For characters of 1st to 14th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
