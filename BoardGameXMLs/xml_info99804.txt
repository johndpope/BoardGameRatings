			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief Cases features three session-length adventures for your Heightened Crime Investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blastback: A murder at a mutant-only gym brings the characters into the shadowy world of mutant fighting and a clash with organised crime. To solve this crime, the characters need to unravel the history of the Danger Room and its staff and stop a young man from throwing his life away. This scenario focuses on investigation for the most part, but the final scene calls for powerful combat-ready mutants or a lot of police backup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kids Aren&amp;rsquo;t Alright begins when a lawyer falls out of the sky. The investigation leads to a local high school - one of the kids must be an unidentified mutant. Tracing the connection between the initial victim and the perpetrator requires interviewing the students; good interpersonal skills and a detailed knowledge of the Quade Diagram are needed to crack this case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoulder to Shoulder revolves around anti-mutant prejudice and tests the loyalties of the characters. A chance discovery of a bomb-making workshop reveals a threat to an anti-mutant rally. Pursuing the case diligently means helping those who despise mutants. This case calls for excellent forensic skills, and is especially suited to a mix of heightened and normal characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
