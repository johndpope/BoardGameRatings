							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RunAway Train</name>
									
			<description>The train car you are on has broken away from the rest of the train, slowed to a stop, and now is heading back down the hill, towards the Train Station that's overlooking a canyon. The car is barely moving, but seems to be picking up speed, the smart thing to do would be to jump now...but, there still some time and the car is not moving that fast yet, you are sure you can toss off some your suitcases (with all your ill-gotten gains) before you have to jump. Too bad the other passengers seem to have the same idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score the most points by getting  your suitcases off the train car. Suitcases have a point value from 1-7 points. There are also bonuses and score multipliers that can increase the points earned. You will at some point want to get your passenger off the train, because if the train does crash (which is very, very likely) you don't want to be on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
