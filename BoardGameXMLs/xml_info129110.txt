							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ICON: Quest for the Ring</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As you round a corner, your sword ready, you confront a monstrously large fire-breathing dragon. Behind you are multitudes of vampire bats, hungry river monsters, and fierce kobolds. Now, through the wall a gibbering ghost emerges. Retreat is impossible....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And all of this is DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN, in vivid colors and at speeds previously impossible for the IBM PC. With the complexity of a text adventure and the graphics and action of an arcade game, ICON challenges you to begin an epic quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the realm of myth. Your journey through the dungeon worlds in search of the mystic icons is more than an adventure. It is a true quest. Be warned, your role is not just to kill monsters and pick up gold. The goal of your quest has a spiritual dimension - to transcend the succession of dungeon worlds and escape from the cycle of endless births and deaths. But the way is not easy. You must discover your destiny and find the path to it. You must master the virtues of a true cosmic traveller and pass the tests that qualify you to complete your ultimate fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE WORLD IS A STAGE -- and you are a player on it. There's more to Macrocom simulations-- epic scope and plots, mythic situations, and remarkably realistic environments. Computer adventure plots don't have to resemble computer programs. Quit fighting with programs that make you think like a programmer. Play a Macrocom simulation and immerse yourself in a microworld created by dramatists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
