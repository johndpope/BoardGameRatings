			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fought Wheels: Matchbox Wars is a game of tactical combat with an RPG element for 2 - 6 players. It uses existing 1/64 scale vehicles that are commonly bought as toys, as well as household items to create terrain and obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are written in parody/homage of miniatures bookshelf games from the 1980s; all with low ink, black and white, and retro art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team of three cars is trying to gain the most victory points through a variety of actions. Destroying enemy vehicles, capturing a flags, and successfully completing &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot; jump routines are a few ways to gain victory points. Each mission has a victory point chart that is referred to at the end of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
