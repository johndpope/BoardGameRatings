			<description>from the core rule book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low Fantasy Gaming (LFG) is a tabletop role-playing game built for sword &amp;amp; sorcery adventures in low magic worlds.  It is a generic ruleset for use with published low magic worlds or a world of your own creation. With some tweaking, LFG could handle most fantasy settings, but the system assumes low fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LFG is rules light, with a heavy emphasis on GM rulings. It's a hybrid of old school and modern game design, based on the 1d20 Open Game Licence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed to be fast and engaging, with minimal waiting between turns. Creativity is encouraged via martial exploits and magic.  Battle is genuinely dangerous and every skirmish takes a toll. The threat of serious injury or death is never far away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LFG worlds tend to mimic our own classical or medieval periods. Humans are the default player race. Magic and fantastic monsters exist, but are very rare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic is not only rare, it is dark and inherently dangerous. Sorcery is a power not meant for mortals, and adventurers engage with it at their peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LFG is about exploring the unknown; delving into the lost places of the world to unearth new mysteries. Player characters are not epic heroes charged with saving the world; they are bold adventurers seeking riches and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LFG is made for short, episodic adventures in an open world. Mechanics and random tables support GM improvisation, empowering the referee to handle any situation or side trek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
