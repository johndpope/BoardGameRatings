							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Husband: The Role-Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations! You've just been hitched. Well, not really, you've probably been married for a few years, long enough to establish that you forget anniversaries, buy inappropriate gifts, do dumb things with your friends, and are generally an idiot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's right, you're not just a husband, you're also a &amp;quot;Sit-Com Dad&amp;quot;. You are cut from the same loud and obnoxious cloth as Cliff Huxtable, Tim Taylor, Fred Flintstone, and the legendary Al Bundy. You are married and have kids. You have a beautiful wife (one of the perks of being a sit-com dad), several very smart children and very little sense of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations! You are an idiot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
