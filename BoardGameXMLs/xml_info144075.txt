			<description>This is an educational card game for teaching materials science to people.  This game can be played by 2 or more players.  Shuffle the cards and deal them face down.  Each player turn the top card face up but in a way that others don't see the card.  Each card present a material with 6 attributes.  The player to the left of the dealer picks one attribute from the top card and reads its number, eg. density 2320.  Other players read out their respective attribute.  The highest value on the attribute collects all other top cards and place them in their pile.  Then it's the winner's turn to turn the top card and to pick an attribute.  In the case of a tie in the attribute value, these cards are placed in the centre of the table and the main player gets to pick another card and to choose an attribute.  The winner gets to take the cards from both rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
