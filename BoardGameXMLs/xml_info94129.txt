			<description>Top Hunter: Roddy &amp;amp; Cathy is a side scrolling arcade platform game developed by SNK for the Neo Geo in 1994. It was also released on the Neo Geo CD, and the Wii Virtual Console. The game has seen re-release as part of SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1, on May 1, 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player, as Roddy (Player 2 plays as Cathy), must navigate through the stages, collecting items, killing ememies, and defeating a boss at the end of each area. The characters can also execute special moves, done by moving the joystick in certain directions and pressing the attack button, similar to Street Fighter and King of Fighters fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is split into four worlds: Forest, Ice, Wind, and Fire. Depending on what stage is picked first, the layout of the stage will change. For example, if the player picks the Ice world before the Forest world, the Forest world's beginning layout will be different. After completing all 4 worlds, the player is taken to the final stage, where they must rematch with the four bosses and battle the game's antagonist, Captain Klapton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Top Hunter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
