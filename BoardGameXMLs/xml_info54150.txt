							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fist of Emirikol</name>
									
			<description>From the accompanying handout &amp;quot;Whether originally created by Emirikol the Chaotic or not, this potent magical weapon was wielded by the infamous spellcaster to such terrible effect that it remains irrevocably linked with his name. This multifaceted &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot; appears to have been carved from a solid piece of bone or horn taken from an unidentified type of creature. Upon each of its twenty faces is engraved a different sigil, each conferring some offensive magical effect.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment: &amp;quot;a large d20 with unique runes that was given out as part of the RPGA player rewards program, along with a rules sheet for its use as a D&amp;amp;D magic item&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
