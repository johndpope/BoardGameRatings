			<description>The Quiddler SHORT Word Dictionary is an extensive collection of only short words. It was created to increase your competitive edge while playing Quiddler, The SHORT Word Game. With over 10,000 short words, the dictionary is organized both alphabetically and by the number of letters per word to help you easily find the best two, three, four and five letter words. &lt;br/&gt;Because Quiddler is a family game, The Quiddler SHORT Word Dictionary has been edited for content with that in mind. With the cards you are dealt and The Quiddler SHORT Word Dictionary as you companion, you'll be sure to dominate the short word bonus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From the back of the book.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
