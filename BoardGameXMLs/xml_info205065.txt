			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your name. Obviously, your name can be whatever you want. But at least for the early stages of the game, it's going to be the only handle on your character that anyone else at the table has. You might want to make it suggestive of the concept you have in mind, but misleading, ironic or simply unhelpful names are just as good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's really worth noting though: your name is the only initial characterization the other players will see. The jist of this game is to make your character interesting, so that the other players will want to hear more about him, without giving the whole farm away up front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intriguing game with compelling mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
