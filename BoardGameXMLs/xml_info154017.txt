							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MicroSport Shuffle</name>
									
			<description>MicroSport Shuffle is a game of dexterity and skill based on popular British pub games dating back to the 15th Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player flicks four coins across a board marked with horizontal bands called beds. If a coin lands entirely within a bed (that is, without touching a horizontal line), he scores a point. Points are scored after each flick, so earlier coins may score multiple times, as long as they bumped into another bed. After his turn, the four coins are removed from the board and the game proceeds with the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score three points in each of the five beds. If a player lands a coin in a completed bed (where he already has three points), a point is awarded to his opponent instead. The winner is the first player to score fifteen points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
