			<description>Naughty Improv is a game of story telling using cards depicting funny and suggestive illustrations.  Each player is given a hand of five cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On playing a card, the player must build on a continuous, common story, with the new addition to the story having a direct link to the card played.  Players are judged on the new contribution to the story, and if not accepted the player retrieves the card and also takes a penalty card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no set play order -- any player can play at any time with the exception that no player may play two cards in a row.  Points are scored for the number of cards played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round ends after a player has no more cards remaining.  The player with the most points after five rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
