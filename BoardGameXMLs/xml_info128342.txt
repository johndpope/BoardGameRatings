							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mandate Archive: The Qotah</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the scattered databases of the fallen Terran Mandate comes the next in a sequence of supplementary files for Stars Without Number, the free OSR retro-influenced game of science-fiction adventure. Sample this free file to discover the secrets of the Qotah, an alien race of merciless avian warriors bound by an ancient pledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Qotah were conquerors once, and frontier worlds were peeled of their humans so that the world-flocks could grow. But the Mandate Fleet broke them and extracted the Vow of Red Feathers, the pledge of peace that has held all through the Silence. But now these jewel-plumed hunters grow impatient, and some speak of the vow's end. Is the frontier to face a furious sky once more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained in this file, you'll find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The history, physiology, and alien mindset of the Qotah.&lt;br/&gt;     The grim demands of the Kri and its check on their conquering ambitions.&lt;br/&gt;     Plot seeds and capsule NPCs for quick insertion into any sci-fi game.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for Qotah PCs and guidelines on their play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
