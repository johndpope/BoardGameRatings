			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A lot of people started asking if we could produce a version of FUBAR suitable for the increasingly popular 6mm scale.  Here is the development draft of what we have done so far.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can help FUBAR players to tailor their games from the 25/28mm generic base FUBAR to a more wide 6mm battlefield. With the inclusion of some rules for vehicles, this ruleset does not differ a lot from the basic one. It is obviously a one page ruleset in the FUBAR philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
