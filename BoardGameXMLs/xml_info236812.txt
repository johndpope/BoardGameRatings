			<description>A Two-Round Event&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your last month-long adventure was a grueling one. You were hired by a distant king to see his son safely on his way to the Prince's Military camp. The only problem was that the king forgot to tell you that his son was a very spoiled, misbehaving, practical joke playing brat. He also forgot to tell you of the several hundred groups who wished for the prince's head to be on a silver platter. And to make matters worse, the directions written (supposedly) by the king took you not to a strict, well run military camp for 11 year old boys, but to a bath house of ill-repute. The military camp was three weeks in the opposite direction. After it was all said and done, deep in your hearts, you sort of regret having told the King you would be happy to escort his son... at no charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
