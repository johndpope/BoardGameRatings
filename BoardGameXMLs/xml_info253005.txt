							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Dog Cards</name>
									
			<description>Mad Dog Cards is a fun, family friendly game for 2-6 players from age 7+. Mad Dog Cards was created to increase awareness of how many animals are sad, lonely, and even &amp;quot;mad&amp;quot;, awaiting a forever home. A &amp;quot;Mad Dog&amp;quot; represents a homeless or shelter dog.&lt;br/&gt;   Mad Dog Cards is a simple card game. The main objective is find a &amp;quot;Mad Dog&amp;quot; a home or owner. Players take turns drawing cards and completing up to 2 actions. If a &amp;quot;Mad Dog&amp;quot; card is drawn, player must find an owner. If the player can't find it a home or owner, that player loses. The winner is the last man standing. &lt;br/&gt;   Yellow personality cards are collected to swipe other players' cards or even retrieve cards from the discard deck. Action cards are used to stack the game in one's favor. One can choose to pick on a player and force their hand in playing a &amp;quot;Mad Dog.&amp;quot; However, with a &amp;quot;Crazy Cat Lady&amp;quot; card, there is no telling how a setup will turn out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
