			<description>These rules were created after watching Richard Lester's film, 'The Three Musketeers' for the umpteenth time. The fighting there seemed so much more immediate and exciting than the gentlemanly way made famous by Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks even thought these may have been more acrobatic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these rules not only is there the possibility of the acrobatic stuff, but we have put in all the fun stuff that makes Richard Lesters view of the three musketeers so distinctive, the head butting, the kicking, the dodging whacking opponents over the head with any kind of implement that may come to hand, even distracting them with the hoary old cry of 'look behind you'. You can attempt to sneak up on opponents, ride over them with horses and even let innocent civilians join in the fun. The rules actually contain two games in one. The first set is for fairly evenly matched sides of swordsmen intermingled with one or two pistoleers or musketeers to surprise the unwary as they come round corners. This fast moving first game is best played with 10 or 15 characters each represented by one figure, and operated by two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game uses all the main rules but with just one or two little alterations and additions that appear here and there. This is the real Hollywood swashbuckling game with invincible heroes leaping from balconies and out of windows whilst taking on dozens of opponents in dazzling displays of acrobatics and Daring do. These rules, as you might expect, are biased so that the superheroes always win, well nearly always.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full range of 25mm figures and these rules can be  found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.redoubtenterprises.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.redoubtenterprises.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
