			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curse of the Pharaoh: The Quest for Nefertiti is a thrilling adventure game of 53 levels set in Egypt in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s.  You play the role of Anna, an archaeologist, and your task is to unravel a mystery leading from Nefertiti to Napoleon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most of the levels the screen is split in two identical halves with 10 differences between them. You have to locate and click on these different items. Additionally, you get to keep some of the items, which you will later use to solve various puzzles in order to advance the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also offers you the opportunity to purchase 4 additional mini games from the in-game store, redeeming coins that you collected during the levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
