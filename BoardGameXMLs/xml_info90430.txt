			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a normal two year supply run to the mining installation on Sirius B, until the cargo pod decided to remain in hyperspace, wrenching part of the coupling away, sending a destructive charge of energy through the ship. Luckily the ship's CNS managed to thaw you out before shutting down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took three days to arrive at the ESSEN mining station. Three days nursing a badly damaged spacecraft, trying to contact the docking port. Three days during which the realisation that all is not well has grown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your damaged craft is severely short of fuel, water and food, all were stored in the missing cargo unit. More importantly, most of the ships data banks have been wiped or corrupted, and a many of the CNS's electrical components blown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The facts are, you must repair the ship, obtain fuel and provisions and re-program the ship's computer. With a bit of luck the mining colony should have all the necessary spares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what fate befell the 200 workers stationed here? What stalks the metal labyrinths below the surface? What mystery links the horror within - to the dawn of human civilization? Can you survive a descent into the lair of the Xenomorphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First person perspective.&lt;br/&gt;Outstanding atmospheric graphics.&lt;br/&gt;Full Xenomorph animation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
