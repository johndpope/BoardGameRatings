			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landscape: The Ferrous Thicket is a set of 36 wilderness areas located in and around the titular forest, all laid out on a single page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is intended for use alone or as part of a larger world, possibly within or centred on a map square or hex. The material is suitable for rules-light gaming and designed for easy adaptation to various settings and systems, describing elements with a degree of uncertainty in terms open to interpretation. It assumes that dice are used for random numbers, but also offers a diceless number generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The package includes a copy of isophasmic light, a compact approach to gaming used in the creation of the profiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three pages are arranged for ease of use on screen or printed, the key features in two variant layouts. The tool includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     36 location descriptions corresponding to a site layout, all on one page&lt;br/&gt;     six rumours, six wanderers, 18 item entries and 18 descriptive terms&lt;br/&gt;     a compact diceless number generator for three of the ranges used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possible subterranean network below the Thicket could be represented by one or more entries in the themed maps series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
