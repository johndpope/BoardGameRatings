			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On November 2nd, 1936, the world died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the stars had come right; and things that lurked under the seas for eons rose to claim their rightful place. Now, they rule the earth, stalking it like titans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millions of women and men died&amp;mdash;yet you survived, doomed to wander the ruins, searching for answers. What went wrong? Are there others like you? How can you stay alive? And is there a way to put this right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Apocalypse is a survival horror supplement for the Trail of Cthulhu roleplaying game that takes Investigators into a terrifying post-apocalyptic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the award-winning Apocalypse Machine, GMs can destroy the world any number of ways &amp;mdash; including the death rays of alien tripods, a plague of white flowers, or the rising of Great Old Ones &amp;mdash; and run adventures of investigation and survival in a land transformed beyond recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cthulhu Apocalypse includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Apocalypse Machine, an award-winning GUMSHOE sandbox setting that gives you the tools to create your own global catastrophe &amp;mdash; from the first strange rumblings to the final, cataclysmic event &amp;mdash; along with Drives, Occupations, and more for adventures among the ruins.&lt;br/&gt;    Five adventures in the aftermath of disaster, taking Investigators through Britain, across the sea to America, and beyond the veils of reality as they struggle to survive. (Previously published as The Dead White World.)&lt;br/&gt;    Three adventures set years later, as the few survivors find their humanity cracking and moulting in the process of becoming something new. (Previously published as Slaves of the Mother.)&lt;br/&gt;    Eight all-new scenarios that give your players the choice as to whether &amp;mdash; and how &amp;mdash; humanity survives in this strange new world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
