							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tyrannosaurus</name>
									
			<description>This is a game for five players, but there are six figurines. Each player controls one figurine which represents one herbivore dinosaur. They move over one great valley in search for food and water. Winner is the player whose dinosaur eats most of the food (collects most counters). But, not everything is simple as it might seems so. More important thing of number of collected counters is their diversity!&lt;br/&gt;The sixth figurine is tyrannosaurus. That figurine is moved by player when he/she finish move with his/her figurine. Tyrannosaurus is carnivore dinosaur, and if he gets him one juicy herbivore dinosaur, he eats it! (a player whose dinosaur is eaten is eliminatred)...this game is neverending race for various food and water counters, and running away from tyrannosaurus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
