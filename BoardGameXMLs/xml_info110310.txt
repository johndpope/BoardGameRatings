			<description>'Bomber &amp;uuml;ber England' (Bombers over England) is like a pinball game that featured a map of England. The map contained holes in the location of key cities such as London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Newcastle, as well as points representing shipping targets in the North Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players shoot spring-driven metal balls representing &amp;quot;bombs&amp;quot; at these targets and are awarded points for hitting the enemy targets. Players are awarded a maximum 100 points for landing either on London or on the home base of the British fleet at Scapa Flow. Other cities and shipping targets are worth between 20 and 70 points. The game was clearly published during the &amp;quot;Phony War&amp;quot; period of late 1939/early 1940, since Calais in France is also worth 100 points, but neutral Amsterdam and Brussels score -80 points each (and hitting Germany is -100).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with many games published during the Nazi regime, it was pure propaganda intended to focus players on supporting the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
