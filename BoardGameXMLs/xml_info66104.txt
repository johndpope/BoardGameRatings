			<description>A game of strategy, money and people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to secretly acquire the most money in your personal account so that when the game is ended you will be declared the winner. Personal money accounts are kept secret throughout the game. Each character assumes the parodic character of 80s infamy (such as Daniel Dictator, Colonel South and Ayatollah Iraney) to accomplish their indivual ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
