			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When A.U.N.T.I. -  the Autonomous United Nations Tactical Intelligence force - was established after WW2 it&amp;rsquo;s mission was to  track down and eliminate any potential resurgence the Nazi threat.  Each nation lent their best and brightest spies to the task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was two decades ago. Now, with the cold war  in full swing, the Nazi menace all but forgotten in the fight between ideologies. AUNTI has become a dumping ground for failures and embarrassments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under-funded,  under equipped, under-supervised, on probation, A.U.N.T.I. is seen as little more than somewhere to put people that governments would rather forget about. Perhaps they can spy on each other? Just as long as they stay out of trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUT&amp;hellip; the old threats are real!  Even if the powers that be don&amp;rsquo;t realise it, they still need AUNTI. For around the globe, the dark forces of Nachzehrer - the Reich Resurrected - are rising.  And this time, they mean business!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Rip-Roaring Treatment for Deniable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agents from A.U.N.T.I. tips it&amp;rsquo;s very stylish hat to the exquisite 60&amp;rsquo;s spy thrillers, such as the British Avengers, The Man from UNCLE, Danger Man and more. Packed with intrigue and sexy 60&amp;rsquo;s style, your spies will find themselves in every corner of the globe, hunting down the invisible threat. From Nazi scientists and their clones, to mind-controlled politicians and superweapons, your heroes are in for one hell of a fight! If only they can set aside their personal agendas and get on with the mission&amp;hellip; and saving the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This treatment includes new rules for Deniable to get you in the 60&amp;rsquo;s vibe, and a groovy new Mission Dossier. You&amp;rsquo;ll be up and fighting the secret resurgence of the Reich in no time at all! Because... that&amp;rsquo;s how we roll here, at A.U.N.T.I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
