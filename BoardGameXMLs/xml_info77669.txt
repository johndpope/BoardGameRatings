							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NHL 09</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;NHL 09 is the 18th video game in the NHL series released by EA Sports.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;NHL 09 introduced several new features from the previous year's edition of the game. Features such as the defensive skill stick, dump-and-chase, and the lift stick option played into the advanced user's demographic. The option to play using the NHL '94 controls, however, makes the game easy for even a beginner to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's edition of the game has also seen the return of the alternate jersey with a verification code as well expanded rosters such as the O2 Extraliga and the Russian Superleague. (Russian Superleague is currently defunct, replaced by the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL); the game was developed before the KHL was formed)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Montreal Canadiens, NHL 09 has a feature where the greatest Canadiens play as an All-Star team known as the &amp;quot;Centennial Canadiens&amp;quot;, which is included on all platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The North American edition of the game features Calgary Flames' defenseman Dion Phaneuf (now part of the Toronto Maple Leafs) on the cover. The Swiss version of the game shows New York Islanders' defenseman Mark Streit on the cover. There is also a Swedish cover version showing Ottawa Senators' captain Daniel Alfredsson. The cover on the Russian version features Washington Capitals forward Alexander Ovechkin.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, NHL 09 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
