							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocketships of Pulp Destruction</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien cover-ups. Strange lights in the sky. Tales of encounters. UFOs. As mankind entered the atomic age on shaky feet, they started to have some visitors. A few of these visitors came down, destroyed by anti-aircraft weaponry- leaving behind the technology which was the key to the stars. But is humanity, and the world, prepared? As with Jetpacks of Pulp Adventure, this sourcebook covers everything you need to add and play Rocketships in your Pulp and Neo-Pulp settings with new and interesting aliens from Venus and Saturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Technology Compatibility from PL 4 to PL 9&lt;br/&gt;     All New rules for Rocketship Types and Subtypes&lt;br/&gt;     Ship Alteration Templates&lt;br/&gt;     Common Ships In The Sol System, Chronan Ships &amp;amp; Venusian Saucers&lt;br/&gt;     All New Rocketship Defensive &amp;amp; Offensive Systems&lt;br/&gt;     All New Universal, Chronan &amp;amp; Venusian Technology&lt;br/&gt;     All New Rocketship Feats including Alien Diplomacy &amp;amp; Nimble Piloting&lt;br/&gt;     All New Races of The Solar System: The Chronans and Venusians&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonies In The Solar System &amp;amp; Interplanetary Trade&lt;br/&gt;This 29 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Bronze and Victory: War of Bronze. Fans of the movie the science-fiction serial Commando Cody and Buck Rogers will love to have this class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
