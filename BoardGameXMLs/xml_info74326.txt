			<description>&amp;quot;Mother 3​ (マザースリー Māzā Surī) is a role-playing video game developed by Brownie Brown, HAL Laboratory, and Nintendo SPD Production Group No. 3. It was published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It has only been released in Japan, alongside a limited supply bundle. It is the third video game in the EarthBound series, following EarthBound for the Super NES 12 years earlier. It was written by Shigesato Itoi, the creator of the series, and directed by Nobuyuki Inoue. The music was composed by Shogo Sakai, whom Itoi chose to succeed long-time series composers for the series Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka; neither were available to work on the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mother 3 is a loose sequel to EarthBound. It takes place on the &amp;quot;Nowhere Islands&amp;quot;, a series of islands on Earth, and stars several characters, including Lucas, a young boy; Flint, a farmer and father of Lucas &amp;amp; his older twin brother,Claus; Duster, a thief; Kumatora, a princess; Salsa, a monkey; and Boney, Flint's dog. The primary antagonist is the mysterious Pigmask Army, an army of people who wear pig-like uniforms, which suddenly invades the islands, subjugating its population. They create a variety of technologies, including Chimeras, creatures that consist of either multiple animals or machine-animal hybrids. The game switches perspectives between the main characters during several chapters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mother_3,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
