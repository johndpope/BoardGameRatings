			<description>The pirate crew has split: everyone wants to be the first to find the Treasures of the evil Captain Barbasucia. Will you be able to become the richest Pirate of the Seven Seas?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has 2 steps. &lt;br/&gt;Step one: Kids take turns taking a treasure card from the deck, which features a multiplication on the back, and the result on the pother face. The kid must read the multiplication out loud and say the result. If correct the card is placed on the board where there is a space for each result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 2: Once all cards in play are on the board (it is possible to decide which tables will be on the game) the game begins. Kids will take turns discovering treasures. That means they must point at a treasure card and mention a multiplication that will allow that result. If correct the kid collects the card. The player with most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LEARN THE MULTIPLICATION TABLES IN AN EFFECTIVE AND FUN WAY!&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other products, the Langley Didactic Material has been designed primarily for teaching purposes, which makes it a fun and captivating tool.
