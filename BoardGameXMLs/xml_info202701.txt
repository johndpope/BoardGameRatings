			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conjurers summon monsters to fight for them. Necromancers create undead to fight for them. Enchanters corrupt the will of others to&amp;hellip; make them fight for them. Why are those different? What if, instead, we created a school for wizards who get others to fight for them? Let&amp;rsquo;s call them Lords. This book presents eight new schools of wizardry &amp;mdash; schools defined by what their members want to do with their magic instead of how it works. It treats wizards as people. As members of a larger society who must coexist with others. After all, no one, not even the most powerful wizard, is completely self-sufficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
