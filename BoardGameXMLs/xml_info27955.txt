			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;You do the steering - smash the pop-up cars - race the closing gate&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic gameboard, which is about 13&amp;quot; square, has a series of two-dimensional colored plastic target cars set on it which are triggered by rubber bands located beneath the board. A small area of the board is sectioned off (the Pits) behind a gate which serves as the timing mechanism for each person's turn.  A small car (the 'Demon') that relies on a ball bearing for mobility is placed behind the gate which is released by an opponent when all the targets are in position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions describe several variations of the game but all basically involve bumping into as many of the target cars with the Demon as possible and returning to the Pits before the timing gate closes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
