			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you play them, you have to surrender control. You can&amp;rsquo;t simply do what you want. You&amp;rsquo;ve got to force them to let you do it. Sounds easy? It&amp;rsquo;s not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;- Greyscales, Fishermen&amp;rsquo;s Guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obulus' veins course with dark power. Feared as much he is hated, he's as foul as a living cadaver. Enslaving minds to obey his undying will, opponents are but meek instruments for victory. No one can escape his cruel grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obulus' team of Morticians leave their opponents mourning in a wake of disruptive manipulation. Menacing and unforgiving, the Morticians actively dismantle their opponent&amp;rsquo;s strategies. Coaches who want to outsmart and exploit their opponents will live for the Mortician&amp;rsquo;s Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laborers of death, this set includes a ball, 6 player cards, bases, and 6 players: Obulus, Dirge, Silence, Cosset, Ghast, Graves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
