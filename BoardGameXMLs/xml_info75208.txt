			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worms 3D is an artillery game in the Worms series. It was developed by Team17. The game was the first in the series to be in 3D and also featured several new weapons. Additionally, some of the weapons operations are substantially different from previous Worms titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modes like Campaign and Quick Match return from previous versions. The game also features a multiplayer feature, as well as the ability to edit and create teams. The objective of most of the matches is to eliminate the opposing forces' worms, whereas the Campaign mode gives the player sets of specific goals which he needs to complete. The gameplay itself hasn't changed much from its predecessors, with the exception of the three-dimensional view, which allows the player more freedom, and more possibilities, to complete the task at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign consists of 35 small missions in which the player has to utilise their worms to complete a certain task, like destroy enemy worms, collect a certain crate, or even unique missions, like having to detonate 16 hidden landmines in a certain time. All of the missions give awards depending on how well you do. Gold medals usually unlock maps, wormapedia entries or even sometimes easter eggs (usually wormapedia entries, voice banks or secret landscapes). Sometimes, completing missions will give you a challenge mission in which you have to use a weapon/utility to collect targets and to try and go for as long as possible (as collecting targets adds time to your timer). Getting a gold time can unlock maps or locked weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game also has various tools that can be used at the players disposal to complete the mission or destroy the enemy. Some of these items consist of: the Jet Pack that has a certain amount of fuel, and can be earned by finding and unlocking it. There is a whole armory of weapons from bazooka launchers to sticky bombs that are well constructed. Other items like the Parachute, can be very useful to get from one place to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet another aspect of the Gameplay is the environment itself. The landscape on many of the maps can be destroyed by the player to create a game field that best suits the player. Using weapons like the rocket launcher and grenades, you can blow the world around you to pieces or leave it untouched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
