			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Dungeon Rooms a new concept in fantasy roleplaying game aids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our teams of Dwarven architects and Elven interior designers have laboured mightily to bring you this new set, with complete, fully-equipped rooms. No dungeon should be without them! Inside this box are no less than 23 ready-made 'special' rooms for use in your adventures, with lengths of corridor to link them together. Simply cut the card sheets into individual rooms and you are ready to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User addition:&lt;br/&gt;Although this was published for WFRP and had WFRP stats for creatures in the rooms, it could easily be used for any fantasy RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
