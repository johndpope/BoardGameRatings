							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Open Word Game</name>
									
			<description>The Open Word Game consists of several different games based around the idea of moving lettered pieces on an 8x8 board to form rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 64 pieces in the set: two copies of each consonant and four of each vowel (including Y).  (Since the Russian alphabet has 33 letters, in the original Russian version there are two of each letter except ะช and ะฌ of which there are one each.)  In addition each piece has a numeric score depending on the rarity of its letter, and a suit (red, yellow, green or blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
