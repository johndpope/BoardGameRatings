							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Obsidian Lords</name>
									
			<description>Obsidian Lords was one of three new Collectible Token Games (CTGs) released at Gen Con 2001. Vortex by Fantasy Flight Games and Sack Armies by Precedence Publishing being the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obsidian Lords feels very much like Magic the Gathering with dice rolls. You summon creatures with Obsidian tokens (mana) and send them off to attack your opponent. Your opponent can defend with their creatures and gratuitous dice rolling ensues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must make your Strike Roll in order to hit. If you hit, you then roll for damage and apply it towards the enemy creature's Life Points. A pencil and paper is required since creatures have huge life totals, a Centaur Paladin has 53 life points for example. If the defending creatures survives, it can make a counter-attack by rolling even more dice. You continue until all attacking or defending creatures have been removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also cast Spells and equip your minions with Weapon tokens. Most creatures have cool special abilities which gives you plenty of options for customizing your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
