			<description>Enter the enchanted kingdom of Papyrum, where you are the author of your very own storybook adventure! Once upon a time and not too long ago, Papyrum was a land of enchantment and beauty until a dark and dreary cloud was cast upon the kingdom by the Evil Witch, Teyra. All that remains is the withered Tree of Life and it&amp;rsquo;s Guardian, Syl the Owl. As the keeper of the Magic Book, you hold the keys to restore Papyrum to its former beauty and return power back to the King, Queen, and Princess Braithlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
