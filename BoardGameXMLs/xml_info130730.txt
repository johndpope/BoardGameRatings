			<description>The game of guessing the answers to funny job descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 198 riddles, each one relating to a certain profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person to the left of the player whose turn it is, slides from under the shuffled deck of cards (so that no-one can read it as they would have done should he draw it from the top of the deck. Each card has 6 riddles. The reader of the card rolls a die and must read out the job against the number rolled. The guesser tries to answer correctly. If he does, his piece is moved up the board. If wrong, the card is placed on the top of the stack and it is now the turn of the next player, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get to the finish line (Ziel) on the board, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
