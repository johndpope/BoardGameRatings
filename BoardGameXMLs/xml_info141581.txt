			<description>From the rear cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three died. They were mauled beyond recognition. The Baron sent his huntsmen to kill the beasts and for a fortnight they tramped across the countryside. Between their whoring and drinking they killed twelve wolves, parading their skins through the village. They were hung on poles as trophies of victory. Then the huntsmen left, the beasts slain, the village saved&amp;hellip; so we thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the fields turned golden under the summer sun the killings began again. Four more died. Then the Baron's man, the bailiff, was killed on the high meadow in sight of Mitra's Temple. His screams could be heard well into the village. He was only identified after we reassembled the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the priest's help I wrote a report to our liege, the Baron of Westtower. My report ended with,&lt;br/&gt;There will be no harvest until the beast is slain and the killings stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
