			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurlements is a horror adventure game designed by Yannick Cadin. It uses the same engine as Zombi, his previous game. This time, players lead Kane, a small-time thief who just got out of prison and his girlfriend Lorry. Kane's cell mate Alan told him about a stash of gold before dying and Kane and Lorry intend to find the loot. While driving to the location, their car break down in the middle of nowhere. Kane and Lorry must find the gold, repair their car and escape a pack of vicious werewolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is the same as zombi: a system of icons used for managing the character's movements, actions, and inventory, a static image showing the current location, light RPG touches (characters can become tired or hungry), and a combat system consisting of moving the joystick left and right as fast as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
