							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jerimond&#039;s Orb</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jerimond's Orb is a d20 System adventure booster designed for 4-6 characters levels 2-4. It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or dropped into any ongoing campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten days ride north of the great city, there is a small town named Treefall. Up until recently, this town was well known for its rich harvests, happy villagers, and prosperous weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These days, however, the once-proud details from Treefall have turned darker. Instead of tales of unending prosperity, you hear hushed whispers of a great curse that has struck the once-happy village. Word has it that, where once roamed contented cattle, now strange beasts hunt by the moon's cold light and terrorize the hapless region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have scoffed with the others at these stories. Despite the things you've seen in your adventures with your friends, the thought that such ill might befall such a sleepy little town strikes you as terribly unlikely. There is plenty of evil in the world, true, but there are also much bigger and better targets. But tonight, despite the firmness of your disbelief, the stories come to find you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been traveling north along the roads on your own business, enjoying the rich fall colors and warm afternoons. Your camp is small and secure, with a roaring fire and meat cooking over the flame. It's one of those crisp autumn days that makes you long for a warm hearth after a long ride in the cool air. Still, the fire is good enough for now, and you and your friends have a wonderful meal, talking and singing and laughing, anticipating a restful sleep beneath the blanket of stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until the beast attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
