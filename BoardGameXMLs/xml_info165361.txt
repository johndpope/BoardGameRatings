							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tailor&#039;s Shop</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some action, see Dwiven. Really? A tailor? Stash the skepticism. Dwiven was a career assassin long before he broke his back. Truth be told, even before the catastrophe, Dwiven found sewing and designing calming. He sewed for himself &amp;ndash; clothes, but actually they were weapons. Now Dwiven stitches for those in the know and on the side brokers clients and assassins together. He has plenty of side jobs as well that he parcels out to adventurers. He might give you one, weaponize you too. How about a little lead in the hem of a cloak? Maybe one of dragon silk? Pricy, yes, but great for lighting tunnels. Ask to meet Athilea, too &amp;ndash; a nice, safe friend of Dwiven&amp;rsquo;s. She only practices transitory assassinations. Along with a shop boy caught in intransigent adolescence - you&amp;rsquo;ll find a good support crew at the Tailor&amp;rsquo;s Shop. Savvy, too. Fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
