							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postmodern: Traits and Flaws</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Postmodern: Traits and Flaws offers a complete system of self-balancing character traits. These traits are designed to flesh out aspects of your character, such as personality, background, or even physique. Traits can serve as an interesting starting point for roleplaying, reminding players of their character's most prominent strengths and weaknesses. Suggestions for roleplaying opportunities are given throughout. Character traits include coldly logical, strange luck, preternaturally sensitive and many more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flaws exist as a sort of anti-feat. Whereas a feat enables a character to be better than normal at performing a task (or even to do something that normal characters can't), a flaw restricts a character's capabilities or imposes a penalty of some sort. Character flaws include criminal record, manchurian candidate, tracking implant and many more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, Postmodern: Traits and Flaws includes a system of character disadvantages. These disadvantages are designed to inject dramatic situations into a character's day-to-day life. These disadvantages may stem from the character's background or some persistent element of the character's personality or daily experiences. Character disadvantages include amnesia, personal code, guilt and many more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Postmodern Traits and Flaws includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Five categories of traits and flaws; mundane, conspiracy, occult, psionic and supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;     Forty character traits.&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty-six flaws.&lt;br/&gt;     Fifteen disadvantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
