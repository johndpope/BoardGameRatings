							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mind Reaper</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focus your will; call your glimmering psi-weapon into existence with a single murderous thought. You are the ultimate assassin, a warrior who can imagine the only weapon he will ever need. You can pass undetected through a President's security cordon and disregard a billionaire's metal detectors, and even though your hands are empty, you are never, ever unarmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mind Reapers are highly motivated, expertly trained mentalist, who focus their natural psionic talents towards stealth and melee combat. Mind Reapers are highly sought after corporate operatives and black ops specialists. Many Mind Reapers were the product of Cold War era cybernetics implantation and breeding experiments designed to unlock human potential. Others are products of secretive martial arts dojos, using secrets handed down from master to student for generations. Modern Mind Reapers hail from across the world, as former government operatives share their secrets with developing nations, wealthy private corporations and extremist groups across the globe. The world gets more dangerous every day, thanks to the presence of these undetectable telepathic assassins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
