			<description>A conversational card game in the vein of Scruples.  The game features three levels of cards, blue, yellow, and red.  The red cards are considered the most daring.  Before the game, the players agree on which level cards to use (only blue, blue and yellow, or all three).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws one card per round.  In turn, you can choose to answer the question by passing the card to another player, who reads the question back to you and you give your answer.  Alternatively, you can challenge, where you will answer the question if another player answers it first.  A third option is to pass and not answer the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answered questions give 1 point for a blue card, 2 points for a yellow card and 3 points for a red card.  After answering, each player can give you 2 bonus points if you revealed something they did not know about you.  Alternatively, if another player feels you went all out to answer the question, displaying honesty and bravery beyond the call of duty, they can say &amp;quot;breakthrough&amp;quot; and you get 3 bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played to a pre-determined time limit where the most points wins (or a set number of points can be used).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
