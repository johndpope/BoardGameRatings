							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PACS Set II: The Next Level</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;PACS (Pocket Adventures Card System) is an entire RPG (Role Playing Game) that fits into a deck of cards. As a non-collectable card game, with a Base Set of PACS and a pocketful of change you're ready for hours of play where no two sessions need ever be the same. Players familiar with RPGs will be right at home, and those new to RPGs will find PACS as an excellent entry point for the genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PACS plays like a typical tabletop RPG with the following changes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You flip coins instead of rolling dice.&lt;br/&gt;For most actions in PACS you flip three coins, count the number of &amp;lsquo;heads&amp;rsquo;, add that to the appropriate Aptitude Score, and determine whether your result is a success or failure. If you want to roll dice, determine a way to divide the numbers on your die into a 50/50 chance. Common options are evens/odds or high/low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no battle-grid.&lt;br/&gt;It is assumed each Hero and Foe is in range of each other. The DM can adjudicate differently as they see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no hit-points.&lt;br/&gt;A Hero or Foe has three statuses: Uninjured, Injured, and Defeated. A card&amp;rsquo;s orientation represents what state the Hero of Foe is in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though there are no 'experience points', characters can still advance.&lt;br/&gt;PACS cannot replace the complexity of a typical tabletop RPG, nor does it try to. It is ideal for introducing new players to RPGs, filling time between game sessions, or serving as a quick and fun way to allow other players to DM. As such, PACS Set 1 allows for Heroes to become more powerful as they gather Loot. PACS Set 2 offers options for leveling characters up (and the options are fully compatible with Set 1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's specific to Set 2?&lt;br/&gt;For the Dungeon Master, there are generic 'Foes' (such as Brute, Soldier, Minor Undead, etc.) that fit a large number of situations, many Loot and Foe cards provide multiple options, new Foe 'modifier' cards (such as Vampiric, Lycan, etc.) expand your options further, and 'weaker' Foes support playing with as few as one or two Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;For the Player, there are options for mounts, familiars, leveling up, and there is more low Value loot to help you earn loot more frequently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
