							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Henry VIII Chess</name>
									
			<description>Henry VIII Chess is a variant of chess, played on a board 8 wide and 7 deep.  Each player has one King, 7 queens and 8 pawns.  Pawns are restricted to moving one space forward (as opposed to 2) and capture as normal.  Queens move like they do in chess.  The game provides a set of opposing objectives where the object is to either capture the enemy King, or to be the first player to lose all 7 of their Queens.  These opposing objectives provides for much tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
