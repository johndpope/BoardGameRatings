			<description>Includes poster-sized map of The Frozen Lands and surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is noted for the amount of material that was re-used from another product: AD&amp;amp;D's Dungeon Module S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks.  Level III of the base described in this adventure is exactly the same as S3's Level III, Upper Walkway and Lounge Area.  Maps of other levels were changed only slightly when re-used in this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer gives credit to the original sources on the front cover of the booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks to Michael Price, Garry Spiegle, Gary Gygax, and Phil Taterczynski for previous works which I plundered like a Gamma World scavenger.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Ancient calling himself the Creator is rumored to rule the Frozen Land(s), an expanse of territory filled with frigid foothills, forests, and plains.  The Council of Haven has given you the task of finding this Creator - whoever and wherever he may be.  The council is hopeful you can neutralize any influence he might have with General Timon's plans for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not an easy task, and the harsh conditions of the Frozen Lands could complicate the situation.  Some say there are robots and weird machines wandering in the icy wastes.  And perhaps there are also clues to the Cities of Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure also contains a system for generating player character and non-player character robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
