			<description>The deck is a standard deck of cards, but augmented with text relevant to the baseball themed game. For example, the jack of spades is a &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play is simple, the batting cards are black, the fielding cards are red, and one player is batting the other fielding. Both players play a card, first batter then fielder, and this may result in base advancement or outs. Players maintain a hand of 7 cards, and play 9 innings, 3 outs for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
