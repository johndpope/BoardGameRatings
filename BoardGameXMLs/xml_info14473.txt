							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Witch&#039;s Caldron</name>
									
			<description>One of Ral Partha's introductory miniature games, Witch's Caldron is essentially a miniatures dungeon crawl, with adventurers (led by a wizard) trying to explore the witch's cave and escape with valuable treasure. The witch, with a variety of monstrous servants, opposes them. The adventurers may explore in multiple parties from three entrances. The game includes spells, curses, magic gates, and HTH combat. Rules, charts, a map, two dice, and twenty miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from a merged game&lt;br/&gt;The object of Witch's Caldron is for the Witch and her Servants to defend the treasures of her cave from the Wizard and his Adventurers. The Wizard has 20 turns to invade the Witch's cave and escape through the three Magic Gates (not from the cave) with as many treasures as possible. If within 20 turns, all of the treasures have been removed from two of the three Magic Gates, but the Witch's magic sword has not been captured and removed from the cave (immediate win for Wizard), the winner is determined by awarding the Wizard points for treasures removed from the cave and awarding the Witch points for Wizard's Adventurers killed. Combat results are determined by &amp;quot;casting spells&amp;quot; and rolling dice.&lt;br/&gt;The playing board is 16 squares by 19 squares. The game includes 20 metal figurines, including the Witch and her eight Servants and the Wizard and his 10 Adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
