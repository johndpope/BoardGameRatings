			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For the school room or home by Mrs. F. L. Crown&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A game in which fifty-six music symbols are quickly and easily learned and the habit of concentration, alertness and fair play is encouraged among boys and girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music supervisors and music teachers will find 'Note-O' invaluable in the teaching of the names and definitions of music symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for playing 'Note-O':&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of 'Note-O' contains forty players' cards, fifty-six dealer's cards and pasteboard discs with which to cover the symbols on the players' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As many players may participate in the game of 'Note-O' as there are players' cards.  Each player is provided with a 'Note-O' card and enough discs to cover all the symbols on his card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each game, a leader is chosen.  This leader is provided with the deck of dealer's cards and from it calls the symbols, one by one.  As a symbol is called, the player having that symbol covers it with a disc.  The process is repeated until some player has covered all the symbols on his card at which time he calls out 'NOTE-O.'  The first player calling 'NOTE-O', whose symbols have been covered correctly, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be varied by having any player announce 'Note-O' when he has covered three symbols in a row on his card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each game, cards should be exchanged and the leader's cards shuffled before starting a new game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is made much more difficult and more interesting when each player is provided with two or more 'Note-O' cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
