							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Traffic Trouble</name>
									
			<description>The traffic lights at a nearby intersection have gone haywire. The lights work, but nothing to control them. The traffic is in trouble and it is now up to you to help direct traffic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is simple: Keep your traffic moving as best as you can. But dont hold cars up too long! If you&amp;rsquo;re Rage-O-Meter becomes full then its game over. Fire trucks, Police Cars and Ambulances will need to get quickly across your busy intersection too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if it all becomes too much then just enjoy creating traffic havoc by setting all the lights green!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
