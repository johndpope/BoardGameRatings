			<description>From the publisher's product description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black as Pitch is the third adventure in the Grendelssaga (after Rescue Run and Salvage Rights), a series of three adventures set on the rogue world of Grendel, in the Queen Alice&amp;rsquo;s Star system.

Meanwhile, another threat awaits them on the surface, biding its time...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This final episode set on the hostile world of Grendel sees the characters forced into further cooperation with the alien Pentapods, as they delve into the secret kept by this planet for the past 100,000 years.
