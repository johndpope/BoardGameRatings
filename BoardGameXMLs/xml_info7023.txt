			<description>West Front: The Campaign in Europe 1943 - 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;West Front is our grand strategic game of the European campaign. It can be played in historical scenarios starting at either the Italian or Normandy landings or in an open landing zone campaign. The game focuses on the Army Group level, with players controlling subordinate armies as the main combat formations. Leadership is a major component of the game, with each player having a pool of named and rated leaders available. In addition, the game uses the same system as our Lebensraum game of the campaign in the East and the two games can be combined to produce an overall grand strategic game of the entire war in Europe from the start of the invasion of the U.S.S.R.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns are 3 months long, units are armies, and each hex is 50 miles across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
