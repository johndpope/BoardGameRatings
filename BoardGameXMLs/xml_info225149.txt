							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TRIPLEX: the 3D Strategy Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRIPLEX is three games of Tic Tac Toe, all played at once, on the same board with movable pieces. The goal is just as simple as that of Tic Tac Toe: to form alignments of three in a row. The goal is also to form one alignment of all three types of pieces all at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turns, players play any one of their pieces into any open space. Once all pieces have been played onto the board they may then be moved from where they were played into any open space. The first player to form all three types of alignments at the same time wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRIPLEX is a board game that designers have been trying to create for over a century. TRIPLEX is the worlds only easily comprehensible, highly enjoyable and truly three dimensional strategic board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
