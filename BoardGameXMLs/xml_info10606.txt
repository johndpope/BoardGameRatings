			<description>A roll-and-move game set in the Ackland Art Museum of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to collect a set of paintings in the same theme and then &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; them to the gallery of that theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven paintings each of seven different themes plus a wild card. Each player begins with five randomly dealt paintings. As they &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; through the museum, they will get chances to trade paintings from their hand with those in the &amp;quot;Art Card&amp;quot; (face down) pile, the &amp;quot;Art Storage&amp;quot; (face up discard) pile, or another player's hand. The first player to collect a hand of one type and get to the gallery of that type wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
