			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings Pembrooktonshire Gardening Cosiety members!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a first look at the rules changes for the next edition of LotFP. None of this is set in stone; it's a playtest document. I just wanted to get it out there to &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; fans to look over and hopefully try out before I let anything to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main reason for the changes is that as a creator and player, working from the exact same unchanging rules framework for years and years gets a bit dull. &amp;quot;I'm not playing my own game as much because it's feeling samey&amp;quot; is horrible, so treating it as a living game and tweaking it here and there seems the more reasonable thing to do. And as I tweak, it gets increasingly weird using more and more rules that are quite different from the in-print books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
