			<description>From the box &amp;quot;When you open the case there's a Boxing Ring right there. Wind up your player, position his arms, and let the boxing match begin. See who can land a knockout or which boxer goes down for the count first.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a neat little wind up game similar in style to the strollin bowlin also made by tomy however this game actually has different strategies that can be used by position the boxers arms in different positions before you wind them up for the match. it comes in a little plastic fold up case which is also very cleverly designed to open up into the boxing ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
