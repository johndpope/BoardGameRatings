			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have a hundred six siders; when you run out, you run out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's the game, right there. Everything else is just elaboration on that single rule. Your superhero starts the adventure with a whole bunch of energy, and spends it carefully (or not) during the course of the day. The only thing that really matters, mechanically, are the numbers on the dice. The special effects - the things your superhero does with his or her powers - are totally up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're playing a flying superhero who can shoot fire from her hands, and you run into a situation that requires her to heat up a bunch of guns wielded by low-life thugs, you can do that. You don't have to worry about putting that specific effect on her character sheet. If you want to use the flame to create an updraft which keeps a kitten from falling to its death, that's cool too. The only limitation is the social pressure imposed by the GM and the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
