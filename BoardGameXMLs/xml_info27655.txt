							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baseball Game (Epoch Book Game Series)</name>
									
			<description>This is a mechanical baseball game.  The players sit on opposite sides of the game.  The batter locks their side of the spring-loaded spinner then the pitcher locks theirs.  The pitcher secretly moves a slider either left or right.  Then the pitcher pitches by pulling their unlock switch.  The batter than has to hit the ball by pulling their unlock switch.  After this is done the result shows through either the left or right window in the game field.  This is repeated until there are three outs and then the game is turned around as the sides are switched.  There are dials to show the current count, outs and score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
