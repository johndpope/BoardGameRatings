			<description>P&amp;oacute;kh&amp;aacute;l&amp;oacute; (&amp;quot;Spider-web&amp;quot;) is a simple, enjoyable and funny family, children and party game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to escape from the spider's web with our chosen fly hero. The first one who escape succesfully wins the match. But it is not that easy to escape...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a double-sided board in the box. Each side is for different game variants and with different complexity. There is a simpler side (which is called &amp;quot;Legyező&amp;quot; and recommended for players from 3-4 years) on which players can play a quick and easy game variant because all events (such as reroll, bonus steps etc.) are drawn on the board. The other side of the board (which is called &amp;quot;Cselsz&amp;ouml;vő&amp;quot; and recommended for players from 7-8 years) is for the more complex game variants. Game variants that are played on the &amp;quot;Cselsz&amp;ouml;vő&amp;quot; side need action cards (the box contains 40 action cards with some different effects). The game rules book contains 2 more game variants (for exemple one for the pro-gamers with challenging complexity) so the constant fun for everyone is guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
