			<description>Delving! is a fantasy themed family card game for two to five players. Play time is about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the role of both dungeon crafter and seasoned adventurer. Explore the dungeon, slay the monsters, grab the treasure all while trying to thwart the efforts of your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is divided into three rounds called crawls. For each crawl a new dungeon is created from the encounter deck. Each crawl starts with a line of eight cards. Players take turns playing adventure cards from their hand affecting the dungeon as well as their opponents&amp;rsquo; hands and loot piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has scored the most points at the end of the final crawl. Scoring is done by totaling the victory value of the cards in each player's score pile, the number on the bottom left of the encounter or adventure card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players do the following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Play an adventure card (optional)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure cards allow you to move encounters forward or backward in line, draw extra cards, add or remove encounters from the line, affect your opponents score pile, move your hero to the other end of the line, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Attempt an encounter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will automatically defeat the encounter at the front of the line provided there is no challenge number on that card. Otherwise you must meet or beat that number on a d6 to defeat it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Draw an adventure card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player to the left then takes a turn, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues with each player taking their turn until no more cards are left in the dungeon. That crawl is then over and a new crawl begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
