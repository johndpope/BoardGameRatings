			<description>Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop was released exclusively for the Wii in 2009. It is technically a port of the critically acclaimed Sandbox Survival Horror Dead Rising, although Chop Till You Drop features so many changes from the original version it can be considered a unique game in its own right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like in the original game you take the role of Frank West, a freelance journalist who finds himself in the middle of a Zombie outbreak in the small fictional suburban town of Willamette. Frank lands on the roof of the town's shopping complex by helicopter, but upon realising what has happened decides to stay there for the duration of the game in order to help the survivors stuck inside and uncover the truth behind the outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Chop Till You Drop you must navigate around a Sandbox style shopping mall environment rescuing survivors, collecting supplies such as weapons, ammo and food (health), and fighting through hordes of zombies. Occasionally you will also have to kill homicidal humans driven to psychosis by the outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chop Till You Drop is a major overhaul of the original Dead Rising, with various aspects changed, removed, added and altered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike in the original, Chop Till You Drop features a much more structured set up. Rather then having just 72 hours in which to achieve all goals and plot points players are given all the goals as separately timed missions. The player can choose when to attempt them and sometimes in what order. Also because it is impossible to miss any of the plot related 'case' missions the bonus part of the original game (known as 'Overtime') is merged into this game as standard. The player is normally not timed at all when on a case mission, meaning they will have several opportunities during the game to explore the mall freely without time constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the other major changes between the two is the removal of Frank's ability to take pictures. Players could originally take photos and score exp. for certain content caught on film, but this function doesn't exist at all in Chop Till You Drop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other changes include different graphics, no longer being able to jump, a stronger emphasis on using Guns (with a Resident Evil 4 shooting style utilising the Wii remote), less variety of items, the removal of some areas, psychos and survivors, and new bonus Mini-games unlocked by completing the main game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to a smaller budget and development period coupled with the Wii's lower graphical capabilities less Zombies appear on screen then in the original (with no more then 100 been visible at one time). Despite this Chop Till You Drop features several new types of Zombie not seen in the original game. Three psychos that were removed from Chop Till You Drop make recurring appearances as special Zombies instead. This game also features Zombie Animals and players must contend with Zombie Poodles and Parrots amongst the regular human Zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
