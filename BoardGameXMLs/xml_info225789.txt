							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legend of the Copperline</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could not say that the &amp;lsquo;Morgan Creek&amp;rsquo; was a pretty ship.  She was an older salvage &amp;amp; shipping vessel, whose worn exterior belied its internal sturdiness.  The captain of this ship, Hewlett Stewart, was himself a sturdy and stout individual. He was not tall, but his personality radiated height.  He was confident and focused, but also cheerful and laid back. He was the kind of fellow everyone got along with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
