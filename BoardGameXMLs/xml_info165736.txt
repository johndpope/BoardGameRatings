			<description>The Captain signals... &amp;quot;RED ALERT&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Moments later you and your crew will gather together and defend yourself from the alien menace. The only option is to escape the ISS Powhatan and destroy the ship before it enters Celeritas orbit. Continue the story. Save the crew. Win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape Pod is the first in a trilogy of co-operative games about leading a doomed crew to their rescue. Each player assumes the role of a member of the ISS Powhatan, a supply ship in the Junxti system. When the ship is boarded by hostile aliens, the crew must work together to gather supplies and prepare the escape pod. Finally, you must activate the self-destruct system and escape to the planet below!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of players taking turns. At the beginning of their turn each player rolls dice to place aliens on the board and then navigates the ship using their action points. Players can search rooms to reveal item cards that will assist them in their efforts. When a player comes into a room with aliens, combat ensues utilizing an 8 sided die with the outcome influenced by weapons the player may have. Certain rooms such as the fuel tanks and the transporter rooms can be &amp;quot;activated&amp;quot; to accomplish the goal and allow the players to escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player characters include; Captain, Security Officer, Transporter Chief, Damage Controlman, Quartermaster, Chief Engineer, and Sensor Operator. Each character has a unique ability to assist in the players winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
