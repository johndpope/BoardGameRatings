			<description>Suspicion is a game of strategy and social maneuvering.  As wealthy tycoons from the 1800's, players compete for power to take influence away from each other while trying to not become a target themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round of the game consists of two phases.  In the first phase, players play Arsenal cards with numbers ranging from -5 to 5 in value in front of themselves or other players one at a time.  After each player has placed three cards, the three highest non-tied values gain control of a Power Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase, the players with Power Decks, which consist of cards representing all the players, vote on a player to take Influence tokens from.  If all three judges pick the same person, that player instead takes three Influence tokens from any players they choose.  If all three judges pick different people, then the judges must each give one Influence token to another player of their choice.  Otherwise, the two judges who picked the same person take one Influence token each from the player they targeted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point, the Dealer passes the Arsenal deck to the player to their left who deals everyone three cards and play goes back to the first phase.  The game ends when every player has been Dealer for one round.  The player with the most Influence tokens at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player also has a secret Agenda card with conditions like &amp;quot;Have three 3's in front of you during the first phase of a round&amp;quot;.  If the player fulfills one of the three conditions on their card, they may turn it in and take the appropriate number of Influence tokens from any player(s) of their choice.  They will get a new Agenda card at the end of that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
