			<description>This game uses the power of static electricity to &amp;lsquo;activate&amp;rsquo; and move a small dart around a playing area under a plastic dome. The dart's position on the board at any one time allows players to claim cards to add to their scoring trays. The winner is the first player to get all 12 of their cards not only on the scoring tray, but in their correct positions on the tray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents&lt;br/&gt;1 x &amp;lsquo;Holly Dolly&amp;rsquo;, a game board unit comprising a transparent plastic dome mounted over the playing area and containing a dart.&lt;br/&gt;4 x sets of 12 numbered cards in four different colours&lt;br/&gt;4 x &amp;lsquo;Dixi&amp;rsquo; cards in four different colours&lt;br/&gt;4 x plastic scoring trays&lt;br/&gt;1 x game storage tray&lt;br/&gt;1 x rules leaflet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a most unusual game. The rules suggest that players experiment with rubbing the top of the dome to see which method of activating the dart is best for them.&lt;br/&gt;Apparently, the movement of the dart can be different for different people due to the varying static charge everyone carries with them.&lt;br/&gt;This charge varies, mainly because of skin moisture or the type of clothing worn; wool, cotton, nylon etc, which can produce static electricity of different intensities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
