			<description>A card game 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out all the cards and each player looks at their cards. Whoever has the green Blanche Neige (Snow White) card starts by laying down that card. The next player has three possibilities; he can lay down another Blanche Neige card or he can play the green 7 stars Nain (Dwarf) card next to the green Snow White card. Or he can pass if he cannot do any of these options. Note that you have to play the same card if going down the columns or the card with the next lowest number of stars if going across the rows. And so the game progresses, each player having more and more options to lay cards along the rows or below in the columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to use all their cards scores a point and the first to rack up 10 points, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
