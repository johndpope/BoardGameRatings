							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hallux Rigidus: Trinity&#039;s Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Objective&lt;br/&gt;Sole survivor... to be the only player with at least 2 dice and five energy (one box).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;Put the dice off to one side of the play area. Hand a force chart to each player. Gather pens or pencils so&lt;br/&gt;each player has something to write with.&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a number between 2 and 6; write the number you chose in the box next to the word Defiance on the right side of the force chart.&lt;br/&gt;Put the number 2 in the top box under the letter C found in the center of the force chart.&lt;br/&gt;Gather drinks and snacks because you will be expending a lot of energy.&lt;br/&gt;The oldest player (or the one who claims to be so, uncontested) goes first.&lt;br/&gt;On the left side of the force chart is energy. It's split into five sets of 100 energy (5 per box; 25 per row).&lt;br/&gt;Energy helps decides the length of each game. At the beginning before any player takes a turn. The group may cross out any sets of energy (beginning at the bottom) to reduce the overall game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting The Game&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with two dice. On your turn roll the two dice adding them for your total. As long as you didn't roll any ones you may continue to roll adding the two dice values to the last total. (This represents concentrating to build more power)You may stop at any time or if you roll any ones you must stop.&lt;br/&gt;If you roll identical numbers on any dice roll you gain a bonus to your total value by multiplying your total value (after adding this roll to it) by the number of identical numbers rolled.&lt;br/&gt;If all the numbers are the same on all the dice you rolled, you gain an additional dice. (So if you rolled two dice and both displayed a two. You would immediately gain another dice so from then on you get to roll three dice. If when rolling three dice, all three display a two, you gain another dice, immediately, so now you are rolling four dice. )&lt;br/&gt;When you stop rolling (concentrating) your total value is rounded to the closest five. Choose an opponent to blast. It's subtracted from the Energy on their force chart. Each box is worth five points so if you blast someone for 25 points they must cross out 5 boxes.&lt;br/&gt;Rolling ones represents losing your concentration. All points you accumulated this turn are lost and you take 5 points damage per 1 displayed on your dice in backlash, (if you rolled two 1's you would have to cross out 2 boxes). &lt;br/&gt;Backlash damage can not be defied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning And Losing The Game&lt;br/&gt;To win you must be the only remaining player or you can share a win by calling a truce. &lt;br/&gt;Losing a game is to be reduced to zero energy or less than two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy&lt;br/&gt;Your energy is displayed on the left of your force chart. It represents your life's energy. When all boxes are crossed out, you die! (lose). It's divided into sections. Each section has 100 health; four rows of five boxes, each worth 5 points. When all the boxes in one section are crossed off you lose one die to your rolls (if you have been rolling three dice on your turn, you would now be reduced to rolling only two).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defiance&lt;br/&gt;Defiance is found on the right side of the force chart. At the beginning of each game you choose a number between 2 and 6. Every time this number is rolled you gain a defiance point which is marked by filling in a box in the defiance section. For each row you have filled you may cancel five points (one box) of damage from an opponent. Once you use it you must cross it out, each row can only be used once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concentration&lt;br/&gt;This represents your level of concentration by the number of dice you get to roll on your turn. It is found in the middle of the force chart. In the top box write the number 2 because everyone begins with two dice. Whenever the dice amount changes, mark it here.&lt;br/&gt;(Everyone begins with 2 dice. If you you gain another dice then in the box below the 2 write 3 as the new number of dice you can use on each of your turns.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trinity!&lt;br/&gt;Whenever you roll three of a kind (except ones) you may yell TRINITY! Thereby gaining its benefit.&lt;br/&gt;If you choose to yell Trinity, you must stop rolling and add this final roll to your total. Multiply it by the number of like dice (in this case at least three). Now you may split your attack between up to three opponents instead of just one. Plus any damage from a Trinity can not be defied. (Trinity is the all powerful truth; undeniable in its consuming power!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unholy Trinity!&lt;br/&gt;Whenever you roll three ones... ouch. You lose three times the amount of backlash&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
