							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jati</name>
									
			<description>Significantly different from the celebrated bookshelf title, this Jati is a solo dexterity game where a player must use a magnet to guide a piece through a maze; in a sense, a bizarre relative of Polarity and Labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Jati, the fascinating action Puzzler, will challenge your skill as it tests your cool. All you do is maneuver the magnet around the Jati maze. Sounds easy - but, here's the catch - you can't touch the magnet! All maneuvering must be done with the magnetic wand. Come too close to the magnet with the wand and - you've had it. The magnet either plunges over the edge or reverses itself and leaps toward the wand. Only a dazzling display of dexterity on your part will maneuver the magnet around the Jati maze and into the center. So, test your skill and dexterity; see if you're a novice or a Jati Master, and score yourself accordingly. As a novice, you'll only score 25 points. To be a JATI Master, you'll have to maneuver the magnet in printed side up - no easy feat! For superb skill, the Jati Master scores 100 points. What if you get the magnet in upside down, you ask. Well, then you're only an advanced Jati player; score 75 points and keep practicing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with:&lt;br/&gt;Jati, a tile laying game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
