			<description>Uncharted: Fight for Fortune is a strategic turn-based card game based on the Uncharted series released on December 4, 2012. The game pits two players against each other, represented by characters from the series. The players use their decks of cards to defeat the opposing side. The game can connect with Uncharted: Golden Abyss, earning the player new cards based on their progression in the campaign and the trophies they have earned. Cards in the main game come from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and the video series Uncharted: Eye of Indra. Two expansion packs were made available on the PlayStation Network to add cards from Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Uncharted: Fight for Fortune&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
