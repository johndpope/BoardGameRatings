			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With as few cards as possible, try to portray a concept while everyone else tries to guess what it is. Whoever gets it first by calling it out receives points, as does the player who successfully portrayed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, in CardArt the players can use the cards as they like: laying them flat on the table, keep them in upright position, or any position they think are helpful to get the concept across to the table to the other players. You can even move them on the table and in the air. With the person card Luca, for example, it is easier to portray a racecar driver in his car or a parachuter under a slightly bended card. The only limits are with the imagination of the players...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
