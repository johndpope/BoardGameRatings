							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Options: Mythic Rogue Class Features</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being Mythic is Cool as Hell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules from Mythic Adventures provide many options for upgrading a character to the realm of mythic heroes. However, while there are numerous mythic spells and a long list of mythic feats (and even more are available in [Mythic Options: The Missing Core Feats]), none of the rogue&amp;rsquo;s class features have mythic upgrades available. There are trickster path abilities that tie into some rogue abilities or common skills, but no upgrades for the rogue&amp;rsquo;s main abilities and talents themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is unfortunate, because many rogue characters focus much more on their core abilities and talents than on feats. Mythic Options: Mythic Rogue Class Features offers mythic upgrades for every rogue class feature and talent from the core rulebook. It allows rogue characters to focus on classic rogue abilities such as uncanny dodge, skill mastery, and trap spotter, or select just a few such abilities to upgrade while adding the normal options of mythic feats and path abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
