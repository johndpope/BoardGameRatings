							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spanish Civil War: The World War of Spain</name>
									
			<description>With a great deal of support, a coalition within the Spanish Military (called Nationalists) declared their revolt in July 1936. The Nationalists allied with Conservative, Fascist, Monarchist and Catholic groups to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; Spain. The democratically elected government of Spain (called Republicans) gathered Left-wing Republicans, Socialists, Communists and Anarchists together to fight these &amp;ldquo;Nationalist&amp;rdquo; insurgents. The Nationalists were primarily supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and the dictatorship of Portugal. The Republicans were primarily supported by Communist Russia and Mexico. Other countries remained neutral and followed official policies of non-intervention. Many neutral country&amp;rsquo;s citizens however made their way to Spain to volunteer in the International Brigades and fight for Republican Spain.&lt;br/&gt;In Spain the sides are clear. Can the red tide be stopped in Spain? Can fascism be given its first real defeat here? Whatever happens, the conflict in Spain will echo on into the coming war that will likely engulf the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the War:&lt;br/&gt;Every territory has resources of men and material to gain or lose until final victory is in sight. On your turn you build, maneuver, and deploy your land and air forces to gain territory for yourself, and deny it to your enemy. In a civil war you fight until one side surrenders. In Spanish Civil War: The World War of Spain, this is the case. You fight until one side surrenders or until one side controls every province of mainland Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
