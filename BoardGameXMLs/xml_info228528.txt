							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Wonders of the Reticulan Empire</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;50 Wonders of the Reticulan Empire is an advanced technology supplement for the These Stars Are Ours! sci-fi setting, also published by Stellagama Publishing. It uses the Cepheus Engine rules and is fully compatible with all other 2D6 OGL Sci-Fi games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reticulan Empire is the richest, most powerful political entity in known space, outshining even its mighty Chiwak rivals. Millennia old, it has reached a mature and stable Tech Level 13. This technological know-how allows the Reticulans to produce marvels of advanced science beyond anything the Terrans can reliably manufacture. This booklet provides a sample of 50 technological and psionic wonders developed and used by the Reticulan Empire, from compact handheld laser &amp;quot;blasters&amp;quot;, advanced cybernetics and gravitics, to the arcane psionic devices that unleash the power of the Reticulan mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are playing in a different setting than These Stars Are Ours! this product can serve as a resource for high-tech equipment available to mature interstellar societies. All technologies here will fit &amp;ndash; with occasional minor adjustment &amp;ndash; into any advanced TL13+ world or polity in any setting compatible with the Cepheus Engine or the 2D6 Science Fiction SRD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
