							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: The Fungal Corridor</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind the door, the passage opens into a stale, moldy smelling narrow corridor that arches steeply downwards. Whether the passageway was hand-carved or is simply a crude nature passage, is visually undecipherable as the walls, floor, and ceiling are completely overgrown with pustulate, spongy-looking, sickly grey fungus. Haphazardly constructed, like makeshift suspension bridge, a flight of stairs hangs from the ceiling. An off-color slimy mold coats the ropes binding the stair treads and ascending into the ceiling where they seemingly disappear into whatever substance engulfs the corridor. The staircase itself descends 20 feet down into a dangerous looking small 5-foot-square fungus encrusted orifice. -- Discover the Fungal Corridor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 12, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
