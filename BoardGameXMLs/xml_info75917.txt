			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;The teams (or the two individual players) observe carefully one of the twelve fully illustrated panels, trying to find out objects which name begins with the letter chosen and writing them on an appropriate paper sheet. The panels are very complex and full of detailed images. After the time is out, the teams sum their points, gaining 1 point for repeated words and 5 points for unique words. Each object should be mentioned only once (no singular/plural differentiation), but the same word can be repeated if it represents different objects on the panel. After the twelfth panel is used, the total points are added together and the winner is the team (individual player) with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
