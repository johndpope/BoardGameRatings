			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;It's about having fun whilst learning about wine! The board game is for 4 or more adults and key features include blind tasting and the testing of wine knowledge through answering &amp;quot;Experience&amp;quot; questions of varying levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is the owner of an internationally acclaimed vineyard. Each circuit of the board is a year in the life of their business and players must travel around the board to bottle their yield and sell their wine at market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will need to bring a bottle of wine, which they have to disguise from other players using one of the special Quaffers drawstring bags provided in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, players can eliminate all others (survive without going bankrupt) or take over two other vineyards. Players vineyards are put up for sale when their wine is identified - &amp;quot;Taste or Bid&amp;quot; squares let the player have a go at identifying the masked bottle of wine that one of the players has brought to the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
