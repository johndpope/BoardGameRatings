							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dino-Duell</name>
									
			<description>In Dino-Duell two players each control 12 dinosaurs, with four dinosaurs each of three different types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dinosaurs start the game in the back rows of a 6x7 game board, and on a turn, a player moves a dinosaur horizontally, vertically or diagonally to a free field or to a field with an opponent's dinosaur; this last move is possible, however, only if prior to the move those two dinosaurs are separated by exactly one dinosaur that belongs to the capturing player and if all three dinosaurs involved in the capture are of different types. Landing on an opponent's dinosaur this way removes that token from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to place four of his dinosaurs adjacent in the river that runs through the middle of the game board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
