			<description>From the introduction of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vignette is a role playing game (or RPG, as we say) of immense proportions and stupefying simplicity, designed to allow you to create exciting stories in any setting imaginable, with a minimum of&lt;br/&gt;fuss, or even preparation.&lt;br/&gt;Vignette is first and foremost an easy game. The guidelines and suggestions within this book have been designed to allow players to move from the thought &amp;rsquo;lets role play in this setting...&amp;rsquo; to actually&lt;br/&gt;playing within a matter of minutes. The character design system is quick and intuitive, allowing you to play any kind of character you desire, and the dice mechanics are easy to learn, and very simple to use.&lt;br/&gt;Vignette is also universal. Or generic. Or whatever you want to call it. These core rules are not wrapped around a specific background or setting, and make an effort to assume nothing. It is a basic system around which you may create your own settings and stories. You will find Vignette offers a wide range of choices for you to customise the game to your preferred style of play, and more than enough room for you to add your own ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
