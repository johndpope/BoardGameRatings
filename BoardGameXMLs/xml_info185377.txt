			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic FRINGE was intended to be the complete base rules of the FRINGE system, but it was never fully completed.  The game was created and tested by an online consortium.  The final-state of the rules was released in PDF format as &amp;quot;Version 0.1&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Primary Traits (Agility, Intelligence, Stamina, Strength, Presence, and Wits) and Secondary Traits (Defense, Fatigue, Health, Passion, Size, Speed, and Will).  Primary Traits range from 0-5; Secondary Traits range from 1-20.  Some characters have Unique Traits (Advantages, Disadvantages, Personality Traits).  Character creation may be free or may use a points pool for distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution uses either an Unopposed Action Roll or an Opposed Action Roll.  Unopposed Action Rolls use 1d10 + Trait + Ability (if any) - Difficulty Class.  A zero or positive trait results in success.  The system presents five levels of success and five levels of failure for Action Roll values of -21 to 21.  Opposed Action Rolls are similar but both opponents make the roll to compare levels of success.  Action Rolls &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot; on a 1 or a 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
