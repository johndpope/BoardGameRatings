			<description>Loose translation from the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancestry is a RPG that plans to balance realism and fantasy without being too complex or trivial. The book offers a complete game system.&lt;br/&gt;Combat rules, within everyone's grasp, are supplemented by optional rules for expert players.&lt;br/&gt;Caracters' creation starts from the choice of the race and offers many different possibilities. The players can let their character grow combining together a large amount of professions, crafts and skills.&lt;br/&gt;Wizards, clerics, sorcerers and alchemists can choose between over 400 spells. The book includes detailed methodologies on how to create magical items, thus offering endless possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;The monsters' catalogue is very rich, with goblins, ninphes, dragons and all kind of classical fantasy creatures, but also detailed informations abouts undeads and demons. By way of necromancy and &amp;quot;hybridomancy&amp;quot; it is possible to generate countless more monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
