			<description>Oiligopoly tries to parallel as much as possible the real world oil industry while at the same time trying to keep the game simple and interesting. For example, a player must find crude-oil, refine it into gasoline, and then sell the gasoline. This is done by landing on an oil well property to collect a round crude-oil chip, taking the round chip to a refinery property where it is exchanged for a square gasoline chip, and and taking the square chip to a gas station property where it is sold to the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the instruction manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oiligopoly uses Monopoly-style concepts to simulate the oil industry, while adding some unique play elements which help it work with the theme. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
