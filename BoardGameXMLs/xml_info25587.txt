							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silly Sammy Seagull</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The quick, funny fishing game!  Catch the fish as they swim around.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silly Sammy Seagull is a children's' action/dexterity game for 2-4 players, and is remarkably similar to Hungry Hungry Hippos.  Each player has a lever-activated seagull that magnetically picks up fish tokens from a electrically-driven turntable.  Catching a fish requires the right balance of force and timing, and captured fish are cleared manually.  When all fish have been caught, the player with the most captured fish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
