It was released in Japan as a launch title on February 26, 2011, and was released in North America on March 27th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bust-a-Move Universe is similar to its predecessors in that the goal is to connect three bubbles of the same color to make them disappear. Different modes of play include boss battles, 100-second, 300-second, or Challenge Mode. Dinosaur duo Bub and Bob travel the universe in a spaceship as doors open on planets, which release bubbles that turn into space debris.
