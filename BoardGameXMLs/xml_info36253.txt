			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Battle between two Star Trek Fleets. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a single Ship (unit). Victory: You win if you Destroy the opposing Dreadnaught.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the ships. The players choose to play as the Federation, Klingons, or Romulans. Each side has eight ships: three Destroyers, two Scouts, two Cruiers, and one Dreadnaught. The only distinction between the types of ships is the number of hits they can take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the shared deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
