			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Protectors is a Tower Defence-type game.  You place units alongside a path and the enemy units attempt to get past.  You start each level with a number of lives and each time an enemy makes it past your troops you lose a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game places an emphasis on being 'cute fantasy' so examples of the enemies you encounter are Ping-Wings (penguins) and Skullies (skeletons).  The graphics are cartoonish to fit this theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay in Little Protectors is presented as being initially simpler than that in the other Protector games, however there are several elements unique to this entry in the series including resource farming and crafting, and collecting loot from defeated enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
