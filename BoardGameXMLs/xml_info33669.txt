			<description>The game box contains a play mat/poster and a set of three six sided dice engraved with letters instead of numbers (except for one that also contains numbers and one other with a blank side). Any number of players may play. &lt;br/&gt;The play mat is Irish themed and bears no other impact on the game apart from providing an area where betting chips may be placed.&lt;br/&gt;A banker is elected by throwing the only lettered dice that also contains a number, the highest number gets the bank first. Players place chips (bets) on any combination of the ten spaces provided on the play mat as a first action. Next, the three dice are thrown and the result matched up with three lettered word combinations indicated on the ten spaces of the board. Players with chips placed in the same named board space as the word rolled, receive between two &amp;amp; seven times the amount bet depending on the number rolled on one of the dice combinations. The banker collects all loosing chips and also if a word is rolled that has not been bet upon by any player. The banker looses the bank when one of the dice turns up blank and a new banker is selected amongst the other players as indicated above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
