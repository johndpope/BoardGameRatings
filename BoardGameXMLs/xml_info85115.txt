			<description>Summarized from the rule sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes and Villains from the Book of Mormon can be played by two or more people.  Each player is given four cards from the shuffled deck, and the rest of the cards are placed face down to be the &amp;quot;fish pond&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player asks any other player for a card related to one of the cards s/he is holding.  For instance, if player number one holds the &amp;quot;Nephi&amp;quot; card with &amp;quot;Obtain Brass Plates&amp;quot; at the top of the card, s/he will ask for any of the cards named on the bottom of the card, all of which are &amp;quot;Nephi&amp;quot; cards.  If the player asked has that card, s/he must give it up and the first player gets to ask again, and plays until forced to &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; (drawing a card from the draw pile when the first player requests a card from a player that isn't in the hand of that player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All four cards equal a book, and the player with the most books at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;44 Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
