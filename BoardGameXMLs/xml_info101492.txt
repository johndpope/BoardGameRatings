			<description>ports Talk Baseball (released in Japan as Pro Yakyuu Super League '91) is a Mega Drive/Genesis baseball video game which features an official MLBPA license as well as most rules and aspects followed by Major League Baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike real professional baseball however, the game ends when one team has 10 or more runs than the other team (win by domination, or &amp;quot;mercy&amp;quot; rule). Players can play either exhibition, regular season, all-star, or playoff games. The game also features authentic Major League Baseball rosters for the 1991 season. Gameplay commonly features double and triple plays, and only the fastest runners in the game are capable of stealing bases. It was one of the first video games to feature individual hitting abilities for each pitcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classic match-ups include Texas' Nolan Ryan versus Oakland's lineup with such all-stars as Jose Canseco, Rickey Henderson, Dave Henderson, and Mark McGwire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sports Talk Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
