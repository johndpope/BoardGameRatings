Each card has a value between 1 and 8, a name, a small fact, and a game-play ability.  Cards from different themes can be mixed.  Players draw a hand of three cards from their decks.  They then simultaneously choose one and reveal it.  The higher number wins the round.  Special powers will break rules and make things interesting.  The player who first wins 4 rounds (short game) or 6 rounds (long game) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
