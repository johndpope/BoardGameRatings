							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghost</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghost can be used as a starting character, or as a way to keep a slain character in the game. Depending on your campaign this could be permanent, just until they complete some task and move on, or even until they get brought back from the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In latter circumstances you could treat is as a kind of compendium class, allowing players to mix and match ghost moves with moves from their original class (or, if the character started as a ghost, let them more freely multiclass into another class).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout (which still only allowed us to fit 30 of the 32 advanced moves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized books, one in color, the other in black and white (to make it easier to print at home if you want). They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The ghost class (which, again, has 30 default advanced moves).&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut with questions to ask yourself, explanations for some of the moves, and a pair of advanced moves that we couldn't fit on the character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
