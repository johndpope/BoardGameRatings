							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of Kerakos</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most human cities grow with life, the great city of Thetos arose from a devotion to the study of death. Over the centuries, necromancers from around the world (and perhaps other worlds) have been drawn to the secret wisdom hidden within her walls. It is said that even the great necromancer Rils abided for a time within the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales speak of those who came seeking the knowledge of Rils and most tales end with the final death of the seeker. Some few, such as Kerakos, managed to survive the tests and become great necromancers. When Rils departed from the city his students honored him by creating their own challenges in imitation of those they had faced. Kerakos, reputed to be among the greatest of Rils&amp;rsquo; students, reputably created just such a tomb within the desert near Thetos. While the tales of the tomb vary, most of them share a common detail: anyone who can survive the dangers of the tomb can shed the bonds of mortality and gain everlasting existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomb of Kerakos is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure. It is intended for a party of 3rd-6th level characters. It is written to follow Rils' Lesser Sanctum, but can be run as a stand-alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the features of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed color maps for the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     Full statistics are included for all encounters&amp;mdash;no need to look up monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     New Monsters ( Desert Ghast, Desert Zombie, and Kerakos Mummy)&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items (Armor of Kerakos, Scarab of Kerakos).&lt;br/&gt;     Free Hero Lab portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;     Giant scorpions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
