							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ilshara: Lands of Exile</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the World of Mystika, and to the Realms of Ilshara, the Lands of Exile! This is a Fantasy&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Setting designed to work with Castles &amp;amp; Crusades &amp;copy; as published by Troll Lord Games, however&lt;br/&gt;with a little work it could be utilized by almost any RPG game system. The information as given within this setting is left as generalized in terms of game design as possible, not only to allow for its easy adaptation amongst varying systems but also to encourage the individual game masters to make the world their own in terms of the fine print of adventuring. Thus, what you will find within are the broad strokes on the canvas the essential information on geography, history, religion and politics in the Lands of Exile, along with a smattering of important figures and possible NPCs. The details as to how any individual, group or even country of Ilshara might play in a campaign are left to the imagination of those who play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
