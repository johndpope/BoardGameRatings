			<description>A game obviously inspired by the Scrabble board, triple and double value squares are an important part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 2 to 4 players take part. You draw a number of tiles from the 108 (2 decks of cards in effect) provided. In your turn you should try to form legitimate Poker hands, which are added to the board crossword-fashion. The winner is the player with the most points after a given number of games. It is also suggested in the rules that this will be a good game for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were originally published in Games &amp;amp; Puzzles #2 (June 1972).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
