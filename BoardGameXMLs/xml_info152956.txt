							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mischief Night</name>
									
			<description>Card game where you must get rid of all your cards to win, but beware... the monsters are out to get you on Mischief Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A light, fast paced card game for 3-12 players. Earn tokens by going out first and being named the Pumpkin King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Mischief Night is to get rid of all of your cards as fast as possible. The 92-card deck contains 78 monster cards ranked from 1 to 12, along with two Jokers (wild) and a Mischief Night X-deck of 12 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. There are twelve 12&amp;rsquo;s, eleven 11&amp;rsquo;s, ten 10&amp;rsquo;s and so on, and a single card ranked #1 which is the Pumpkin King.  The lower the number, the better the rank. While the #12s are low ranking cards and the hardest to get rid of, they each have a unique ability that may be used during the Mischief Night part of play at the beginning of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the standard monster cards, there is another deck of twelve special (X) cards with different backs. This deck serves two purposes; it is used before the game starts to determine the starting player order and then 2 cards are earned each round by the player who earned Pumpkin King status.  During the Mischief Round they are very useful in battling the individual special powers of the #12 cards. The more rounds you win, the better chance you have of protecting yourself from the mischief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
