			<description>(from the Box:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The storm which is World War IV engulfs the continent of Australia. War sparks ingenuity. Ingenuity birth technology. Technology is escalation. The puppet regime which is called Shuttoral World Government is the enemy. The Australian-led resistance grows in strength with the advent of the HAFS &amp;lsquo;Jerry&amp;rsquo;, a tow-legged tank with a ground speed of 54 km/hr. War continues&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;January 11, 2885: New Canberra City falls to Australian forces. The Germans retreat south skirting the desert.&lt;br/&gt;February 3, 2885: Shuttoral forces, isolated, make an abortive drive on the township of Gibson. A beachhead rescue saves most ot the force.&lt;br/&gt;April 25, 2885: Shuttoral scientists make a secret presentation to Command of the prototype Krachen vogel, armed drone recon. This weapon will be particularly nasty to the Allies because of its similarity to the un-armed Neuspotter.&lt;br/&gt;April 26, 2885: Plans begin for a new Shuttoral offensive towards New Canberra City. The directive is &amp;ldquo;Take, or destroy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SF3D is a Fast-Moving, Realistic 2-player Game of War, Inspired by the award-winning series of plastic model kits, by Nitto of Japan. This game has been thoroughly playtested in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;Limited, Numbered Edition of 2,040&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;480 Superb, die-cut doubled-sided oversized counters&lt;br/&gt;4 folding, full-color, semi-geomorphic map boards&lt;br/&gt;20-page Japanese rulebook, numbered&lt;br/&gt;10 Scenario Cards, plus variants&lt;br/&gt;1 Combat Chart Card, 2 Air Commitment Cards&lt;br/&gt;2 six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(BGG description:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all of the science fiction wargames that were published in Japan, almost all were based off anime shows, and none used original designs (even the US Battletech just used robots from JPN anime shows without permission to begin). This one does use its own story and designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 4 mounted maps, and many scenarios that are each given their own scenario cards (ala the US Squad Leader wargame). Includes slightly larger counters than are usually used in Japanese wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was an expansion/sequel to this produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
