			<description>Published in the Xmas special issue of Plasma (n&amp;deg;15).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During April 8th 1945, last survivors of the Leibstandarte Adolf Hirler and of the Hitlerjugend struggle one last time in the little town of Wiener-Neustadt, a few kilometers south of Vienna.&lt;br/&gt;Facing them, the best elements of the Soviet Guard 6th Army. One the houses on the outskirts of the town is the place of violent fights. All the night, the combat moves from room to room and the last combatants kill each others in the most grim ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now April 8th 1995 and the soldiers who died that night come back to reenact, as they do each year, the fight that occurred.&lt;br/&gt;Hatred is the energy that make them live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.....................&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 5 undead soldiers. One player controls the undead Soviets, the other the German ones.&lt;br/&gt;They fight on a map of the house (garden and first floor, square cases, not hexagons).&lt;br/&gt;Hatred influences the Action Points pools and other game mechanics. Each player has 50 hatred points he uses as 'fuel' for his characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses a D6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
