							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNLOCKED</name>
									
			<description>The game is as simple as the name. The whole of UNLOCKED is based around the theme of skeleton keys and their many components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNLOCKED features 2 decks of cards. There are the key cards, and the key component cards. The key components can be assembled to create any of the keys on the key cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with the dealer (who has already dealt every player a hand of cards). The dealer then flips the first key card over. He then draws 2 cards and then plays or discards 2 cards. Cards can either be played to build the key or can be played to do nasty little things, like destroy another players key or remove the flipped key altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game continues, each player takes turns building their keys to match the one flipped. After the first key is made, 2 additional keys are flipped. The longer the key, the more points it is worth. The first player to 25 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the subtle details in this game that add to the strategy. The special cards and bluffing the other players each have their own strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
