							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flatten out Monsters</name>
									
			<description>Monsters invade! Heroes are ready to defend in groups of two, but these heroes are out of control and need an intelligent leader to lead them to victory. Can you do it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flatten out Monsters is a new type of memory game in which you need to memorize only six cards! Can you effectively lead the heroes and flatten out the monsters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, monster cards are placed in a 3x7 grid and double-sided hero cards are placed in a 3x2 grid in front of the monsters. Heroes in the same line &amp;mdash; that is, a line of two hero cards &amp;mdash; will fight the seven monsters lined in front of them. On a player's turn, he must swap two hero cards, then flip them to the reverse sides. These two cards activate the cards in the same line with them and become the attacking groups, then you resolve the attack on the monsters one by one in each activated line. If the two hero cards show the icons needed to defeat the first monster in line, they win the fight and score the monster card. Then they fight against the second monster, and so on until they fail. Play continues in clockwise order until at least two lines of monsters are all defeated, and whoever has the most monster cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
