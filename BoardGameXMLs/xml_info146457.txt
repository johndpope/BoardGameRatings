							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AirBuccaneers</name>
									
			<description>AirBuccaneers is a multiplayer airship-FPS game about vicious Buccaneers and infamous Vikings battling in the sky. It requires seamless teamwork and strategic battle skills. AirBuccaneers is an indie PC game powered by Unity 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient North, once the cradle of culture and peace, is now corrupted by magic and inhabited by nasty bandits sowing destruction in airships. Originally an UT2004 mod, AirBuccaneers has now been developed into a full game by a Finnish game studio LudoCraft, which specialises in multiplayer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player chooses to be a Buccaneer or a Viking and takes a glider to the skies. The goal is to drop enemy vessels and secure dominance of the ancient North. You can use different weapons, help others, board enemy ships or be the captain &amp;ndash; whatever it takes to get your enemies out of the way. The success, as well as the bitter defeat, is solely dependent on how well you co-operate with your crew mates. Finding the right kind of battle strategy is not self-evident in the merciless winds and twisted magic of the North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has taken inspiration from medieval descriptions, sagas and other ancient northern myths. The landscapes are breath-taking &amp;ndash; even though magic has spread and corrupted the surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AirBuccaneers was greenlit by Steam users on the second set to Steam. Those having purchased the game before Steam release will automatically receive a Steam key for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
