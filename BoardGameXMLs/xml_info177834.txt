							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Black Star Commando</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Star Commandos are the galaxy's foremost fighting force. A nearly unstoppable, impeccably trained cadre of cyber-enhanced supersoldiers, the Black Star Commandos are answerable only to KOMAND ONE, a planetary artificial intelligence as ancient and potent as the Adam Intelligence itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Star Commandos are the most elite soldiers serving Galaxy Command. These implacable, robotic Spartans guard Galaxy Command's most important sites and leaders, serve as ceremonial&lt;br/&gt;guards for the Galactic Senate and lead commando incursions deep into WARSTAR territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Star Brigade is the best of the best, with a tour of duty as a Black Star Commando only availbe to the most skilled, dedicated and loyal of Galaxy Command's soldiers. In addition to skill and loyalty, prospective Commandos must possess a killer instinct bred out of the human majority by two millennia of peace. Unlike the peacekeeping Galactic Marshalls, Commandos are just what their name implies- they are soldiers, killers and an offensive force. Their presence often makes the clean-cut, heroic men and women of Galaxy Command nervous, but noone can question their heroism, or the necessity of the Black Star Brigade's existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Advanced Class is intended for the Galaxy Command setting and includes all the information needed to add the Black Star Commando to your game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
