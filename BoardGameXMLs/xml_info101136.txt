							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armageddon: The End is Near</name>
									
			<description>The game is played in a scenario on the brink of the Doomsday. Everything is scarce, raiders roaming free, nanotechnology is being used freely and natural resources are coming to an end. The so called government is trying to crowd control an inevitable riot but what they really want is to leave the planet before the end. However, only a few people know this plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a faction opposing the government but due to the latest information leak you will be struggling to participate in the escape route. Or you can start a Coup and take over control. Game ends when world ends or when the Coup is triggered. Whoever had the most influence wins the game and explores the new dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armageddon is the first of a three-game trilogy telling the history of some surviving factions in a post-nuclear war environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's mainly a dice placement game using dice &amp;quot;pips&amp;quot; to get whatever goods are remaining, fight over some decay buildings and government privileges. The game lasts 7 rounds and each round one space for gathering resources is taken away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking its basis from Stone Age and Alien Frontiers, it's intended as a highly-tematic dice-placement games of struggle for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
