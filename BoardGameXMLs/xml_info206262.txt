			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in five ages. In the age of Creation, all players will take the role of a titan. Collaboratively they will tell a story about how their actions lead to the creation of the game world and they will draw a map of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following three ages, Myth, Legend and History, involve taking turns to play through the events of the ages of this world. In each age the players will play a different role but they will always had a great impact to the world through their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        In Myth they will be gods, roaming the world and reshaping it.&lt;br/&gt;        In Legend they will be heroes, trying to put their mark on the world and to be remembered by History.&lt;br/&gt;        In History they will be rulers, not powerfull in themsleves but leaders of many men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last Age, Memory, we will zoom on a small group of a characters whose actions will not not have a world-changing&lt;br/&gt;impact but will nonetheless be important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During development the game was titled Ruination and Millennia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
