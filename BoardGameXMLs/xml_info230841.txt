			<description>All questions are for sale. Tease your opponents by increasing the bid and win the auction of your favourite categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Auktionsquiz all questions are for sale. Whomever bid the highest on one of the 10 categories, wins the chance to answer a question in the category and can win 1 point on a correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have a limited amount to bid in the auctions, so you have to think fast and bid smart. Should you bid on a category to drive up the prices for the other players? Should you have play cool and only bid on the categories you like? Categories that are popular will be expensive, while other categories will be cheap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players receive a number of auction cards, which can be used to play for double points, steal questions from other players, or get points when opponents answer a question correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of Auctionsquiz is the player with most points when all the auctions have ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
