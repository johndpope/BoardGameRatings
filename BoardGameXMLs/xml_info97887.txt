							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: Rangers Command Squad â€“ &quot;The Boss&quot;</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;The Boss is an expansion for Dust Tactics, the tactical miniatures board game of explosive battlefield combat! With The Boss, an Allied Rangers Command Squad, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain a new level of control over your Dust Tactics forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boss has the Command Squad ability, making it indispensable in overseeing your other forces. Their exceptional motivational skills even allow them to reactivate units that you&amp;rsquo;ve already used! What&amp;rsquo;s more, both squads have the Artillery Strike ability, meaning they can serve as spotters for any friendly tank armed with Artillery (as described in the Artillery rules in the Operation Cyclone Campaign Expansion)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boss is a squad of Allied officers, and they&amp;rsquo;re on the battlefield to ensure that every order is perfectly executed. Like other Rangers, the Allied Command is equipped with assault rifles and a machine gun, but their real strength lies in their ability to coordinate the attacks of other units. Known for its powerful leadership capability, this unit is a high-priority target that must be protected at all costs. But used wisely, they&amp;rsquo;ll tip the balance in your favor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
