							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Schatz der Inkas</name>
									
			<description>This is a game about collecting treasures of the Incas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center of the board shows a number of different treasures, connected by paths. Five cards are drawn, each showing one of these treasures. Players roll a die to move their pawn, and when they reach a treasure that is on one of the cards, they place a chip in their color on that card. Each card can be visited three times; the first player to find a treasure gets the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The score is kept on a track around the board. Several spaces on this track have a symbol; if a player lands on such a space, they may discard one of the treasure cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that is the first to reach the end of the score track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with the Ravenburger game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
