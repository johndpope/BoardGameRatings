			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VRAANZANNTH is intended to be a generic, universal resolution mechanism for role-playing in any genre.  The game uses an atypical dice method by rolling 1D12 and 2D6, with most results (except outright failure) being resolved with an action table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the system have six Attributes:  Strength, Reflex, Vitality, Personality, Mentality, and Vanity.  Attributes typically range from +5 to -5.  Vanity is also referred to as the &amp;quot;normalizer stat&amp;quot; and has three sub-values; it generally is used when something else don't seem to fit.  Each Attribute covers a range of Skills, each Skill has a Points value.  Attribute values and Skill Points are used as modifiers on action resolution dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 2.0 presents a slightly more intelligible overview of the game rules as well as cleaned-up action tables and far fewer typographical errors from Version 1.0.  Generally speaking, the two versions are interchangeable.  Version 1.0 was titled VraanZannth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
