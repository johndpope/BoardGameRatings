							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clear Round</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race against the clock!&lt;br/&gt;A frantic family show jumping game where players set up a course, then race against the timer to complete the jumps with the fewest faults. Saddle up, watch out for the poles and try not to spook your horse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is double sided - dressage and cross country - and the aim is to get your horse around the course as fast as possible (the round is timed by a sand timer) without picking up faults (represented by cards) at the obstacles along the way. The person closest to a &amp;quot;clear round&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
