							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Bible Objects</name>
									
			<description>Game has 105 cards, each bearing a picture of some object connected with the Bible or Bible times and in most cases one or more Bible references. Shuffle the cards and deal 10 cards to each player. Each player tries to make books. Three cards of the same class of subjets make up a book. These completed books are placed aside till the end of the game when they are counted. Whoever has the most books wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player calls any player he wishes and asks for a card from any series - (Animals, Trees etc.) If successful then the player may continue asking for other cards from any player he wants until he asks for a card from a player and that player does not have one that he asked for, at which time the active player draws 3 cards from the deck and play passes to the next player to his left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #4012&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
