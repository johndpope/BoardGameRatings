			<description>Ingression is a 2 player strategy game in two phases and has a fluid maze that changes each turn through player actions. In the first phase, the Build Phase, players work to build a maze of cards in a 5 x 5 grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the maze is built, the Ingression Phase begins.  Players navigate the maze by creating new paths on the grid.  At the beginning of a turn, a play may draw a new tile and replace a tile already on the board, or turn a tile to create a new path. One of these actions must be taken each turn, and the player also must move if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a player must move their pawn to the other side before their opponent reaches theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 39 maze tiles and 2 home tiles, two movement cubes (blank red and blue colored dice), and a small full color instruction manual.  It is designed to be small, portable, and easy to learn.  Ingression can be taught to new players in as little as 5 minutes.  The game does not require much space to play, somewhere between 1 and 2 square feet depending on how the players lay it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
