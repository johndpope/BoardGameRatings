			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long have the fey captured mankind&amp;rsquo;s imaginations. Dwellers in Dream is a fey-themed player sourcebook containing five all-new races for the Pathfinder RPG. This new sourcebook explores five original fey-themed races for your d20 and Pathfinder games. These are not your standard fantasy fey either, these are creations from the darkest recesses of the twisted minds over at Total Party Kill Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of the five new player races is the Briarborn, a plant-like race born of nature&amp;rsquo;s response to harm and injury. They grow quickly and are a measured response to the likes of orcs and men who would seek to harm the world itself. Then there are the Crimbil, goblin-blooded fey and snatchers of children. Next, we explore the True Changelings, mercurial shape-shifting fey. There is also the Glimmerkin, a race of elves who used magic to enter a chrysalis state for an age and emerged something altogether different. Lastly is the Sylfaen, a brutal warden of nature and fey lands, the leaders of the Wyld Hunts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each race is fully developed with a total of 80 pages of content! There are tons of new fey-themed feats, abilities, traits, archetypes, spells, magical items and even a new plane of existence. All of the content is hyperlinked to the d20pfsrd.com website for your convenience of use and extensively bookmarked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
