			<description>Craters of Tharsis is a two-player boardgame published in Buck Rogers magazine #3.  It is based, in part, on the novel Hammer of Mars (also published by TSR).  One player takes the role of the NEO freedom fighters, the other plays the omnipresent RAM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a mapsheet of the area (where the battles for Mars take place), 6 pages of rules (covering basic initiative, movement, and attack phases), and one sheet of cut-out counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory points are given to each player for destroying (or stealing, for the NEO player) enemy units.  The game ends when all NEO troops are killed or all RAM Krait fighters have left the map.  The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
