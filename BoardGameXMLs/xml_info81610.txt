			<description>M.U.S.H.A. (known in Japan as Musha Aleste: Full Metal Fighter Ellinor (武者アレスタ)) is a 1990 vertically scrolling shooter developed by Compile and released by Toaplan in Japan and Seismic in the United States. It is part of the Aleste series. The game instantly became popular among scrolling shooter fans. M.U.S.H.A. remains popular among Sega Genesis  collectors today, and is one of the most expensive games for the system -- it has been known to reach high prices on eBay. This game is also available on the Wii Virtual Console, where it was released in North America on January 19, 2009. The PAL regions got this game on July 17, 2009 as an import.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the US version, M.U.S.H.A. is an acronym for &amp;quot;Metallic Uniframe Super Hybrid Armor&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an alternate Tenryaku  Era in the year 91 (2290 AD in the American version), technological advancements in Japan suddenly explode making robotics, computers and space travel possible. A space colony project is planned, but the environmental control system to a space colony known as &amp;quot;Little Japan&amp;quot; goes out of control and the supercomputer controlling the colony, Dire51, goes rogue, sending its attack units against mankind. Leading the attacks is a black transforming attack robot called Big Asia (大亜) responsible for most of the attacks. A defense squad of mech pilots is called in for a counter-attack, but only one pilot, Ellinor (Terri in the American release), survived and continues the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;M.U.S.H.A.,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
