			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion for Hero Kids includes ten new monstrous pets for your game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Beguiler - The beguiler's eyestalks unleash powerful and versatile magic&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Boar - The battle-boar carries stalwart heroes into battle&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Gorilla - Enemies' attacks only strengthen the gorilla's attacks&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Griffon - The griffon swoops down to carry off its prey&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Hydra - Each of the hydra's three heads has a different ability&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Phoenix - The phoenix is shrouded in blankets of flame&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Salamander - The quick-footed salamander radiates intense heat&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Wyrmling - This juvenile dragon spits balls of crackling lightning&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Wyvern - The wyvern fledgling buffets enemies with its wings&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;bull; Yeti - The thick-furred yeti throws hard-packed icy boulders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pets included in this pack are intended to be used by players in conjunction with their normal heroes.  The players must split their move and normal action between their hero and their pet.  When used like this, players with heroes and pets do not overshadow players without pets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want, you can allow your players to run their pets independently, giving the pets their own actions separate from the normal heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
