							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slik Stik</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Slik Stik was a smaller sibling to the widely popular joystick TAC-2 from the same manufacturer. It had a very similar design but was smaller and the base could quite easily be gripped in one hand. Also, the button had only 1 placement making it rather unfit for left-handed gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the TAC-2, the Slik Stik was simply a metal pin that touched metal plates, and the spring that pulled it back into center position was a bit of rubber. The connectors were very close to the stick, so it had to be merely touched a bit to connect, making the Slik Stik an ideal controller for &amp;quot;wiggle&amp;quot; games where the goal was to wiggle the joystick back and forth quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
