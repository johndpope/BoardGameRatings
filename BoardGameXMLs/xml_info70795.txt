							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Collection of Fantastic Weapons</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has the +1 sword lost its luster? How many holy maces has your character owned? Has finding an enchanted weapon become as routine as finding coins? A Collection of Fantastic Weapons is your answer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put the magic back into magic weapons with this amazing collection of 150 unique treasures. Every single weapon in this book gets the full treatment. An entertaining description provides each weapon's origin or history, its reputed powers, and details about its construction and appearance. Use these to create legends or to inspire adventures and even entire campaigns! Finally, each weapon is beautifully illustrated so you know exactly what your characters are packing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following each description are three full sets of game stats that present the weapon at power levels suitable for low-, mid-, and high-level characters. No matter how many campaigns and adventures you play, and no matter what class and level your characters, you'll never run out of intriguing magic weapons again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the descriptions start, a chapter on the mechanics of magical weapons tells you everything you need to know about creating your own unique weapons. To get you started, we give you over thirty brand new magic weapon special abilities.  New random weapon special ability tables consolidate them all to more than double the abilities in your arsenal. By combining these and the other unique abilities given to most of the weapons described, you have at your fingertips the ability to thousands and thousands of singular weapons for your campaign. Never again will you have to settle for an ordinary, +3 sword!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is your one resource for magical weapons. Whether you need a weapon on the fly or want to create your own wondrous weapon, this book is all you'll need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
