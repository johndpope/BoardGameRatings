			<description>This fast paced card game is all about risk and reward. Players are dealt cards equal to the number of players and play one card each round, with the lowest card winning that round. The winner receives points equaling the number on the winning card. The first player to reach 50 points is declared the winner, so bid high (but not too high)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
