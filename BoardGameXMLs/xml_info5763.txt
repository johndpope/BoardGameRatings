							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Home Sports Trivia: Texas Rangers Edition</name>
									
			<description>This baseball themed trivia game has two teams made up of the players participating and a &amp;quot;batting order&amp;quot; for each team is devised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As each player has their &amp;quot;at bat,&amp;quot; they roll a die. If a 5 is rolled, it is a walk. A 6 is a strikeout. In both of these cases, the result is resolved according to the rules of baseball. Rolls of 1-4 require the player to answer a trivia question. An incorrect answer is an out, while a correct answer is a hit. A 1 is a single, 2 a double, 3 a triple and 4 a homer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game lasts for 9 innings with the team with the most runs winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition contains cards with questions about the Texas Rangers and their progenitor the Washington Senators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
