			<description>User Notes: For characters level 4-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: In the 7th year of the reign of King Kessel V, in the kingdom of Antharp, in the shadow of the Silverbray Mountains, at the south end of Druna Pass, your search for adventure has led you to the sleepy town of Crow's Watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the few days you have spent here, you have found that the people of Antharp were once prosperous and proud of their king, but recent events have brought the spirits of these vibrant people down. It all began when Herzl, court wizard and trusted advisor to King Kessel V, and his father before him, left the king's court for unknown reasons two years ago. Then, from the last spring planting to the autumn harvest, raids by renegade bands of goblins plundered the border communities of Antharp. Only the onset of winter stopped the goblins from further destruction, and all efforts to track and run the goblins to the ground have ended in failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But instead of the promise of rebirth and renewal that Spring thaw brings, this new year has brought only more bad news...the infant heir of King Kessel V, and only child has disappeared from within the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
