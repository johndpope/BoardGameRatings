			<description>Twisted Metal 2 (known in Europe as Twisted Metal 2: World Tour and Twisted Metal EX in Japan) is the second and most successful game in the vehicular combat Twisted Metal series. It was developed by the game studio SingleTrac, published by Sony, and released in 1996 for PlayStation and PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC version features slightly cut-down graphics compared to the PlayStation version but doesn't require a 3D accelerator video card. It also features multiplayer mode over a modem line or Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two years after its release, Twisted Metal 2 was re-released as a PlayStation Greatest Hits game. A similar title was released in Japan in 2007. On November 1, 2007, it was also released for download in North America on the PlayStation Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Twisted Metal 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
