							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall from Grace</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Foundling Worlds lies Grace, a planet once colonized by Rogue Trade Aspyce Chorda. In its prime, Grace was a haven for Imperial renegades and villains, but none escape the Emperor's wrath forever. As violent warp storms destroyed the warp routes to the colony, it soon fell to the predators of the Warp, a roving Xenos menace and most of all to its inhabitants own dark impulses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the warp storms recede for the first time in decades, Grace is once more open for the taking. Fall From Grace takes the Explorers and their ship to claim a long forgotten world filled with treasure and danger. The Explorers must race their rivals to loot the prizes left there by a generation of the Imperium's decadent outcasts, a reward that might cost them their lives, their ships or their immortal souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is divided into four chapters. Adventure overview (which you are reading now), Grace Gazetteer, which provides details for the setting of this adventure, Fall From Grace which details the adventure proper in three parts and Appendix: NPCs, Antagonists and Ships which has the game stats for the relevant adversaries and their fleets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
