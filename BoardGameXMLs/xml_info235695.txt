			<description>Do you have what it takes to be the greatest outlaw that ever lived? Grab your supplies and head out into the Old West! Survive the harsh conditions by making important decisions. Prepare to win duels against some of the West's most notable gunslingers by buying, selling, and trading supplies. Avoid calamities like dust devils, bounty hunters, and droughts. Kill a few critters. Rob a  few banks and trains. Earn notoriety, keep supplies, stay alive, and collect bounties. With a little luck, you'll make your mark on history! Each player's turn comprises of either buying or selling from three Store Cards (Saloon, Mercantile, and Gunsmith)and using Rations to gain Stamina. Once that part of the turn is completed, 1 card is revealed (based on Notoriety gained throughout the deck)from the massive 173 card deck. There are four card types within the deck: Duel Cards, Critter Cards, Range Cards, and Calamity Cards. Depending on what is revealed, you might have to use your bullets to defeat a Duel Card or Critter Card, you might have to forfeit supplies or cards when a Calamity is encountered, and you might gain supplies when a Range Card is revealed. The game ends when all 9 Duel Cards have been defeated or when every other player has died. Then each player calculates their Bounty! Highest Bounty wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
