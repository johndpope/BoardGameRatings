This is accomplished by a dial approximately 3 inches in diameter in the center of the controller (almost in the same location as the DualShock analog sticks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jogcon would later be sold separately from the Ridge Racer R4 game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jogcon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
