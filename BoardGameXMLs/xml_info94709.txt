							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stompem</name>
									
			<description>Stompem was one of the 1st web app games on Apple's website. Now you can play it with 309 additional puzzles across 4 seasons for a total of 412. Some puzzles are easy and some aren&amp;rsquo;t. This retro-style game is complete with 8-bit sound effects, old school graphics, and it no longer needs a web connection! (The web version is no longer available.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this stompin&amp;rsquo; fun puzzle game, you touch a white box to stomp a flower, beach ball, pumpkin, or a snowman. The goal is to help Fumu-san stomp them all. The red ones must be stomped twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pure-puzzle game, no time-limit, no lives, just you against the game, but chances are you&amp;rsquo;ll find out how big of a crybaby Fumu-san is. Hope you like it. Have fun and good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
