			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TapZoo is a zoo sim that lets you manage a garden of cartoon animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin your animal adventure with a tiny patch of land and a gorilla or two. The goal is to set up as many animal enclosures as possible to attract visitors and garner a high grade. You can add to your menagerie by breeding two animals of the same species, and even by cross-breeding two different species (often in defiance of all laws of nature). You also have to set up snack stands, install sidewalks, hire staff, build a few restrooms, oh, and you better pick up all the trash that visitors drop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all, a classic management game in the SimX-spirit. The animals, facilities, land-expansions, etc. are bought with two different currencies, &amp;quot;Coins&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Stars&amp;quot;. Coins are generated by your animals (I assume this means how much the visitors are willing to pay to view them) at a set interval of (real-)time, different for each species. Coins can be used for most content but there are some animals, and some decorations that can only be bought by Stars. Stars can not be earned in-game but have to be bought by real money via in-app purchases. You can also buy extra Coins via in-app purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is something parents need to know, the game is designed so that players have to wait a long time between purchasing animals or buildings for their zoo. Early in the game, you will only earn a few hundred coins from your zoo, but anything you want to buy will cost far more than that (example: a hedgehog is 16,000 coins). If you don't want to wait, you will need to spend real money to buy extra coins. Disabling in-app-purchases is recommended before handing this game to a kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
