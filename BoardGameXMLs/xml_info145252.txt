			<description>This is a hack for Mermaid Adventures which contains rules for playing tiny characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another world inside the walls, in the floors, and in the attic. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe it? Just open your ears to the sounds underneath the normal sounds. Go beyond the honking of the car horns outside, past the bark of the dog and the meow of the cat inside, past the creaking of the floor as you walk. In these places, the cracks of the house and only in the corner of your eye, are where the Squelks live... and have lived for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard about the Squelks, but let me be the first to tell you they are very real. They stand about 6 inches tall with long tails and a mouse-like demeanor. You might have even seen one in your life and simply confused it for a rodent, or a strange looking bug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;this item is reward for kickstarter backers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
