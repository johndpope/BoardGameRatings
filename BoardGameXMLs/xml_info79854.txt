							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All Around Northern Virginia</name>
									
			<description>All Around Northern Virginia is similar in play to monopoly, but with a few house rule differences. Taxes and fines are paid to the kitty where a player can collect on the Municipal Parking Lot space. The cost of &amp;quot;expansion&amp;quot; or upgrading monopolized property is listed on the board rather than printed on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
