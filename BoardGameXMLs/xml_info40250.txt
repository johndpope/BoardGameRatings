							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warmaster Renaissance Supplement</name>
									
			<description>This self published variant was released shortly after the original Warmaster, as a modification of those rules for the Renaissance period.  It is interesting that this work pre-dates Games Workshop's Warmaster Ancients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction of this title:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are meant to supplement the Warmaster fantasy miniatures rules produced by Games Workshop, and incorporate the ancient rules supplement for that system developed by Stephen Hess. Our thanks to Mr. Hess for taking the time to assemble the basic troop types for the vast majority of troops available in the ancient period, as well as providing many prepared armies lists, and for graciously allowing me to directly incorporate his work into this piece. This supplement for Renaissance gaming is heavily dependent on the work done for the ancient period. Especially useful were the basic infantry, cavalry and elephant troop types. Rules incorporated here are elite, skirmishers, phalanx, warband, and camels. Stephen Hess&amp;rsquo;s Ancientmaster rules supplement can be found on the web &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.brumbaer.de/Wm/Ancients/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.brumbaer.de/Wm/Ancients/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are guidelines for creating army lists from other sets which focus on this period, WRG 7th ed. &amp;amp; DBR.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
