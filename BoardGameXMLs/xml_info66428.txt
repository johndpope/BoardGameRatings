							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great City: Player&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The sourcebook contains new races, residences in the Great City, taxation, religion, azindralean tongs, organizations, new core classes, new prestige classes, professions, feats, spells, Great City specific equipment, gaslight technology, weather and climate, calendar and days of the week, constellations and Auspicious signs and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great City is rife with excitement, intrigue and adventure; dare your characters make it their home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great City Player's Guide features (among the other things):&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Five Base classes: Cultkiller, Ghostblade, Guttermage, Neopagan and Urbanist.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Seven Prestige Classes: Crossroad Guardian, Insurrectionist, Moon Warrior (Warrior of the Silver Lady), Numismatist, Rooftop Runner, Sewer Runner, and Shadow Mage of the Gray Consortium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Foreword by Tim Hitchcock:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Great City Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide provides a wealth of information for Players and Game Masters alike concerning all things urban, at least in the Great City. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say you can&amp;rsquo;t use the material within in other settings; you can! The mechanical elements herein are 100% compatible with the brand new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook and still play fine with the old d20 SRD. It&amp;rsquo;s just that we tried very hard to make sure the book captured the flavor we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the Great City. For those of you familiar with our product line, you&amp;rsquo;ll be pleased of how much setting material we incorporated into this book. Things like how the constellations might affect you, new Pathfinder traits you can gain for being a member of one of the city&amp;rsquo;s numerous organizations or tongs. New core classes like the ghostblade and the guttermage, and even a barrister NPC class for those PCs needing good legal representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This time out, I&amp;rsquo;ve called upon a greater variety of writers as well. Sure, I tried to use the old favorites who designed the original Great City and Great City Adventure Arcs. Yet I was also fortunate enough to be able to incorporate a few other very talented writers as well. This, of course, is what happens in every great city: change and progress. I hope you find it as fantastic and enjoyable as I did to read their interpretations and fresh ideas on what might be going on in the Great City.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
