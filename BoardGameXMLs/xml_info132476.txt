			<description>A children's game for two teams that consists of guessing and uses a wooden cablecar toy on a rope to transport tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main idea: &lt;br/&gt;The children of two families visit each other using a cablecar. Each of them takes their favourite toy with them. The players try to find out which toy belongs to whom as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;The players are divided into two teams. One team gets the four daughters of the Moser family, the other team the four sons of the Huber family. Each team gets 4 boy/girl tokens, 9 toy tokens, 1 player board (the team with the girls gets the boy board and vice versa). 3 of the 9 player tokens are given to the other team. Of the remaining 6, 4 are selected (without the other team knowing which ones) and placed face down on the player board. Thus each boy/girl gets assigned a toy.&lt;br/&gt;Two players (one per team) stand up, each holding one end of the rope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;The team playing the Huber family gets the cablecar. They put one of the boy tokens and a toy token inside the cablecar. The cablecar is attached to the rope and sent over to the other team. The team checks with the help of the player board if the boy and toy match (i.e. if it is the green boy token, the toy has to be the one that was assigned to the green boy on the board). If it is correct, the boy is put on the board and the toy is turned face up. If it is incorrect, the boy stays in the cablecar. Then the Moser family team puts a girl token and toy into the cablecar and sends the car back to the Huber family. Now the other team checks if girl and toy match. Then a new boy and toy are put into the car.&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one team has managed to guess all their child-toy combinations. This team wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
