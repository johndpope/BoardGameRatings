			<description>Tit 3 Tat is game #30 of the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tit 3 Tat is a 3 player only game on half a checkerboard, with each player having 6 pieces of their color.  In the game, players attempt to control more spaces on the board by the time the game ends.  Pieces move like chess queens, and have the ability to pass through spaces control by their side.  Each turn, a player must either move one of their pieces on top of a single piece of an opponent, or remove an enemy piece on top of a stack from two players (this is in the basic version, with a variant providing more complex removal rules). Effort was made to provide a 3 player game experience that would try to prevent players from colluding to gang up against a single player in order to eliminate them from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game provides a unique feature where it is possible for a player to win a game, even if they haven't made a move.  In addition, turn order is not fixed, and depends totally on who a player interacts with during their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
