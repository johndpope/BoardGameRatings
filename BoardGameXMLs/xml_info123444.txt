			<description>You are the Spymaster of a team of agents -- Your Mission is to penetrate the Control Centre and seize the Master Modules hidden there. BUT... Counter intelligence sourses have discovered that a rival power has despatched a team of ruthless Agents to oppose you.&lt;br/&gt;You must direct your team to the control Centre via an international network of safe houses. En route, you must eliminate the opposition whilst avoiding their murderous attempts on your agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially a game where you plot movement on your board and try to work out where the enemy is on his board. Lots of guessing and bluffing needed. The winner is the first player to capture any one piece of the five Master Module pieces. You can also win if you are the lone survivor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A triumph of design, nothing is wasted. The game comes in a leatherette wallet, the pieces are magnetic and stick to the player boards and the rules are on the back of these boards. The boards and components are suitably dark and sinister for a game about espionage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;2 Dossiers&lt;br/&gt;36 Spy Counters&lt;br/&gt;6 Target Counters&lt;br/&gt;5 Master Modules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
