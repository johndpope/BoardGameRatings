							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Alignment</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is more than what you believe...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every day, Heroes and Villains live out their lives in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Saving innocent lives, conquering the world, gaining power, or spreading the word of a divine being - all of them are quintessential means to an end. They are defined by the alignments: Law, Good, Evil, Chaos, and Neutrality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is more than personal beliefs in Life, more to the fundamental workings of the universe than the independent actions of trillions of creatures. Alignments are not just a series of guidelines for your character to follow. They control everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Alignment is your guide to translating one-and-a-half pages of rough text on the alignment system and expanding it like never before. Providing a theoretical viewpoint of alignments with alternate possibilities for incorporating and expanding the system in your game, this book provides options and topics for discussion within your campaign. Whether these ideas are original or obvious, they are designed to invoke thoughts and concepts to give your characters greater depth in how they interact with their world. Optional rules include true alignments, triple alignments, a non-alignment campaign, and personality archetypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, The Book of Alignment introduces a worldly concept in the alignment system and introduces alignments as a universal force. Imagine a creature of pure Evil, its very being striving for nothing more than the absolute destruction of all Life and yet never sated. These pages contain epic options for any campaign, taking your characters on the ultimate quest: to discover the meaning of Life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
