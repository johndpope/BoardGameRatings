			<description>A two to four player word-building game. Each player uses tiles from their own pool and/or a common pool of tiles, and creates words of three to five letters on a five by five board. Colored tiles and letter frequency determine scoring. Play proceeds until all 25 spaces on each player's board are occupied by tiles. Allowed words follow conventional rules such as no proper names or foreign words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
