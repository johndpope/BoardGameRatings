							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Travel Game</name>
									
			<description>Space Travel Game was a Jack in the Box kids' meal giveaway.  It is a simple spin-and-move game packaged in a small plastic clamshell box.  The top of the box is a spinner.  Inside is a folded game board with a track leading a space shuttle back to Earth.  Players spin and move their pieces either forward or backward on the track (or lose a turn) as indicated, trying to be the first to reach Earth.  A note on game design:  The spinner is exactly balanced between moving forward and moving backward, and with 40 spaces on the board, this could be a very long game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
