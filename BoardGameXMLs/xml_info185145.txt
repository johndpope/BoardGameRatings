			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ammo - Revenant War, also known as Ammo: The RPG, is a very simple implementation of the Fudge rules that supports a single scenario with very limited play options.  In general, the characters begin in a war zone where every NPC is more-or-less trying to kill them.  All aspects of the system are handled through narrative process except for firefight resolution which uses dice.  Gunfire is lethal and common (in fact, constant) and thus character life expectancy is not long--the rules have no real mechanism for advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
