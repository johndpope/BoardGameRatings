							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hasbro Family Game Night: Battleship</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the games that can be accessed via the Hasbro Family Game Night client.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battleship has three different modes from which to choose: Original, Salvo, and Super Weapons. Original plays just like everyone remembers. After the players place their ships (either manually or auto-placement), each player takes turns launching one &amp;quot;peg&amp;quot; to try and hit their opponent's hidden ship. Salvo is similar to Original, but now the players can shoot once for every one of their ships remaining in play. That means that each player gets five attempts if all five of their ships are still in play. Super Weapons is the most unique because every time a player misses, they get a chance to unlock a new weapon. These weapons consist of: reinforcements, lucky shot, heavy shot, decoy, and torpedo. Each has its own characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played either single-player vs AI, or local/network multi-player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
