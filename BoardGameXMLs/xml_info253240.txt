			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three part adventure will take the players from fleeing a quarantined city to doing battle with the henchman of a shadowy organization bent on murder and destruction.  The players will have to use every ounce of their guile and wit to survive the traps and ambushes of a well armed clan of Kobolds.  Be prepared for deadly sneak attacks, insane traps, and bizarre conversations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is obsessively planned to keep the DM as organized and prepared as possible, so they can concentrate on having fun.  It is suitable for new players and dungeon masters as well as experienced campaigners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure manual includes Dungeon Master Reference Maps as well as maps designed to be printed and cut out to be used with miniatures.  Each combat encounter includes round by round tactics and each NPC has suggested role-playing tips and a background to help the DM easily portray a fully fleshed out character.  Every room has at least a paragraph of flavor text.  There are also NPCs that can be included in the player's party to fill out a small adventurer group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
