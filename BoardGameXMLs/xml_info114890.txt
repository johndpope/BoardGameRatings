			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has taken over a year to compile this book and it is an ideal add on for any Fuzion campaign. It is geared towards Cyber Punk gaming in the Dark Millennium setting but can easily be used for any genre. Fantasy and Sci-Fi would be perfect genres to plug Power Core into, especially with the Spell Designer and the Item Designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We made several key decisions that Fuzion gamers should be aware of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First and foremost, you need to read this entire chapter before using the book. It details all of the changes to Classic Fuzion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We do not discuss the dialing aspect but you may convert as you wish. For example, we speak of Hexes as being yards and have geared the powers in that fashion. You may use meters if you&amp;rsquo;re more comfortable with the metric system but you may have to do a little of your own math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We use a relative cost system for power modifiers rather than an add/subtract system. In this first chapter you will find two other easy conversions to Classic Fuzion and a Hero-Like style of cost modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
