							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Napoleonic Wargame</name>
									
			<description>A book containing rules for miniature wargames covering the Napoleonic Wars using various figure scales frokm 5mm to 30 mm and various ground scales of 1mm:2yds to 1in:10yds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A criticism levelled at many books on wargaming is that they attempt to cover too wide a period of military history.  This book concentrates on one of the most active and interesting episodes in the history of warfare - the Napoleonic Wars.  The author firmly believes that wargames should duplicate the conditions and events of real warfare as far as is possible within the context of a set of rules.  Among the factors which he stresses are the use of realistic scales and the importance of morale.  He also believes that, provided the player has done his research, the rules should be flexible enough to allow him to employ unconventional tactics.  After all, neither Napoleon nor Wellington won their battles by sticking to previously accepted ideas on tactics.&lt;br/&gt;This book is the result of a long experience of wargaming and painstaking historical research.  Whether the reader accept the author's conclusions or not he will certainly find much both to enjoy and discuss.  The text is illustrated with eight pages of colour photographs and nearly 40 line drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
