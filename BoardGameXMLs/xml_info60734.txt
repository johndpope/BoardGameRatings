							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thrash 2.0</name>
									
			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone rumored &lt;br/&gt;Nobody believed &lt;br/&gt;But you see IT&amp;rsquo;S TRUE &lt;br/&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to have the REAL answer...&lt;br/&gt;Who is....&lt;br/&gt;THE STRONGEST?!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrash 2.0 represents a major overhaul to the Thrash RPG system, staying similar while taking out some of the more broken rules.  From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The goal of Thrash was and still is to create a tabletop RPG that captures some of the awesome inherent in 2D fighting games. In retrospect, the original version of Thrash was sloppily put together from bits and pieces of Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game (at the time, White Wolf&amp;rsquo;s one attempt at a non-WoD game), Mekton Z (still my favorite mecha RPG), and Ninjas &amp;amp; Superspies (Erick Wujcik is awesome!). I think it got more revisions through complaints on the mailing list started by Rob Pool (which is still the official Thrash ML today) than through playtesting. Still, it let you stat up most any fighting game character, and it drew interest from people all over the world.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
