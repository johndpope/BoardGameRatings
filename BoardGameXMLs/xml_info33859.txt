			<description>Rules Blurb loosely translated from German:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Krone von Irland (The Crown of Ireland) is a tactical strategy-game for 3-5 players set in Ireland in the 12th Century. The players represent English-Norman families of that time fighting for dominance on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The families try to become the next King of Ireland by using the powers of the English Crown, the Church or even supporting the rebellious native Irish. By choosing different roles (with different powers attached to them) the players try to further the influence of their family over the other families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is highly limited with only 15 beauty-fully  handcrafted copies in existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
