			<description>Don Bradman Cricket 17&amp;rsquo;s enriched career mode will allow players to begin their cricket careers at the local level, playing for teams in their chosen region before earning selection for domestic and international duty. Teams will also be dynamic throughout player's career saves rather than locked to a single line-up for the duration; other players will shift about as they retire, suffer injuries, slump in form, or get selected for higher levels of cricket. A new &amp;ldquo;Be a Pro&amp;rdquo; option will bring with it the ability to play through career mode as an existing player, and we&amp;rsquo;ll also have the option to play through career mode controlling the whole team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman_Cricket_17 Don Bradman Cricket 17]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
