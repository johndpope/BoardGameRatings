			<description>Originally published in one of GW's magazines in June 2000, these are revised rules for using titans (combat mechs) in an &amp;quot;Epic 40,000&amp;quot; SF-miniatures battle. However, although they occasionally refer to the Epic 40K rules, this is only if you want to use the titans with infantry or tanks in combined armies. By themselves, these rules constitute a playable game pitting titans against titans (an &amp;quot;Epic 40K Lite,&amp;quot; if you will). The concepts and mechanisms will be familiar to anyone who has played any of GW's miniatures games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory points are gained by damaging and destroying enemy titans, as well as by meeting the objectives of the chosen scenario. The player with the most VPs when the battle is decided is the winner. Playing time is completely arbitrary and will depend on the base point costs of the armies and the scenario being played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules WERE available on GW's Web site as a free downloadable PDF. However, the PDF doesn't include the objective cards that were printed on the back of the magazine where the rules first appeared, so unless this is fixed, players who have only the PDF will be limited to basic straight-ahead attack scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
