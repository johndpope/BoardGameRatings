			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sense of being immersed in a role may be particularly challenging to students charged with promoting worldviews that are antithetical to their own beliefs. If this causes discomfort, remind them that they are merely playing roles. Also remind them to direct their criticisms at one another&amp;rsquo;s roles rather than one another as persons. (For example, you may need to intervene if someone repeatedly says, &amp;quot;Sally's argument is ridiculous.&amp;quot; But encourage them to say, &amp;quot;Governor Winthrop's argument is ridiculous&amp;quot;). Similarly, remind students that it is inappropriate to trade on out‐of‐class relationships when asking for support within the game. (&amp;quot;Hey, you can't vote against me. We're both on the tennis team!&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remind students to always assume, when spoken to by a fellow player&amp;mdash;whether in class or out of class&amp;mdash;that that person is speaking in role. Some roles may include elements of conspiracy or deceit. Such roles will cause some students stress, so you should encourage students to talk with you if they become uncomfortable with their roles. In the vast majority of cases, you will be able to talk them through their discomfort. To encourage these students make it clear that everyone is merely playing a role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
