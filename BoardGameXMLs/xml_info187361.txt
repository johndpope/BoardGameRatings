			<description>Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neo-Hunt is a board game about highly advanced cyber varans (large humanoid reptilians) in special testing zone or battleground. Their mission is simple: destroy as many trooper units or other varans as possible before being destroyed or until there are no more troopers left&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players select a &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; token and a corresponding &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; card.  All the &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; cards for players are combined with one gray &amp;quot;trooper&amp;quot; order card; this deck is shuffled to determine phase order.  &amp;quot;Trooper&amp;quot; cards are randomly selected to make a trooper deck; 7-17 cards may be used (this will determine approximate game length).  &amp;quot;Sector Tiles&amp;quot; are then shuffled and randomly distributed into a circle form to create a random playing board.  Players then receive a random &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; card and eleven &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all &amp;quot;troopers&amp;quot; are destroyed.  If a player's &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; is destroyed they can resume with new &amp;quot;varan&amp;quot; but will suffer a score penalty.  On each player's turn they utilize action cards and move their varan into a new sector or attack any other unit they see.  On the trooper turn standard rules apply to move or shoot; troopers will only shoot at visible varans.  The game supports a few special status conditions which may occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is print-and-play and published for free access via HTML.  Components and rules are downloadable in PDF format.  Color printing is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
