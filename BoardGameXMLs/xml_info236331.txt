			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the inaugural issue of my webzine: Cavalier Attitude. As the masthead says, this zine will focus on the Old School Revival (OSR) in fantasy role-playing. The Oldschool System Reference and Index Compilation&amp;trade; (OSRIC) is my personal retro-clone of choice, but I will cover other games systems as well, as interest and time permit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will be publishing the zine quarterly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you will see from the preview&amp;rsquo;s table of contents, the zine will feature articles on gaming subjects of interest to Old School players and those who play the newer editions; Old School art by myself and other artists featured in my work; updates on my modules, supplements and campaign world; a social media round-up; and each issue we feature a well balanced party of six pre-generated characters for use by you and your players as NPSs or player characters in your own campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future issues will also include fantasy fiction by myself and others; background information and additional areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in my ever expanding campaign world; one-shot and one-page modules and encounters; DM&amp;rsquo;s tips and rules discussions; miniature painting galleries and guides; interviews with authors and other makers in the RPG community; and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
