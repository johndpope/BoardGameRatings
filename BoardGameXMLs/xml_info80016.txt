			<description>Arch-Mage Treasure Rooms &lt;br/&gt;(Rooms P1, Goodies 2004-2005)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The number of VP necessary to win the game is increased by 1 VP for each face-up Arch-Mage Treasure room. For example, if the game is being played to 5 VP and both Arch-Mage Treasure rooms are visible, the game is now played to 7 VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giant Grinders:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Giant Grinders work exactly like rifts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A flying character (Wizard, Ghost, Specter, etc...) can fly over a Giant Grinder during his movement, but cannot stop there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Characters who can move over pit traps, like the Thief or Elf Scout, cannot more over a Giant Grinder square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A character carrying a rope can move over a Giant Grinder or stop there as long as there are two valid attachment points available. However, his movement must be from one valid square to another valid square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Giant Grinders are obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pipes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pipes are not normal floor squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pipes do not block line of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pipes are obstacles for characters with a combat value of 3 or more (only the unmodified combat value on the character counts). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Characters of combat value 0,1,or 2 (only the unmodified combat value on the character counts) can use Pipes like normal ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Characters of combat value 0,1, or 2 can stop on Pipes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Characters of combat value 3 can move over Pipes like normal ground. Characters of combat value 3 cannot stop on Pipes. If they do stop on the Pipes, the Pipes break (place a broken marker) and the character falls into the giant grinders, which causes immediate death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Characters of combat value 4 or more can use Pipes, but as soon as they step on them, the Pipes break and the character is killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     When Pipes break, only the square where the character was standing is broken (not all of the Pipes). That can lead to a strange situation (but legal) where a piece of Pipes is all alone because the Pipes on each side were broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arch-Mage Treasure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A character standing on an Arch-Mage Treasure square can pick up the treasure for 1 AP. Place a Treasure token under the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each Arch-Mage Treasure square can only offer one Treasure per game. Pace a broken marker on the Arch-Mage treasure square to indicate that this square was already looted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If the Disciple &amp;quot;forgets&amp;quot; this room and it contains a looted (with a broken marker) Arch-Mage Treasure square, the broken marker is withdrawn. The square will provide another treasure once the room is discovered again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Arch-Mage Treasure squares are considered to be normal floor squares only with regards to movement and line of sight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Arch-Mage Treasure squares are not obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
