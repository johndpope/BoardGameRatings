							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Masked Mage:  A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another one came up today, to the top of your mountain. Another seeking to best december, to defy the bite of ice. Another who received it, in full. You are Winter - cold, uncaring, and untouchable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Masked Mage is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game, and the fourth of my Mage Revised series. The Mage is one of the most popular playbooks I have ever written, but it has its flaws - the class is too open ended, and is generally capable of solving problems on a larger scope than any other class can really confront. My solution was to pare down the class into multiple different classes, each built around a single Spell Focus. This class is a reimagining of a Mage with Spell Focus: The Mask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Masked Mage is an illusionist of the highest calibre. She can craft illusions, reveal additional truths about the world, and people find they just trust her, as a natural state of being. The Masked Mage's unique mechanic is their Masks - these function as Race replacement moves, but the Masked Mage gets two of them, and which two masks they choose to hide behind drastically alters their capabilities. The Mask of Deceit lets you hide or avoid attention better than most. The Mask of Flesh makes you a doppelganger, a face-stealer. The Mask of Gold has everyone believing your are rich and wealthy, and allows you to pawn off anything as something precious and valuable. The Mask of Myth convinces everyone that you are a hero of legend, with all the fame and accolades that come with it. And the Mask of Truth can be used to wipe away your previous lies, rebuilding trust you've broken in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
