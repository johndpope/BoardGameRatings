			<description>Orcs allied to Undead to populate dungeons? Get out of here! More stories to not let you sleep, told by bragging adventurers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orcs are tolerant! They will hit everything that moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And where there is dead there are treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Unfair Undead&amp;rdquo; pack, you can face the undead!&lt;br/&gt;Be careful, though! They are evil and tough to kill, and some of them will bring you no gains!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only advantage of playing them is the possibility of getting an extra card in your hand (taken from the center pile). You can as well take advantage of passing them to other players and forcing them to face them instead of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pay attention to the Mummy, though! It&amp;rsquo;s one of the worst enemies. It is true that she possesses a lot of gold, but to kill her will be a curse and she will make you lose a lot of life points! Vicious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Necromancer can only be killed with the help of a Magic Stuff Card. Tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trap Card &amp;ldquo;Rotten Hands&amp;rdquo; will prevent you from playing any other card from your hand. It will be you against Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a challenge Card Undead ends in failure, it will not be discarded unlike the other cards. It will be placed in the Permanent Challenge. If another card was already in the Permanent Challenge, the Undead Challenge Card will be placed on top of it. Everything else that is under it cannot be played until the Undead Challenge Card is defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We told you the Undead were unfair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
