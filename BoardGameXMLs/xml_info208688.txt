							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Truce 2D10</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the new 2D10 RPG, the Truce is a free fantasy adventure centered in a frontier village called Jegyr's Creek. Heroes arrive in the town to discover conflict between local centaurs and settlers and have the opportunity to confront a growing evil in the nearby woods. The adventure includes a good mix of both battle and problem solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, it's one page. And free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Truce is the first part in a trilogy of adventures which can be inserted into a fantasy setting of choice or used to form the backdrop of a larger story. Look for those additional adventures soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background Notes: This adventure was actually written many years ago, rediscoverd in a backup archive, and edited for use with 2D10. You can easily use it with another game system of choice. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
