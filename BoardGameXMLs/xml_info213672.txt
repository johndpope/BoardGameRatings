			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game of existential horror and dread.  It is not likely the players will win.  Bad things are going to happen - hopelessness, insignificance, and futility.  This game should be played in dim lighting and with a haunting ambient soundtrack.  All players should be aware of what they're getting into here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created for the Spooky Design Contest 2016 but was not considered in the voting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
