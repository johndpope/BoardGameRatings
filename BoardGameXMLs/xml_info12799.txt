			<description>From the designers/producers of Pursue the Pennant, this game allowed players to 'build' their own team using great players from the past. Salaries were a part of the team generation process. Unlike a simulation, there was no actual baseball game to play; rather a chart would dictate the percentage of time a team would potentially win. The main play of the game was acquiring players to build a team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
