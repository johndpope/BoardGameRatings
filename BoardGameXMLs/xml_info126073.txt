			<description>The game board represents a stable. It is three-dimensional, with stable doors opening individually. At the front of the stable there is a circuit around which the players race their horses. &lt;br/&gt;There are two versions, one for older and one for younger children. In the former, players have to answer questions to get food for the horses or move obstacles. Movement is determined by a die roll; obstacles within the range of the roll can be overcome by answering another question. &lt;br/&gt;In the latter, only number cards are used. Every player secretly chooses a number card. The active player moves the number of fields shown on the number card; the other players can move one field if they chose the same card as the active player.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to cross the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
