							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tet &#039;68</name>
									
			<description>Tet `68 is a simulation of the 1968 Tet Offensive in Vietnam.  The objective of the game is to show what happened during the campaign, how the U.S. and its allies, despite winning a military victory, were defeated psychologically and politically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are a large 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map of Vietnam, 200 counters, and extensive 16 page rulebook, including rules for intelligence, logistics, and weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is awarded based on points, which are earned in different ways for the Communist and U.S. players.  Communist points are scored for political successes; U.S. points are primarily scored for military objectives.  At the end of 7 game turns, the player with the highest victory point total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
