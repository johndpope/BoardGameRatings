			<description>The Game of Rat and Dragon is a 2 player abstract strategy game played on a 6-by-6 square grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has four Characters made of wooden cubes; a Rat (a single cube), a Dragon (3 cubes in an L shape) and two Soldiers (two cubes each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player builds a cube out of their Characters in the 2-by-2 squares marked on opposite corners of the board. Players then take turns moving their Characters on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to build a cube of Characters in the central 2-by-2 &amp;quot;Sun Square&amp;quot; or to capture one of the opponent's Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing characters can be captured, or trapped, by covering enough of their square faces with faces of your own characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
