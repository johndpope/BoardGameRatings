			<description>For years cats and dogs have feuded over who was the greatest pet in the neighborhood. Today they have decided to settle the argument once and for all with an epic battle in the streets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cats vs Dogs is a two-player game. One player will control the cats and the other the dogs. Your goal is to take control of the yard friendly to your opponent &amp;ndash; or scare them off the board. But be careful, the board is littered with distractions that will make your animals lose focus during the heat of battle. Can you lead your animals to victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 10 pieces which are set up hidden from the opponent. Players move on a grid showing several houses and a street from the neighborhood. When two pieces occupy the same square, both players will reveal their piece and play a card adding to its value. The player with the highest total will win the battle. However, if you're fighting in a square with a distraction, you total battle strength will be reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who can occupy his opponent's yard on the far side of the board. This is a lighthearted game that plays quickly and is simple enough for young children but with enough strategy to keep their parents entertained as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cats vs Dogs by Chris Hansen is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
