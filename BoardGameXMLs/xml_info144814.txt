			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edmus is a semi-racing game with the layout and controls of a sidescrolling platformer. You control your Edmus character and try to get as far as you can in the level without missing a jump, or hitting an object. If either of these occur your run will end. &lt;br/&gt;Along the way you will collect flowers. These can be spent to permanently upgrade your speed, your jumping ability and your double jumping ability. The race about distance not speed, the player who runs the farthest wins. When you play you will see the likeness of the players who also played that same day, and they will die off just as the players did in their run. There is also a population marker that tells you how many other players made it as far as you did that day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
