			<description>Nom Nom Yum! is the deliciously fun card game in which you try to collect an impressive stash of 10 yummy food items, while strategically interrupting the progress of your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the deck and deal 5 cards to each player. Set the remaining cards between all players, face down, as the game deck. Directly beside the deck shall be a singular discard pile. The player to the dealer's left has first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every turn, the player draws up to 6 cards (the hand limit) and plays 1 card face-up into his or her personal &amp;quot;food stash&amp;quot; (a double decker set of 10 card slots) on the playing surface. If the player has more than one of the same food in-hand, he or she may play any or all of them during a single turn- the only way to play multiple cards in a turn. Cards may not be picked up from the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a card is played, if an opponent has the food item in his or her stash, that player must discard 1 of them. For example, if a player puts the &amp;quot;Pizza&amp;quot; card into his or her stash, any opponent who has that card must discard it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the game deck exhausts at any point, shuffle and reuse the discard pile. Play continues clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to create a full food stash of 10 cards, in total, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
