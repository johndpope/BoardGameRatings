			<description>From Box: Alexander the pink bunyip is hungry again. He decides to visit his four favorite shops. But the Bunyip Catchers have other ideas and set out to catch The Bunyip before he returns to the safety of the billabong. Watch Out Bunyip - don't get caught!&lt;br/&gt;[note: a Bunyip is a mythical Australian Aboriginal creature].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The winner is the player who finally catches The Bunyip OR the Bunyip who has visited all four shops and returns safely to the billabong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Bunyip, the others are Bunyip Catchers. If 6 play, the 6th is a second Bunyip. The Bunyip(s) starts in the Billabong in the centre of the board, the catchers in the corners of the board. Each player spins a spinner (mounted in the box) and moves that many spaces (1-2-2-3-3-4-5-6). &lt;br/&gt;The Bunyip(s) must pass over (they don't have to stop on) each of the 4 shops in the centre edges of the board. The shops and the pink spaces either side of the shops are prohibited to the catchers. The catchers attempt to land on the Bunyip when he is not in a safe area. If they do so, they spin the Bunyip Escape spinner (a second spinner mounted inside the box): either the Bunyip is moved automatically to another named space, or he is caught (and the catcher wins). If the Bunyip visits all 4 shops and returns to his starting space (the Billabong) he wins. Catchers landing on another catcher send the latter is sent back to his starting space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same game system, with different artwork and creatures was used in &amp;quot;Watch out wombat&amp;quot; and the New Zealand version &amp;quot;Catch that kiwi&amp;quot; both issued the following year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
