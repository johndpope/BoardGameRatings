			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;The first twenty-four Robin D Laws columns are no longer available free online, and can be purchased here as a PDF, or from our webstore. Whatever your game, Robin D Laws&amp;rsquo; innovative collection features wisdom for GMs, players and publishers alike. At twice the size of the excellent Robin&amp;rsquo;s Laws of Good Gamemastering and at half the price, it&amp;rsquo;s incredible value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See Page XX is an irregular column written by Robin D Laws for Pelgrane Press Ltd. This collection brings together the first twenty four column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a publisher, my reason for asking Robin D Laws to create See Page XX column was as a way of bring traffic to the Pelgrane Press website. As a GM and rpg enthusiast, it was like having my own expert on tap to write about any rpg issues to which I wanted an answer. I hoped that my questions matched the expectations of our readership. I know that his answers met mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The columns are amazingly innovative, sometimes bringing in to the light techniques many GMs use without having a name for them, sometimes putting forward brand new ideas. They only dwell in theory as much as is required to highlight practical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is advice for designing games, researching and planning games, running games, improvising, commentary on the rpgs and their relationshop to other media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also include two internal design documents for the GUMSHOE system which are invaluable aids to creating GUMSHOE background settings and The Esoterrorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These columns are frequently funny, occasionally controversial, but always entertaining. So when you next find a See Page XX, you'll know where to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
