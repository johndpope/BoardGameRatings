			<description>GuitarFreaks is a music video game series produced by Konami. It is a rhythm game where the player uses a controller to simulate the playing of an electric guitar. The game consists of music predominantly from the rock music, rock and roll and J-pop genres. It is considered one of the most influential video games of all time, for having laid the foundations for popular guitar-based rhythm games, such as the Guitar Hero series. Working Designs attempted to bring Guitar Freaks PlayStation 2 games in the U.S., but patent problems with the guitar controller prevented the project from moving forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's nineteenth version, GuitarFreaks V8, was released in March 28, 2011. It was speculated to be the final release of GuitarFreaks V.&lt;br/&gt;A spin-off series, GuitarFreaks XG was released in Japanese arcades on March 10, 2010, which added two more buttons to the fret bar.&lt;br/&gt;A sequel, GuitarFreaks XG2, was released on March 9, 2011. Another sequel, GuitarFreaks XG3, was released on Feb. 23, 2012&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Freaks Guitar Freaks]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese name is ギターフリークス&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
