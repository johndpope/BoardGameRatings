			<description>A tactical football game. Saturday afternoon football without the Sunday morning aches, bruises and sore muscles. Ther are no punts, your team has four downs to score. The team scoring five touchdaowns first wins. Clipping and downfield blocks are encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The counters represent individual players on each team. Players are rated for strength, speed, receiving and passing ability. Before the game starts, players &amp;quot;draft&amp;quot; a team from the available counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ball counter is used and is possessed by the ball carrier. Offense lines up first with all players at or behind the line of scrimmage. Defens then lines up on the other side of the line of scrimmage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play starts when the center snaps the ball to the quarterback. To keep control of the game, only five of the offense's players will move to be followed by five of the defense's players. This allows players to set up blocks and maneuver around to gain a positional advantage. The remainder of each team moves next. Passes, laterals or handoffs are attempted in the second move action. A die roll determines if a pass is completed based on the pass distance and the passer's passing ability. Incomplete passes end the play. Receivers catching the ball use their speed to run for as much yardage as possible and defensive players attempt to minimize the yardage gained by tackling the receiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no set plays drawn up in the rules, so players draw up their own plays in the dirt by using a stick (not really, but that's how you should approach the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
