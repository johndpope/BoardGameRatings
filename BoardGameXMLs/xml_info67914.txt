			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplaying in T.V. Hell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dice&lt;br/&gt;        Everyone Player gets five dice. The GM begins with only one (and gets more as the game is played). It doesn't matter how many sides, so long as everyone's dice have the same number of sides. Remember that the more sides, the longer the game will tend to last. Six- or ten-sided dice are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Your Character&lt;br/&gt;        You get to invent a character. Someone who whines, gets in trouble, is afraid to admit he's wrong: A typical sitcom character. If you fancy yourself a major part of the Sitcom, your character's first name is the same as your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Annoy&lt;br/&gt;        Pick something about your character that annoys the audience. This is called your Annoy. For example, Ray Romano would have an Annoy of Whine, alien Dick's Annoy is Pretentious Overacting, ALF's annoy is Being ALF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Putting the Situational in...&lt;br/&gt;        The GM deviously sets up some bizarre and stupid situation that can conceivably be solved in thirty minutes. This should allow for the Sitcom format: Problem introduced, problem seems unsolvable, stupid fix three minutes before credits roll, everyone laughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
