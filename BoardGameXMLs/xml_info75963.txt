			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fear Effect is an action game for the PlayStation. It was developed by Kronos Digital Entertainment and published by Eidos Interactive. The story concerns three outlaws named Hana, Deke, and Glas who are trying to retrieve the missing daughter of a wealthy Chinese businessman. Essentially a cyberpunk adventure set in futuristic China, Fear Effect's storyline also incorporates elements of Chinese mythology...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fear Effect features traditional survival horror gameplay with unshaded characters textured to resemble cel-shading. Rather than using pre-rendered 2D backgrounds, the environments are composed of streaming or looping full-motion video. As a consequence, the game is composed of four discs. There are also puzzles interspersed between action sequences, similar to other games of the survival horror genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls one of three mercenaries (either Hana, Deke, or Glas) and pilots them through areas filled with human and non-human enemies. The game controls are similar to traditional survival horror tank controls, with an exception being that the characters can run and shoot simultaneously. When wielding two guns (one in each hand), they are also able to shoot multiple enemies at the same time. Another feature is the ability to duck and roll; whilst facing a number of the armed foes, the player can roll a short distance and avoid taking enemy fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's title refers to the player's life bar, a meter which resembles a pulsing EKG. When the player is damaged, the green line of the EKG will pulse faster and turn red. It is possible to 'regain' health by performing acts that will calm that character's heart rate. These include solving a puzzle or sneaking behind a guard to perform a stealth kill. Both will be rewarded with a health boost that brings the meter back to green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
