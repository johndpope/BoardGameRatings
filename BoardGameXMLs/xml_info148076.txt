							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Ruins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Modern Ruins, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look well, for this is the byproduct of war, the destruction of civilization.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Modern Ruins is a collective landscape of a shattered modern city. A still standing center building has debris collapsed on the inside and outside of the building. The rest of the city has been flattened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in modern games or post apocalyptic games. It can also be used as a ruined city in a science fiction game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Modern Ruins could be created by several means. Carpet-bombing of the area or a nuclear bomb could have destroyed the city during a war. Alternatively, a natural disaster destroyed the city such as a massive earthquake or tsunami, capable of flattening smaller buildings and collapsing taller buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Modern Ruins could be used as an expansion or an alternative map to our City Ruins product. The difference between the two products is that the buildings and terrain of the City Ruins product are more intact than the Modern Ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a post apocalyptic game, the group could come upon the ruined city and try to scavenge for food, water, or other materials in the areas. Other scavengers have laid claim to the area and decide to fight for their territory. The area is a tough one for gunfights since hard, tall cover isn&amp;rsquo;t readily available except next to the withered trees, some free standing building walls, and the center building and rubble surrounding it. The rest of the cover is generally soft, short cover that can only be used if kneeling or prone, such as the many flattened buildings. The group needs to defeat the scavengers, perhaps finding what they need to survive in their pockets instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
