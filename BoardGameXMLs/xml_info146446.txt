			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For untold millennia, man hid in his caves, whipped by Father Storm and buried by Mother Snow. Some who hid appealed to the raw power tearing through their world, and made dangerous bargains. Thus spirits were wed to humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are still a few old women who remember the time before aeromancers charted the sky and waters. Now, those brave enough to dance between the storms venture out, establishing trade with other pockets of humanity. What strange beasts, food, tools, and dwellings has man made for himself during his millennia trapped in the womb of Tempest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
