							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grand Naval Game of Tactics</name>
									
			<description>Australian game of World War II vintage or slightly earlier.&lt;br/&gt;Box features a group of adults playing game. The box contains a board pierced with holes, around 400 wooden coloured matchstick-type pieces and the rules. Each player controls his own fleet at the same time trying to locate the enemy forces.&lt;br/&gt;I think this must be a Battleships-type game but the pieces, that you thrust through the board to hopefully score a hit, are different colours and this must have some effect on game-play. The manufacturer describe it a &amp;quot;Thrill for Adults&amp;quot;. But, covering all bases, it is also suggested for children. Nice to see wooden components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
