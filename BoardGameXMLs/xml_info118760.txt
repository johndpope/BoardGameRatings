			<description>&amp;quot;Say your word!&amp;quot; in English.&lt;br/&gt;There are 48 cards with a letter. The cards are dealt among the players, face down in front of them. &lt;br/&gt;In his turn, the active player will return the top card of his pack and place it face up on the table. Then he will propose, in less than a minute, a word with the letter of the card. He look at his cards to find other letters for this word, if one letter still missing, he moves to the next player and look at his cards for this latter. If any other player has a valid proposal, the unfortunate active player must not only take the card he has returned, but all the cards on the table of previous rounds and puts these on the point deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, when all the cards were played, the game ends, there are points on the letters we have collected, and whoever has the least is declared &amp;quot;Grand Winner&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
