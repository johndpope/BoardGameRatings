							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Harbour</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city guards are hot on your tail, but you take one mighty leap from the harbour wall and grip the edge of the departing ship, quickly pulling yourself on board. Phew! That was close. You will not be able to return to this city for a long time after your run-in with the Guild of Thieves! You watch and wave as the city guards howl with anger upon the rapidly vanishing harbour wall as the ship makes way. You can afford only to pay your passage until the next port of call, a small coastal hamlet by the name of Horosk, so that is where you will depart. From here you will be able to lie low for a while and then make your way to adventures new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That night you lie on the deck gazing up at the stars, looking forward to the season of autumn and the prospect of new lands ahead of you. You expect to arrive at Horosk in about 5 days, depending of course on the wind. Should the weather be favourable, you should arrive just in time for All Hallows Eve, and look forward to celebrating the start of the new season...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability - 1 character level 1-3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
