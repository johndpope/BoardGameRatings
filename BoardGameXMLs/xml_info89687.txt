			<description>From the rules sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pocket word dice game consisting of seven white letter dice and one black symbol dice. Comes in a drawstring bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a turn to shake and throw the eight dice. Using the letters on the upturned faces of the seven white letter dice, the aim is to make the highest score possible by creating one or more words of two or more letters. Players decide the number of rounds they wish to play in each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each dice has a score value and these are added together to get a total for the turn. The blank has no score value and may be used as any desired letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all the letters can be used in making two or three words, an extra 5 points is added to the player's score for that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six letter words add 15 points to the player's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven letter words add 25 points to the player's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The black symbol dice affects the player's throw by adding or subtracting points, imposing a time limit, allowing a rethrow of all dice, prohibiting multiple words or adding an extra blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
