			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you keep from spreading your poison oak rash? How do you get an alligator to let go of your friend's foot? Based on the best-selling books and games, this game brings the Worst-Case concept to kids, to amaze and educate a whole new way. Players have Tool Cards, that feature common items like a broom or water bottle. The kids hear a scenario and decide which tool can get them out of it. Tap the alligator on the nose with the broom to release your friend's foot. Use the water bottle to rinse off the plant oil and your poison ivy rash isn't contagious anymore! Just for fun, What's Worse? Cards give kids icky choices. Like, What's Worse: giving your cat a bath by licking it all over OR eating a giant bowl of dog food? Comes with a game board, 50 Tool Cards, 170 Game Cards, six What's Worse Chips, playing pieces and a die. For 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
