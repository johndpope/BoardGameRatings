							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Character Portraits: Fantasy Heroines</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Whenever you create a new character sheet, one item always seems to get neglected - the character&amp;rsquo;s portrait. What does Agnes des Barres, budding human paladin actually look like? You probably spend a short amount of time telling the rest of your party about your hook nose and eager face, only to immediately involve yourself in adventuring and abruptly forget your own limited description. Now you can address this problem without hours of work drawing a portrait which will probably end up looking like the Bearded Lady; let Mongoose do it for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this, the second in a series of PDFs containing character portraits, we present more than 100 fantasy heroines, all races and all classes, plus a few novelty ones thrown in for good measure. In this PDF you will find fighters and monks, clerics and magic users, even psions. What is more, each one has even been given a name so that if you are feeling uninspired you can leaf through and pick out a suitable name as well! All the pictures are designated Open Games Content, so you may do with them as you will. This 26-page PDF also includes full and simple instructions that will have you cutting and pasting character art in no time. It really is that easy!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
