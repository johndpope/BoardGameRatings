			<description>Strike! is a loosely based simulation of the British car industry of the 1970's and was published free in a 1981 edition of Games &amp;amp; Puzzles magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are paired together and act as representatives of their respective car manufactures. Each of the pair takes on the role of managing director, the other as union leader of its' work force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the managing director is one of expanding sales and profits against competition from other managing directors in the rival car firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the union leader is to secure fair deal for the workers and secure the highest possible share of the company profits against the resistance of the management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike! asks you to do the impossible: combine with players holding diametrically opposite interests to achieve your objectives within the company while helping to sweep the competition from the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
