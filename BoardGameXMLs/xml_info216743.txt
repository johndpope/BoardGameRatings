			<description>Compete with friends and family members to become the most succesful successor to Mads Skjern's business empire! A game of trivia questions based on the succesful Television series &amp;quot;Matador&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game builds on questions previously used in other games with the same theme, but has a new different gaming mechanics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start out with a suitcase with which they travel round the board. Players earn money by answering questions of variating difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speciel fields on the game board, allow the players to advance from the suitcase to a small house, eventually reaching the 3 storage warehouse that Mads Skjerns ends with in the television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special cards allow the players to interact by moving the player tokens on the board, stealing money from players etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player with a 3 storage warehouse to pass the starting field on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special questions are available to children playing the game with little or no prerequisites for answering Matador specific questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
