			<description>Planetfall an explosive, fast paced game that brings ground-pounding, armoured combat to the ever-expanding Firestorm Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this deadly, hard sci-fi setting, hordes of futuristic tanks, agile aircraft and hulking mech-walkers tear each other asunder with high-powered weaponry. Lasers burn across the tabletop, rail-gun slugs smash through armoured hulls and advanced cyber-warfare weapons hack through vital systems &amp;ndash; the war zones of the distant future are no place for the faint hearted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firestorm Planetfall puts you in the role of a Grand Commander, orchestrating the maneuvers of your chosen army. Each of your Battle Groups will contain several Helixes of stunningly-detailed 10mm scale miniatures, ranging from towering Leviathans to numerous bases of Infantry, all prepared to fight to the last under your command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your planetary invasion force will be formed of troops from one of the six core races, who in turn belong to one of two sides: the Zenian League or Alliance of Kurak, vast alliances currently fighting for dominance of the Galactic sector. Each of the six races has its own complex motivations within the conflict, as well as entirely unique vehicles and distinct ways of fighting their battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firestorm Planetfall is a miniature tabletop wargame, set in the Firestorm Armada universe. The game uses 10mm miniatures and dice to reproduce future combat during planet invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firestorm Planetfall is a revised and updated version of Firestorm Invasion: Planetfall, with significant rules changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Force construction is different and now uses the helix system, &lt;br/&gt;- Reinforced Target Zone markers were removed, &lt;br/&gt;- STAR cards were replaced by TACs (Tactical Action Cards), and - squadron activation no longer uses cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The helix system has also been blended into game play, in that you must activate every squadron within a helix before moving to another helix, and the turn structure is also different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
