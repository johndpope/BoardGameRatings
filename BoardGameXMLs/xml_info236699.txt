			<description>Featuring all original artwork inspired by Art Nouveau, Lygari! is a fun bluffing game for 3-6 players, where each player is one of the Einherjar in Valhalla boasting about their conquests!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lygari!, there are 13 different monsters from Norse myth, and players take turns boasting about what creatures they have defeated in their previous life before coming to Valhalla. Cards are played face down, while players claim them to be one of the monsters in the game. It's up to other players to determine if each play is a bluff. Play continues until either one player has played all their cards, or the draw pile is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turn, players have a choice of making a boast, calling the previous player a Lygari, or just drinking mead. When making a boast, a player plays any number of cards from their hand, face down, and claims them to be one of the 13 monsters in the game. If the next player calls their bluff, the cards are revealed. If they matched the previous player's claim, the calling player must take all cards played so far into their hand, otherwise, the lying player takes all cards played into their hand. A player may instead opt to &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; by drinking mead and drawing a card from the stock. When the mead runs out (all cards are drawn), whoever has the fewest cards left in their hand is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lygari! is the second in a series of games from Green Fairy Studios LLC in a shared setting of Mystique, where beings from ancient myth return to our modern day world. Lygari! highlights just some of the fantasical beings from Yggdrasil, the Nine Worlds of Norse myth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
