			<description>The player controls Cool Coyote in a game with advanced, colourful graphics with some novel gameplay features. Perhaps two of the most memorable features of the game are the ever-present representation of the gameworld at the bottom of the screen which features some accomplished shimmering water effects and the 'sunset' style background colour effects that were also memorably used in the Amiga game Zool. The CD32 version was graphically enhanced to include detailed background scenery, 256 on-screen colors and several layers of parallax scrolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fire and Ice (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
