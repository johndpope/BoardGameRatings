			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventures of the Bow Street Runners in their Struggle against the Minions of the Cthulhu Mythos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;London, 1749: A city of vice, crime and misery. Gangs of ruffians rule the streets, unopposed. Brothels proliferate. Child-beggars starve in filthy gutters. Corrupt night-watchmen and thief-takers turn a blind eye to wrong-doing. And dark creatures lurk in back alleys, called from beyond by the desperate with nothing left to lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is a new force on the streets of London; for the author and magistrate Henry Fielding has teamed up with his brother John to form the city&amp;rsquo;s first police force &amp;ndash; the Bow Street Runners. The Fieldings have persuaded parliament to fund their crime-fighting endeavour, but they know that there is something behind the vice &amp;ndash; for John Fielding&amp;rsquo;s blind eyes can see things that others cannot &amp;ndash; things that man was not meant to know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Streets is stand-alone role-playing game in which players take on the roles of officers in London&amp;rsquo;s first, desperately small, police force, investigating the dark secrets behind the sordid crimes of eighteenth century London. A mixture of authentic history and the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft, using the Renaissance D100 system, Dark Streets comes to you from the UK Games Expo Award-winning authors of Abney Park&amp;rsquo;s Airship Pirates, Clockwork &amp;amp; Chivalry, Pirates &amp;amp; Dragons and the OneDice series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
