							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fruit Trees Game</name>
									
			<description>Fruit Tree develops color recognition and identification while introducing your child to the fun and challenge of playing a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents are 4 tree boards, 20 fruit counters in 5 colors (red, green, orange, purple, yellow), and 1 color spot die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a tree board. The fruit counters are placed face up in the center of the play area.  Each player rolls the die and places a counter of that color on their tree board,  If the color that is thrown is already on the tree the player does nothing.  If a blue is thrown the player may pick a fruit from another player's tree.  The winner is the first player to fill the tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
