			<description>Vintage HOME GOLF Pebble Beach 1961 GAME Includes Driver, Fairway Wood, No. 3 Iron, No. 5 Iron, No. 6 Iron, No. 7 Iron, No. 9 Iron, Wedge and Chipper PLUS Instruction Booklet.  Greens (made of Styrofoam). It's played in the comfort of your living room. The course is an accurate and detailed replica of the world famous Pebble Beach golf course in Monterey, CALF. Object of the game is to complete the course in the fewest possible strokes. The game consists of a set of 18 Fairways, a Putting Green, a Putter.    When a player's marker finally lands on a green, he actually putts across the felt-lined green (which takes up most of the box) into the little hole marked by the 8&amp;quot; flag with his little plastic putter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
