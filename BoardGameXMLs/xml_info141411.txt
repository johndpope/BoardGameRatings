							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taffy&#039;s Party Game</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the instruction sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Taffy's four party scenes are shown on the board - but where are the guests?  Each player is Taffy, trying to be the &amp;quot;hostess with the mostest&amp;quot; by making the right scene with the right guests.&lt;br/&gt;     Players start with random guest cards for all the parties.  You make the party rounds according to your calls on the telephone.  The spaces on the board match the shapes of the guest cards.  Whenever you land in a space for which you have a guest card for a matching shape, you must place that guest in the space.  Funny scenes will develop, such as pajamas appearing at the formal party, guests in bathing suits frolicking in the snow, etc.&lt;br/&gt;     Whenever you are able to take the correct guest to the correct party, you receive a picture card.  The WINNER is the player who can show she is the best hostess by placing the most guests correctly and collecting the most pictures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
