			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wyrmslayer: A Sword for One Purpose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short adventure produced for the 4th ed. game system! This is made for levels 5-8 with a variety of classes. It also includes full page, color maps and a second downpload that contains the stats for all of the NPCs and monsters. This is an excellent follow up to Beyond the Black Door, as Wyrmslayer begins where the previous left off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious stranger who claims to be a dragon rider is in Deepport looking for a company of heroes to retreive artifacts that will help him take his role in an ages old prophecy. Aragorn Cloud communicates directly with dragons by telepathy. He knows that the remaining dragons who live in the mountain on the Isle of Io are in an uproar and are a danger to man and themselves. No dragons are evil in this world. Until recently, a dragon had never attacked innocents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs will travel the Inland Sea, battle pirates, storms and other terrors before they reach the Isle of Io. Once there, they have the task of exploring Dragon Mountain and looking for clues to find the artifacts. Many of the lairs are empty and other things have moved into the ancient stronghold. The treasure and rewards are high but then, so is the danger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
