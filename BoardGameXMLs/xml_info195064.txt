							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horses of the Wild</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most overland travelers only need use of a generic light or heavy horse as described in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, some players might have use for a more exciting animal in their adventures. One that needs protection from theft or destruction. More expensive, yes, but well worth the extra coin. The equines included feature a wide variety of bonuses for a multitude of needs as the player desires. Other riders may want to learn new tricks to make their mounted combat shine. For there are bandits on nearly every road and the wilderness is full of dark and terrible creatures. Having a way to incorporate the mount in battle enables the character to shine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
