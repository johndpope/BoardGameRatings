			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local farmers have been coming into Feastelburg recently recounting harrowing stories of a growing number of attacks upon the land. Farmers and travelers have decidedly noted that the creatures causing the problems are troglodytes. The creatures seem to be becoming bolder in their attacks as initially they were at night under cover of darkness. The last several attacks have occurred during daylight and the recent reports have included chasing down and murdering farmers and pilgrims alike. Several farms have been put to the torch and it has the town on edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is suitable for adventure groups of level 3-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign, however it is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
