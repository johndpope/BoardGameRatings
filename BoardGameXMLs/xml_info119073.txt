			<description>The game features eight character classes which can be improved up to level 200. Each is customisable with a variety of weapons, spells, support abilities, and attributes. Different classes who can use the same weapons attack differently with them. For example, the Warrior's spear attack is a thrust, while the Archer throws his spear over a distance. Each usable spell in the game has its own spellbook, and only classes with that spell on their skills list can use the spellbook to cast the spell.&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - A well balanced melee class. Default name: Eric (Alex in Japanese)&lt;br/&gt;Archer - Attacks from afar using bows and spears, and summons forest creatures. Default name: Rwinn (Luin in Japanese)&lt;br/&gt;Sorceress - Uses a variety of offensive elemental spells from a distance. Default name: Premiera (Pamela in Japanese)&lt;br/&gt;Dragonute - The slowest but toughest melee class. Default name: Tyroth (Tiros in Japanese)&lt;br/&gt;Priestess - Specializes in healing and support spells. Default name: Prim&lt;br/&gt;Dark Wizard - Uses Dark elemental spells. Default name: Armand (Bloodstar in Japanese)&lt;br/&gt;Brawler - The most powerful and quick offensive melee class, but suffers from low defense. Default name: Zachs (Sachs in Japanese)&lt;br/&gt;Ninja - A swift medium-ranged class using a mix of spells and physical attacks. Default name: Raizen&lt;br/&gt;??? - A Dark Wizard similar to Armand; secret character who becomes available after beating the game once. Has no default name.&lt;br/&gt;Each character is able to equip up to three weapons and three items for use, and switch between them at any time. You can get 3 extra slots for either by equipping the Backpack or Knapsack. Attacks are performed by tapping the attack button, or holding to charge a more powerful attack. Beyond regular equipment, a &amp;quot;Soul&amp;quot; item can also be equipped; it is charged by defeating enemies, and unleashed to inflict massive damage on nearby enemies. They come in various elemental types and levels of effectiveness. They are graded on the roman numerals I, II, III, IV and V, with V being the strongest and taking the longest to charge up.&lt;br/&gt;Characters also have resistances to a number of elements: Fire, Ice, Thunder, Light, Dark and Poison. These can be raised by equipment, but also through endurance: by taking damage of a particular elemental kind, they can increase their resistance to it, but being killed by an attack of that type will decrease the resistance level by a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shining Soul II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
