							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beh√ºtunsburg</name>
									
			<description>In 13th century Bayern, family ties were strong, but for some, the lust for power was stronger.  Rivalry among and within noble families would often lead to Machiavellian politics, outright theft and sometimes kidnapping. The Beh&amp;uuml;tuns family was no different, as different branches of the family squabbled over money &amp;amp; subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Beh&amp;uuml;tunsburg is a two-player card game usually played in 4 rounds. (Two copies of the game can be used to play with 3-4 players.)&lt;br/&gt;Players will assemble a &amp;quot;court&amp;quot; of Barons &amp;amp; Knights with their Ladies, then a King and Queen, and finally adding a castle.  Each of these elements are worth a certain number of victory points. Knights can be sent on quests to find treasure and more vassals for the King, (i.e. drawing more cards).  Opposing players can attempt to disrupt plans by sending rogues to steal from the treasury or kidnap ladies, knights, barons or baronesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when a player with a complete court and castle discards their last card.  Scores are totaled based on the victory points of the cards in play.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the most total victory points at the end of four rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
