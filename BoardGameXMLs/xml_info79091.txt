							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abyss (2010)</name>
									
			<description>Abyss is an original strategic puzzle game that challenges you to rearrange colored pieces by sliding them horizontally and vertically to create a path for your pearls across the abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can tilt your phone to maneuver the pearls down the path, but be careful, you must balance them so they don't fall into the abyss. Different sound and theme options make this game fun and appealing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abyss has a simple concept but tests your strategy and problem solving skills by increasing the difficulty of each level as you progress. The high score is recorded, so you can compete against yourself or a friend. Hurry, the faster you complete each level, the more points you receive! You'll never get bored with the UNLIMITED number of puzzles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
