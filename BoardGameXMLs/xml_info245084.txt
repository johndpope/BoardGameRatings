							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Willy Maykit</name>
									
			<description>Willy Maykit is just an average guy. You'd probably like him. But Willy has a problem. He let his friend, Betty Woent, drag him to the shopping mall on Black Friday, and that giant coffee-like drink has run right through him. If he doesn't find a restroom pronto, he may have a rather uncomfortable accident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you all play a different version of Will in alternate worlds, who are all suffering from the same dilemma at the same time - the desperate need to pee while stuck in a busy shopping mall. You're okay with karmically throwing another you under the bus if it's going to get you to the restroom sooner. It's all very existential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Maykit is a casual &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; card game, where you'll be managing your (Bladder) Control. You don't want to run out of Control. That's when you have an Accident. In a public place. Embarrassing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
