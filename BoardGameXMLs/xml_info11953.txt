							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pop-Up Store Game</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This wonderful Toy and Candy Store game with its &amp;quot;Pop-Up&amp;quot; counters is made especially for children to play going shopping. They have fun as they go from counter to counter, buying articles on their shopping list with play money, and stopping to eat at the soda fountain - just as in a real store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to complete your shopping list, have the packages wrapped paid for, and be the first to leave the store.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not much of a game here, but an incredibly cool &amp;quot;pop-up&amp;quot; board. Allegedly from the 1950s&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
