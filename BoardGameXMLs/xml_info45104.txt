			<description>A Horrid Enemy&lt;br/&gt;The Slayer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Trolls provides detailed information on trollish physiology, habitat, and society, giving you a fundamental level of understanding on how this race exists and interacts with the rest of the world. Players can learn the types of combat tactics trolls are likely to employ against their characters and Games Masters are given guidelines on how to introduce trolls into their existing campaigns, and will also benefit from material demonstrating how to portray these creatures to the players. A few troll subspecies can change the expectations of any encounter, as do the new trollish feats that alter the standard troll into something even more horrific. Finally, a complete troll lair is featured to be used as either an extended encounter, the basis for a complete set of scenarios, or even just as an example of how such troll lairs are generally laid out. There are more to trolls than first meets the eye. After reading the Slayer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Trolls, you may never view these monsters in quite the same way again&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
