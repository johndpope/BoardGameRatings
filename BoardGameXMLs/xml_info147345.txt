							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rawen TCG</name>
									
			<description>Rawen's land has been a place of war for hundreds of years. Twelve empires, twelve powerful gods &amp;mdash; all longing for the same thing: limitless might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything started with a Cataclysm and the appearance of the New Ones, who ruthlessly squelched the Old Ones &amp;mdash; except for those who escaped into other planes of existence, specifically four parts of the world that managed to survive the catastrophe: the Big Continent, also known as Askalar where most of the empires lay; to the North, Iceland, the Isle of the Mages; in the south, Fireland, the home of Demons; and in Oceania, Bale, the Life Tree's territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fight has not ended after the New Ones victory. The balance of forces varies, and it takes only a little to break the fragile balance. Fellowships are made, then breached in moments, but the stakes are much bigger than the power over Rawen. The New Ones fight not just for victory; they are seeking themselves. A secret part of their essence, which they can hardly remember. They were born on another world, which they gave up in exchange for survival. In the depths of their minds, a name pulsates about which neither their new dependents nor The Old Ones might know: Earth. The War of the Gods started in the far past of Rawen, but it affects the future of the whole universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Rawen Trading Card Game, the Gods of Rawen wield their power through their Warlords. As they expand their territories, the armies of the opposing Gods frequently battle one another. Your goal is to defeat the enemy warlord with the help of fighting units, heroes, and summoned spells. Successful attacks by your army weaken your enemies, and thus weaken their God, too. If the enemy warlord ever has as many wounds as health points, the warlord dies and you win the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game terms, each player chooses a warlord and a class, then creates a deck of at least 45 cards, with the warlord card, class card and primeval energy cards not counting toward this total. The game is turn-based, and in the main phase of your turn, you may act in any order, placing cards from your hand onto the battlefield, attacking with your units, activating a special power, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
