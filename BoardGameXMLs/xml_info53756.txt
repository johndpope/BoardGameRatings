							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abduction of Good King Despot</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Can you rescue GOOD KING DESPOT?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good king has been abducted!  The kingdom has lost its benign, honest, and charitable ruler (at least that's what he said he was, and the dubious, tax-crippled citizens found it prudent to agree).  Despot's good queen cannot be consoled, though she tries very hard to find comfort.  At last, the truth emerges: the good king is being held in the magical prison of the arch-fiend Ignax.  And a party of brave adventurers will, of course, get the unenviable task of digging him out - perhaps even literally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those bold souls who undertake this rescue mission will quickly discover that Ignax's warped mind has created the zaniest dungeon setting they have ever experienced.  The characters will encounter weird (though dangerous) monsters, strange traps and devices, brutally cryptic clues, and utterly mystifying situations.  Only a group with imagination, intelligence, bravery, and an indomitable sense of humor will be able to restore the king to the arms of his loving wife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Abduction of Good King Despot includes a 32-page text booklet, a 16-page booklet of black-and-white illustrations, and a color map of Ignax's wacky dungeon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
