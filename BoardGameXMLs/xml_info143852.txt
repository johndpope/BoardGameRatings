							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trojan Cross</name>
									
			<description>Trojan Cross is played on a 13 x 13 grid of red and black squares that features a &amp;ldquo;Trojan&amp;rsquo;s Cross&amp;rdquo; in the center (and adjoining four squares) of the board.  All the corner squares of the board are red.  The game&amp;rsquo;s pieces consist of 20 red and 20 black checkers, each with a pawn on one side, a crown on the other.  The game is played on the black squares of the board, with players&amp;rsquo; pieces beginning on the black squares of the three closest rows.  Players may begin with any combination or formation of pawns and crowns, so long as they are identical to each other, though the instructions do provide three recommended ways to start: three rows of pawns, or one row of crowns and two of pawns, or two rows crowns and one of pawns.  Black moves first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the exception of the cross in the middle of the board, player movement is the same as an ordinary game of Checkers.  Pawns may move forward (left or right) one square only unless jumping and capturing an opponent&amp;rsquo;s piece, when they may jump however many times there are openings.  Crowns may move and jump forward and backward.  Captured pieces are removed from the board.  Crowning of pawns takes place upon reaching the opponent&amp;rsquo;s home row, or after moving over any four squares in the Trojan&amp;rsquo;s Cross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s instructions feature a number of diagrams describing what movements a pawn may make within the cross, how it may exit, what conditions it must meet to be crowned, how the opponent must be notified, and how the opponent may interrupt.  The game is won by capturing all of an opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces, or by blocking all of an opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces from moving, or by making seven uninterrupted moves within the cross.  Methods are provided for scoring, should players desire it for multiple matches, but the simplest method provided is one point for one victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
