			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost a century ago, the village of Solis suffered through a dark time where evil ruled the land, and back then that evil was vanquished by a group known only as &amp;ldquo;The Five&amp;rdquo;. After the defeat of the unknown evil and the disappearance of &amp;ldquo;The Five&amp;rdquo;, Solis rebuilt itself. As such, it has been at peace for decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a new, unknown evil looms, threatening to spread darkness and destruction over the land and dominate the continent. The village has grown peaceful since its first encounter with this evil and is no longer equipped to deal with this threat, so the call goes out for new adventurers to come to the aid of Solis and protect it from whatever may threaten it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coming Dark, Chapter One: Into the Light is the first chapter in a three part campaign developed for 5th Edition. It is designed for a party of between four and six 1st or 2nd level characters, taking them up to at least 4th level at the end of the chapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
