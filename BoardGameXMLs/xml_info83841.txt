These creatures have been carefully selected for their surprising and unique characteristics. Some, like the cheenoo, can teach the heroes rare secrets of hunting or healing herbs. Others, like the adlet and maero, enjoy torturing humanoids and will try to capture the heroes and condemn them to a fate worse than death. The devious bokwus can steal the souls of those it kills, robbing them of any chance of an afterlife or resurrection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bane Ledger II features monsters ranging from CR 2 to CR 19, including dreadful demons like the Hedammu that lurks beneath the ocean's waves.
