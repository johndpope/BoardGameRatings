			<description>The game is played on a board consisting of 8x8 squares. Both players have a set of eight arrows, which start on the first row on their side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arrows have four different colours: white, blue, yellow and red. White is stronger than blue, blue is stronger than yellow, yellow is stronger than red and red is stronger than white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player may move any one of his arrows a single square in any direction. If an arrow ends up next to a weaker opposing arrow, the weaker arrow is placed two squares back. If it cannot be moved back, it is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to have your arrows reach the center four squares of the back row. Each of these squares is colour coded. If an arrow matches the the colour of the pin, two points are scored, otherwise, a single point is scored. The player who gains the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
