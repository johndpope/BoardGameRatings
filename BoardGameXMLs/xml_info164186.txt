			<description>Cards and dice game. There are 9 cards representing the skittles 1 to 9. They are shuffled and laid out in a diamond formation. Then the player in his turn, reveals the 9 cards and rolls the three dice supplied. A skittle is hit if the number on a card corresponds with the numbers on the dice,either as an individual figure or the sum of 2 or 3 dice. In this way combinations of the dice may be used to knock over as many skittles (turn them over) as the player can. There are rules about which skittles in a layout are covered by other skittles. This cannot be knocked over until the skittle(s) covering them are knocked over first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in their turn can throw the dice three times. Every skittle knocked over scores a point. If all 9 are knocked over in three rolls, then the score is 12 instead of 9. If you can knock them all over in just two throws, you score 15. First player to 77 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
