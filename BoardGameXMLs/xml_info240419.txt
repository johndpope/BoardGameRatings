							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prelacy of Camon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prelacy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Church of Archanon is in complete control and that's just how they want it! Any who criticize or complain are punished or made to disappear. They've had generations in power and the populace genuinely believes Archanon favors them and is their God. There may be whispered rumors of a time when there was a King who balanced the Church's excesses, along with the Cavaliers who protected the nobles. Those days are gone and the rulers of the Church like it just fine this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you'll learn about the Prelacy, how it came to power and why. There's a great deal of history in this land and Camon has had a remarkable ability to surprise the southern kingdoms each time it has tried to convert the rest of Shaintar to the Church - at swordpoint. The time is coming when it will be Camon who is surprised. Their lie has been hidden for too long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's some new secrets revealed and you'll learn about the Paladins, each of the Cardinals and the Nobles they rule. We've also included a bunch of new gear, edges, powers, and other cool stuff to help you get the feel of Camon within a character or NPC. You'll also find some new information about the Cavaliers, they may play a significant role in the future of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
