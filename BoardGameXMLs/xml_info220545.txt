			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight Hoary Heroes Set to Brave the Bitter Cold! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter Heroes is our seventh set of 8 ready-to-play pregenerated 1st level characters created specifically to shine in a Witches of Winter Adventure Path but ideal for any campaign venturing into the marvelous mash-up of the fantastical and the futuristic! Ideal for use as allies, cohorts, long-running NPCs, or replacement player characters, Liz Courts brings you amazingly detailed and lushly developed characters including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Brynla, half-orc druid of the green faith&lt;br/&gt;    Maja Tasker, halfling investigator sleuth&lt;br/&gt;    Pero, human summoner and his otherworldly protector, Drahu&lt;br/&gt;    Roelof, dwarf witch guardian of the ley lines&lt;br/&gt;    Stojan, snowborn elf two-handed fighter&lt;br/&gt;    Zakhar, snowborn elf oracle&lt;br/&gt;    Zuza Holt, human herald of the horn skald&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least, the shadow-sneak Senka Featherfingers, fetchling rogue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built according to organized play specifications, using the 20-point-buy method and with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just piles of statistics. Each one is as much about story as combat, with robust links built in to each other as well as the official Witches of Winter Adventure Path, though every one easily stands on its own in any setting where savage barbarians battle technological terrors. The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&amp;rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Winter Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character includes a detailed backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from the Witches of Winter Adventure Path player&amp;rsquo;s guide. Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build. We haven't even mentioned the fantastic character portraits courtesy of Bob Greyvenstein, or the included foldable paper miniatures for every character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
