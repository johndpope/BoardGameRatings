			<description>A teenage boy, Aidan, and his pet monkey, Hobo, are on a cruise ship. The boat starts to sink. Aidan gets onto a lifeboat with Hobo. The lifeboat dashes away, but soon comes to a stop. The pilot announces that the propeller is stuck. Aidan volunteers to go and free it. The boat shakes and Aidan is thrown into the current with Hobo. He starts to drift away. A man on the lifeboat tosses him a suitcase. Aidan grabs the suitcase. Hobo hops on top of the suitcase. Soon, Aidan wakes up on an island. He explores it until he sees a larger island in the distance. He builds a raft out of the suitcase and some driftwood. He and Hobo sail over to the larger island. The raft breaks apart as he reaches the island, and all his belongings float away. He is greeted by a teenage girl, Lucy, when he gets there. They band together and start to explore the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lost in Blue: Shipwrecked&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
