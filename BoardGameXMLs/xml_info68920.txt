			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edition Spielbox No. 88. First published in Spielbox 1/2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are hikers that are trying to cross a bridge. However the bridge is not stable and will collapse if there is ever too much weight on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is secretly assigned one of six colours at the start of the game. The players throw the die in turn and make a number of moves with any pawns equal to the value rolled. Each space on the bridge has a weight score and if the sum of the pawns' weight is greater than the stability score of the bridge, it collapses. Pawns at the start and in the middle of the bridge fall into the river and swim back to the start, pawns near the end land on rocks and are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player wishes to move his pawn to the goal and win, he must declare his intention to do so before rolling. The next player may then try and guess the roller's identity, with a correct guess eliminating that player from the game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
