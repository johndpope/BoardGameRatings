			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the sons and daughters of the ultra-rich have been acting strangely, prone to public outbursts and irrational behavior. All such events have been hushed up neatly, both in the public and in the press, to the point where few even know that anything unusual has occurred. Yet, that only serves to leave everyone unprepared for the moment when the first of these favored sons and daughters loses whatever tenuous hold they had upon reality, sending them over the edge into a violent, psychotic rage. A violence that their gene-sculpted and heavily augmented bodies quickly turns all too deadly. The local authorities are too ill-equipped to handle such heavily augmented individuals. Which means it is up to the Vigilantes to stop these rampaging monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
