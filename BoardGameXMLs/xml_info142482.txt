							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Primer of the World of Ptalmanar</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Ptalmanar, where two empires represent the cradle of civilization while foreign powers loom off every horizon, watching for signs of weakness. As the Imperial rulers find their lands extended to their natural boundaries, great sailing ships strike out across the oceans in search of new lands to colonize for the glory of the crown. The riches flow from the colonies back to the coffers of the King and Queen, as pirates with no allegiances at all strike at the laden ships, announcing their presence with the sharp sound of a cannon&amp;rsquo;s roar. As the mortals wage their wars and struggle to expand, twelve gods watch from above, locked in their own eternal conflict. They sit poised upon the Divine Wheel, three of light, three of darkness and six in between. Each god stares across at their enemy, their personal adversary in the divine struggle. High priests stand in sanctified temples, speaking with the authority of heaven, guiding their initiates to exercise the will of their patron deity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included here is an overview of the campaign setting, going over some of the unique aspects of our world and the rules we have introduced. The following is intended as a primer for prospective players and game masters, so they can get a snapshot of the world of Ptalmanar and the Twin Crowns: Age of Exploration Fantasy campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
