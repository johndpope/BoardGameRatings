			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a New Kind of Mythic Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your character&amp;rsquo;s mythic path tells you about the kinds of abilities in which he specializes, and perhaps even gives some clue as to his ultimate mythic destiny, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about where he came from, and what made him mythic in the first place. For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces the pharaonic heritage in particular, which represents characters whose mythic power comes from sources such as the Nile (or similar mythic rivers in hostile wastes), the Old Kingdom, and the pharaohs. If you are the long-lost descendant of an ancient pharaoh, accidentally awakened a sleeping power deep within a forgotten pyramid, have been imbued with power by a pharaoh or one of the mysterious gods of the Old Kingdom, or even are a pharaoh yourself, this mythic heritage allows you to tap into the ineffable and ancient power of the god-kings of the desert. This book includes 18 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the pharaonic mythic heritage. Call forth powerful sandstorms which harm your foes, but leave you untouched. Imprison your foes in miniature pyramids and erase their names from history forever. Adventure with confidence, knowing that if you are slain you will rise again as a mummy in short time to wreak vengeance on those who slew you. Call forth oases with merely a word. Transform into a swarm of scarabs. All these and more are powers of the pharaohs, and they can be yours to command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
