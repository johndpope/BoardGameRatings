			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All at Sea is a murder mystery game for 16 to 33 guests and one or two hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us in a thrilling evening of plotting, mystery and treachery. You will be in the middle of the action and it will be up to you to wheel and deal with the other guests. Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive All at Sea? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who killed Captain Bayard - and why? Find out in All at Sea.&lt;br/&gt; It is 1914 and the First World War has just broken out. On an American cruise ship in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, diplomats, dignitaries and the crew must grapple with not only the outbreak of war but also the murder of Captain Bayard.&lt;br/&gt;           &lt;br/&gt;All at Sea lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (43 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
