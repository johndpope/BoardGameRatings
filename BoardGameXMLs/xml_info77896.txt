			<description>Designed as a version of Boulder Dash that could fit onto a floppy disk, the designers had a hard time for this approach in order to create better graphics. (The original Amiga Supaplex version had to fit on a standard 880kB floppy disk and it needed to run on a standard 512kB Amiga like the original A500 or A2000. In fact: The Amiga version could not be copied onto the hardrive due to copy protection and its custom disk format.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 111 levels though many unofficial level sets have been released that greatly increase that number. The game was released for Amiga and MS-DOS. (Two guys from the London region started to program a full version for the Atari ST, but it was never released, because of the limited graphical support.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to hardware dependent programming, the PC version of Supaplex ran twice as fast as PCs became faster. Herman Perk disassembled the game, debugged it and re-assembled it again. The result became known as SpeedFix. Extra features have also been added without changing the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developers of the game have declared the software freeware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Supaplex,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
