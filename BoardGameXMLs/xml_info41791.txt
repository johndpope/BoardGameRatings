							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fallujah</name>
									
			<description>November, 2004: Intelligence indicates that terrorist leader Abu Masab Al-Zarqawi is hiding in Fallujah, a town about 40 miles west of Baghdad. Capturing Al-Zarqawi, an associate of Osama bin Laden and the mastermind of numerous terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East since the 1990s, is the military's highest priority. On 7 November, Coalition forces surround the city and U.S. Marines amass just to the north for the attack. Most of the civilians have fled the impending battle; amidst the buildings of the city await an estimated 3000 Islamic insurgents of Mujahideen Shura and Al-Qaeda Iraq. Operation Phantom Fury is about to begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fallujah is a solitaire wargame pitting U.S. Marines, U.S. Army &amp;amp; Iraqi special forces against insurgents. Can you clear the city of Fallujah of entrenched insurgents with minimal losses, or will you be forced to give up your field command in a stunning defeat? Play this highly replayable squad/platoon game using a new solitaire game system and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fallujah is designed by Mark Kalina, producer of Silent War. Easily playable in an afternoon, play time ranges from 2 hours for a short scenario to 3&amp;frac12; for the full campaign. Complexity is medium (about 5/10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
