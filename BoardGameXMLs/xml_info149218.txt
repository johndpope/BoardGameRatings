							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ring of Stones</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For hundreds of years the stones stood undisturbed, encircling a clearing in the middle of a dense forest. Eight identical slabs of solid rock, towering twenty feet in to the air, anchored in to the earth in such a way that not even the strongest man could so much as budge them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows for sure why they are there, or even who created the circle in the first place, but many believe it's best that they remain undisturbed. Some things are best left unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent times the world around these nondescript stones began to change. Evil began to dwell within the forest as it turned dark and foreboding. The wild became a dangerous place, claiming anyone who dared disturb it, and those that have entered it forest were never heard from again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, at the center of it all, stands the ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows what secrets remain dormant, awaiting to be unlocked by those that seek to harness their power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ring of Stones is a focal point in the second act of The Coming Dark, Chapter One: Into the Light, a large scale campaign currently in development by Darklight Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may use this map pack in any way you wish; the above is how the ring currently exists within the module The Coming Dark. The true purpose of the ring is entirely up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack includes high resolution (150 DPI) images of the ring of stones, both in full color and in desaturated grayscale. Package also includes 50DPI JPEG images - black and white or color, with or without grid lines - for use in third party applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
