			<description>Which ice cream flavor is a bass guitar? Which sport is breakfast? Which Star Wars character is the Eiffel Tower?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X is Y is a game about comparing two lists, such as ice cream flavors and musical instruments. The facilitator will choose an item from list A (musical instruments) and show the other players the title of list B (ice cream flavors). Then all players will all come up with their best answer to the question, which X is Y?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players gain one point for each other player that they match, and then they try again with a different word from list A, such as which ice cream flavor is a flute? Using the information that they gained about their friends in the first turn, they will try to preserve the points that they earned, and earn more in the second turn. On the second turn, the players gain one point for each other player they match, but they lose a point for each player they don&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of 2 turns, points are tallied and positive points are added to their score. The facilitator changes and one word is swapped out. After each player is facilitator, scores are tallied and the high score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
