			<description>ATC Rush Hour is a game in which players take role of Air Traffic Controllers on an airport. The main objective of the game is to make sure that all the planes land or take off without any problems. The game will is available to play from 4 to 6 players. Each player controls one airport with its ATC (Air Traffic Controllers) and try to take off and land as many planes as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives one board at the start of the game. The board represents an airport that is controlled by the player and it is divided into five Zones and seven spaces for Action cards. The Zones are used as an areas to place ATC and Plane cards and the other spaces are destined for corresponding Action cards (Airport, Upgrade, Event and Weather).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key element of the game is moving the Planes between the Zones and players. The Planes are moved by sending them ATC commands. To send a command to a Plane, a player must pay with ATC points, which is done by removing a number of counters from ATC cards. Moving Planes provides victory points which are needed to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
