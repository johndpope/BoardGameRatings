			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark powers are stirring in the Forbidden Lands. Zygofer's henchmen, the feared Rust Brothers, still haunt the land, but the spellbinder himself has not been seen for centuries. Both his enemies and his allies are setting plans in motion. The Blood Mist covering the land has lifted and the deathly calm that has reigned for so long is about to shatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the players are free to roam the land as they see fit, there is a larger scheme behind the scenes that they can get involved in. In the campaign called Raven's Purge, penned by Erik Granstr&amp;ouml;m, the players hunt for four powerful artifacts, adorned with Elven gemstones that together have the potential to decide the future of the Forbidden Lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raven's Purge is not a linear story and it has no set goal that the players are expected to follow. Instead, it is a rich tapestry of legends, characters and plans that the players can interact with in a multitude of ways. The four artifacts can be placed in any adventure sites, thus giving the GM the means to control the length and the pacing of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
