			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hook Line &amp;amp; Sinker is an easy to play, fun game that will entertain the entire family and you don't have to be a fisherman to enjoy playing Hook Line and Sinker. It is a game of chance that depicts most aspects of a day's fishing in a boat. In the box are 82 colorful playing cards representing ten varieties of fish. Each fish is worth a set amount of points from the low scoring Garfish to the mighty Marlin which can score you 100 points. Every cast of the dice will put you in an hilarious and exciting fishing predicament. The winner is the person who catches the most amount of fish with the highest points score, which means you can finish last around the board and still win the game. Try fishing in the lounge room, it's sure to get you in, Hook Line and Sinker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
