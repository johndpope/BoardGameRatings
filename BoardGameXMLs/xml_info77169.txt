							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Future Tactics: The Uprising</name>
									
			<description>[From the back of the game box]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your turn saving the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the future. It's not a pretty place. Not since the creatures took over, anyway. What's left is a rag-tag bunch of human survivors who live in squalor, battle their multidimensional overlords and wax nostalgic for better days. Now a young boy named Low, his sister and a collection of fighters find themselves mankind's only hope for blasting the creatures back to where they came from....... wherever that is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A unique, turn-based tactical combat engine that's all about the action, not the stats, leaving you more time for destruction.&lt;br/&gt;- Really leave your mark on a deformable terrain that changes as you destroy it. Blast holes in the wall, make craters out of meadows and send boulders flying like toys. Make a mess! No one will be around to clean it up.&lt;br/&gt;- Compelling story in the 19-level single player Story Mode. Build to suit with an experience point system that lets you upgrade them with more powerful weapons.&lt;br/&gt;- Two-player customisable Battle Mode lets you modify the handicaps, power-ups and victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;- Uniquely stylised high-polygon RPG characters, 18 in all, each with their own personality and attitude, let loose in a 3D world that is just as rich and full of surprises as they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
