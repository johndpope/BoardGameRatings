							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dark Meadow</name>
									
			<description>A dark fairytale of intrigue and mystery, where the sins of the past must be paid for&amp;hellip; So sets the stage for The Dark Meadow -- a visually stunning world of deep exploration, gripping story, and heart racing combat, created with the unrivaled power of the Unreal Engine 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You awake in a hospital uncertain of how you arrived there or why. An old man warns of a beautiful witch whose minions roam the halls seeking the living. It is only when the witch is destroyed that you will be released from this unrelenting torment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using fun and intuitive fully gesture-based controls, you explore the decaying ruins of Montclair Hospital, armed with your crossbow for long-range combat as well as your sword for up close and personal melee battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best elements from role-playing games encourage exploration as a wide variety of items are secreted throughout the world - from hidden scraps of paper that reveal the mystery of your imprisonment, to weapons and items, to money which can be used to purchase better equipment and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
