							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Likely Mistaken Rules of Advanced Time Wizards!</name>
									
			<description>A surreal roleplaying game of Time and Time Wizards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every session starts with at least one individual shouting The Opening &amp;ldquo;&amp;iexcl;Mientras tanto, los MAGOS DEL TIEMPO!&amp;rdquo; This is a critical step and cannot be forgotten. Other potential participants have until The Opening has been completely enunciated to join in the yelling. Failure to do so will disqualify them from taking the role of Time Master for the remainder of the session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Meanwhile, the Time Wizards!&amp;rdquo; can be substituted for parties that are incapable of even pretending to speak Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: Everybody throws their hands in the air and shouts &amp;ldquo;&amp;iexcl;Mientras tanto, los MAGOS DEL TIEMPO!&amp;rdquo; while a sweet funky beat opens their session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: For best results, involve alcohol as frequently as possible when playing Time Wizards. It will help serve as a buffer layer between players and the ensuing insanity. It can also help maintain a friendly atmosphere. But if you don't want to, then that's okay too. You just won't achieve the best results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Likely Mistaken Rules of Advanced Time Wizards, usually called just Advanced Time Wizards, was published in November 2013 and is a standardized fusion of Time Wizards Revised First Edition and The Likely Mistaken Rules of Time Wizards.  The document included three pages of print-and-play cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
