			<description>Wacky Mountain Adventures!&lt;br/&gt;Aliens have invaded Clem's beloved wilderness home and used their technology to control the animals. Clem must collect diamonds on each level to release animals from alien mind control.&lt;br/&gt;Puzzling Terrain!&lt;br/&gt;Each scrolling level presents a multi-layered challenge. You will climb peaks and slide down slopes. Tunnels can send you to the other end of the level. Water, trees, and rocks stand in your way, but with a little determination, you'll find a way past these obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;Grab Your Tools!&lt;br/&gt;With the right equipment, you can raft across lakes, chop down trees, or climb steep slopes. But you can only carry one tool at a time, so hopefully you'll have a plan! It definitely pays to pick the right tool for the job.&lt;br/&gt;All Creatures Great and Small!&lt;br/&gt;Snakes, hawks, and bears will be chasing you (or maybe just bumping into you in a bad way). Sometimes you just need to stay away from them, but other times you need their help. Under the alien's mind control, the animals move in predictable ways. You can plan routes for them by carefully pushing crates into their path.&lt;br/&gt;Aliens!&lt;br/&gt;The aliens have installed their contraptions all over the place. There are strange buttons, doors, and even cloning devices. You may meet the aliens themselves, although they certainly prefer not to be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
