							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Living City Player&#039;s Guide to the Meta-campaign Options</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Living City!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Ravens Bluff is home to the largest community of adventurers in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. As such, there is always a flurry of activity as this adventuring group goes here, does this and that and comes home victorious. However not all adventurers are out and about on a daily basis. Some of them have real jobs, commitments and organizations that they have pledged time too. This handbook details some of those organizations and activities as the Living City directors and coordinators have restructured them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is far from all-inclusive, it is hoped that this gives you a basic idea and understanding of what the new look of the organizations and activities are and how you can interact with them in the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
