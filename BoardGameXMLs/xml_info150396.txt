			<description>Free RPG Day 2013 Character for use with Shadows of a Black Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a bounty hunting job, fellow clansman Lar&amp;rsquo;omx betrayed and humiliated Tray'Essek, which according to his beliefs &amp;ldquo;zeroed out&amp;rdquo; his jagannath points, denying him a place of honor in Trandoshan society and in the afterlife. The only way to restore his lost points is to kill the one who did this to him. Tray'Essek has devoted his life ever since to killing Lar'omx&amp;hellip;and making sure that nobody else kills him first.
