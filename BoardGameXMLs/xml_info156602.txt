			<description>Master burglars gather around a set of blueprints to plan an epic heist. As play escalates through the night, it&amp;rsquo;s a race to reach a specific dollar value, or survive with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grid based strategy game for 2-4 players is all about movement and bartering. Walls, doorways and windows of structures all affect line of sight and movement, with security guards roaming everywhere trying to thwart your progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mix this with a heavy dose of bartering, as co-operation with other players may be the only way to steal certain objects, and your are left with lots of satisfying take that moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
