			<description>&amp;ldquo;Simulates a car chase between the Law and a Fugitive. Winning: The Fugitive wins if the Law does not catch him at the end of 7 turns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck with seven types of cards: Investigation, Fugitive, Chase, Escape, Capture, and Location. At the start of each turn the players fill their hands up to ten cards, with the option to discard and redraw up to five. The remainder of the turn consists of up to three phases of card play - the Search Phase, Chase Phase, and Escape Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn ends with any Phase that the Law player loses. The Law player must win a series of all three Phases to capture the Fugitive and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
