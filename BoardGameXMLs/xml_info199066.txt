							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farjavad Village</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a bit more than a day&amp;rsquo;s journey I reached the small town Farjvad. It is a bit small for being called a town, closer to the coast we&amp;rsquo;d probably just call it a village, but here in the middle of the large forest it is as large as a town will get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you just need a map of a village, something to use while your players travel. Or maybe a place from where they can start out on their adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a map of a small village called Farjvad. You will get one map of just the village with numbers placed on different buildings, and also a player handout with a short story describing what the different numbers are. So let the adventure begin&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
