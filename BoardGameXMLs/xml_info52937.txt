			<description>subtitle: Adventures in Tabloid World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;  Pandemonium is a role playing game that takes place in the weird world of the Tabloids - those tacky looking newspapers you see in the supermarket but are afraid to buy because you don't want your friends to think you actually believe Elvis is still alive, or that evil aliens from a far galaxy have come to Earth to kidnap our women. So you sneak a peek while you're waiting in the checkout line but never actually get up the courage to buy a copy, because what would the neighbors say?&lt;br/&gt;  Well, here's your chance to find out what you've been missing!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained in my copy are two newsprint items - the &amp;quot;Weekly Weird News&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;USA Alive&amp;quot;. Not sure if these were included in the original book or promos that I picked up at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
