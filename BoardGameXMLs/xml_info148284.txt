							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">imagine I Can... Catch a Pirate!</name>
									
			<description>The small games in the imagine I Can... collection of mini-games-in-a-tin are geared at young children 3 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catch a Pirate! plays 2 to 5. The game contains 27 pirate cards in three colors, a colour die, a pirate die and a pirate die, as well as a wooden pirate captain figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After placing the captain in the middle of the table, arrange all 27 pirate cards face up around him to form a square island. Players take turns rolling the three dice. As the dice are rolled, players try to be the first to grab the card or cards that corresponds to the dice roll. If the pirate die shows the pirate captain, players make a grab for the pirate figure. The players that grabs the captain may choose any card of the table, then returns the captain to the center of the table. If the card that corresponds to the dice roll has already been taken for the table, the dice are passed to the next player. Game ends when a player collects 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For beginners or very young players, remove the pirate die and wooden captain from play and match cards to the number and colour dice only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
