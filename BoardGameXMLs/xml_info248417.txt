			<description>A card game version of Trap the Cap. Players can either claim a stack or play a card. Card can be played on a stack if it is the same number, or if it shares a color with the top card and is higher. Stack can be claimed if it is a player's turn and his card is on top of stack. After all cards have been played, points are scored based on the number of cards players claimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
