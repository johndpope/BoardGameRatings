							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Football</name>
									
			<description>Game in The New Book of Games, circa 1950.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who wins the toss begins the game, by placing the &amp;ldquo;Ball&amp;rdquo; on the circle of his colour in the centre of the field. He then throws the dice and moves the ball along the line opposite the number thrown. The same player continues to throw until the ball is lost to an opponent by being kicked on to a circle of the opposing colour.&lt;br/&gt;When the ball is kicked out of play it is placed on the goal-keeper&amp;rsquo;s circle, and he takes the resultant goal kick.&lt;br/&gt;After a goal has been scored, the ball is kicked off by the side which has lost the goal, and the game restarted as in rule 1.&lt;br/&gt;A fixed time for playing should be settled before the game begins, and it is won by the side which scores the largest number of goals within that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
