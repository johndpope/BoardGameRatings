			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eager to establish yourself as adventurers, you accepted an offer from the famous Captain Mortensen to sail as crew on his renowned merchant ship - Endeavour. And the pay is good too &amp;ndash; 100gp up front and the same again at the end of the voyage. It&amp;rsquo;s only now that you are out at sea and can look around the abandoned crew quarters that you realise that apart from Captain Mortensen himself, you are the only crew on board...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-shot 5e adventure for 1st or 2nd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
