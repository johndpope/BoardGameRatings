			<description>ISB - The Indian School of Business - is a premier B-school (top 50 global schools as per Financial Times) and Atrium was designed to celebrate ISB's 10th anniversary and make players (re)live that experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To graduate from ISB requires 32 academic credits. However, there is more to ISB life than academics alone. The 1 year long flagship Post Graduate Program has parties, student clubs, networking opportunities etc. In Atrium, the objective is to get to 32 points through a combination of academic courses, clubs, parties, and life@ISB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on die roll, players accumulate time which they can use to collect academic, personal, or networking hours. Hours are traded for courses, clubs, parties, and life@ISB cards in a race to be the first to get to 32 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
