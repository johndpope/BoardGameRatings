			<description>Ruff and Reddy have agreed to test Professor Flipnoodle's Pocket&lt;br/&gt;Rocket. At blast off, something goes terribly wrong and the rocket spins wildly out of control, heading off into deep space.&lt;br/&gt;It crash lands on a planet inhabited by small blue aliens known as Lilli-Punies. Some of these have decided to go exploring on a nearby planet and have become either lost or captured.&lt;br/&gt;The Lilli-Punies kidnap Ruff and Reddy and tell them that the only way to regain their freedom is for Ruff to go and rescue all the missing aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without much of a choice the Lilli-Punies take him to the planet where their friends are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the inlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
