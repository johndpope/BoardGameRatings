			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glycolysis &amp;amp; the Krebs Cycle is a simple LARP implementation used in high-school or collegiate-level courses to teach complex principles of metabolism in eukaryotic organisms.  Play takes place during a single class period.  The instructor provides basic &amp;quot;goals&amp;quot;, and the students are then left to reach the goal within the constraints of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are assigned roles of named molecules/reactions, which have (somewhat anthropomorphic) goals and tasking.  Play takes place in several simultaneously-running phases, with some sub-set of players moving from place to place during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in &amp;quot;Increasing Conceptual Understanding of Glycolysis &amp;amp; the Krebs Cycle Using Role-Play&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;The American Biology Teacher&amp;quot;, Volume 70, Number 3, March 2008, pages 163-168.  The article includes a description of the game as well as a learning outcomes analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
