			<description>This is 4 games in 1 box, all relating to 36 famous artists and their artworks which hang in the White House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four games which can be played with the two sets of 36 tiles with images from he paintings are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory: 2 or more players; using 72 cards and standard rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go Collecting: 4 or more players; a memory and recognition game where the winner ends up holding the most numbers of pairs which are earned by hand management and visual identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name The Painting: 2 or more players; a flashcards-type game where one player holds up the 36 cards one at a time, and the players are expected to identify the artist and title of the work. The winner is the player with the most cards at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bingo: 2 to 4 players; using cards and the master sheet with detailed info about the paintings (each column has a number 1-4) and a die. The die is rolled to determine which columns belong to which players, and players take turn trying to pick a random card from one of 6 stacks of 12 and matching it with a painting in that column. If there is a match, the player places the tile in that column atop the painting face down. If the drawn tile is not a match, it is returned to the bottom of the same stack. The winner is the first to complete his or her column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
