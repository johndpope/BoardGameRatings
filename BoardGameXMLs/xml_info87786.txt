							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">S.L.O.POLY</name>
									
			<description>Short for &amp;quot;San Luis Obispopoly&amp;quot;, S.L.O.Poly markets itself as a Monopoly derivative, but actually has significant rules changes. Instead of the standard Monopoly board layout, the game has 45 properties. Each property costs $5,000, and the rent for each property is $1,000 times the number of properties next to it owned by the same player (so as more properties are owned in a row the rent goes up). Once all of the properties have been purchased from the bank, players can buy property chains from one another. The other major change is the concept of &amp;quot;marriage&amp;quot;. When two players become land on the same square, they become married. Later, if you are married and land on your spouse's square, you sue for divorce and talk half of their property. If you are married and land on the single players square, the marriage gets annuled and the player gets sent to &amp;quot;Morrow Rock&amp;quot; (the game's equivalent to jail).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
