							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mor-Fun Stock Exchange Game</name>
									
			<description>In 1936, the Universal Games Company of St. Louis, Mo. published the Mor-Fun Stock Exchange game. It was a bit out of the ordinary as the game board was made of 1/4&amp;quot; thick pressed board stock and had a long heavy metal spinner that spun on bearings. The lowest cost 'Home Model' sold for $5, which was a lot for a game in the 1930s. By comparison, the very popular game of Monopoly retailed for $2.00.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was no scrip or play money with the game, the only trading was done with stock shares. The players trade stocks; the amount traded and the profit is determined by spinning the metal spinner then throwing the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is assigned a player number and in turn is a 'buyer' and spins the indicator bar.  The player whose number the indicator lands on is the 'seller'.  The number of stock shares will be shown under the players number where the indicator stops.  The 'seller' then rolls the dice to determine the amount of profit the 'buyer' must pay for the stock shares. Multiply the number thrown on the dice by the number of shares to be transacted equals the amount of shares the 'buyer' must pay the 'seller'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, there are 'Futures', Margins', and the 'Pit' where players may be required to put shares of stock that can subsequently be won by any player as described in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who acquires the most stock at the end of the game wins.  A player who runs out of stocks is eliminated from the game and play continues to an agreed upon time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no scrip or game money, all transactions are completed with shares of stock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
