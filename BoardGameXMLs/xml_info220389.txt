			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the skies with different levels. You start with the realm being invaded and 3 siblings must overcome the loss of their father to take back their kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a turn-based game with resource management and RPG element. The characters are one or more of 4 classes. Combatants that you use to protect yourself and gain back sectors. Mechanics that can fortify sectors and craft items. Leaders who help take over sectors for resources, once conquered. They can also use a special Militia skill that can depreciate and hold back enemy armies. Finally Academics who can heal and fortify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is based on attack values and then dice rolls. You come up against different enemies, some of whom can taunt and focus damage on them, others can heal. Others again are warlords that try to spread across the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
