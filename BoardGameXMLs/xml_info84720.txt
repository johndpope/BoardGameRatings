							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Matrix Iterations</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;What is The Matrix Iterations?&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, unlike the Matrix itself, one can be told about The Matrix Iterations. It is a roleplaying game that allows players to explore the possibilities inherent in the Wachowski Brothers&amp;rsquo; rich setting. It gives the players options for many stories, set before, during and after the events shown in the films and the computer game Enter the Matrix. In fact, it is possible with The Matrix Iterations to visit the era of previous iterations of the Matrix, as well as to explore the world after Neo&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice, which we glimpse briefly at the end of Matrix Revolutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Matrix Iterations uses Guardians of Order&amp;rsquo;s Tri-Stat dX system. This universal game system is simple and elegant, yet complex enough to handle all the permutations we see in the Matrix movies, comics and games. This game functions at a d8 level, and uses 2d8 to resolve tests. For further information, please see the Tri-Stat dX rulebook Tri-Stat dX: Core System Role-Playing Game[/thing].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
