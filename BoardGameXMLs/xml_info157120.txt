			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Darkclaw Forest, amid the sluggish waters of the Greater Gurden River, stands the village of Riverburg. Set upon thick stilts driven deep into the riverbed, the village sprawls across several stout wooden platforms and serves as a sanctuary for those daring the surrounding forest or searching for the nearby Moaning Caves. A friendly, if isolated place, the village is home to the Rivermen's Guild who protect travellers from the depredations of vicious river pirates lurking somewhere in the nearby woodland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
