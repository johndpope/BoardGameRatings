			<description>A game for the 2013 2-p PnP Game Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A worker-placement game in which the two players are competing Funeral Home operators. The goal is to satisfy the funerary wishes of the deceased through the collection of coffins, cemetery plots, and headstones. The harder to please the client is, the closer you are to satisfying the deceased's wishes, and the faster you can accomplish it, the more points you're awarded at their funeral. But, should you fail to keep them happy, your customers might crawl up from their tombs to complain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from standard worker-placement fare, this game utilizes a unique time mechanic that dictates when and where players may place their workers. More difficult actions require more time to complete, and players must balance the use of their time against the monetary costs of their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
