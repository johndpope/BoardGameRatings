			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capconia was a peaceful kingdom until the Seed of Wisdom was snatched by the evil warlock Gordian.  Gordian infused his minions with the power of the Seed of Wisdom and sent them among the Capconians, forcing them to answer very difficult questions or be eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four heroes emerged to battle the minions, defeat Gordian, and reclaim the Seed of Wisdom--the fighter, the wizard, the amazon, and the ninja.  Each character has one special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in easy, normal, or hard mode.  Characters begin with 12,8, or 4 quarters (US$0.25) which are spent to regain vitality (hit points).  Play progresses through nine stages, each a specific location in Capconia.  Stages increase in difficulty.  Players move through stages by rolling a die.  Combat is resolved by the use of trivia cards (from any popular trivia card game)--correct answers result in damage to the opponent, incorrect answers result in loss of vitality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RPG game is designed to mimic the Capcom arcade game &amp;quot;Quiz &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
