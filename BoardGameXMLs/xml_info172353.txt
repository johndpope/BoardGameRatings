							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reshape</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;In Reshape you rotate a square in the centre of the screen to line up with approaching triangles so they can connect neatly with each of the square's flat edges.  If you collide with a moving triangle as you are rotating your shape, any connected triangles are lost and you revert to a plain square.  If you collide with another triangle in this state, you lose.  Each time you manage to connect with four triangles and form a larger square, it shrinks back to the standard size.  The goal is to go on as long as possible before being defeated by the increasing pace of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
