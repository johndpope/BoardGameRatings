			<description>THIS IS A PRINT AND PLAY GAME.  DOWNLOAD IS FREE AND ALL REQUIRED FILES ARE AVAILABLE BELOW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vikings: Long Ships in the Mist is a Euro game with historical flavor, covering the heart of the Viking Age, 800 to 950 AD.  Players must carefully balance the two primary options they have each turn: plundering for quick riches; or attempting to settle and control provinces on the map.  Areas that are settled and controlled by a player produce income and are worth victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is simple.  Combat entails a little more chrome than most Euro games, and features what simulations usually refer to as a Combat Resolution Table, where a roll of two dice is cross-referenced on a table listing the attacker's odds and various potential results, including the possibility of success from a low-odds Berserker attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major feature of the game is a random events table, which guarantees no two games will be alike.  The list of possible events range from plagues and enticing defection by an opposing player's unit, to significant historical events like the division of the Carolingian Empire, the development of French tactics against Viking attacks, the Magyar invasions, Alfred the Great's revolt against Viking rule, and Otto the Great's attempts to expel Vikings from areas of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interest in history is the main reason I got into gaming.  So even non-simulation games like &amp;quot;Imperial&amp;quot; appeal to me in a way fantasy games do not. I designed VIKINGS with two goals in mind - I wanted a game that takes no longer to play than most Euro games, and one that offers more historical references and flavor (and maybe a measure of historical plausibility).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please leave feedback on the forum with suggestions for potential revisions.  Hope you enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
