			<description>Game developped by the former Danish football player Knud Lundberg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    One board, divided into four quarters (A, B, C and D)&lt;br/&gt;    One set of pieces, which are six coloured tokens (Green, Red, Yellow or Blue) and 30 Black. The coloured markers have arrows which is important to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to catch the other players snakes, even by hitting it's head or by trapping it:&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning each player chooses his colour, with each their Quarter, (s)he then places the coloured pieces in the shape of a snake (here the arrows is important, as they shows the snake's direction).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players hide this information and the first player places a black marker on each of the other players Quarters of his/her own board where (s)he believes that the other player's snake(s) are located; the other players place a black marker on the same spots. If a snake is hit it have to be anounced and the black marker is placed under the coloured. When the third piece is placed, the players move their snake one step ahead, and the next player goes. When it is your turn you move your snake one space - but you are not allowed to place the head where there already is a black spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who get's his snake closed in, or hit in the head is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is from the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
