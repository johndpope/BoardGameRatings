			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first Gothic and the first Immersive supplement for the Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're thinking of running a Gothic or Immersive game and want to know how that might work, or playing in one and want some more quests and ideas for the genre around, you'll love Fortitude: the Legendary 139!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's got:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    all-new Fortitude content!&lt;br/&gt;    a brand new lifepath, suitable for Fairy Tale, Gothic, and Immersive play!&lt;br/&gt;    dinosaurs!&lt;br/&gt;    quest sets suitable for the Gothic and Immersive genres and&lt;br/&gt;    Gothic stories (four of them) and Immersive stories (four of those too), suitable for playing through as a member of the legendary 139 or, with a tweak or two, as just about anyone... including trips to Venus, the Outside, and the Moon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, on the day the old sun died, a ship sailed in to Fortitude. There are a few mysteries around it. Nobody ever found the captain. More than a few passengers remember their deaths, and most of them remember being rather older. But in the end that wasn't what made the ship a legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dying angel of the sun, before she had entirely departed from the world, stopped to walk among them. To share a certain portion of her light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of them will claim to have been ordinary people. Many will even claim to be ordinary people. But the ship is a legend because in the years since the angel of the sun gave her parting gifts to them, each and every one of them has proven themselves to be extraordinary, over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortitude: the Legendary 139 is the story of the passengers who came in upon that ship. They're pretty cool. They've got neat system bits. And as for their lives ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They got a pretty good deal, I think. Their lives have had some ups and downs, some struggles and some pains, some close shaves and some scary adventures, certainly... but in the end that's just the way life is, you know?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underneath it all, they've got something even better than the deep and filling richness that is life in Fortitude. Underneath it all, the hidden currents of their life are bound to, connected, with something precious; something holy; ... with something good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's your chance to join them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
