			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little more than three centuries ago, humanity woke up and climbed carelessly out its little blue and white cradle. Less than a decade ago, we earthlings blundered into the dark beyond the cr&amp;egrave;che of our solar system's gravity well to learn that Einstein was wrong. Travel to distant stars is difficult and dangerous, but possible&amp;mdash;and very, very profitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We emerged onto the galactic stage to find ourselves largely ignored by the societies that inhabit the ruins of the Grand Empire. It turns out that we of Earth are nothing special, scarcely worth noticing at all. A hundred or more races eke out their existence in the galaxy that we still quaintly refer to as the Milky Way. Most of them think it cute that we still call our home star &amp;ldquo;the Sun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have some catching up to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a jumper, a risk-taker, a fortune hunter. Become an alt with a genetically engineered body purpose-built to conquer the stars. Become a cog with cybernetic enhancements that give you a unique edge over the competition. Become a borg with a powerful robot body and just enough humanity left to distinguish you from a pure machine. Become a psi with the ability to unravel and reweave the underlying fabric of the universe to your liking. Or take to the stars as a vinnie with just the DNA, brains, and tenacity that you were born with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show 'em all that Homo sapiens still has what it takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refuse to be ignored. Leap into the void. Cross the chasm to strange new stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claim your birthright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of Starcrossed is based on Fate Core. The Fate Core book is required to play. Starcrossed is fully compatible with other Fate Core products. All minor variations are documented in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
