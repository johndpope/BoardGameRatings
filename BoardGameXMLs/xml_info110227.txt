			<description>From the Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;Foreword&lt;br/&gt;Hello reader, and welcome to Neoclassical Geek Revival (NGR). NGR is a fantasy heartbreaker RPG; it does what you would expect out of a traditional fantasy role-playing game. While NGR will work as a complete game I have no doubt it will rarely be played as such; This game is designed expecting that you will most likely see things in this game you would like to remove and plug into your own game rather than playing it whole cloth.&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed to simulate low magic fantasy, but most mechanics are equally at home in a science fiction, action or post-apocalyptic game. The rules are designed to be as setting neutral as possible while solving commonly held gripes and bad tropes. In the writing of this game I used the following as guiding principles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) Funny dice are fun on their own merits&lt;br/&gt;2.) Choices to make are better than problems to solve&lt;br/&gt;3.) You are already familiar with role playing games&lt;br/&gt;4.) You are not looking for gritty realism, but do enjoy the presence of the &amp;lsquo;fourth wall&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;5.) Gaming is meant to be entertainment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features many useful rules for plugging into your own game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Improved stealth and social conflict resolution systems that give equal strategic depth as combat in most games. This means it is not a one roll resolution and that all classes can participate.&lt;br/&gt;- An improved &amp;quot;build a class&amp;quot; section. Simple and easy to use its the &amp;quot;Pie&amp;quot; system.&lt;br/&gt;- A distinct difference between priest miracles and wizard magic. Both are better mechanically than what you will find in most role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;- A simple and yet useful encumbrance system. Easy to plug into any game where you don't want players doing complicated math, but also don't want characters carrying everything.&lt;br/&gt;- An improved HP system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
