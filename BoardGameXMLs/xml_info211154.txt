			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs are deep in the dungeon and have just defeated a terrifying dragon! As they bandage their wounds, and ready their fallen friend&amp;rsquo;s bodies for return to the surface, they look around and ask &amp;ldquo;So what treasure&amp;rsquo;s in the dragon&amp;rsquo;s hoard, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At that point, unless the GM has prepared a detailed list of treasure, the PCs get (possibly) literally tons of coins and some generic magic items. (After all, most GMs have better things to do with their prep time than generate descriptions for stuff the PCs will likely sell).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasures &amp;amp; Trinkets: Gemstones &amp;amp; Art Objects banishes these problems by presenting scores of bespoke art objects and detailed gemstone notes ready for use in virtually any GM&amp;rsquo;s campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is designed for use with the 5th edition of the world's most popular role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
