			<description>Welcome to the swashbuckling Caribbean, young buccaneer! It is a world of savage danger and merciless pirates. Take command of your own Flagship, arm it to the teeth with powerful cannons, and pile as many gold doubloons into your cargo hold as you can! The New world is yours for the taking, but beware there are other ambitious adventurers who would dare try and take what is rightfully yours. Forge your own destiny and make history on The Spanish Main!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cutthroats, you and up to five other players vie for control of key towns in the Spanish Main. Players utilize one of seven skills to attack each other's ships and towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships move by use of a 12 sided die. But players can only move in certain directions on the board, which can be changed after reaching a port. Players that land on another player's port must pay port fees to that player or try to conquer the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat takes place when a player passes another on the high seas and decides to attack. Each player rolls a 10 sided die and adds to that number, the number of cannon upgrades they have. Best two out of three wins the fight. Losers are forced to lose an upgrade, and pay a ransom to the victorious player as well as being sent to the nearest town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are eliminated if they owe more doubloons than they have in their hold. Last player with money wins. A secondary way of winning is to conquer all five towns and hold them for a full round of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
