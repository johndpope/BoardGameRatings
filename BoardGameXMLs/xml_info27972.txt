			<description>Petra, Paul &amp;amp; Co. is an educational game about decisions made in the local politics to improve your home town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Players act as local parties and try to get enough influence from the other players to fulfill their agendas.&lt;br/&gt;If an agenda is fulfilled, the corresponding part of the gaming board is flipped over to show the improvement. The game ends if a player has fulfilled all of his agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their turn the players move on the board according to a die roll. They can change direction in 90 degrees but only once in their turn. If they get to another player or to a space that is connected to their agenda, they collect votes. if they get to the library or the newspaper, the players can answer a trivia question to collect another vote. The votes are collected on a separate board, witch shows the game progress. If a players stops at the town hall, a poll is executed. The wining agenda gets as many votes, as players take part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a clear educational game with easy mechanism for quick explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
