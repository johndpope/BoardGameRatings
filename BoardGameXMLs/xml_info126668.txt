			<description>Due to such high demand for &amp;lsquo;BrainBox The World&amp;rsquo; we have added another game and another 20 cards to the amazing BrainBox. This fabulous game includes twenty new countries. Did you know the capital of Mauritius is Port Louis or that .bb is the internet domain for Barbados?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players    1 or more,&lt;br/&gt;Ages    8 to 88,&lt;br/&gt;Contains    20 illustrated cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
