							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlegroup Modern Warfare Rules</name>
									
			<description>Battlegroup has been written because of modern wargamers, dissatisfaction with the commercial rules available. Battlegroup has been&lt;br/&gt;play-tested over the last few years and were used successfully between 1997 and 2008 in the Ultramodern World Wargaming&lt;br/&gt;Championships, the 1997 Royal Air Force Wargames Association Championships and the modern competition at Roll Call 2001-2007.&lt;br/&gt;The feedback from all those experienced players helped the rules evolve into this edition.&lt;br/&gt;Although these rules offer nothing revolutionary in the field of wargames rules you will find Battlegroup faster and easier to follow&lt;br/&gt;than previous modern rules, rules that due to the complexities of modern warfare ended up either too complicated or far too simplistic.&lt;br/&gt;Battlegroup is designed to give the feel of modern combat, taking into account all the latest technologies being fielded, yet still remain&lt;br/&gt;an enjoyable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
