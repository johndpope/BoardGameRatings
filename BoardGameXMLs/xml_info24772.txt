			<description>&amp;quot;Experience this exciting card game with the entire family!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an &amp;quot;Oh Hell!&amp;quot; knockoff with just a few minor changes.  The deck is a standard 52, nicely done in four bold, primary colored suits and clear numbering 1 through 13.  There are also four &amp;quot;Back Alley&amp;quot; cards that serve as ubertrump wild cards. Prior to bidding, each player may exchange one of the cards in their hand for one of the cards not dealt, drawn blindly in turn order.  The scoring is also changed.  If the bid is met, you score three points for tricks bid and taken, plus one point for tricks greater than the bid.  If the bid isn't met, it's minus one point for each trick missed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with clear rules that also give instructions for additional players.  A nice score pad in also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
