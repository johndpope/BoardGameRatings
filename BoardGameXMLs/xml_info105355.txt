							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">March Attack: Napoleonic Wargame Rules</name>
									
			<description>From their website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleonic Wargames Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;March Attack are presented as an 80 page A4, full colour, perfect bound book. The rules are designed to allow players to fight large battles with battalion sized units in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command and control, orders and morale for large formations are combined with easy to learn tactical game mechanics so that battles of a Corps or more a side &lt;br/&gt;can easily be fought by a few players during an evening. Each unit on the table represents a battalion of infantry, regiment of cavalry or battery of artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ground scale of 1&amp;quot; to 60 yards, one turn representing 20 minutes and fast paced strategic movement rules mean that battles play out at a realistic rate. Combat is dealt with in a manner that allows large numbers of units to be fielded and the interaction between strategic movement and tactical combat allows for a fast paced game that keeps a good level of detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven different training and morale levels combined with the historical strength of a unit introduces the concept of &amp;lsquo;Combat Value&amp;rsquo;. This ties together all of the tactical rules and ensures that troop quality, more than just luck or buckets of dice, plays an important part in every battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
