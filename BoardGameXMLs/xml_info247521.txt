							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Chips</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life in 2068&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the relatively banal existences of Joe and Jane Uniform, the world of Citizens Divided is filled with unique and interesting folks, working on both sides of the corporate divide, in order to rebuild a broken world, strengthen their own futures, or support a personal agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give in to Sensation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Chips is a collection of Three mini-adventures for Citizens Divided. In these scenarios the characters delve into the seedy world of Sensuals. Each scenario deals with Sensuals as a plot device to propel the characters into an adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scenarios can function for characters of any Professional Edge on either side of the corporate divide. In scenarios involving finding a bad chip, any character with a Skill Chip Reader could encounter the chip by mistake when attempting to slot a new skill chip. Perhaps one of the characters is a Doctor who finds out about the chip from a patient. The most likely or common scenario would be that one of the characters, or one of their associates, is a Sense Chip user, and slots the chip looking for a good time. Instead, they find nothing but trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final scenario could theoretically target anyone. It is a great chance to pull together characters from wildly different backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Seeds, System Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Chips contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Three One-Sheet Adventure style scenarios focused on Sense Chips.&lt;br/&gt;    Expanded Sense Chip rules&lt;br/&gt;    Sesne Chip Addiction rules&lt;br/&gt;    A dark look fiften minutes into the future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
