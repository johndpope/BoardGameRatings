			<description>There are 18 little poles, their tips are in six different colors. These are stuck into a special tray. A turn works like this: A player rolls three color dice and pulls out a stick. If the color matches one of the dice, he or she gets a chip and the game passes on to the next player who has to find a stick in one of the remaining two colors, etc. If a stick doesn't match any of the dice, a chip has to be paid to the bank, the stick is put into the tray (on the other of the two sides of it). A player who can pull out the stick matching the last die gets all chips from the bank. The sticks are then put back into the tray, on the side which currently has less sticks. The winner is the player with most chips at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
