			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Price Immortality?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you could avoid living in a severely diseased, injured, or dying body by having your brain transplanted into a durable, powerful artificial body, would you? Even if you knew you wouldn't have the full range of your human senses and sensibilities? What if you could eschew the organic altogether, and have your consciousness uploaded, without interruption, into a computer that would inhabit one of these powerful, durable bodies? It would still be you, there is continuation of consciousness, but it would be... different. No longer, strictly speaking, human. Would you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a comprehensive set of rules for exploring these questions in The Victory System.  Includes new Mechanica, new Equipment, and a collection of Full Conversion Frames ready for a living brain, or even an intellect converted into data, to occupy.  Exist as a super soldier, a living tank, a mechanical super-hero, or make a bid for true immortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just be careful... there's always a price, and the money is only the beginning.  What would you be willing to leave behind, if the rest of you could carry forward into the future?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
