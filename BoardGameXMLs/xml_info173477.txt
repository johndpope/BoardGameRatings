			<description>From Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a blistering hot day, the temperature so high you could easily cook an egg on the hood of a car. And in fact, that&amp;rsquo;s what a lot of people are doing, cooking food in the sun while scrambling to buy some cold refreshment to accompany the quick meal before the announcer&amp;rsquo;s voice fills the air again. Everywhere you go there are crowds of laughing, shouting, and excited people. The air is filled with the odor of burnt rubber, exhaust, and high octane fuel. The wind thunders at this altitude, but its nothing compared to the roar of precision engines, the rumble of heavily-modified cars shooting past at over a hundred miles per hour. Welcome to the &amp;ldquo;Death Derby&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Styx is known as the most populous &amp;ldquo;city&amp;rdquo; on the Twisted Earth. Here almost anything and everything can be had, from rare finds found at Flea&amp;rsquo;s Market, to exotic shows at Moe&amp;rsquo;s Moving Picture Emporium, to fellowship and hospitality at the Temple of Unending Joy. But Styx is also known for its entertainments, none more popular than the death-defying races held atop Red Rock Mountain, part of the local tradition known as the &amp;ldquo;Death Derby&amp;rdquo;. Racers from all over come to risk the infamous Red Rock Mountain course, a dizzying descent down the mountainside, along the cliffs of the Grand Canyon itself, through mutant-infested camps and minefields, across a dried alkali lakebed, and back up the mountain for a torturous hour-long ride. During the Death Derby anything goes; vehicle-to-vehicle combat, boarding actions, and plain old treachery. The winner is the first one to make it to the finish line. The losers&amp;hellip; generally tend to end up dead along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
