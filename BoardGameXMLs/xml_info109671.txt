			<description>Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems is the title of a side-scrolling video game based on the events of Marvel Comics' series, Infinity Gauntlet. Adam Warlock calls upon Earth's greatest super heroes to seek out the Infinity Gems before they fall into the wrong hands. In a series, the game is considered a spiritual sequel to X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse. This game is not related in any way to the arcade game Marvel Super Heroes, despite the similar premise and the fact that Capcom published and developed both games. However, Capcom in fact recycled some of the sprites to make the fighting arcade game. Examples of that are the character portraits of Spider-Man, Captain America and Iron Man in the Select Screen, along with Blackheart and Dr. Doom battle sprites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player plays each level as one of five superheroes - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, or Hulk - as they battle through various locations around the globe and even outer space. Each character's health bar is separate and carries over between missions - healing can only be done by picking up items in the levels or using healing items picked up during missions. When a character falls, they must be revived individually with the appropriate item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After investigating an area, the player may or may not be rewarded with one of the gem resulting in a restart of the entire game. Only two can be picked up during the first four missions, one is picked up in the following mission, and then two more are randomly received in two of the four following levels. The last gem is only received upon defeating Thanos, thus completing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special level in the game is The Avengers Mansion where you can practice fighting certain bosses of the game. Sometimes, you will be rewarded with an item for succeeding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character can also execute special attacks with command input similar to fighting games, but slightly simplified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playable heroes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Captain America: Balanced in both attack and speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shield Throw: Forward, Forward, Y (Side Throw) OR Up, Up, Y (Upward Throw) OR Down, Down, Y (Downward Throw)&lt;br/&gt;    Shield Charge: Down, Forward, Y (Charges horizontally with his shield at front)&lt;br/&gt;    Air Combo: Y, Y, Y in Air (Kicks enemies thrice in air)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Iron Man: Powerful but quite slow, can use a variety of projectiles and also has double jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repulsor Beam: Down, Forward, Y (Charges a beam that travels horizontally and knockbacks enemies - can also be used in air)&lt;br/&gt;    Shoulder Grenade: Down, Down, Y (Ducks and fires a single grenade downwards that has a small explosion radius)&lt;br/&gt;    Flying Uppercut: Up+Y (Boosts upwards with a flying uppercut, causing multiple hits)&lt;br/&gt;    Body Slam: Forward, Forward, Y in Air (Charges forward while flying, causing multiple hits)&lt;br/&gt;    Air Combo: Y, Y, Y in Air (Punches the enemy twice and fires a beam downwards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hulk: The biggest character in the game, being the strongest and also the slowest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamma Charge: Forward, Forward, Y (Charges forward with a headbutt)&lt;br/&gt;    Flying Slam: Down, Forward, Y (Punches upwards and jump with an overhead attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spider-Man: Very agile, but also the weakest character in terms of attack power.
