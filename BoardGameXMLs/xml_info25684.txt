			<description>From the back cover of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fast Game of Vocabulary, Luck, &amp;amp; Action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love playing with words but think word games are too slow? &lt;br/&gt;Then start your mental engines and get ready for Scrosswords, the &amp;quot;un-bored&amp;quot; word game with no board, no waiting, and no end to the fun.&lt;br/&gt;Each round pits one player against all others in a race to discover words in random letter tiles. When you're the Wordsmith, you roll five dice: The black dice determine how many tiles you get - from 4 to 24 - and the red die gives you a chance at a bonus category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The timer starts as soon as you flip over your tiles. You've got 2 minutes and 30 seconds to form as many words as possible, crossword-style, and earn points for them. Meanwhile all other players - the Scavengers - are furiously writing down all the words you're missing. At the end of the round, tally up you points and see whose words are worth the most!&lt;br/&gt;It takes a combination of luck, skill, and fast reflexes to score big at Scrosswords. And because every turn is different and everyone plays at once, the excitement never slows down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
