			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Blaster! is an attempt to recreate the magic once held by Traveller. It is a hard science fiction game with a simple and internally consistent set of core rules and game mechanics. Although it is supported by a detailed background these rules can be quickly adapted to any SF universe you could want to devise (or borrow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game&amp;rsquo;s focus is on the extraordinary Heroes that the players create. You will quickly discover that the characters this system encourages are larger than life and almost cinematic in quality. Hey, if you want to play a down-on-his-luck, droid service engineer that&amp;rsquo;s up to you. Personally I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to play a High-G World, former Corporate Marine on the run from the Southern Cross Organisation, who&amp;rsquo;s battling to prevent Ancient Technology from falling into the hands of rogue AI Terminators. Or perhaps a gorgeous Belter Star-pilot trying to break the bank at an Orbital Casino while her crew ambush an alien courier. Or even a veteran Farsider Trader leading his men into the desperate pursuit of Rim Pirates who have his patron&amp;rsquo;s daughter in their evil clutches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is much more Flash Gordon than Star Trek. A universe where small starships abound (for reasons explained below) and a handful of good men can still play a major part in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
