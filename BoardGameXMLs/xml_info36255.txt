			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Battle between  Buzz Lightyear and Evil Emperor Zurg. Takes place in the Buzz Lightyear Universe. Each figure represents a main character or group of lesser characters. Victory: Capture the opposing Leader.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the forces. Each side has sixteen units. The units are rated for hit points, movement, attack range, and special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game.
