							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Argent: Hall Monitor</name>
									
			<description>In Argent: Hall Monitor, a small abstract strategy game that uses the pieces from Argent: The Consortium, students battle over a hallway in Argent University, which is set in the World of Indines universe created by Level 99 Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student has a different power depending on the magic school that student follows, with the school being signified by its color, and your goal is to reach the other side of the hallway with one of your students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing mages from a common pool of available mages. When the mage is placed it enacts whatever power is associated with its school of magic. For example, placing a Sorcery mage will remove an adjacent mage from the board. Other powers are passive, such as the Nature mage which cannot be directly targeted by any enemy mage. Players must use these powers in creative and strategic ways in order to defeat their opponent and make it to the end of the hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
