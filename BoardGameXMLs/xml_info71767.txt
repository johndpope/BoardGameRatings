							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secret of Evermore</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Secret of Evermore is a North American role-playing game  (RPG) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. It was released by Square USA on October 1, 1995, in North America. In February 1996, it saw release in the PAL  territories of Europe and Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story follows a boy and his pet dog as they are inadvertently transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the characters. The player guides both the boy and his shapeshifting dog through Evermore, a world that is composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. Control can be passed between the two characters at will to solve various puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secret of Evermore is unique in that it is the only game developed by Square designers in North America. The game received positive reviews upon its release due to its graphics and gameplay, but was criticized for not being up to the standards of what many reviewers were used to by its developer. The game was designed simultaneously with Seiken Densetsu 3 as a localized sequel to Secret of Mana.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Secret_of_Evermore,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
