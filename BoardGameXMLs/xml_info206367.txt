							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Brimstone: Frontier Doc Hero Pack</name>
									
			<description>A staple of every Old West frontier town, the rough and rugged Frontier Doc has been around and seen things most people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe. Though academic by nature, these crafty and resourceful medical men use their wits and experience to learn the weakness of their enemies, and then cut them to pieces in a fight. While keeping a steady hand and cool head under pressure, a Doc is an expert at bandaging up wounded comrades and cutting off unwanted growths... wherever they may sprout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Frontier Doc is a strong support character with the ability and resources to keep the Hero Posse in tip-top shape when it comes to Wounds, Injuries, and Mutations. Starting with the Doc&amp;rsquo;s Bag, the Frontier Doc is never short on Bandages, and even gains a fantastic bonus when using them. His Field Surgery ability also allows for some much needed Injury/Mutation relief, without the need to find a Doc in Town or worry about it being botched! Of course the Frontier Doc is also no slouch when it comes to battle. Though he doesn&amp;rsquo;t start with any weapons by default (just using his basic Combat to Attack), he can become a powerful hand-to-hand fighter, and retains the ability to use Ranged Weapons as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes Male and Female Frontier Doc miniatures in high-detail resin, two 30mm plastic bases, Frontier Doc Double-Sided Hero Character Sheet, Rulesheet, Frontier Doc Upgrade Chart, Starting Upgrade Cards, and Starting Gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
