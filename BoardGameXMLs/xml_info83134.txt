							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Compleat Alchemist (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridging the realms of science and magic, alchemists of old tried to bend the laws of nature to let them transmute lead into gold, isolate the magical essences of the elements, and perhaps even create artificial life. Now the Compleat Alchemist provides everything you need to bring these versatile historical characters into your game world. Inside, you'll find explanations of alchemic knowledge and skills, lists of alchemic ingredients and their innate properties, and descriptions of a wide variety of items and substances alchemists can create. There's also a special gamemaster's section that covers such topics as the cost of setting up an alchemist's laboratory, the traditional relationship between alchemists and magicians, the use of alchemic products in game play, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now with rules for both skill- and level-based roleplaying systems, this second edition also contains revised and expanded ingredient lists and an all new description of the ultimate alchemic artifact, the philosopher's stone. Whether you've been playing alchemists for years or are just discovering their unique possibilities, The Compleat Alchemist is a reference you'll turn to again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
