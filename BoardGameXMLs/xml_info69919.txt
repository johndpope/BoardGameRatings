			<description>A fan-made card game based on the characters from Project Shrine Maiden (Touhou Project). A two-player versus card game in the style of Magic: the Gathering, as the players play characters, spells and interrupts on each other, trying to bring the opponent's life points down to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back:&lt;br/&gt;Easy to grasp, yet deep! A new card game using the characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new type of card game where the player uses cards depicting all the lovable characters from Project Shrine Maiden, builds his own deck and gets to battle with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
