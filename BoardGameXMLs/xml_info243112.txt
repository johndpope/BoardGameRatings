			<description>Do you dream about being a little K3 danser, joining Marthe, Klaasje and Hanne on stage? It's a lot harder then it seems! You have to learn a lot of dance moves! Do you want to try out? Try to get on the stage first and show of your moves, show that you know all the routings. Learn the dancemoves on the cards on the rotating stage and try to do them in sequence without faults but look out, the further you get the more moves you need to learn.And just when you think you mastered the routing someone might switch up the moves. Welcome to the K3 dance studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roll and move, take that, memory dance game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
