			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Element-ary! presents the heroes and villains from your favorite forgotten Saturday morning superhero cartoon. Three not-so-ordinary people, transformed by a deranged clown, form a team to protect their city from an eclectic collection of bad guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Element-ary! uses the Fate Core system, including the rules for super powers originally found in Venture City Stories. Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find four heroes and five villains with complete stats including aspects, skills, stunts, and powers, along with various NPC mooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Hot-Head, a circus performer infused with flame.&lt;br/&gt;    Big Blue, a scientist transformed into water.&lt;br/&gt;    Earthling, her husband turned into dirt and roots.&lt;br/&gt;    Glob, their daughter, transformed before birth.&lt;br/&gt;    Laffo the Clown, their nemesis.&lt;br/&gt;    Robot Face, an AI bent on wiping out humanity.&lt;br/&gt;    That Ninja, wanted thief with mysterious powers.&lt;br/&gt;    Party Animal, a trickster in many forms.&lt;br/&gt;    Fashionable Ghoul, an immortal grifter after the richest brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout, we also detail the series, its episodes, and the tone of Saturday morning cartoon action. Use the material in It&amp;rsquo;s Element-ary! as you find it or let it serve as inspiration for your own Saturday morning campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
