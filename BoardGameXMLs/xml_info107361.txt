			<description>This is a team trivia game with a betting element (guessing how many answers your own teammates or the other team will get right).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two teams, team white and team black. Team white starts by drawing a card. Each card contains one general question or overall topic (e.g. &amp;quot;Which of these fungi are edible?) and 6 specific questions (in the example above: names of different fungi). The first player of team white announces the general question for the first player of team black to answer. Before the specific questions are read, a die is thrown to determine which of the two teams (the active player's own team or the opponents) has to guess how many correct answers the active player will be able to give. The number of points gained by the active player's team is determined by both the number of correct answers and by how close the team's guess were. (The system for point allocation is a bit complicated; the game comes with a cardboard dial for determining the number of points.) Then the next player in team white has to answer questions and so on, until one of the tams reaches a  previously established numbers of points (40, 50 or 60 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question cards come in three different types: &amp;quot;for all ages&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;young players usually have an advantage&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;more experienced players usually have an advantage&amp;quot;, which allows the players to adjust the level of difficulty. Each player also randomly draws two joker cards, which can be played after the general question has been announced (but before the specific questions are asked) and is then discarded. Joker cards also come in three different types: one allows you to pass on your question to a different member of your team (the &amp;quot;I'd rather you answer&amp;quot; joker), one allows you to take over a question from a member of your team (&amp;quot;I'm an expert in this area, I want to answer this&amp;quot;), and one allows all the team members to answer a question together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
