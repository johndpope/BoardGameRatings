			<description>This two player trick-taking game combines elements of German Whist and Watten and offers scope for strategic play.  At the start of play, one player chooses a trump suit and another chooses &amp;quot;supertrump,&amp;quot; i.e. chooses a single rank of cards (two through Ace) that becomes part of the trump suit and beats all other trumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two stages.  After each of the first 13 tricks the players replenish their hands from a draw deck; each trick won at this stage counts for 1 point.  The second set of 13 tricks is then played out, with each trick won during this stage counting for 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed rules can be found in a forum posting below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
