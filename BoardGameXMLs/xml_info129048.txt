							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Farmer</name>
									
			<description>Dice Farmer is a very fast-playing game of chance, with just enough strategy to make it and interesting.  The game was developed by Tailsteak of Leftover Soup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a pool of dice from four siders to twenty siders in a pool between the players, including d14s, d16s, and d18s. Players have a &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; of dice they throw every turn. Any 1s rolled are returned to the pool. Other dice that singly or in groups total the size of a die available in the pool can add that die to the players hand (ie a rolled 4 and 8 could claim a d12).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last player remaining or first with three d20s in their hand wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
