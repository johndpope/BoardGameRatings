			<description>Players decide on a grand story about who they are and may improve their story by utilizing their story telling skills and over-acting the character they are trying to portray.&lt;br/&gt;As you tell your story, you will be challenged by other players to work some of their &amp;quot;TOPIC TILES or TOPIC CARDS&amp;quot; (depending on the version you have) in to your current story. If you are able to, you will make money (chips), but if not, you will lose coins. Your goal is to make it as hard as possible for the other players to work your topics in to their story by giving them the most challenging topics. Players are guided by their TOPIC cards which they find easy to explain and use for themselves, or tough to imagine an explanation, so they challenge another player which can help you earn extra money or lose it to great story tellers.   Some cards contain blanks which you get to fill in to make your topics as challenging as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quickest minds &amp;amp; most boastful of your group will certainly have an advantage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is concluded when all players vote with their coins and decide who the best story teller was. A great game or activity for acting classes, drama clubs, scouting or camping activities or other educational purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
