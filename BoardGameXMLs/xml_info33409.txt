			<description>Rules from AGPC Archives: The game is played with a deck of Horse Cards with names of horses and numbers 1 to 3 printed on each card. 5 horses are entered in a race (hand), a horse can finish 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. During the race (hand)all players try to form a sequence of horse cards from 1 to 3 in front of them. Beginning with number 1 and then adding 2 and 3 consecutively. A player completing the sequence 1-2-3 ends the hand (race). The winning sequence does not have to be completed with the same horse in all three positions. If a  player does complete the 1-2-3 with the same horse that player becomes the next BANKER. The banker in the game sells and redeems Bank shares and Wager Tickets. All money received from the sale of bank shares and wager tickets is kept in an account. At the end of the game the amount in this account is divided among shareholders with an equal amount being given for each share held. At the beginning of the game players can purchase bank shares which are always redeemable for their face value. Anyone not redeeming purchased bank shares during the game is entitled to a split of whatever money is in the bank at the end of the game. At the beginning of the game (race) players can purchase wager tickets on their favorite horses. Bets are made across the board in all 3 positions and players collect from the bank for how a horse finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play the game the deck of cards is shuffled and then the first player draws a card, if its a number 1 card it is kept face up in front of the player, if its any other card it is discarded play continues until someone has completed the 1 2 3 sequence at which time players holding winning tickets matching names of horses somewhere in the winning sequence are paid off. In other words when the wining sequence happens if you had bet on horse 'Stewball' to finish second on one of your betting cards and the winning sequence actually has 'Stewball' in the #2 position that wage ticket wins money for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
