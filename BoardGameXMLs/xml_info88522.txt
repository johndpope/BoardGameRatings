			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 3200 and mankind's empire lies in ashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jump Gates fell six hundred years ago, severing the links between the myriad worlds of the human diaspora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the long isolation of the Silence falls away as men and women return to the skies above their scattered worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be among them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stars Without Number is a retro-inspired science fiction role playing game influenced by the Old School Renaissance.
