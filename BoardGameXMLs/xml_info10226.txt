			<description>Thunder at the Crossroads: The Battle of Gettysburg July 1-3, 1863&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the back of the box:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the evening of July 1st. 1863, George Gordon Meade mounted his horse for the short ride north to the small Pennsylvania town of Gettysburg. Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities. For the North. it was the beginning of the march which would eventually win the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Powell has completely revised his earlier Thunder at the Crossroads. New scenarios allow more in-depth looks at particular actions of the battle (with smaller map and play times, too). Revised unit and leader ratings allow full integration with the Second Edition Series Rules. Graphics has been upgraded to the latest series standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 200 yards &lt;br/&gt;Units: Brigade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Two 22&amp;quot; X 34&amp;quot; mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;Two countersheets (560 1/2&amp;quot; dual-side printed counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 32 page Civil War Brigade Series rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;Two 20 page game exclusive rule booklets&lt;br/&gt;Two dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 18 Hour Plus&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: High&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
