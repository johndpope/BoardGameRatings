							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Baker&#039;s Dozen of Enchanted Volumes</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an Adventure Path Add-on which is intended to add extra material to Paizo's official adventure paths, in this case volume #27, part four of the Thieves Guild Adventure Path. This is a collection of thirteen enchanted volumes that are intended to add more content to the Library found in the Abandoned Lodge in that adventure. The volumes have been imbued by a spirit so that reading them makes the reader experience some of what is described, and as a result of this they can gain abilities from doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to respect Paizo's IP, proper names have been replaced with generic descriptions where relevant. These have been highlighted in bold, to make them stand out. These can then be replaced with the actual names by the GM. The books can also be dropped into other campaign settings in a similar way, by simply replacing the generic descriptions with ones appropriate to the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is an extract from a sample volume:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nine Lives of Harrinan Whistler - This book by a thief grants a +1 bonus on Stealth checks, and Sleight of Hand checks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is cover, one the front matter and one the OGL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
