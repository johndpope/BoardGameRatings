			<description>From the Game's First Chapter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This chapter uses a modern, low-power setting to display the basics of character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloodworks is a generic RPG designed to create conflicted characters for a variety of genres. Though generic, Bloodworks is designed to be flavorful and to provide a character a constant threat--his own &amp;quot;dark side.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vitally, there are two parts to each character: his Face and his Bane. A character's Face is what is usually seen in the game; it's every part of the character that he has worked on or picked up, his skills, occupation, and niche. A character's Bane is the part of him that tries to hold him back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character occupies a distinct niche in the game, his/her Title. A Title implies something about the character; it should explain some of what he can do and his background. A good Title would be The Runaway Girl. The Title tells us what we need to know--the biggest factor in her background and perhaps some of her skills. It's slightly binding, but not too much. A poor Title would be The Fighter. &amp;quot;Fighter&amp;quot; is too general to be effective; a better Title would be The Barroom Brawler, The Jaded Gunman, or The Alleyway Knifer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
