			<description>From the 24-hour PDF introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuns 2 Ninjas is an RPG designed for lite rules story telling. All you need to play is pen and paper, 5 2-sided dice (use coins or several six sided dice counting 1-3 as &amp;quot;heads&amp;quot; and 4-6 as &amp;quot;tails&amp;quot;) a couple of friends and someone to run the game, I.E. a Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system is multi-genre and as such does not run off of one specific theme but is instead designed to be open to any theme the Game Master wishes to run the game in. In order to play the game the players must create a character that they will then portray within the game world. The Game Master will probably create many characters for the player to interact with in various ways however creating a character is the same for both the players and the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
