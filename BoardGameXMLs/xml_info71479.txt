			<description>[Game Box]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's just a kidnapping. Of an entire city! By an Alien UFO. Will Fester sit still for this? The quest begins. For starters, take on slime replicators, skeeters, globules, and giant scorpions. Your health is at stake, not to mention your life. Will you whip the Alien Bosses? Or will they whip you? Lucky for you, this is a family affair. And what a family! Find your way to Thing and help is right at hand. In trouble? Just ring for Lurch. He'll give those aliens trouble with a capital L. The fate of the whole city is in your hands. And we've saved the worst for last!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
