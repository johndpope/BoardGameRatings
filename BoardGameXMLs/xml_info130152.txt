							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caves of Doom</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst exploring the planet Doom you were captured by the guards of the ruthless Lord of Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are now imprisoned in caves deep within the bowels of Doom but are determined to escape. To do so you must find five keys, one of which is in three pieces, which are scattered around the caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the odds are against you as the Lord of Darkness has laid traps in the caves and has sent many thousands of his bloodthirsty minions to thwart your mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are unarmed and, therefore, must use your wits to avoid certain death on Doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caves of Doom was written by Robert Sansom of Mr. Chip Software and was released by Mastertronic on the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to Jet Set Willy, in that the player guides a character around the screen avoiding moving enemies and collecting items. The difference is that instead of jumping and being limited by an air supply, instead the user flies using a jetpack and is limited by fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a level editor which allows any of the 40 screens to be modified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
