			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out in the west, they say there are a thousand stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few of them belong to those who make their own path. Many are tales of battle, sneaking and finding, or seeing all we&amp;rsquo;ve worked for crumbling to dust. But those who pull themselves out of the pitfalls, those who fight even a losing battle, and those who make mountains out of molehills. Those are the stories that people remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     20 page document&lt;br/&gt;     Brave: A native warrior who uses honor and cunning to outdo foes.&lt;br/&gt;     Jaguar Warrior: A ferocious combatant who takes on their totem&amp;rsquo;s form in a furious rampage.&lt;br/&gt;     Painted Rider: A mounted outrider using their bond with nature to bear down on their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;     Conquistador: A merciless mercenary who adapts to their enemies and stifles empathy for profit.         &lt;br/&gt;     Spirit Walker: A naturalist whose close bond with an animal gives them insight into the world around them.   &lt;br/&gt;     Cowboy: A.K.A Vaquero, this gunslinger specializes in mounted combat and trick riding.&lt;br/&gt;     Mountain Man: A wilderness expert who lives by the words &amp;ldquo;desperate times call for desperate measures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     Vigilante: A watchdog who&amp;rsquo;s been forced to watch too much bites back. The vigilante serves out justice, no matter whose clothing the villain wears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
