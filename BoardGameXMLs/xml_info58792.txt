							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mysteries of Hungary</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An understanding of the thousand-year history of Hungary is vital for a good background. During the centuries, four nations have tried to rule the area now known as Hungary. German-Roman emperors brought the Hungarian crown into their treasury. In the eleventh century their attacks stopped, due to huge casualties. In 1241 the Tartars came and burned the land, after they crushed the Royal knights near Muhi. They too were eventually defeated. The Turks, and then the Austrian Habsburg family, came to dominate the country in the sixteenth century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally a new state was formed by mutual accord. It would not stand long, for the Great War began in 1914.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MYSTERIES OF HUNGARY describes the land, the history, and the people of Hungary. Chapters include History and Legends, Economy and Standard of Living, Budapest, Lake Balaton and Region, Adventuring in Hungary, Mythos in Hungary, Professor of Nygotha, and Hungary in Other Eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
