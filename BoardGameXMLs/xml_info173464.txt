							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Post-Apocalyptic Dispatch (Issue 11 - 2007)</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vespuloids is an unusual scenario that introduces a new monster to Darwin's World. In this adventure the player characters are drawn to the domain of a powerful raider gang by reports that a community of farmers has vanished and, without them, the annual corn harvest - which supplies the raider overlords of the land with ethanol fuel for their vehicles - won't be forthcoming. Without their tribute payments the people of the wasteland will be certain to suffer the consequences, which are sure to be brutal. The PCs are asked to go to the farm community and find out why the farmers have disappeared, and hopefully deal with the problem before it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vespuloids is designed for characters of levels 3-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
