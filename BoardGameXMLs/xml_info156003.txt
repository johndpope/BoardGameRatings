							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Charlie Murder</name>
									
			<description>Charlie Murder is an action role-playing-beat 'em up video game for the Xbox Live Arcade on the Xbox 360.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's protagonist, Charlie Murder, is a member of a garage punk band of the same name. Charlie kicks one of the founding band members, Paul, out of the band, and begins to experience chart-topping success creating music in a new genre with new bandmates. Paul takes on the name Lord Mortimer, forms his own band, Gore Quaffer, and raises a demonic army to destroy Charlie Murder. The player character is killed at the beginning of the game, fights out of hell, and is reborn on earth in the midst of the apocalypse. The band is tasked with stopping the apocalypse by defeating Gore Quaffer in a Battle of the Bands. During the game there are several flashbacks that detail the story of the band before Paul is kicked out, as well as an in-game radio program in which callers talk about the band and the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Charlie Murder,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
