			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For anyone wanting to use Cepheus Engine as a rules-set for a fantasy setting, Fast Magic offers a complete, improvisational magic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no spell lists in Fast Magic and this is done firstly to keep the rules flexible and easily adaptable to a referee&amp;rsquo;s setting, and secondly to mirror the rules-light approach of Cepheus Engine itself. A player character does not have to wait passively for an opportunity to use a spell on his spell list. Instead he can adapt his magic to each situation, playing a much more active role in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We provide very firm, well explained guidelines that ensure both referee and player understand the mage&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and limitations. Fast magic is easy to learn and, during a game session, quick and easy to cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes a description of four new Cepheus Engine skills: Magic, Alchemy, Calligraphy and Artifice. A new magic-using career, Mage, is also included and may be used as presented or as a template for the referee&amp;rsquo;s own magical careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
