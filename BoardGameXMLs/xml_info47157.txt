			<description>Jeremiah - The RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher &amp;quot;Utilizing the Open Gaming License, this exciting roleplaying game details the characters and rich background from the 35-hour saga. The Jeremiah roleplaying game includes all the rules and background information needed to play in this gritty, post-apocalyptic world. Taking advantage of the Open Gaming License from Wizards of the Coast, the rules and mechanics of the Jeremiah Roleplaying Game should be easily recognized by anyone familiar with the most popular roleplaying game in the world. Designed to allow as much flexibility to explore JMS's future world as possible, players will take on the roles of tough and nasty Jocks, brilliant Brainboys or ever-restless Wanderers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without the comforts and conveniences of civilization, players will adventure through a dangerous world populated by feral children, vicious marauders and enigmatic factions, all vying for the few scraps that are left of the Old World. The main rulebook provides the framework for a complete game including chapters on skills, feats, equipment, combat and character creation. The game includes all new character classes tailored for the world of Jeremiah and includes a complete episode guide covering all three seasons as well as additional material on the world outside of North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jeremiah roleplaying game is a 256 page, hardcover book and will be supported by future sourcebooks covering the people and places seen in the first three seasons of the television epic and beyond. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
