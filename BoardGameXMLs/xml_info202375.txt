			<description>Four Knonsters compete in a race in order to find out who is the fastest Knonster. Is it the anxious Rithle, the snappy Aristas, the self-confident Celya or the devious Elaari? Choose your two Favorites and help them to get a good rank in the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;The starting player is chosen randomly. Then, starting with the starting player, each player in clockwise order plays one of his cards and executes the instructions of the card. In most cases this means, that a certain Knonster will be moved forward a few steps. But there are cases where the card does not have an effect in the current game situation; in that case, no Knonster is moved. If a Knonster crosses the finish line after position 60, it will be placed on the best still available place on the podium. If a player has fewer than 5 hand cards, the player draws a card from the draw pile (if there are any cards left).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of Game:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends immediately after the third Knonster has crossed the finish line. Theoretically it can also happen, that the draw deck is depleted when a player is about to draw a card, but fewer than 3 Knonsters have reached the goal. In that case, the game also ends, but only for the Knonsters which have reached the goal the points will be distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
