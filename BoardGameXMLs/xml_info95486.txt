			<description>Expansion for The Touch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Touch, plastic playing pieces (landmarks such as the Eiffel tower, objects such as a roller skate or a hamburger) are placed inside a plastic dome while cards containing sets of these figures (i.e. &amp;quot;Paris Landmarks&amp;quot;) are placed around the dome.  In turn, players will place their hand in the dome and attempt to locate (by feel only) pieces matching those pictured on the card that was overturned.  Points are awarded for pieces drawn and sets collected with victory going to the player earning the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Farm Animal Expansion adds a new themed set of 12 pieces (cow, horse, goat...) and 6 cards to add variety to the base game.  The base game is required in order to use this expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
