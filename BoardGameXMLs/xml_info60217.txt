			<description>Rank and File are a set of horse and musket rules that cover the period from 1740 through to 1900. The basic game mechanics are simple and easy to learn with the aim of being able to play large games within a reasonable time frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics use a fairly standard D6 system for table top games with both sides taking their actions in phases - either alternate for movement or simultaneous for firing, morale and melee.  Units can represent anything from battalions to brigades and are made up of a number of stands.  As losses are taken stands of figures are removed and the unit is forced to take morale tests, multiple failures remove the entire unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are broken down into basic and optional rules - at the most basic level the game is fast and simple, the optional rules add more detail and realism but also add more time to the game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
