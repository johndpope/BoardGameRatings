			<description>The Wayfarer's Guide to Verbobonc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long before the coming of humanity, Verbobonc was an elven settlement set on a wooded hilltop overlooking a spot where a minor tributary, Gillendyl&amp;rsquo;s Run, enters the Velverdyva River&amp;rsquo;s wide expanse. The small river town featured an impressive elven tower fortress surrounded by yet more tall, thin towers, narrow walkways, lofty ipt-houses, and parkways illed with delicate wood and ceramic statuary. Considered a safe haven on the great river, a market place developed along the riverbank attracting goods from near and far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item provides background and setting development for the Viscounty of Verbobonc on Greyhawk.  It was created by the Verbobonc Triad and Verbobonc Council (the formal organizations charged with, respectively, creating and running the Living Greyhawk Verbobonc Regional play program) - but it was not published by Wizards of the Coast.  It was intended to function as a free resource to introduce and orient players to the Verbobonc region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
