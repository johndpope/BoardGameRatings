			<description>The Great Dragon Hunt is a great kids game with lots of gameboard action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are Knights who must each roam the land to capture 10 different dragons.  At the start of the game each player is dealt one coloured dragon card... that becomes their first target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin and move by complete count.  If they land on a dragon space that matches the colour of their dragon, they 'capture' it and draw another card.  If they land, by exact count, on another player, they send him back to his home castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board contains a number of plastic 'drawbridges' that are either up or down.  They may only be crossed if they are lying flat.  Boats also exist that may allow a move of close to 1/2 of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
