			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alien Struggle game system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space-- the Final Frontier. This is the game where you send out starships to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life forms and new civilizations, and kick their ass&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Struggle is a one to four player game played on a tabletop where players are leaders of alien races that have recently discovered faster-than-light drive. Expanding outward, exploring their way into the galaxy they colonize new worlds, make contact with less developed alien races and discover ancient artifacts. Each race has its own unique equipment and special rules. Players may engage in combat or in peaceful trade and co-existence. Each game is a new experience since players create the game &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; anew every game by drawing world tiles from the Cosmic Cup. Players explore, discover new worlds, establish colonies and recruit new units to increase their power, making and breaking alliances with other players, developing secret weapons and fighting desperate battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game set can be played by itself or combined with any of the other Alien Struggle game sets to increase the size of the galaxy and add new races, allowing larger games with up to 20 players. Each race comes with its own special rules, unique abilities and pieces. Explore all the possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Struggle Game sets include a four-page rulebook, die-cut cardstock science chits, two player aid sheets, plus unique rules and die-cut pieces for FOUR different alien races depending on the set&lt;br/&gt;. Each set is compatible with any of the others or can be played separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five sets -each ordered separately: The Coming of the Cosmic Prophet, Cyborg Invasion, Hiver Hegemony, Federation &amp;amp; Empire, and the Shadow War. Alien Struggle isn't a particular game, it's the mother system. You get one or more of the sets to play. Any set can be played on its own or combined with any of the others to make a bigger game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
