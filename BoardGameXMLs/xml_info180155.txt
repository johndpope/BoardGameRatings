			<description>ファイアエムブレム０（サイファー） (&amp;quot;Fire Emblem 0 (Cipher)&amp;quot;) is a collectible card game based on the Fire Emblem video games. Currently, it is being released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players choose one main character at the start of the game. All the cards in the game are character cards. Each character has a base attack strenght, as well as support strength (in addition to certain other powers and abilities). Each player has five 'orbs' ('life' represented by cards'), which the other player tries to get down to zero by attacking the main character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's five phases in a game.&lt;br/&gt;1) Starting Phase&lt;br/&gt;Untapping tapped characters, and drawing 1 card.&lt;br/&gt;2) The Bond Phase&lt;br/&gt;Playing 1 card into the &amp;acute;bond&amp;acute; area. Each card has a value (top left). The value of cards in the 'bond' area determines the value of the characters you can put into play.&lt;br/&gt;3) The Sortie Phase&lt;br/&gt;Play characters, or level up certain characters. The characters you can play depends on their card value and the value of cards in your &amp;acute;bond&amp;acute; area.&lt;br/&gt;4) The Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;Move your characters into the opponent's area; attack your opponent's characters; or use a skll.&lt;br/&gt;5) The Final Phase&lt;br/&gt;Skills that say 'during this turn' end, and the turn goes to the opposing player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent's main character by destroying his 'orbs.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
