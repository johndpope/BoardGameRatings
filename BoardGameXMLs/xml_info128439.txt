			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to My Little Pony: Roleplaying Is Magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a labor of love for the brony (and bronette!) community by Tall Tail and Know-It-All, and is presented free for all to play and use. We intend to revise and update the game&amp;rsquo;s core rulebook with each successive season of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, incorporating new lore, mechanics, and rules as they are established by the show. To that end, you won&amp;rsquo;t find everything you want within these pages; we have been very careful only to incorporate essential things and things which have been well-enough established by the show to warrant their inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What should you expect out of My Little Pony: Roleplaying Is Magic? We are long-time Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons fans, in addition to many other pen &amp;amp; paper RPG systems, and set out not to simply create a module for My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic within a pre-existing system, but rather to build a new system from the ground up to support the style of play and the atmosphere of the show. To that end, we don&amp;rsquo;t feel that there is a simple way to explain the game (such as &amp;ldquo;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons with ponies&amp;rdquo;); it is its own system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we&amp;rsquo;ll try!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Little Pony: Roleplaying Is Magic is based on both freeform roleplaying as well as concepts from other pen &amp;amp; paper RPG&amp;rsquo;s which many veteran players will surely recognize. It has elements of World Of Darkness, Unisystem, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Ars Magica, and Mythic, as well as several others in smaller but no less influential ways. The game is very rules-light, and uses interpretation and adaptation, rather than tables and strict rules, to determine not just the outcome of rolls, but the rolls themselves. We believe it is better described as a &amp;ldquo;collaborative storytelling system&amp;rdquo; than as a roleplaying game system. It&amp;rsquo;s not designed for dungeon diving; it&amp;rsquo;s designed for storytelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its heart, My Little Pony: Roleplaying Is Magic is designed to let players and GM&amp;rsquo;s create the atmosphere of the show in their own games; to bring Equestria to the table and make it their own. It is our hope that playing the game will help to bring a group of players together with their GM, promoting cooperation and having fun as a group. We hope that playing the game will help you to enjoy the magic of friendship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
