			<description>One of the 70s-era &amp;quot;Micro-Warfare&amp;quot; games published by Heritage Models, Inc, under its &amp;quot;Tabletop Games&amp;quot; subsidiary.&lt;br/&gt;The Cold War heats up on your kitchen table, as Red launches it's nuclear arsenal of ICBM's, IRBM's, and Strategic Bombers against Blue's air defense command. &lt;br/&gt;Blue occupies two thirds of the table with his cities, missile silos, radar sites, and surface-to-air missiles, while Red lurks menacingly behind his Fail-Safe Line, awaiting the go-codes to unleash Armageddon. &lt;br/&gt;Supplied components are a rulebook, the cardboard pieces that you must cut out, and a pad of &amp;quot;Missile Attack/Defense Order&amp;quot; sheets. Players must supply two different colored dice and a meter stick. &lt;br/&gt;(A sharp pencil and a calculator are recommended as well.)&lt;br/&gt;Despite involving a somewhat greater-than-usual amount of record-keeping, both players quickly find themselves in a tense battle of nuclear bluff and counter-bluff. &lt;br/&gt;Are those incoming blips merely a Red ruse, or is that &amp;quot;The Real Thing&amp;quot; building up behind Red's Fail Safe Line? &lt;br/&gt;Should Blue strip the air defenses of his cities to assure his getting off a retaliatory ICBM strike against Red, or protect his populace and risk obliteration of his missile silos?&lt;br/&gt;Overall, a tight, well-balanced table-topper &lt;br/&gt;It never plays the same way twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
