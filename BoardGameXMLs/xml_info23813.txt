							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New York Times Crossword Puzzle Game</name>
									
			<description>Players take turns solving crossword puzzle clues before their time runs out, and advancing their pegs along a cribbage-style track based on the number of letters that are in the words they have correctly solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puzzles are actual New York Times crossword puzzles, edited by Eugene T. Maleska, having a copyright date of 1978, and there are 100 of them. Additionally there are another 20 &amp;quot;Junior Level&amp;quot; puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An approximately two-minute hourglass timer provides the suspense, and players select which clues to answer based on the values on four ten-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has advanced his pegs furthest along the track  at the end of the game (e.g., when the crossword puzzle is completely solved) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
