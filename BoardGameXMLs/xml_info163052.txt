							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tribes of Crane</name>
									
			<description>The Tribes of Crane was the first commercial play by mail game to be moderated by a human game master (at first entirely, and later with the assistance of a computer). This allowed players &amp;ndash; who adopted the roles of leaders of particular tribes &amp;ndash; to submit special orders with their turns, instructions which were processed by a human being and could thus include any action imaginable rather than being restricted by a predesigned set of rules. This flexibility, combined with occasional opportunities to enact the role of a particular individual rather than that of an entire clan and the potential for games to continue indefinitely, made Crane&amp;lsquo;s game play resemble that of a tabletop role playing game far more closely than that of a board and counter war game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
