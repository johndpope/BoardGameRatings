			<description>Fictionary is as rich as the idea is basic, and each game is completely different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played with a dictionary. Each player takes two sheets of paper.  One will be used for definitions, and each player writes his name on top of it.  The other will be used for guesses.  One of the players takes the dictionary and looks for an obscure word that, he thinks, all other players ignore (i.e. eguzla, exarch or jabot).  He spells the word and tells what kind of word (verb, name, adjective).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must now imagine and write down a plausible and convincing definition for this word.  The player with the dictionary writes the true definition.  When all players have written their definition down, the player with the dictionary takes all sheets, shuffles them, numbers, and reads aloud all the definitions.  If necessary, he may read those two or three times.  Each player must then write on his guess sheet who, in his opinion, has written each definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have written their definitions, the player with the dictionary unveils the truth and tells who wrote what.  Each player scores:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 points if he found out the dictionary&lt;br/&gt;     1 point for each other player he found out&lt;br/&gt;     1 point for each player who thought his definition was the dictionary's one&lt;br/&gt;     If no one guessed what the true definition was, the player with the dictionary scores as many points as there are players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have scored their points, the player with the dictionary gives it to the player on his left.  Play goes on until each player has had the dictionary once or twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are numerous variants at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=ludotheque&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=ludotheque&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;id=58.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fictionary is also described at Wikipedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Balderdash is a popular commercial version of this game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
