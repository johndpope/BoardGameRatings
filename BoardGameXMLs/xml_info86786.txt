			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has been designed for use with the revised gaming system for Villains and Vigilantes, and presents a complete adventure setting for four or more players. This product is designed for the Gamemaster's use only. Anyone planning to participate in the adventure as a player should not read any further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should also be noted that the material in this scenario is subject to the Gamemaster's expansion, deletion or alteration in order to make it more suitable to his/her campaign. Special attention should be paid to the statistics and powers of the Amida Tong, the NPC villains provided for this adventure. Although experience levels are supplied, The Gamemaster may find it necessary to modify these values slightly, depending upon the levels of hidher own player-characters. It is suggested that the combined total of the villains' experience levels (those with super-powers only) should be at least three to four times as high as the combined total of the player-characters' experience levels. A few NPC heroes are also provided, and may be worked into the adventure if the Gamemaster finds the sides to be drastically unbalanced in favor of the villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is designed to take place on both the East and West Coasts of the United States, specifically New York City and San Francisco, It may be more favorable to the campaign, however, to have the first location fairly close geographically to wherever the player-characters have their headquarters. The second locale, on the other hand, should be left a good distance away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is a complete adventure, the Gamemaster is encouraged to add his/her own ideas and to expand on any details he/she wishes in order to make this a more exciting adventure for the players. Any changes made to this scenario should be made prior to the start of the action, rather than during play. No matter how complete a scenario has been made, circumstances are bound to arise that no amount of preplanning could anticipate. In these instances, the Gamemaster will have to make spur-of-the-moment decisions which should be based upon his/her overall knowledge of this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
