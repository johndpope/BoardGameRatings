							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic West</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of humanity discovering the Galactic West system is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, and persistence. Through treaties with alien nations, political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, building farms, ranches and towns, marking trails and digging mines, the whole system is gradually settled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the folk of the Galactic West system are becoming a proud frontier people, whose values are focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as individualism, and self-reliance. From frozen moons to advanced planets, under the direction of the &amp;lsquo;core worlds&amp;rsquo;, the Federation is becoming ever more tightly bound together. But it is still a system that is recovering from civil war and there is scope for adventure on one frontier world after another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us as we make planetfall, looking for the next big score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
