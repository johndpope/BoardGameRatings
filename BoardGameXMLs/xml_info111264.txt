			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a somewhat typical &amp;quot;roll &amp;amp; move&amp;quot; trivia game with a couple of interesting wrinkles... players may only move one of their pawns after they correctly answer a question, and each player gets three player pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player is able to land on a space with another player's pawn, she may send her opponent's pawn back to its starting space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get three pawns into the center space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
