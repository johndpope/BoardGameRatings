The game uses point-to-point movement and a chit pull mechanic to simulate events and enemy army formations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player commands British forces and native allies. On each turn, the player will select a British Leader and build forts, move, draw event chit, or reorganize. Actions are limited by the Leader's Action Points. Enemy actions are determined by event chits, which are drawn when entering hostile territory. Combat is based on unit strength with units rolling dice equal in number to their combat strength. British eliminate a unit on a roll of 5 or 6 and Zulu eliminate a unit on a roll of 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is capture Chief Cetewayo adn subdue as many hostile Zulu areas as possible. The player must manage both the Zulu forces and the British political will to stay in the war.
