			<description>This is a game about a fishing competition. Players toss a die to move around the board as they attempt to land on the best fishing holes.

Players must also head for the bait shop in order to keep fishing. The game ends after a player reaches the dock... points are scored for the weight of each trophy fish and the player with the most points is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the board, six tokens, fish cards, bait markers, a die, and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
