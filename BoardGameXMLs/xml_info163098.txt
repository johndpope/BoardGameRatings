			<description>from the PDF&lt;br/&gt;In this game we work together to explore and enjoy an adventure story. The story has a hero - the Barbarian, and it has a whole cast of supporting characters who the hero will meet during the course of the adventure. One player&amp;rsquo;s job is to play the role of the hero, to make choices on the hero&amp;rsquo;s behalf, and to make us believe in that character and care what happens at the end of the story. The Barbarian has a mission in the city, someone they&amp;rsquo;re desperately trying to find. When you&amp;rsquo;re playing the Barbarian, you&amp;rsquo;re trying to succeed in that mission, but you&amp;rsquo;re also open to finding there&amp;rsquo;s something the Barbarian cares about even more than that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players together play the supporting characters. Their job is to make the world come alive around the Barbarian, to make the city feel real, like it has a life of its own. Each of the supporting characters has an agenda you can choose. Some of these might conflict with the Barbarian&amp;rsquo;s mission, some will support it, and others could go either way. When you play a supporting character, you work toward&amp;rsquo;s that character&amp;rsquo;s agenda, and find out what happens as a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;the PDF has three files:&lt;br/&gt;4 pages for rules, 15 pages for character cards, 12 pages for tarot cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
