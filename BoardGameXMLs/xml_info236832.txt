							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes Three Round 1: In Search of Adventure (DM Invitational Version)</name>
									
			<description>A Two-Round Adventure for Six Adventurers&lt;br/&gt;DM Invitational Version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Three. That's what they call your group. Actually, there are six of you. As one of the leading adventuring groups in all the Forgotten Realms, you have a responsibility. A responsibility to the people, and an equal one to your&amp;not;selves. Heroes are supposed to go on heroic quests, and you haven't been on one lately. Your last experience was in routing a group of orcs attacking a farmhouse. Important work, to be sure, but frankly you have a feeling that the burly farmer might have been able to save himself and his family. You did save his farm and livestock for sure. The family was very grateful, your reward was one of the best home-cooked meals you've had in some time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've been involved in that sort of thing for the past year. While it is safer, it just doesn't match the thrill you got when the drow turned and ran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, it is time for a truly heroic quest. Merlin has announced that he is almost ready to retire. He wants one more heroic quest before he quits. It seems the only way for a true hero to go out. Barnath has asked you all to go out and check around for information on a truly formidable challenge. You have been asking around for days, some of you listening at the inns, others searching through libraries. You have agreed to meet this morning to discuss your findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You meet at Sori's Cafe, the best place for breakfast in the town of Hamish. All of the adventurers in the know eat here. Hamish is located near forests, mountains, ruins, it's a perfect spot for adventuring. That's means that Sori's is packed this morning. You can see Adventco, Inc., the Company of the Mad Griffin, Jerod and the Hawks, and a few adventurers you don't recognize.  The day dawns bright and clear, a perfect day for adventuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
