							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Defenders</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...A small village in the woods, surrounded by wild wolves lead by a giant, white and monstrous wolf as tall as a men. The characters are the only ones who will stand up to defend the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...A little town built next to the sea, and of a giant covered of seashells and seaweed, emerging from the waves, marching on the beach, to the port and the boats, that are the most precious possession of every family in town. Imagine the characters as the only ones brave enough to take arms against the tribes of giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...A small encampment in the northern lands, hosting refugees from various villages, seeking shelter from the ongoing war; and imagine a gang of knights, lead by a corrupted cleric, marching nearby - filled by anger, hatred and greed. The characters are the only hope for the refugees to avoid a raid and the consequent violence and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
