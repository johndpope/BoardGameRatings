							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Rally</name>
									
			<description>One in a series of sixteen Flipsiders games designed to resemble pastel colored audio cassettes. The game contained a metal gameboard that would flip out with the snap of the wrist. A storage compartment at the top of the game would hold the magnetic pawns. A spring-loaded switch would spin the wheels of the cassette to generate random numbers and events during play. The game would hang from a blister pack on display at the store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spinners determine how far one may move during one&amp;rsquo;s turn. The players will compete in three races and the first to complete all three races is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
