			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beau-Jolly made their name in the music business by selling compilations. In the mid 1980s they were looking to do the same thing with video games. One of the companies they approached was Imagine. After their spectacular and public collapse, Beau-Jolly ended up owning Imagine's back-catalogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Value Pack compilations released by Beau-Jolly contained mostly Imagine games. Some were duplicated across different platforms, but no two compilations were the same, though they shared the same artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 48K ZX Spectrum version consisted of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Cruiser - A shooter where you use a cannon to attack an alien spacecraft and save the crewmen released.&lt;br/&gt;B.C. Bill - An arcade game where the aim is for a caveman to use his club to hunt food, defend against predators and 'collect' wives!&lt;br/&gt;Pedro - An arcade maze game where a Mexican gardener is fighting to protect his plants against various animals.&lt;br/&gt;ZZoom - An aircraft shooter with a 3D viewpoint.&lt;br/&gt;Zip-Zap - An arcade game where a robot on a far-off planet is fighting against hordes of aliens.&lt;br/&gt;Alchemist - An arcade-adventure where the player is aiming to collect four pieces of a scroll to defeat an evil warlock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
