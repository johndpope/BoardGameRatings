							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Dozen Effects of Lingering Spell Energy</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a spell is successfully cast, the arcane or divine energy released during the process leaves a faint, invisible aura that is ignored by all but the most powerful of spellcasters. This invisible aura is often referred to as lingering spell energy by those spellcasters versed in its existence. The number of spellcasters with knowledge of lingering spell energy is small and, smaller still, is the number of spellcasters who have learned how to tap into this invisible aura of magical power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 5-page PDF, Philip Reed presents rules for lingering spell energy -- and rules for tapping into and using that energy. 12 sample effects are included -- DMs and players are encouraged to create their own effects to add to the samples included in the pages of this short PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
