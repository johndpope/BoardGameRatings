			<description>Hollands Glorie is a game about tug-boats on the North Sea, inspired on a novel with the same name by Jan de Hartog. The gameboard depicts the North Sea, with six harbours and six offshore platforms. At the start of the game, eighteen ships are placed at sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Weather Card is drawn, which shows the weather in different areas, and two ships which are in jeopardy. The players attempt to reach these ships and tug them to a harbour. If a player succeeds in doing so, he collects a number of coins as reward. At the end of the game, the player with the most coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by rolling two dice. In fair weather, the a tug-boat moves a number of squares equal to the sum of the two dice, in unstable weather only the number shown on the highest of the two dice and in a storm only the number shown on the lowest of the two dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling doubles results in a special event. On a double 5 or 6, the weather shifts and new ships are placed in jeopardy. On any other double, the player draws a Log Card, which will often have some one-time effect or give him a special assignment with which he can gain coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
