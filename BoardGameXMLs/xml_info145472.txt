							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noggin Workshop Brain Bending Conundrums</name>
									
			<description>A workout for the brain.  This mind teaser card game includes riddles, puzzles, and mysteries to be solved.  Skills used to solve these brain teasers include deductive reasoning, critical thinking, and outside of the box analyzing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played individually or as a group racing to solve the conundrum first.  Player draws one card from the deck, which could be an image or text problem, and then works to solve it.  If only one player, then he/she &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot;.  If more than one player, then the winning player keeps the card as his/her point.  Play goes on until determined number of wins.  The goal is to solve as many problems as possible without having to look at the answers on the back of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
