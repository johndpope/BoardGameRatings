			<description>&amp;quot;Experience the emotions and obstacles of the Vietnam foot soldier as you take your men on patrol through the bush of Vietnam! Created by a Vietnam Vet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game blends strategy, emotions, and luck in which a player can win by surviving 365 days through a simulated tour of the combat soldier in Vietnam. There are few rules which will not be difficult to learn and will enhance the competitiveness when applied&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mapboard consists of 365 numbered spaces. The object is to get to the end of the tour with the most grunts left alive in your patrol. The &amp;quot;educational&amp;quot; nature of the game comes from the terminology (as well as attitudes and emotions) that the designer has injected into the game. Each square bears a term related to the Vietnam War, and a small glossary folder explains what each term means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include mounted game board, 53 plastic grunts, 2 dice, 20 boonie cards, 1 POW camp, 4 plastic helicopters, 4 patrol cards, and the glossary. The rules are printed on the bottom of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
