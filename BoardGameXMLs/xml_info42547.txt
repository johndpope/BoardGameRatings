							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fantasy Nations Table Game</name>
									
			<description>Fantasy Nations is a game played on a tabletop where each player controls his own nation in a fantasy world. Each game is a new experience since players create the game &amp;ldquo;board&amp;rdquo; anew each game by placing large cardstock terrain tiles on the table. Players conquer territory, recruit new units, draw magic items, gold, healers, heroes, sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s apprentices and additions to their royal family from the Cup of Destiny to increase their power, making and breaking alliances with other players, slaying monsters and fighting desperate battles. It is possible for more than one player to win. The game set here can be played by itself or added to any of the other Fantasy Nations game sets to increase the size of the playing area and add new races, allowing larger games with more players. Each nation comes with its own special rules, terrain tiles and pieces. Explore all the possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Nations Game sets include: &lt;br/&gt;   The Elf-Dwarf War. &amp;ldquo;The Final Solution to the Dwarven Problem&amp;rdquo; -- Can the free Dwarves of the mountains withstand the assault? Can the humans living in the valleys below remain neutral? Or will they be forced to choose a side? Which will become the dominant Fantasy Nation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sorceress Queen, an epic struggle between the forces of Magic and Technology with armies of magical creatures clashing with the gunpowder weapons and airships of the Devourers of Wisdom. Whose side will the Goblins join? Or can they profit from the exhaustion of the others?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
