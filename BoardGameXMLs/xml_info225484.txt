			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theatre Of The Mind Encounters are short adventures, situations or encounters described purely in text. The setting description is kept to a minimum so they could be parachuted as easily into an Arabian Nights campaign just as easily as a Medieval European campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These encounters are system neutral so no game stats, spells are explicitly mentioned and if a character&amp;rsquo;s profession is mentioned that should be taken to me the actual profession of the &amp;lsquo;living&amp;rsquo; person not necessarily the character class of the same name if it exists. By that I mean if I mention a thief then I just mean someone who steals something not an NPC of the thief character class and all the associated skills and abilities. That does not mean that they are not of that class or profession. That is a choice for the DM/GM to make when preparing the encounter for his or her players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
