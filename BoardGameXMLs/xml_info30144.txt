			<description>Honningspillet (The Honey Game) is a Winnie the Pooh-themed children's game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All playing pieces are mixed before the game starts, and the only way to find out who controls which piece is to move to a bee square and look at the sticker at the bottom of the honey pot. The players must then remember the colors and move their own pots towards the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all his or her honey pots to the goal is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;12 honey pot pieces with plastic feet&lt;br/&gt;12 stickers&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
