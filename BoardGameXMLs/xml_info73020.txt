							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stalin&#039;s Fury</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;STALINGRAD, SOVIET UNION, 22 October 1942: The German 6th Army push into the heart of Stalingrad played directly into the hands of the defenders, intent on contesting every building. Pavlov&amp;rsquo;s House became the name of one particularly well-defended apartment building, its moniker gained from Sergeant Yakov Pavlov, who commanded the platoon which first seized the building and which kept defending it throughout the battle. The house was a four-story building in the city-center of Stalingrad, overlooking a large square, the  9th January Square . The small garrison established anti-tank and machine-gun posts at the windows and held off all attacks for fifty-nine days. Each time enemy infantry or panzers attempted to reach the defenders, Pavlov&amp;rsquo;s men took them under heavy fire littering the square with corpses and wreckage. Eventually the defenders, as well as the Russian civilians who remained in the basement throughout, held on until 25 November 1942, when they were relieved by counter-attacking Soviet forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is STALIN'S FURY, a brand new set of four scenarios + a new 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map on heavyweight stock. You also receive a color (red, naturally) cover and VARIANT RULES page. All you'll need to dive into the heart of the inferno that was the Battle of Stalingrad during 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario pack also includes Teufelhunden (GWASL #1) a 1918 WW1 scenario set in Belleau Wood France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
