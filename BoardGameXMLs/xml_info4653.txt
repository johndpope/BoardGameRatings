			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be an Egomaniac! Let unbridled self-interest be your guide. Unleash those long repressed diabolical yearnings to triumph over others as you maneuver for power, control, and total victory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game is for you to become the Supreme Ego by amassing the required amount of Powers and Properties. Owning Powers gives you potential control over other Egos' freedom of movement, security, access to information, and the amount of their money. Owning Properties gives you the potential to control and block other Egos' board movement strategies. The inevitable conflicts that arise are resolved by direct negotiations between players, resulting in bargains that are as devilishly clever as human invention permits.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
