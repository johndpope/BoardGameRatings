			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEISHIN is a conquer-and-control board game set in feudal Japan, designed and developed by Rogue Artist Creations Ltd. It is a well-balanced mix of area-control, resource-management and strategy that has enough to interest lots of different types of gamers. You can find yourself in a furious battle to control Niigata or engaged in making desperate alliances to save-guard your borders... only for your allies to turn around and betray you several turns later!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You (Yes, YOU!) are a noble Daimyo of Japan. Your role is to expand and conquer provinces, then set them to produce resources and score Victory Points. However, do you do what the Emperor wishes you to do or follow your own path? (That is what the concept of SEISHIN is all about!) Every year, the Emperor's wishes change and different resources are plentiful or scarce, so the game is constantly changing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll dice, play Action Cards, attack and defend, produce and score. Expand your influence and take over regions. However, Japan is only so large and can take only so much political upheaval before all heck breaks loose and Civil WAR! is declared! Now the Emperor's own provinces come under attack and everyone's loyalty wavers in the red tide of War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will be left in first place when all the final points have been totaled and the last Victory Points added? Who will be crowned the new Emperor or Empress? Only time will tell. So put on your armour, draw your katana and take battle to Japan, as the fires of War and beckoning and you will never take Osakaaaaaa!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
