							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naturally Disastrous: Discoverable Items Promo Pack</name>
									
			<description>This promo pack was available during Kickstarter.com campaigns and at conventions.  It contains the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloaking Device- The owner of the device cannot be seen by natives unless they are the only Alien not KO'd or Mutated.  If the Yellow Alien is in play, and all other Aliens are KO'd or Mutated, the cloaking device has no effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M.R.E. (Microwavable Ready Earth-food)- The Medical officer of the crew figured out that if you Microwave a lemon filled doughnut    allows you to heal all your wounds.  It is then discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malfunctioning Transporter- This functions similarly to a transporter but you have to roll the D10 and D8 die to decide where you end up.  You can also discard it to move a Native or Mutated Alien instead of an Alien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
