							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flush!  The All-American Tax Game</name>
									
			<description>Flush! is a Clinton-era satirical trivia game about taxes and the IRS.  Players roll and move along the board, which features caricatures of many of the most recognizable political figures of the early '90s (apparently, images of the board were sold as posters before publication of the game).  Depending on the space, players pay taxes, fees, or penalties, answer questions in the categories of Tax &amp;amp; Trivia, Waste, and Pork, flush money down the toilet in the center of the board when they draw an Audit card, and occasionally receive Handouts from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the person retaining the most money after everyone has landed in the Poor House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
