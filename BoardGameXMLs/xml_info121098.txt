							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mighty Hood II</name>
									
			<description>The Mighty Hood II is a two-player game that simulates the main World War II battles involving HMS Hood, pride of the Royal Navy. Players maneuver their ships on the tabletop (or floor) and try and defeat the enemy through combat. The standard game covers the Battle of Denmark Strait in May, 1941, pitting Hood and Prince of Wales against the German Bismarck and Prinz Eugen. Another scenario covers the Battle of Mers-el-Kebir in July 1940, when British forces led by Hood neutralized the Vichy French fleet along the coast of North Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a heavily-revised version of The Mighty Hood, which appeared in Panzerschreck magazine #14. The new game provides new ship ratings, introduces new rules and modifications congruent with the Battleship Captain standard game system, and adds ships allowing gamers to recreate the Mers-el-Kebir scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battleship Captain is a &amp;quot;miniatures&amp;quot; game system with scenarios played on the tabletop or floor, using the rules and ship counters provided. Scale is 1&amp;quot;=1000 yards. The game emphasizes playability, as players maneuver their ships and try and defeat the enemy fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also requires a tape measure or ruler in inches, paper and pencil, and a six-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
