			<description>The purpose of this spin and move vintage space exploration game is to travel to as many planets as possible on the playing board starting at the rocket launching platform spot. The planets are located around the edge of a Monopoly style layout. Each player receives the celestial currency called Celestros upon visiting a planet. Players can encounter setbacks and benefits along the way by landing on specific squares. The game is over when all players return to the Launching Platform. The player with the greatest amount of currency wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has beautiful box graphics typical of the 50s era. The board has the spinner built into it and the playing pieces are colored plastic rockets very similar to that produced by the Lido corporation and seen in the board game Rocket Race to Saturn (1953). Rules are printed on the inside of the box lid and the game was produced by the E-Z game Manufacturing Corporation, New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
