			<description>From the publisher's website and press release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A neat mixture of Politics and strategies that gives you control on how intense to play (Casual relaxed social mood or competitive against opponents).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game kicks off as participants choose their favorite VOTE chips and PARTY card along with four PROP cards from the deck. Players then take turns campaigning, purchasing potential votes, and rolling the dice against opponents for State&amp;rsquo;s Supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Elections are called, votes counted, and winners of the Presidency, House/ Senate Majority, and Supreme Court judges are revealed. Players are paid according to the total number of VOTES earned. The cycle continues until someone wins the game by achieving Absolute Majority. Players use strategy to determine which states to campaign in, how much money to spend on a given state, and decide when to pass a BILL to hinder their opponents.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game can also be played as a type of POKER in a relaxed setting.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
