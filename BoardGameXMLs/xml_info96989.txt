							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test Drive II Car Disk: The Muscle Cars</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember when gas was cheap, cylinders were eight, and cubic inches meant something? Well, top off the tank, those days are back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are five All-American, street-scorching muscle cars for The Duel. Roll up your sleeves, squint into the sun, powershift down the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1963 Corvette Sting Ray &amp;quot;Split Window&amp;quot; Coupe--One of the greatest collector Corvettes of all. Designed to end the racetrack domination of the Ford-powered Cobra, it quickly became the king of the American road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1969 Dodge Charger Daytona--A street rocket with incredible macho power. Big tires, big engine, big appetite for long, straight blacktop. This muscle was all biceps - the last of a dying breed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1968 Shelby GT500 Cobra--The Carroll Shelby and Ford Mustang combo that destroyed challengers. On a good road - smooth and fast - its mighty engine bred confidence bordering on arrogance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1967 Pontiac GTO--Grand Turismo Omologato by birth, but nicknamed The Goat. It was the first American muscle car - a gutsy performer that frequently blew the doors off other production automobiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1969 COPO 95620 ZL-1 Camaro--If ever a killer Camaro existed, this was it. Only 69 were built, but its special-option, full-race, aluminum-block, 427-cubic-inch engine made it arguably the fastest American production car of all time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
