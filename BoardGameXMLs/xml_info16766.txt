			<description>Strange Behavior /  Ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 to 4 teams with 2 people on each team.  They take a piece and 3 color-matching tokens.  Each team starts off in a different corner.  There are a few path ways: one that goes all the way around the board and 2 pathways that intersect the board in the middle.  There are 3 stacks of cards: description, noun, and action.  Each card has 2 different words to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One players draws a card from each stack, picks 1 word from each card and then has to act the 3 word phrase out without using words, just noises and movements (ie. crazy monkey swimming...)  For each correct word guessed in 30 seconds, you get to move your piece toward another corner in order to collect a token from the corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If another player &amp;quot;runs into you&amp;quot; they send you back to the last corner you achieved a token from.  The first team to get a token from each corner and make it back to their home wins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
