			<description>From online description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple, yet realistic, fun board game that employs the principles of sailing and sailboat racing. Visualize sailing into the windward mark on a starboard tack, calling for right-a-way at the mark, or getting a big puff downwind to slip past several boats. Play by yourself or with up to eight players. Play your own boat by starting behind an imaginary line sailing to windward, tacking to avoid the head wind, rounding the mark, reaching to the second mark and on to the downwind leg of the course. The basic strategy involves port and starboard tacking and staying clear of the competition. Fun and instructive for the new sailor and a challenge for the experienced skipper. The whole family will love to play as there are no complicated wind changes and the game moves along at a pace that will keep everyone interested. Game is boxed and includes a playing board, eight pewter boats, chance cards and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
