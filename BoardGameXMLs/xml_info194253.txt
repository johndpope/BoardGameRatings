			<description>The year is 1525 in the Republic of Florence, and the city-state prospers under the rule of the Medici family.  It is a time of artistry, of education, and of invention.  All over the land, people are vying to find a patron, one of the rich noble families who will support and encourage a creative soul with their wealth, fame, and good name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the members of these illustrious nobility is looking for a fresh, young mind to carry into the halls of history.  To find the best and brightest, the Patron has organized a challenge.  All geniuses should seek to emulate the greatest man of their time, Leonardo da Vinci, and therefore, the most worthy artist will be the one who can turn Leonardo&amp;rsquo;s dreams into reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the Patron&amp;rsquo;s hopeful aspirants, you have been invited to one of daVinci&amp;rsquo;s private laboratories, to compete against other artists in their goal to follow in the late Master&amp;rsquo;s footsteps.  Your job is to maneuver around the puzzle that is daVinci&amp;rsquo;s lab, traversing the rotating gears of his workshop, all the while assembling a team of expert engineers to study and be the first to build a replica of one of da Vinci&amp;rsquo;s designs.  The first recruit to successfully assemble and test the proposed machine will win the coveted spot in the Patron&amp;rsquo;s household.  Do you have what it takes to win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to move around a moving gear board, with each gear offering up a different resource for your build - plans, engineers, tools, and materials.  The plans tell the players what other resources they need to collect.  Plans are played with cards, engineers and tools are played on tokens (so they can be left on a board location), and materials are played with shards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has all of the resources necessary to complete his build, they can move on to the final gear to assemble their creations, and then return to the beginning of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
