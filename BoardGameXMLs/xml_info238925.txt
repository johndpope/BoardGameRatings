			<description>For whatever reason, all of the freakishly aggressive predators in your care have escaped!  The surrounding wildlife is in danger!  As one of the only park rangers on duty, it&amp;rsquo;s your job to protect all of the adorable creatures in your reserve.  You are the only thing stopping a predator from an all you can eat baby buffet.&lt;br/&gt;Most games require a high score to win - not this game.  In PreyCare, you reduce your score by matching up cards in the same column.  The lower your score, the less blood you&amp;rsquo;ll have on your hands.  Be careful though, matching up cards activate special abilities that may not be what you were hoping for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple.  You have to match cards in the same column.  Failure to match up the cards means you have screwed up and your baby creature gets mauled.  Most games require you to have the highest score in order to win.  Not this game though.  Each point above zero is blood on your hands.  The player with the lowest score by the end of the game is the &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo;.  Reducing your score is simple: whenever you match two cards in the same column, their numbers cancel each other out and their value becomes zero.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t match a column up, well we have bad news for you.  You gotta add the numbers together &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s basically a kill count, you failure.  Add up all columns together, and the player with the least amount of carcasses is as close to a winner as they come &amp;ndash; considering the fact that you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with adorably dead animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
