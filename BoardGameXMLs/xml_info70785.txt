			<description>From The User Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1930s Europa, tensions rise to an all-time high between the continent's two distinct military powers - the Empire and the Federation. in the struggle for ultimate supremacy, the Second Europa War (E.W.II) erupts, and Gallia, the small independent nation situated between the two superpowers, now faces attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Empire's Imperial Army is first to strike Gallia, forcing the young lieutenant Welkin Gunther to pull back his small platoon. As the invading forces charge toward the capital city, Welkin not only discovers that they are outmatched in scale and weaponry, but the enemy also has Valkyria, an unusually powerful race, in their ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the war rages, the capital city is about to fall to the enemy, but Welkin's unique battle strategies bring hope to his homeland...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may be a chance for Gallia after all. This is Welkin's story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valkyria Chronicles puts you (Welkin) in a land very reminiscent of 1930's Europe.  The land is divided and ruled by two large warring factions: the Empire and the Federation.  Gallia sits between these two giants and the Empire has put plans into motion to move in and conquer this beautiful land.  Your story will revolve around the gentle but resolved Welkin and his friends of the Federation's 7th platoon as they work to restore peace to the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the story is engaging, it is really the gameplay that has made this game a quiet hit among strategy gamers.  Using a turn-based system, you are able to move your soldiers, tanks, and medics through a 3-D interactive battlefield.  While the game never quite feels like you're playing a first person shooter, the feeling that you are actually moving around, aiming, and shooting adds immeasurable depth and satisfaction to your skirmishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valkyria Chronicles was released in 2008 and a sequel has been made for the PSP only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
