							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Killer Reunion</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This murder mystery game is rated for Teen and Adult audiences. The murder does not take place at the party although there may be further murders that do. The main 12 characters are all couples very much in love. There are no affairs at all in this game. This game was created for church groups, class reunions or those looking for a VERY clean murder mystery game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also have a Mature rated Version. It is still relatively clean, but has more intrigue then the 'clean' version and it does have 1 past affair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Killer Reunion was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp;amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups, high school &amp;amp; college reunions or others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the same game as our Class of '57, but we removed all reference to year &amp;amp; school so that people could customize it to any year, decade or school. We have areas in the game that can be customized by you to perfectly match your event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/killerreunion.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/killerreunion.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
