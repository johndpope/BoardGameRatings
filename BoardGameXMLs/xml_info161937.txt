			<description>Tactical wargame designed for military training, played by two players or teams plus an umpire. The full game consists of a rulebook, 8 geomorphic map 1x1 meter boards with 3D terrain, and 1000 game pieces representing military units of company size and below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a free wargame, meaning there are very few rules. Players on each side write orders on map sheets and the umpire then makes all decisions on what the outcomes are, falling back to roll dice when not sure about something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
