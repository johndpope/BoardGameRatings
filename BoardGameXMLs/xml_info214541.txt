			<description>Brom Guest Box - a guest artist expansion for the Conan game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They were characteristic Argosean sailors, short and stockily built. Conan towered above them, and no two of them could match his strength. They were hardy and robust, but his was the endurance and vitality of a wolf, his thews steeled and his nerves whetted by the hardness of his life in the world's wastelands. He was quick to laugh, quick and terrible in his wrath. He was a valiant trencherman, and strong drink was a passion and a weakness with him. Naive as a child in many ways, unfamiliar with the sophistry of civilization, he was naturally intelligent, jealous of his rights, and dangerous as a hungry tiger. Young in years, he was hardened in warfare and wandering, and his sojourns in many lands were evident in his apparel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Robert E. Howard, Queen of the Black Coast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion lets you bring alternate versions of Conan the Barbarian and B&amp;ecirc;lit, Queen of the Black Coast, as envisioned by the legendary Brom, to your tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes come with a unique set of skills and equipment that adds more customisation and replay-ability to your games of Conan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of Conan is based on the Cimmerian's days as a thief and as such he appears slightly less powerful in combat. But he does come with more toolbox abilities fitting this new role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The version of B&amp;ecirc;lit in the core box is that of a charismatic leader, preferring to take a backfield roll. In Brom's version however, she has eschewed this passive attitude in order to lead from the front, blades flashing as she directs her men. Ambidextrous is her new talent, replacing a more defensive one on her other incarnation. This gives her a great deal of efficiency when it comes to performing quick and precise attacks. Her command ability means that she can count on her men to cover her flanks or hold up larger groups as she deals with other targets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Two plastic miniatures (Conan and B&amp;ecirc;lit), their two character sheets (one side in French, the other in English), and 12 equipment cards (six in French, six in English).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
