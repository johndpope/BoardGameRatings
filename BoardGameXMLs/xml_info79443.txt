							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, the Tuath were a mighty folk who strove against the goblins of the Tangled Wood for dominion over that ancient place. Defeated by treachery and their feral, warlike enemies the Tuath's civilisation was thrown down. Their settlements were sacked, their places of strength broken open and their holy places despoiled; the few survivors melted away into the trackless gloom of the deep forest leaving behind nothing but remnants of their once-great culture. The Road of the Dead, a ceremonial pathway representing a soul's journey to the underworld, is one such fragment that yet lingers in the Tangled Wood awaiting the brave or the foolhardy. A cunningly designed death-trap, it hides the forgotten treasures and legends of a fallen people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road of the Dead takes place on The Lonely Coast...but is easily adaptable to a GM's personal campaign. Raging Swan's first GO PLAY adventure, Road of the Dead contains everything a GM needs to get started quickly - an adventure that can be prepared in about one hour, an easy-to-use layout, six pre-generated characters and illustrated player handouts of every major encounter area and new magic item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
