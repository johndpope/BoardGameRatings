			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This (2016) is a very special year  for GRANNA - we are celebrating our 25th anniversary! Throughout all this time we have tried to provide all of you with the best games - the kind we would like to play ourselves. We would like  you to celebrate  this very special anniversary together with us. For this occasion we have prepared a little surprise. Open the box and enter the land of good games. Thank you for being with us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game 25 consists of a deck of 54 double-faced cards. They show pieces of the covers of 6 games published by Granna. Each cover picture is divided into 6 pieces. Each card's 2 sides show pieces from the same position of 2 different cover pictures. Each specific piece of a cover appears on 3 different cards in the deck. In a 2-player game, the goal is to make 2 complete pictures on the table. With 3 and 4 players, the goal is to make 1 complete picture on the table and collect 1 piece each of the 5 other pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
