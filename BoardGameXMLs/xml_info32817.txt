			<description>Players roll dice to determine which colored pieces they can activate. When activated, a player can do the following with the piece:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Place a small piece onto your home row under your control.&lt;br/&gt;  * Upgrade a piece you control or one that is standing.&lt;br/&gt;  * Move a piece you control&lt;br/&gt;  * Activate a lying piece you control by standing it up.&lt;br/&gt;  * Activate a standing piece by downgrading it. Apply area after downgrade.&lt;br/&gt;  * Take control of a standing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, during play, a piece is moved over and off your opponent's side of the board, place it aside. It is out of play and counts towards your win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have a piece of each color cross over and off your opponent&amp;rsquo;s home row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
