							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jamie Swise Mystery Games: Who Killed Lowell Weenaman?</name>
									
			<description>Mystery party game for 3 male and 3 female characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local television personality Lowell Weenaman, better known as Captain Weenie, was found murdered last night at Readenweep Racetrack.  Mr. Weenaman was making a personal appearance, in costume, as part of the track's season opening festivities.  The Captain Weenie Show, which totally lost its school age audience years ago, had become the rage of the age 25 to 45 crowd.  While scratchy cartoons and local magicians provided the bulk of the show's content, the program took on grotesque proportions when Weenaman peddled his Captain Weenie VCR Covers and Weenamagic, a do-it-all food processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a role playing game for 6 players, great for a fun evening.  The suspect characters include three local T.V. news personalities, a female sulky driver, a state racing board official, and a track character named Paddock Pete.  Cast yourself and friends in these roles and play to learn who murdered this most unusual nostalgia act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Time: December 1, 1985   The Place: Galesburg, OH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This game includes an audio cassette tape which, although not mandatory, is played at the start to set the mood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
