							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Breaking Point</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Breaking Point, technology managed to unlock superpowers. Manipulating energy, slowing or speeding time, altering their physiology, altering probability itself - all of these became accepted parts of life. Science fiction quickly became fact, and humanity was quick to adapt. The world is a thriving place, and what used to be miracles are now the cornerstone of people&amp;rsquo;s lives and identities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breaking Point is a system designed to allow you to take the place of one of these people, living in a near-future world and commanding special powers. With your fellows and a Gamemaster, the world is before you and the story is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
