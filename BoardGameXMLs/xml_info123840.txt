							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Solo Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solo Dungeon is designed to be compatible with the most widely used Fantasy, Character Role-playing rules which most of you will be using. This is a programmed dungeon which, if you haven't tried this system before, is easily explained and in fact runs thus:- Start by going to Page 1, Letter A and read the paragraph through. It will offer a number of choices from which you pick out the action you wish to take and then go to the appropriate number to find out what happens. Usually you will have another choice there and so on, until you either leave the dungeon or get eliminated. It is in effect, a manual computer programme such as those used in certain 'Teach Yourself' books. The only other items which you will require are a set of dice and pencil &amp;amp; paper for mapping (unless you get a thrill from becoming hopelessly lost).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
