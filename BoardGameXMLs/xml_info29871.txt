							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Pate</name>
									
			<description>The game &amp;quot;Der Pate&amp;quot; was included in Spielbox 6/90 as part of the &amp;quot;Spiel im Heft/Game in the zine&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is played on a large hexagon containing 184 hexes. 6 home cities in the middle circle are surrounded by 2 x 6 free cities in the outer and inner part of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 playing pieces and 1 special piece (the &amp;quot;pate&amp;quot;) per player are provided, but at the beginning of the game, each player just starts with 2 pieces and his pate in one of the 6 home cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the number of players, 26-72 playing cards are needed for play (one suit=13 cards per player). These cards enable to buy new playing pieces, make movements or assassination attempts and help to protect your pate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pate is a figure that you must protect from being lost, because otherwise, you have to start from the beginning, with just the 2+1 playing pieces. The best protection would be to marry him and to get a son, who can replace your pate if needed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the first player occupies 7 of the 12 free cities, the game is over and he is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
