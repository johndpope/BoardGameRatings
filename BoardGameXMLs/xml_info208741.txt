							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fire Temple of the Elder Elemental God</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After resurrecting the Air temple, Theleb went in search of the 3rd temple in his quest -- The temple dedicated to the Element of Fire. Theleb used the ancient texts and found the Fire Temple in the underdark of the Yatil Mountains. He was surprised to find the temple in this cold location and even more surprised that the temple was not in ruin. A Mind Flair named Irrlan, who is a Cleric of the Elder, was in charge of the temple. Irrlan is the High Priest of a secret organization that still worships the Elder. Irrlan was skeptical of Theleb&amp;rsquo;s arrival and was ready to destroy Theleb (or at least try) because he knew the secret location of the temple. After much discussion Theleb was able to convince the cleric with the ancient texts that his story was true and that he should be a major part of his plan. The Mind Flair Cleric laughed and explained the situation of the Temple with Theleb. His story brought much to light at how well prepared the temple was for Theleb&amp;rsquo;s ultimate plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 10th - 14th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
