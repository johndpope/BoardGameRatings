			<description>Who'd want to be a mouse? There's so little cheese around, and mousetraps are everywhere! &lt;br/&gt; Not only that, enemy mice are afoot, armed to the teeth with crossbows, plasma grenades, shotguns, flamethrowers, bazookas, evil space lasers and a host of special powers! &lt;br/&gt; In the fast-paced card game Cheese Or Die, players take on the role of mice competing to horde the most cheese, whilst arming up in a bid to steal cheese from their opponents. Will you take your chances and draw from the Cheese Deck - a deck which becomes increasingly 'dangerous' as the game goes on - or play the long game by collecting weapons and bonuses, and smashing your rivals in combat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you'll need to be ruthless and pick your fights carefully.&lt;br/&gt; Oh, and avoid proximity mines...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cheese Or Die, the first player to collect 6 cheese cards wins... but this can be difficult! To do this, players can attack opponents by choosing a weapon card from their hand, adding any bonuses, and playing any number of special cards on top. Expect brutal fights with lots of surprises! Special cards allow you to alter the normal victory conditions of the game, or mess with your opponents' combat total, for example. Only if attackers win can they draw a card from the defender's cheese cards. Just don't draw a mine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also the Cheese Deck, which has its own dynamics. Players can take a chance and draw directly from this deck, or set traps for their opponents by looking ahead and loading the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all this is a fast, fun and tense card game that provides some hilarious moments! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
