			<description>STORYLINE: Somewhere in an old funfair, Little Charlie owns an attraction that features a special kind of trampolines. Far from being a childish game, the tournaments he arranges provide a challenge for memory, tactics and intuition. Will you be able to set clever traps for your opponents while avoiding to get caught in theirs... or even yours?&lt;br/&gt;MATERIAL: AN 8x8 board, 48 tiles and 4 counters in different colors.&lt;br/&gt;TRAMPOLINES (TILES):Charlie&amp;acute;s trampolines do not allow to jump the way the user pleases, but only in certain directions (according to the arrows inscribed in the tiles) which are revealed just when they are trodden on. The arrows are in three colours: green (1-space jump), orange (2-spaces jump) and red (3-spaces jump). Besides, there are two types of arrows: one-way (self explanatory) and multidirectional (the user may choose among two o three possibilities). Finally, there also exist two &amp;lsquo;fake&amp;rsquo; trampolines that once occupied will tumble down and will make the player lose its counter.&lt;br/&gt;GOAL:  To be the last player remaining on the board, the rest having fallen in a hole or being forced to jump out of the trampolines field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
