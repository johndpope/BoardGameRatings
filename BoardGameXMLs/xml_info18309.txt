			<description>Arena is a simple boardgame for 2-4 players where each player has to try to move his or her gladiators from his or her table-end to the other end of the board. A die-roll determines whether a player may move their gladiators (1-4) or the lion (5-6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each gladiator has a weapon (net, trident or knife) and this weapon determines whether that gladiator can capture another gladiator (net captures trident, trident captures knife and knife captures net). The lion captures any gladiator it land on. Captured gladiators must start at that players table-end. The first player to move all his or her gladiators from the opposite table-end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
