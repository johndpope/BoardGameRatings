			<description>Ghost Rider is a third-person game released for the Game Boy Advance based around the movie of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's storyline is a sequel to the movie, and was penned by Marvel writers Garth Ennis and Jimmy Palmiotti. Players can play as Ghost Rider both on foot, or on the Hellcycle. The villains are both from the movie and the comic, including Scarecrow, Deathwatch, Lilith, Blackout, Vengeance and Blackheart, and for the GBA version, Mephisto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a system reminiscent to that of God of War and Devil May Cry, even having some of the same controls and style of attacks. Combos are done with bare hands and with the Demonic chain. The overall mood, setting and visual style are very much the same as those in the first installment of Devil May Cry. When on the Hellcycle, Ghost Rider is still capable of performing many of the same chain attacks, and can shoot hellfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Boy Advance version has some elements of Road Rash and Castlevania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ghost Rider (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
