							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Average Modern Bowling Alley</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob sat at the snack bar sipping cheap beer out of a plastic cup. The crashing of the pins and the mindless chatter of the two teenagers behind the counter were about to drive him insane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob hated bowling alleys. It wasn't the people so much as the cacophony of sound that clawed at his brain. However, this is where his contact wanted to meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So...I know where the bomb is or rather where it will be,&amp;quot; the short rotund man said with a smile in his voice as he slipped onto a stool next to Jacob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob glanced and saw Vinnie dressed in jeans and a black and white bowling shirt. Jacob opened his mouth to launch a sarcastic remark, but came up short as he felt something wet smack the side of his face. He turned and looked at Vinnie, who wore a shocked expression on what remained of his face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture as well as hex and square grids.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: a 100 DPI .JPG file, that contains no square or hex grid, has been added to support most VTT programs!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is your basic neighborhood bowling alley. The building is over 20,000 square feet with 12 lanes, a snack bar and a pool/arcade area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
