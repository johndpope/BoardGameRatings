			<description>The year is 2025, and the war on crime is all but lost. The streets are filled with fear as abandoned buildings and darkened alleyways haunt the imaginations of the few innocent citizens brave enough to remain. Gunfire echoes across the cities as gang violence brings vast urban decay. The global war between the Mafia and Triad syndicates has brought civil society to its knees. The fate of the criminal world is to be decided by the force you can muster and economies you can develop in the ultimate crime war that is: INFRACTION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play consists of hiring mercenaries and building developments. Each player is trying to kill the other's boss. Using mercenaries to attack, and developments to gain riches, as well as the odd trick 'o' trade, they try to dominate the board in the hope of wounding the enemy boss. The game starts with each player drawing cards and using a family bank balance as a kickstart to their criminal empire. From here you build your syndicate over the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
