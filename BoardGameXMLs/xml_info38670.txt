			<description>Its time to go grocery shopping! Learn to do what wise shoppers do &amp;mdash; scout ads for best buys! Grocery Cart involves players in four important life skills: comparing grocery ads, making correct payment for purchases, keeping accurate financial records, and reconciling cash on hand with shopping records. The winner is the player who makes the best purchases, makes correct payments, and keeps accurate records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two levels of play allow players in grades 4 and up to benefit. Eight grocery ads are included. Players are encouraged to substitute local ads to further increase realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
