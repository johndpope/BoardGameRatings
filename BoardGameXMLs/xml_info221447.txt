			<description>From the Publishers homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Finesse Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every runner knows there are times when you need to throw grenades at gasoline trucks, and other times when more discretion and subtlety is called for. True pros distinguish themselves with precise operations that are noticed by no one besides their target&amp;mdash;but those targets see enough to push them over the edge of sanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Mission, runners get an assignment that is easy to describe but difficult to execute. The job? Ruin a life. The method? That&amp;rsquo;s where the runners come in. They&amp;rsquo;ll have to exercise all their creativity and sneakiness to plan and pull off this job&amp;mdash;unless they want the police and some nasty corporate security putting their work to an early end. Do runners have the smarts, stealth, and deviousness to pull this off? As always, the answer is another question: How badly do they want to get paid?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do No Harm is the latest Shadowrun Mission set in Chicago, bringing a new twist and degree of freedom to runners who take it on. The Mission is for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition, and plot elements could also be used with Shadowrun: Anarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
