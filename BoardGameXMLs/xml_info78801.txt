							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ridge Racer 7</name>
									
			<description>Ridge Racer 7 is an installment in the Ridge Racer series of racing games, released on PlayStation 3. The game has around 40 cars, many of which return from Ridge Racer 6 and the PSP incarnations of the game. There are also 22 courses, available in forward, reverse and mirror mode. The game runs at 1080p resolution and at 60 frames per second. It also features Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and free online gameplay via the PlayStation Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay revolves around highspeed circuit racing featuring Ridge Racer's &amp;quot;drift&amp;quot; handling, where the player slides the car around hairpin turns without any great loss of speed. New features to this iteration include car body and engine customization which can have an impact on the performance, handling and nitrous system of the car. Ridge Racer 7 also boosted the use of slipstreaming as a prominent feature in the game, compared to previous iterations which included the feature but did not show its presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Ridge Racer 7 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
