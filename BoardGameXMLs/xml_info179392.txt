							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Collected Magic of Palladium Books</name>
									
			<description>What you hold in your hands is the collected eight issues of &amp;quot;MOP&amp;quot; - better known as The Magic of Palladium Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some ways, MOP was a forerunner to The RifterTM. Like The Rifter&amp;trade;, it had news, coming attractions and special sourcebook type features. The BIG differences were that MOP was only 16 pages, printed on newsprint (a tabloid), a bit smaller than 8 1/2 x II, and cost only 50 cents. It was an inexpensive &amp;quot;give-away&amp;quot; promotional item sold to distributors at below our cost, given to stores and handed out free or sold for 50 cents to garners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a lot of ways, the Collected Magic of Palladium is a time capsule. It carne out sporadically from 1988 to 1991. We've reproduced them exactly as they originally appeared (minus the color), including the old advertisements, press releases and everything. The end result is a look back at what we were saying, doing and planning TEN YEARS AGO!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Siembieda, 1999&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Part of description from the book Introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
