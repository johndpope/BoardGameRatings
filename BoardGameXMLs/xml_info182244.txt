			<description>Shuffle the 36 knight cards and deal all the deck to all the players. Each player keeps these cards as a face down pile in front of him. At the same time, they reveal the first card of their deck. The one that revealed the highest card takes all of the cards and place them under his deck. If there are ties for the highest card, tied players play a second card face down, then a third card face up to see who wins all the cards in play. If an other tie occurs, you repeat (one face down, then one face up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player loses all of his cards, he is out of the game. The winner is the one that won all the 36 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drawings and the lenght of the weapons help the children players to understand the cards value : The longest blade wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
