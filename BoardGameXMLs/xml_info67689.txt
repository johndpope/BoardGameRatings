							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Dragon&#039;s Lair</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ice tunnel comes to an end and you enter in a cold cavern filled with ice, a frozen pool stands just beside you. Suddenly a cloud of frozen air sneaks from behind a stalactite followed by a loud roar&amp;hellip; The white dragon&amp;rsquo;s lair consists of three sequential caverns; in the caverns are scattered stalactites and ice crystals that give an eerie feel to the complex. The first cavern contains a frozen water pool, just beside the entrance. The second chamber is where probably the dragon spends most of its time and contains nothing (if the dragon is out for food) or it may contain the dragon&amp;rsquo;s eggs. The third cavern is the most wished by all adventurers: the treasure chamber. Here all kinds of treasures are scattered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some hints to use the lair:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The PCs are hunting for the dragon&amp;rsquo;s lair in a solitary mountain. When the party enters the cavern, they find a number of runes encircling the frozen pool. The runes seem to have been erased in some spots. A PC wizard may tell the runes indicate some sort of summoning. In the second cavern, the party finds a frozen corpse of a wizard, already grasping a frozen staff. The wizard attempted to slay the dragon by summoning a powerful ice devil. The devil slaughtered the wizard and killed the dragon but fell prey of a mighty magical item in the treasure vault, which bounded him there; Now, the gelugon is waiting for an opportunity to flee and the PCs may be that opportunity&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;     The PCs are hired by an old man that claim to have a map leading to a treasure cavern of a now dead dragon. The old man leads the PCs to the cavern. When the PCs arrive in the second chamber, they find the frozen remains of an adventuring party. One of the corpses grasps a strange magical item, a small statuette shaped as a white dragon. Once the PCs put the item in a sack, the old man polymorphs in a white dragon. The magical item have the power, if not hidden by something, to repel a white dragon. While the dragon managed to slay the group, the statuette remained in clear view and the wyrm needed someone to cover the magical item on his behalf. Once covered, of course, the dragon has no need of the party&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
