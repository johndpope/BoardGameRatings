			<description>Stay linked and on track as you twist and criss-cross hands and feet in this fun and physical game for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jungoeira comprises eighteen foot-pads and eighteen hand-pads, and a deck of &amp;lsquo;track&amp;rsquo; cards all packed in a handy rucksack. Players lay out a track of hands and feet as shown on one of the cards (two tracks if you are playing in two teams). Then players race along the track placing a foot on a foot-pad and a hand on a hand-pad, all the while staying linked to the person in front and behind &amp;ndash; often with hilarious results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jungoeira, published early this year and already a hit in Scandinavia, was devised by Oxford Games&amp;rsquo; very own Frederica Scott Vollrath. So we are delighted to be able to introduce this fun-filled party game to the UK as an Oxford Games exclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
