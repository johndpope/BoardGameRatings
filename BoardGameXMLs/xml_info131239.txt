			<description>Fanticide is a whimsically grim skirmish game for battles between opposing homicidal warbands.  Open Architecture and clear guidelines for building any kind of war band you want with figures you want to use. Ruleset is friendly to any miniatures, including historicals. Starting bands include centaurs, fae, creeps, and the flying monkeys from the Land of Od.  Does not use an &amp;ldquo;I go, you go&amp;rdquo; turn sequence. Instead, it uses a card driven sequence, full of events and interesting command &amp;amp; control choices for determining what units can move and act.  These cards are assigned to each unit, character and monster in the game.  These activation cards are drawn one at a time and the units are activated in turn. There are also Event cards that are shuffled in with the activation cards which produce random outcomes like killer unicorns enraged by the &amp;lsquo;Rainbow&amp;rsquo; Event.   Easy to learn but challenges and rewards intelligent game play.  30 to 40 figures per side is typical. D10 Combat and magic is simple but gives an interactive and satisfying result.  &lt;br/&gt; Sculpting by Mike Broadbent, Alan Marsh, Paul Clarke, and Ernest Baker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
