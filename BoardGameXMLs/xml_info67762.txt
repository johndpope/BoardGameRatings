			<description>A strategic fantasy adventure of quests and treasures, battles and diplomacy. Be the first to establish your domain by reuniting the realms of man and beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is randomly generated using 25 tiles which contain various terrains (or domains): mountains, forests, deserts and seas. Each player receives one pawn (gold, silver, black or white in color). All pawns begin the adventure at the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village is surrounded by 4 ancient ruins which contain various treasures (again randomly generated by shuffling and arranging Treasure Cards at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must land on an &amp;quot;undiscovered&amp;quot; ruin for their first turn. A player is assigned one of the 4 domains listed above based upon the ruin they discover on this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other 20 tiles on the map are called realms. They are controlled by colonies of mythical men and beasts. Each player's domain consists of 5 realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player must scout each of these realms to receive quests for specific treasures (these, too, are randomly generated by arranging cards at the start of the game). A player takes control of a realm by completing its quest. The first player to control all 5 realms in their domain wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is enhanced by the fact that each treasure has a power that a player may use to their own advantage for as long as they possess it. Players may also trade with and battle each other for the treasures they need to complete their quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
