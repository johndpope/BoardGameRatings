							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Game of Tales and Thrilling Stories: Adventure 1 â€“ The Museum Case</name>
									
			<description>You are a group of four kids and best friends. It seemed to be a day like every other day when something happened that got you really upset. A boy from your neighborhood stole money from one of your friends. You decide to get the money back. The thief hides in an old villa and you go inside. This is where the adventure begins that will turn to The Museum Case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game of Tales and Thrilling Stories is a rules system for story-driven board games that does not require one player to take the role of a game master or narrator of the story. The system is similar to paragraph driven games, but follows a pre-defined story and therefore provides a more integrated story experience. The story elements are not written in a paragraph book but communicated through cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
