			<description>Sc&amp;eacute;nario is a game about producing movies. It is a trivia game with set collection and negotiation elements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players' goal is to make and publish movies. Movies are made by collecting a set of matching Actors, Title, Director and Producer cards as well as enough money to produce the movie. Money and cards are collected by moving on the gameboard and answering movie-related questions. A player can only have one card of each type in hand, so if additional cards are collected (for example a second Director card), they can be either discarded or traded with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement on the board uses a roll-and-move mechanic, with a few tweaks, like no &amp;quot;reroll&amp;quot; spaces, and several spaces allow the player to move her game piece anywhere she wants on the board. At first players only have access to the board spaces that allow them to collect cards or money (provided they correctly answer a question). Once a player has at least produced at least one movie, she gains access to all of the gameboard, including spaces which allow players to collect cash from their produced movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has made more movies than other competitors, she can win the game by going to the &amp;quot;Palme d'Or&amp;quot; space and answering a special question. End of game questions are designed to be more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sc&amp;eacute;nario won the 1989 &amp;quot;As d'Or&amp;quot; for best simulation game at the Cannes international games festival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
