			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome back, agents&amp;hellip; As you know, the Shop's defection last year was a major blow to the Archer Foundation, and more specifically, the Company. My predecessor as Control of this organization, Dennis Gray, led the betrayal; worse, the Company is now riddled with Shop moles. Thanks to our compromised security, mounting operations against the Shop in Company territory is difficult at best, explosive at worst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, we've caught a break. Recently, another of our field teams shut down a Shop operation in San Francisco. The fallout of that incident has afforded us with our first real chance to take the fight to the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, I can't tell you more than that at this time. Even here, at the Kennel, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance the enemy has eyes and ears about, and I&amp;rsquo;m not willing risk tipping our hand before we&amp;rsquo;re ready to ante up. Within this packet are the details of Operation: TURNABOUT. The security tape is not to be removed until you are en route to your destination. Your pilot will be briefed about your target destination once you are in the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've got the tiger by the tail agents: for once, we have the initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t blow it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
