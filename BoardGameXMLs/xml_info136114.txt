							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second game in the Shock Troopers Series. It is considered to be a standalone title since the plot has no connection with the first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay system has been drastically changed because only 4 characters are selectable and the team mode from the first game is not featured in this. Also, the graphics has a more cartoon-feel to it and the sprites are a combination of 2D and 3D, although the game is completely in 2D since the 3D graphics are pre-rendered. There is also the ability to ride some vehicles, as in the Metal Slug games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The follow-up is more violent than its predecessor because the enemies die in unique ways despite their cartoon-like appearance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
