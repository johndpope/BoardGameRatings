							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ultimate 11: SNK Football Championship</name>
									
			<description>Published in 1996 (Japanese title: Tokuten Ou - Honoo no Libero, &amp;quot;Goal-Scoring King: The Flaming Sweeper&amp;quot;; despite the international title, it is still considered the fourth game in the series. Sometimes the game is known as Super Sidekicks 4 due to the fact the game is 4th in the series), it features 80 national teams divided into 8 regions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Europe A: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Wales, France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland (as North Ireland), Iceland&lt;br/&gt;    Europe B: Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, Croatia&lt;br/&gt;    Europe C: Bulgaria, Russia, Turkey, Czech Republic, Romania, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Israel&lt;br/&gt;    Africa: Nigeria, Cameroon, Zambia, C&amp;ocirc;te d'Ivoire, South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Zimbabwe, Tunisia, Algeria&lt;br/&gt;    Americas/Caribbean Sea: United States, Canada, El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Honduras&lt;br/&gt;    South America: Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Paraguay (returns from Super Sidekicks 2), Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela&lt;br/&gt;    Asia/Oceania A: Saudi Arabia, India, Iraq, U. A. E., Iran, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Uzbekistan&lt;br/&gt;    Asia/Oceania B: Australia, China, Taiwan, Thailand, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players scoring the goals are still named, but individual scores are no longer kept. The regional tournaments have been eliminated and replaced with alternate mode the SNK Football Championship, which is the game's namesake, an elimination tournament in which your team can select any one opponent from any region to play (similar to fighting games in which you face another character after beating a previous one until you reach the boss). The last region you play is the deciding match. If you're good and can make a lot of goals on your opponents, you can play a hidden boss team called the SNK Superstars, which features characters from SNK's fighting games as players (you can tell them when their names are called, as during fouls).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's in the basic game play where The Ultimate 11 has its most deciding improvement. Teams now have a charge bar (similar to the one in fighting games), which is charged depending on how long you can keep the ball under your team's control. When the bar is fully charged and flashing, if you're near the goal, you can take a shot that is virtually unblockable, depending on the opposing team. Teams are &amp;quot;ranked&amp;quot; from 1 to 80 mirroring their real-life counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate 11 was one of the few Neo-Geo games to feature a corporate sponsor: Akai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also being released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in July 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Sidekicks&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
