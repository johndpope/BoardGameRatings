			<description>Alchemy Gothic Treasury&lt;br/&gt;Vampire Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Roller-Dice Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object:&lt;br/&gt;A two-player game, played in two turns.&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes his turn to see who can be the most successful Vampire, roaming the night and attacking victims, before the Vampire Hunter eventually kills him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, one player is the Vampire, while the other is the Vampire Hunter. When the Vampire is eventually killed, the players reverse roles for the second turn and the Vampire who finishes the best &amp;lsquo;score&amp;rsquo; of victims, wins.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn lasts as many nights as the Vampire can stay alive, with each die roll representing one night. The Vampire rolls first and notes his &amp;lsquo;score&amp;rsquo;. The Vampire Hunter then rolls to try to kill the Vampire or save his victims. This continues with the Vampire adding his score, until he is eventually killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vampire&amp;rsquo;s roller-die is marked with:&lt;br/&gt;3 bats        = 3 victims this night.&lt;br/&gt;2 bats        = 2 victims this night.&lt;br/&gt;1 bat            = 1 victim this night.&lt;br/&gt;Sunrise        = No victims caught on this night.&lt;br/&gt;Fangs        = Attacks the Vampire Hunter and wins two free nights, (without a Vampire Hunter die roll).&lt;br/&gt;Coffin        = Remains resting in Coffin for the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vampire Hunter&amp;rsquo;s roller-die is marked with:&lt;br/&gt;Garlic        = Saves (cancels) all Vampire victims this night.&lt;br/&gt;Crucifix        = Defends against, (cancels) Fangs.&lt;br/&gt;Decapitation    = Kills the Vampire, if not in his Coffin.&lt;br/&gt;Stake        = Kills the Vampire, if caught in his Coffin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
