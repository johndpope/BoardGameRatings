			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play out dynamic games of Pixel Tactics against friends and rivals, or take on the 100+ stage solo challenge modes to unlock new cards, place on worldwide leader boards, and collect new cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will receive some free cards to start their adventure, and can expand their collection by purchasing structured campaigns (either with real or in-game currency) that take you to various venues from the world of Pixel Tactics. Each campaign comes with a handful of new cards and 24 solo challenges to tackle. Overcoming these single-player challenges will further expand your collection and give you access to new Leaders, each of whom possess a powerful new ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pixel Tactics Online is more than just a digital re-implementation of the tabletop card game. The game is rebalanced, retouched, and optimized for digital play across numerous devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Structured online events, such as seasonal ladders, tournaments, limited drafts, and special event variants!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
