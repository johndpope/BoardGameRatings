			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayRoom, which comes pre-installed on every PlayStation 4 system, is an augmented reality simulator in which players utilize the PlayStation4 Camera and DualShock 4 controller to connect their living room to their PlayStation for a fully-integrated digital playground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayRoom allows for other devices to be included as well for a fully connected experience. Plaers can use a smartphone, tablet, or PlayStation Vita to draw anything they like, flick it out onto their TV screen using the touchscreen and watch it become a 3D toy for the AR Bots inside The PlayRoom to chase after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayRoom includes facial recognition, a robot companion named Asobi, AR bots, a digital and dynamic air hockey table, and other features to demonstrate the combined capability of the PlayStation 4 Camera and DualShock 4 controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
