							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Checkpoint X</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Checkpoint, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we can just make it to Checkpoint X we can negotiate with the soldiers and get to the safe zone away from here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product includes a single map of a ruined military checkpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in modern, post apocalyptic, horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with Checkpoint X:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Continuation: The survivors lived through the zombie rail attack in Modern Ruins 3. Using the repaired train and rails, they successfully make it to a train station in the next town and rush north towards Checkpoint X, a military outpost along the quarantine zone of the zombie-infected area. Hoping to get out of the quarantine zone, the survivors want to negotiate with the military personnel stationed there to get out of the quarantine zone. Zombies chase them towards the military outpost. When they arrive, they find the army there&amp;hellip;a zombie army. The survivors need to kill the zombies to the north and south and get out through the northern checkpoint gate to get out of the city. Perhaps they find an operable jeep with a 50-caliber machine gun or a military truck with a weapons cache of military grade weapons that can get them out of the town on the other side of the checkpoint tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
