			<description>from the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic Man To Man Combat 1491 A.D. to 2060 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a complete and realistic look at small arms conflict from early matchlocks to futuristic blasters. This system is modular and may be used with any role-playing system or game. It is intended for the player who wishes to accurately simulate a small arms conflict but does not wish to sacrifice playability. Computer-generated tables allow you tremendous realism with little effort. The system is easy to learn and includes the following key features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Simultaneous movement and fire without written orders or turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic representation of weapon accuracy, penetration, and damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Data for over 190 weapons from early matchlocks to futuristic blasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Accurate rules for automatic weapons, shotguns, and hand grenades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Protection afforded by cover and body armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     And above all, 59 anatomical hit location tables, which do away with &amp;quot;Hit Points&amp;quot; and other such arbitrary measures of how many times you have to shoot your opponent to drop him. This system shows the real results of a bullet wound, whether a graze or direct hit, and its effects on short-term performance and long-term chances of survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules blend realism with playability to create a system that is fast moving, easy to learn, with accuracy beyond that of any previous game. Moreover, it is suitable for use with ALL small arms oriented role-playing games, or as a stand-alone combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We invite YOU to experience the full Spectrum of armed conflict...and move up to the Leading Edge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
