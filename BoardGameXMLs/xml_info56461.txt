							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Duel with the Destroyers</name>
									
			<description>[From the editorial introduction.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to our first V&amp;amp;V scenario, eh? What you have here is not only an incredibly good adventure (though it certainly is that) but also a sneak preview of the way V&amp;amp;V is going and a salute to the way it used to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEATH DUEL WITH THE DESTROYERS has been designed to be fully playable with either the original V&amp;amp;V rules or with the new improved edition which is soon to be released. This way we can sell you the scenario now before the new rules come out but still give you a taste of 'em so you'll buy those as well, see?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this ingenious plot of ours, I promise you won't be wasting your money - - and I strongly suspect that all future V&amp;amp;V releases will be equally worthwhile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENJOY!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
