							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Creatures of the Nile</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals of Myth and Legend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals serve an important role in legends and folklore, and in few places is this more true than in the ancient lands of the Nile, home to such exotic and wondrous creatures as crocodiles, hippopotamuses, hawks, and serpents, to name a few. But while these creatures may be objects of importance in adventures set in the Nile (or other rich oases like it), they tend not to be very interesting at the game table. Animals rarely get special or unique abilities in their stat-blocks, meaning that they tend to make for rather dull or forgettable encounters, and their combat abilities are easily divorced from their in-game identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this may be fine for average animals, and even their dire cousins, mythic animals demand something more. All four animals provided in this book have unique and exciting special abilities that truly make them mythic. Watch your players quake as a Nile hawk&amp;rsquo;s shadow passes over them, or surprise them with Nile crocodiles that, among other powers, are completely invisible when in water. The deadly Nile serpent, with its ability to transmute itself into water, can slip through nearly any barricade to get at potential prey in the night, and the fearsome Nile hippopotamus can swallow victims whole in a single, sudden gulp, and subject any survivors to the deadly Nile sweats disease, which is all but impossible to remove, and must be endured for its (mercifully short) duration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
