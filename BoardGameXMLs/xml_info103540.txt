			<description>(from the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;Nowhere in the world has magic and its research a higher priority than in Xarxaron. In this land, that is under the control of the magic princes of the Optimate house of Tharamnos, knowledge is the most precious commodity. It gives the rulers of Xarxaron a tiny advantage in the battle against the faceless hordes from the neighboring Draydal&amp;acirc;n. However, even within the venerable house of Tharamnos the search for ancient secrets lead to bloody conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;When you reach the remote city of scholars called Masachora, you do not presumme that you are drawn quickly into such a conflict. You have heard of the Library of Tychondorias: a temple of wisdom from the early days of the Empire and the center of Masachoras. But you did not schedule a nighttime visit to these ancient halls. On the one hand, the access is permitted only to members of the house of Tharamnos, on the other hand, a curse is said to be lie on the library, that no one could escape at night.&lt;br/&gt;But a meeting with the young Optimate Gylderianius make your plans quickly fail. And before you know it, you are in the cursed halls - surrounded by deadly traps, pursued by hellish creatures and confronted with the intricate puzzles of a madman. Only when you reach the Forbidden Chamber, you might have a chance to escape ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
