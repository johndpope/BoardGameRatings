			<description>In this ultimate battle card game, powerful SOURCE wizards face each other in a spell casting show down!  Two to four players move around the play area, made up of hidden Spell Cards, collecting and combining sets of cards to make powerful spells to unleash on the other wizards!  The aim of SOURCES is simply to defeat your opponents - the last wizard standing wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spell Cards come in four types, representing the power Source for each wizard &amp;ndash; Fire (red), Earth (green), Water (blue) and Air (yellow). In each of these four Sources there are seven spell types (Molten Rock, Fist of Air, Acid Spray, Cone of Cold, The Orb, Sound Wave and Concussion Bolt).  Combining these together in sets of one Source, or one spell type (eg. Molten Rock), creates spells that cause damage.  Even more powerful spells can be made by combining specific sets of spell types in one Source colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 20 Life (indicated by a d20), a hand of four Spell Cards, and the play area is laid as a 4 X 4 grid of Spell Cards that start face down, with the remainder of the Spell Cards set aside as a draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players can perform a number of different actions once each:&lt;br/&gt;- Take a Spell Card from the draw pile if they have a hand of fewer than four&lt;br/&gt;- Move their wizard avatar from one Spell Card in the play area to another adjacent card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Reveal the Spell Card their avatar is on, choosing whether to trade this with one in their hand or not (either way a Spell Card has to be replaced back in the play area)&lt;br/&gt;     Attack another player by discarding a set of three Spell Cards.  There are three types of attacks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1- Source attacks - three Spell Cards from the same Source colour, this type of attack only does 2 damage&lt;br/&gt;2- Basic spell attack - three Spell Cards of the same spell type (eg. Molten Rock) from any of the four Source colours, doing the damage indicated by the spell type (1 to 7 damage)&lt;br/&gt;3- Advanced spell attacks - each Spell Card has a combination attack written on it, consisting of three different spell types (all in the same Source colour). These attacks are the hardest to collect, and do the most damage (8 to 12 damage).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
