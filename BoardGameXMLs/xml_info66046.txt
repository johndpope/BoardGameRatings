			<description>From the game's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N/AI is a role playing game where the characters are programs in a world-spanning internet gone horribly wrong. Something has happened, but no one can seem to remember what it was. And now sentient programs fill the digital world, and even fewer are at all interested in knowing where they came from...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes of the computer network are the PCs, or player characters. The PCs are sentient programs, who try to investigate whatever it is that caused a rift between the digital and physical worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
