							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mystery at Port Greely</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MYSTERY at PORT GREELY&amp;trade;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure in Hyperborea designed for from four to six characters of 4th through 6th level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until about three years ago, the peculiar town of Port Greely was renowned as a prolific exporter of crustaceans. Then the Greely lobstermen severed all ties with outside partners. Subsequent attempts at renegotiation were shunned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More recently, a small group of Fishmongers&amp;rsquo; Guild representatives from the City-State of Khromarium has gone missing in Port Greely, and answers have been less than forthcoming. At present, the Guild seeks answers. It wants to know what became of its representatives, and it wishes to re-establish its lucrative partnership with the Port Greely lobstermen. Your party have been contracted to help resolve The Mystery at Port Greely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mystery at Port Greely takes players into an action-packed realm of adventure: the mythical world of Hyperborea, a sword-and-sorcery campaign setting inspired by the fantastic fiction of Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, and others. This adventure is designed for Astonishing Swordsmen &amp;amp; Sorcerers of Hyperborea&amp;trade; (AS&amp;amp;SH&amp;trade;), a role-playing game descended from the original 1974 fantasy wargame and miniatures campaign rules as conceived by E. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. Therefore, AS&amp;amp;SH is compatible with most traditional fantasy role-playing games (c. 1974 to 1999) and their modern simulacra, such as OSRIC&amp;trade; and Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry&amp;trade;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
