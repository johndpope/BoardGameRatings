							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City in Peril</name>
									
			<description>Flames, floods, biohazards, craters, and evil robots abound everywhere. Will you sit idly by and watch, or will you spring into action? Compete against your friends, rivals, and enemies by navigating the city using 91 unique combinations of powers. Rescue the most civilians and prove that you are the greatest hero in the city! Welcome to City in Peril!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a two to four person, free-for-all tactical navigation game. It plays in about 30-60 minutes regardless of the number of players. Each player controls a hero, and the goal of the game is to rescue the most civilians. There are 100 civilians that spawn throughout the game at an increasing rate. Players repeatedly navigate their hero from their corner of the city to the opposite corner using abilities from a common power pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a top-down view of a city. There is a 6 by 6 grid of street intersections that have one of five obstacles. Civilians appear at these intersections by dice rolls, but the heroes must use power cards to get to them. Each turn, a player chooses one of five pairs of power cards. After their turn is over, the abilities are discarded and replaced by a new pair of cards. Game-play continues until all the civilians are saved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a unique starting corner of the board and must move forward towards the opposite corner. Although there is a common pool of powers available to all players, what is useful to one player might not be useful to another. Players who are too greedy to rescue a lot of civilians in a single turn, might find themselves poorly positioned for future turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
