			<description>Sacremento is a redevelopment of Take five by the same author. Like its predecessor, the game is played on a 6x6 board with 4 chess pieces: two bishops, a knight, and a rook. However, these tiles are printed with playing card values: aces, 3 royals, and the numbers 10-7 in four suits. Play proceeds just like Take Five, but the goal is to build the best poker hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
