			<description>A complex set of miniatures rules for playing large-scale Napoleonic battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised edition of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Empire (third edition)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the designers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The majority of the changes have been applied to the tactical portion of the rules. Many more of the movements, particularly those that concern tactical reactions to enemy moves and movements of less-reliable troops, have been randomized. A new combat mode has been added to represent the protracted firefight between bodies of formed infantry. We have also included new tests of commander and troop resolve at the maneuver element level. These will work more than ever to increase the need for reserves and limit the numerous and unrealistic fights to the last man, and hopeless charges which plague so many games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
