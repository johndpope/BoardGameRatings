			<description>Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.drjochum.de/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.drjochum.de/&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.archive.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.archive.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexagonal Kyoto Shogi is Tamiya Katsuya's Kyoto Shogi adapted to a 37-cell hexagonal board. The movement of the pieces is based on Wladyslaw Glinski's Hexagonal Chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all Shogi variants, the objective is to checkmate your opponent's king. Unlike chess, Shogi pieces are flat, all the same color, and pentagonal. Ownership of a piece is indicated by the direction it is pointing. When you capture a piece, you may on a later turn place that piece on the board and use it as your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player has five pieces, which appear from left-to-right in the following order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tokin, which moves like a Gold General (Lance)&lt;br/&gt;     Silver General (Bishop)&lt;br/&gt;     King&lt;br/&gt;     Gold General (Knight)&lt;br/&gt;     Pawn (Rook)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name in parenthesis is the piece's promoted value; when a piece promotes. it is flipped to its promoted side. However, the unusual feature that this game shares with Kyoto Shogi is that a piece must promote (and demote) every time it is moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the geometry of the hexagonal board, some pieces have more, and less, mobility than its counterparts on a square board. For example, the King in Shogi may move in one of eight directions, while in this game, it has a choice of twelve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
