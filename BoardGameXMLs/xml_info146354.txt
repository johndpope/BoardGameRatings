			<description>(from DriveThruCards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to place 5 cards in a row, before their opponents use Card powers or the power of their fracture cards to destroy their winning lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player makes a blind pick of a colored deck of fracture cards and then builds lines of cards upon their foundations.  Players use their card powers to slow or stop their opponents while they complete a line of 5 cards all in the same direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fracture cards allow a player to break an opponents line before they finish it, each player has 4 and when they are gone they are gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
