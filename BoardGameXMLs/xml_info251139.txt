			<description>Teach your kid how to dress according to the weather by associating pieces of clothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After picking a character card, the player has to find the three cards representing the clothes worn by the character and put them in the wardrobe. The wardrobe is then closed and the door on the back is open to reveal a character wearing the conbination of the three pieces of clothing. If it matches the character card, the player scores.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the character cards have been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For older kids (3+), the back of the character cards is used, showing only the background. Players have to find the correct pieces of clothing based on the weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
