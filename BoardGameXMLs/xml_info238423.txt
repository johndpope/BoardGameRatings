							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polaris: The Race though Space</name>
									
			<description>A simple roll and move game where the object is to race through space to be the first to reach Polaris, the Pole star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two versions exist of the game. The earlier version (1925) has the players starting from the sun and travelling a path of small stars through the solar system from closest to most furthermost planet (Neptune at that time) before continuing through the major zodiac constellations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The later version (1953) takes a slightly different course starting at Earth, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus then continuing the same path as the 1925 version stopping also at Pluto. In both cases landing on a red star along the path may lead to a penalty or bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics between both version also has considerable differences, with the later version showing rockets along the course and the early version having hangers for the biplane playing pieces. The boards were informative for the players by having facts on all the celestial bodies known at that time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
