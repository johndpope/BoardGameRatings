							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Xeno-Terror</name>
									
			<description>Xeno-Terror is a co-operative &amp;ldquo;Stationcrawl&amp;rdquo; (sci-fi dungeoncrawl) pitting players against the &amp;ldquo;game system&amp;rdquo;. Players represent the last remaining, human survivors struggling to endure while caught in the crossfire of warring alien factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a character (miniature) with different attributes, skills, items and weapons (tracked by the use of cards). Game play takes place on a gridded (or hexed), modular board that depicts the location(s) the characters are exploring. Players attempt to complete objectives by co-operating as a squad or independently as the mission takes shape.&lt;br/&gt; All is not safe in the universe, as humanity has been virtually decimated. While salvaging for weapons, energy and anything useful, characters will eventually meet various Xeno&amp;rsquo;s (Xenophobes). Upon contact, merciless Xeno&amp;rsquo;s will quickly aim to destroy the human survivors. Luckily, bio-scanners are able to detect the location of any Threats or possible dangers. Using a combination of stealth and efficient deadly force the humans may have a chance to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xeno-Terror promotes fast tactical action, exploration, character development and a sense of adventure, as the players not only interact with each other and their enemies, but with the environment that surrounds them. Characters may attempt to search or open crates, lockers, containers and other devices as well as attempt to hack computer terminals, panels or control mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The T.A.C. Engine: Xeno-Terror is the first in a series of 5 games that use the multi genre T.A.C. Engine (Tactical Adventure Card Engine) developed by Steve &amp;quot;BLAST&amp;quot; Lefort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
