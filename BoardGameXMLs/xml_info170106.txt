In this turn teams deploy their game. It&amp;rsquo;s divided in two phases: Initiative and Replica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this type of turn, the manager will start the Initiative phase by playing cards from hand (cost of cards is paid by field players), activating player special abilities and/or interacting with strategy cards previously deployed and style cards(They are deployed from the beginning). What is more, the cost in minutes of every played card will be increase the total minutes of the match. The Initiative phase ends when he stops playing cards or abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that the opponent Manager will play a replica phase, in which he could carry a similar phase up to the maximum of minutes played in the Initiative phase by the opponent. Taking into account that some of the cards can only be played in the initiative phase(marked with an icon in the cost). This phase means the opponent is playing and deploying its strategy, not just waiting looking at the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Highlight turn: It represents what is amazing in a match , those scenes we watch in the TV match summaries. Contains up to two phases, attack phase and a possible counterattack phase(or even more than one).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase attack begins with the manager with initiative increasing the time in one minute.

When no one wants to continue, Both will  throw 3 dices of 6 faces. Also the defending manager will throw two incidence dices (they signal possible fouls,yellow/red cards, injuries, set pieces, etc) the difference after bonuses will mark what has happened: Goal, Dangerous play, good defence and &lt;b&gt;CounterAttack&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of replica turn or Highlight turn both Managers untap players and cards in the field and draw two more cards 2 (with a hand limit of 8 cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QR Code&lt;br/&gt;Each one of the game cards has a qr code QR that redirect to our database directly to this card page where any manager could solve doubts and everything about that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manager ID&lt;br/&gt;Manager ID (MID) cames along with each copy of Goal: The Match.
