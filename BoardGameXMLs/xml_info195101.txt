							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">United Human Front Affiliation Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone thinks about the United Human Front (UHF) as some sort of domestic terrorist organization hell-bent on killing AMPs. The truth, however, is much more difficult. While there are outliers in the mix, the vast majority of UHF members are simple folk who want to make sure their world is not taken from them. The UHF will stop at nothing to keep humanity as the dominant species on Earth... even going so far as generic tampering. Affiliation Guide: United Human Front will give you to lowdown on whether you could be a part of the group or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    What is is like to be member of the UHF?&lt;br/&gt;    Learn what the UHF stands for and how far they are willing to go for humanity&lt;br/&gt;    New Character: Monet&lt;br/&gt;    New UHF-Only Power: Genetic Tampering&lt;br/&gt;    Complete adventure: Dark or Light&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
