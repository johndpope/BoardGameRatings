							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat Feats 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feats are a useful way of altering or modifying abilities that characters have. Combat is the prime time to use the edge that feats give you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It could be the difference between life and death, from feeling the cold embrace of steel and living to enact your revenge another day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These feats are for making combat more deadly&amp;hellip;for your foe that is. Just hope they don&amp;rsquo;t have some of these feats either or your life may very well become more interesting, yet also briefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may grant a bonus when you take aim, or when you kill, or even knock out, another. Some even give you a bonus when you use an attack or spell you are known for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find 17 feats in one of four groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Aimed Attack - 1 Core feat and 4 other related to aim attacks&lt;br/&gt;    Attacks of Opportunity Feats - 6 feats related to attacks of opportunity&lt;br/&gt;    Follow Through - 5 feats that grant you a bonus when you kill or knock out an opponent&lt;br/&gt;    Signature Move - A single feat but with many options for your favourite attacks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
