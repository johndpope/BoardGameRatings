			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to second issue of my webzine: Cavalier Attitude. As the masthead says, this zine will focus on the Old School Revival (OSR) in fantasy role-playing. The Oldschool System Reference and Index Compilation&amp;trade; (OSRIC) is my personal retro-clone of choice, but I will cover other games systems as well, as interest and time permit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second issue&amp;rsquo;s contents include the following highlights:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    an article on 8 Reasons to Check Out OSRIC: why it&amp;rsquo;s so great and why you should be playing it;&lt;br/&gt;    a group of 6 pre-generated player characters: ready to take on whatever your GM&amp;rsquo;s campaign can dish out;&lt;br/&gt;    a NEW COLUMN containing an exclusive one-page OSR adventure, THE SHRINE OF THE TITANS&amp;rdquo;: this high level adventure challenges a party of 4-6 players of levels 8-10 to combat a priestess setting up an evil shrine in the mountains above a peaceful settlement.&lt;br/&gt;    a showcase of Old School art, by myself and others: amazing art features in my published books;&lt;br/&gt;    synopses and information on my recently published books; and&lt;br/&gt;    a roundup of role-playing social media posts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
