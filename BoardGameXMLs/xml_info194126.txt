			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysteries abound in the American Colonies. From whispers of strange things lurking in the woods, to ancient evils lurking in the night&amp;rsquo;s darkness waiting to strike, the colonies are full of curious things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While all attention is focused on the bloody conflict between subjects and crown, there are some seeking to take advantage of this. They work without fear of being caught, and they know it will be too late when these plans are put into action. Now you can learn of these plans in the two adventures found between these covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Angels of Jacob Hill you learn of strange disappearances plaguing the region of Peekskill New York. At first, it was an occasional hunter, or a lone traveler disappearing without a trace. Now villagers have begun disappearing, and no one knows how, or why, this is happening. Unbeknownst to the rest of the villagers, a small group resides in the area and is behind the recent troubles. This group? Angels. Sadly things are not what they seem, and these angels might be something that arrived from the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sin Eater you discover that some evil has been living in the colonies for a very long time. They have lived here so long they have become one of the most dangerous threats. Are you strong enough, not only in physical prowess, but also in courage to face this evil? Set in Trenton, New Jersey, Sin Eater is the perfect adventure to run as a bridge between Flames of Freedom: Boston Besieged and Flames of Freedom: The Philadelphia Affair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
