							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NGo: New Global Order</name>
									
			<description>In the near future our planet has been devastated by a global war, which ended with the modern amenities and technology. Only a few ill-equipped factories, decimated armies and insufficient resources have been in the hands of four groups scattered over the face of the Earth. You lead one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N*Go is a strategy game board where you must become the protector of the planet's resources for the survival of your people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting from a situation where all forces and resources are in balance, luck has no place here. There is no win card or dice that do the work for you, every attack has a possible defense and nobody knows the strategy of the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are easy and simple, all goals are in sight of achieving these objectives... heck you have to be prepared if you want to get it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make alliances, colonizes virally, passively awaiting development of the strategy of your opponents ... or a mixture of all this. There is no right or wrong way of doing things here, you have nothing to lose, yet is all at stake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
