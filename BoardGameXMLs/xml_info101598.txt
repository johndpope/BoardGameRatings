			<description>A set collecting game. One player is assignated to be the Auctioneer. He takes no part in the actual play but he sells cards, checks sets and settles any questions from the players (The rules say his word is binding.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an equal number of counters (not provided) and will gain some and forfeit some during the game. New cards are auctioned each round but players must bid 'blind' so they don't know what they are bidding for. If a player gets a set of two, they may 'cash it in' or they may keep it to try to get the third card of each set as this will increase the award from the counter pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Magistrates set is a penalty set so you need to avoid collecting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most counters after all cards have been matched, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
