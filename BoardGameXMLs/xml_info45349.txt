			<description>kicker Fu&amp;szlig;ball-Quiz 3 is a German-language trivia card game about football presented by kicker, a leading sports magazine in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player answers trivia questions in four categories and tries to win each of four cups. A cup is earned by answering at least one question correctly without answering incorrectly; each cup is earned by answering 1, 2, 3 or 4 questions in a row, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrong answers earn players yellow and red cards.
