							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightmares on Parade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs thwarted the Nightmare King&amp;rsquo;s plans in Pixies on Parade, but the ancient bogeyman despises the idea of losing to mere mortal children. Expending the greater portion of his hoarded strength, he draws all of Glavost into the Dream Realms. There his power is absolute, and the pixie guardians are cut off from the helpless townsfolk. The only ones capable of opposing him are the young champions who defeated his avatar once before and stole a piece of his magic. Can the PCs protect the adults of Glavost from their fears and teach them the power of imagination, or is the town lost in a never ending nightmare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmares on Parade is an adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and is designed for 4-6 PCs of 7th level, who should reach 8th level by the adventure&amp;rsquo;s conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
