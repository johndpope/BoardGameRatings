							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Exploding Zoo!</name>
									
			<description>Fuelled by hunger and convenience of the planet, the greedy aliens have landed at the Zoo System to feast on delicious eggs. Clearly thinking with their stomachs was a mistake, because this is a Super Exploding Zoo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything in this zoo explodes, from the 30-odd different animals with their special skills, to the concessions stands, to the tiny tufts of exploding grass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So round up a herd of animals and blow the aliens (and yourself) to smithereens in this 80 level explode-em up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out the Hatchery for new animals or collect stickers for your souvenir sticker book. Why not go head to head against a friend in the Versus multiplayer pens! Two go in, what's left of one comes out! (picking bits of the other team out their teeth, usually)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
