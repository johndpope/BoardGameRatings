			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every treasure belongs in a hoard, not every bauble is traded for coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you want to reward your player characters with the favor of the local townsfolk, with a ship captain's gratitude, or a city watchman's respect. But just what does a caravan leader's respect earn your heroes at the end of the day? Now the answer is easy with 101 NPC Boons! Building on the concepts first discussed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: GameMastery Guide, 101 NPC Boons helps provide nonmonetary treasure for those situations where stealing a dead man's boots just won't do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken down by regions like Urban, Rural, Nautical, or Wilderness, and sorted by professions or social distinctions, 101 NPC Boons presents tokens of appreciation from all walks of life for any group of adventurers. There are eight new play-ready NPCs from CR 2 to 12 utilizing material from In the Company of Giants, The Ironborn of Questhaven, Wyrd of Questhaven, The Secrets of Divine Channeling, and The Secrets of the Luckbringer. Feats, traits and other interesting material from all of those products have been presented in easy-to-integrate sidebars and notes and ensuring these NPCs have everything necessary to quickly become a part of your game's story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So do yourself a favor you won't regret &amp;mdash; pick up 101 NPC Boons today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
