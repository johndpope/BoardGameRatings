			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 4-6 players. Over the course of a 3-hour session you will tell the story of an amazing band trying to change the world with their music while trying to walk a path between idealism and realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of you will play the band &amp;ndash; gifted individuals brought together by music and friendship, but with your own dreams and drives pulling you in different directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of you will play the Light &amp;ndash; the supernatural force of radiance and change that is the character&amp;rsquo;s staunch ally and source of their magical musical powers. Your job is to track the character&amp;rsquo;s balance between the Light&amp;rsquo;s ideals and the World&amp;rsquo;s vices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last one will play the World. It&amp;rsquo;s your job to place obstacles between the band and their goals, and to present them with conflicts that test their dedication to the band and to the Light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
