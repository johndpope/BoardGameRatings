							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saga</name>
									
			<description>In this lightweight fantasy game you get a random race (elf/undead/human/orc or demon) and a random saga (fight/duel/treasure/mist/crown).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races all have a leader and 3-4 soldiers. Elf, undead and human have 1 character with a ranged attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each saga has a different goal. Fight saga is a battle between all characters. Duel is just the leaders fighting it out. In Treasure saga you&amp;acute;ll fight to get the most treasure chests. Mist saga is a bit like chinese checkers were you&amp;acute;ll have to get your characters over on the other side and stop your opponent getting across. The crown saga is a battle to have most characters around the crown at games end. The end of the game is random. An hourglas will start at a given time, and when you draw a red hourglass the game ends. The board is also  randomly drawn. You&amp;acute;ll start at opposite ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5 races has small variations in their stats(move/dodge/attack and defend) and a few characters can shoot, if line-of-sight is good. Each round you can move and attack (close combat or ranged). If you start your turn in combat you&amp;acute;ll have to dodge to be able to move away from combat. All characters have 1 life, so if a character is hit and fails to defend it is dead. You have to roll equal-to or above your stat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
