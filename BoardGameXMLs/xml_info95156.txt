			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The System Of Role Development, or the SORD, is a gaming system free from setting. SORD is therefore exchangeable with other systems, rules, and formats, and gives creative control directly to the Game Master's desire. SORD was designed for realism in the diversity of character types, flexibility in optional rules, efficiency during combat and gameplay, as well as overall play-tested simplicity for any novice to experience role-playing gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SORD v6.00 internet rulebook is compatible with the official published rulebook available in game and bookstores by Fractal Dimensions, INC. With this internet document, you have all of the SORD necessities for role-playing. The official published book (96 pages) now in stores is artistically formatted with a color-glossy perfect binding and contains a plethora of internal artwork by several artists, character sheets, glossaries, indexes, professional editing, a higher level of details and examples, as well as a complete historically-based Robin Hood setting (literature, adventures, maps, sample characters, cultures, professions, equipment, skills, and so forth).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there are many downloadable SORD settings on the internet (such as the Ethaerios Fantasy Worldbook, Arthurian Avalon, and QUASAR), this v6.00 rulebook might not be 100% compatible with those earlier supplements scattered across netspace. Many authors, including myself, are working to update all internet materials of SORD to the official v6.00 system. In the future, you can also find SORD-lite (the DAGGER) and the 3D RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
