							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">101 Adventure Seeds (Leagues of Adventure)</name>
									
			<description>From the introductory thread post:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm working on a freebie (title above) for you guys and gals. Having written god knows how many seeds for the core rules and Globetrotters' Guides, I'm throwing slots open to you lot. Anyone who wants to contribute can post their adventure seed here. No time limit, but as soon as the last slot is filled it's too late.  I'm currently on #31.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a very few simple guidelines to avoid chaos at my end...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No epics, please! You've seen the size of the ones in the core rules, so stick to that sort of size (1-6 lines of full width text). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No inventing new Leagues (even as a passing name). Feel free to use any of the official ones mentioned in the Globetrotters' Guide table of contents thread. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No using any location mentioned in the Guide table of contents thread unless it has already been released. Just saves me from having to cross-check every single seed for duplication of ideas -- if it's out, you can see what seeds already exist and avoid duplication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
