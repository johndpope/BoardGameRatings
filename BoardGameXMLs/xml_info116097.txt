			<description>A game in the vein of Pictionary, played in teams where one team member draws a picture and the other team members try to guess what is being drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One difference to Pictionary is that the game consists of 40 laminated cards, wipeclean pen and cloth, where each card already has a squiggle drawn on it that should be included in what you want to draw. Another difference is that the drawer chooses themselves what to draw, and has 30 seconds to draw as many pictures as they can, with the card being wiped clean as soon as someone guesses correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
