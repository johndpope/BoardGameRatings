							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Goethia</name>
									
			<description>Goethia is the most modern of the Combat Gears developed by Wissenchaft. Using the science of the Lost Logias, this artifact of destruction is capable of devastating entire armies with its powerful technomagic weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Wissenschaft Warrior/Mystic- Lv. 50+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 5 | Dm 5 | Df 8 | Ar 4 | LP 25 | Re 10 | Mo 6/10 | AP Varies/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Ranged Attack (16 inches), Flight, Immunity (Poison), Damage Resistance.&lt;br/&gt;Homing Lasers: Goethia's Ranged Attacks do not require Line of Sight. If Goethia cannot draw Line of Sight to a target, then it applies the penalty for Hard Cover to its Attack. This ability may not be used to target Hidden Units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Goethe (Magic, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt;Distance (12 inches), +1 Attack / +1 Damage. If this Attack hits its target, then all Characters within 2 inches of the target also suffer the Attack. Goethe is not affected by the Homing Lasers rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ooo - Calamity Rain (Magic, Ranged Attack)&lt;br/&gt;Distance (16 inches). Goethia makes three consecutive Ranged Attacks. Each Attack must target a different unit, or it cannot be made. Limit: Once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goethia - Pilot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear: A Gear cannot have Advantage cards associated and you must select a Pilot for it. The cost of the Pilot is added to the Gear's Level. The Pilot selected for a Gear determines the number of Actions Points it will recover per Turn and may give additional abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Pilot: The same Pilot cannot be selected more than once in the same party, regardless of the Gear he is in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technomagical Powered Armor: You can take any number of Goethia Gears in your party, as long as you follow the Unique Pilot rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valeria Strauss - Lv. +10&lt;br/&gt;Recharge: 3&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Advanced Deployment.&lt;br/&gt;Indomitable: Goethia increases its Speed by 2 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frederick Mausser - Lv. +15&lt;br/&gt;Recharge: 3&lt;br/&gt;Marksmanship: Goethia obtains +1 Attack to its Ranged Attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Aimed Shot: If Goethia doesn't use any Movement during its activation, it gets +1 Attack to its Ranged Attacks that Turn. This bonus stacks with Marksmanship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edgard Ivanesku - Lv. +0&lt;br/&gt;Recharge: 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
