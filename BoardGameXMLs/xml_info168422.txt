			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party is hired to track down a legendary rebel Jedi hero that has infiltrated the industrial world of Corulag.  But if the Empire has any say, none will leave the planet alive!  With swoop races, giant bird mounts, and a weirdly omnipresent lizard, the party may be a little too busy to track down one crazy old man.  Once the &amp;quot;Jedi&amp;quot; is in tow, success appears to be close, until they accidentally land on an imperial satellite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the heroes avoid Moff Tarkin and his squads of stormtroopers?  Is this smelly old man really the hero they were looking for?  And why the heck does this lizard keep staring like he knows more than he is saying?  With blasters blazing and light speed coordinates locked in, be prepared to ask the question:  &amp;quot;Are You My Jedi?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: the last line has been changed to &amp;quot;Are you the hero we're looking for?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 27 - Your Moms a Jedi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all the talk of Star Wars it was only a matter of time before the Gagmen jump on the gravy train and put together an adventure. Experience the high stakes racing experience of swoop racing, or lizard racing, in this wacky adventure idea that really didn't follow the premise, but gets there just the same. Dave is out of this adventure, but we make up for it my continually fighting amongst ourselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
