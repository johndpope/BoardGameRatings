							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasia: Book of All Knowing</name>
									
			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hear ye, hear ye! Those brave souls who are in search of adventure are invited to enter the realms of Fantasia! Let this be your guide, the complete trilogy of core rules; the Rule Book, Player's Books and Master's Book all in a single, comprehensive volume. Have you the mettle to stand against bloodthirsty Orcs, man-eating Trolls and fire-blooded Dragons? Have you the wisdom to defeat most cunning traps ad ancient riddles? Do you have heart enough to win the favor of Elvish folk? Combining classic role-playing rules with traditional storytelling, this game creates an adventure that is both real and rewarding, historical but also with the flair of fantasy, with the details, themes and triumphs carefully placed where our dreams have always wanted them. This is not just a game, not just a rulebook, but the beginning of a story, the greatest story, indeed your story....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
