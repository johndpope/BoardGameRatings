							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spain, Europa Play Aids Kit 5</name>
									
			<description>(from the back cover:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is Kit 5, it is the sixth kit released. Kit 6, Europa-By-Mail, was completed and released prior to this kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have included the western France map in this kit due to the fact you will need it for Spanish Torch. Many of you have requested it as well. Spanish Torch was designed by John M. Astell and contains all the rules necessary to play an alternate invasion scenario. You will need the components listed in the rules to use the scenario. Spanish Torch is not a complete scenario in that respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently we have produced the following kits:  Kit 1, Fire in the East - Kit 2, Desert Pak -  Kit 3, Narvik - Kit 4, Scorched Earth -  Kit 5, Spain and Kit 6, Europa by Mail. We have also started The Europa Players Association, which promotes the Europa system by providing additional products, a newsletter and a contact service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    two - 50% True Photo Reduction Europa Maps, 17 &amp;amp; 23&lt;br/&gt;    Gibraltar Area Display Chart&lt;br/&gt;    Off Map Air Display Chart&lt;br/&gt;    Air Distance Chart&lt;br/&gt;    Rail Distance Chart&lt;br/&gt;    Port Display Chart&lt;br/&gt;    The invasion of Spain scenario: Spanish Torch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Europa Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magazine References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Europa Magazine 20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
