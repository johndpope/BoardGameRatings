							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Capture of Mr. Raffles</name>
									
			<description>This trick-taking card game has a deck of 54 cards. There are four &amp;quot;series&amp;quot; or suits (Trump, Star, Sun, Moon), each with cards numbered from 0 to 12. There are also two additional cards, The Detective and Mr. Raffles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules show a normal process for trick-taking games: one player leads, highest card takes each trick, and any trump beats any non-trump. In this game, however, The Detective is a top trump: it may not be led, but can be played at any time unless the holder also has Mr. Raffles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mr. Raffles card is automatically picked up by whoever wins the trick on which it is played, and that player in turn must play Mr. Raffles at the first opportunity (the first trick in which he does not have the lead). A hand ends whenever one player runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each trick taken during a hand counts one point. Each 0 card taken or held counts 5 points, and whichever player ends up with Mr. Raffles scores 10 points. Game is to 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
