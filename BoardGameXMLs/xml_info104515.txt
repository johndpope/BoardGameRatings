			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cobra is attempting to infiltrate and destroy the GI Joe Team. Only YOU can stop them in OPERATION: MINDBENDER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Army spy planes have picked up evidence of covert military operations on a small island in the South Pacific. Your team - Leatherneck, Airtight, Beach Head, and you, Commando - have been sent to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But suddenly Beach Head and Airtight attack you and Leatherneck! It's unbelievable, but you find yourself in a vicious fight with your own team members!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it's over, you notice that Beach Head and Airtight are disoriented and confused. They see you as the enemy. They have been brainwashed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to save your friends from Cobra's clutches - and make sure this brainwashing doesn't happen again. Vital decisions are up to you as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
