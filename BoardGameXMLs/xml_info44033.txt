							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Summit</name>
									
			<description>Something has gone wrong in outer space. Something's gone so wrong that the four major races (not including humans) need to meet on neutral ground, and nobody's going home until this is solved. Be it kidnapped children, violated trade sanctions, killed royal pets, or something else entirely, the delegates have been sent to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An agenda has been mocked up, and is held by the Host. Be careful, the meeting plans and rules can change, and you may be the one to change them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The votes must be unanimous; this is the fate of the Universe we speak of. And until the Host declares the meeting adjourned... nobody's going home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Summit is a small roleplaying game for play over dinner, hanging out, or just waiting for the new guy to make his character. In the game, characters are alien delegates trying to solve a delicate situation. Diplomats don't roll dice, but they do have agendas and use alien powers to further their goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
