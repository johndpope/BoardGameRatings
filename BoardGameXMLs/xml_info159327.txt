							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village of Xer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East of the great city of Filbar is the Village of Xer. This large village is the gateway to the Eastern lands and the humanoid tribes. Xer was originally the army base for the Bloodrayne Conflict of 715. After the battle the wounded returned to the serene woods and some remained after that. Since then it has been a comfortable caravan stop for many weary travelers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This town setting can be utilized by any level adventuring group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign, however it is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
