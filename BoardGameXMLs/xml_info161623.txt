			<description>Almost-RPG wargame about Rommel campaign during the Tobruk siege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games focuses on view of battlefield from perspective of a firing team.&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a small squad of soldiers operating during major ww2 battle. Each soldier belongs to a specific class with unique abilities like heavy gunner, rifle man, mechanic, driver, medic and gun operator. Each unit consists of 2-4 soldiers (each unit is built around a commanding officer). Every soldier can gain a level up, making him more efficient in battle, or giving more abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During players turn player issues a basic order to his troops like &amp;quot;advance&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;fall back&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;move to left/right flank&amp;quot;,attack a unit. While orders can be precised to specific units and target. Way they're handled is up to units and their officers in command. During action units that suffered a casualty might flee, decide to fortify, or even advance in counterattack. Goal of the game is to gain control over battlefield by either eliminating enemy units or gaining points of interest. However, the player is operating in a small section of battlefield and has to take into account that not only units visible on the map are a threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original game design was for 2 players. But solo campaign and cooperative play are also in works. Also game is prepared to take into account game masters possibilities using special set of story and event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
