			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fate Codex is a mostly-monthly e-zine featuring Quick Start Adventures and more for the Fate roleplaying system. The project, funded through Patreon, grows and swells as more patrons support our work. We've been lucky to have lots of folks pledge, and we're now entering our second year of production!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our backers have enabled us to not only hire great authors, but also to include great art in every issue. Issue 4 of Volume 2 features Mike Mumah, Kaitlynn Peavler, and Juan Ochoa! There's some great work in this piece and over 10,000 words of awesome Fate content, ready to be thrown into your next game of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we're bringing this content to you on DriveThruRPG, so you can find and download your issues easily. Since every title is saved to your library on the site, you'll always have The Fate Codex right at hand when you need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fourth issue of Volume 2, we've got:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Tara Zuber's essay on using flashbacks in Fate to create character backstory and engaging scenes called &amp;quot;I Remember When...&amp;quot;: Using Flashbacks in Fate.&lt;br/&gt;    Travis Scott's piece on rethinking the roll of skills, Under the Hood, an essay that challenges what we think skills ought to do for a game of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;    Mike Olson's essay, Stunts are Cool, that summarize what he's learned about writing stunts in the process of developing Atomic Robo and other Fate products. &lt;br/&gt;    Jon Peacock's quick start adventure, Family Matters, a madcap adventure that features ghosts angling to control a family's future through their chosen heirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
