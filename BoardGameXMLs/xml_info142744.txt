			<description>Documentation accompanying program listing in SoftSide Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Television game shows have been around for almost as long as television itself [. . .] One game capable of surviving on its own merits, with the home version game sales to prove it, is Concentration. In this version, the computer displays a playing board comprised of 32 numbered blocks, behind each of which is a prize of differing value. As those of you who remember seeing the game on TV will recall, for each item revealed on the board, another just like it lurks under a different square. The object is to concentrate on the board, and remember which items have been uncovered at each location, so that when your turn comes you can name them both and secure the prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have succeeded in matching two items on the board, you have won a battle, but not the war. You now have your first of a series of guesses as to the computer's &amp;quot;secret number&amp;quot; (1 to 100). The computer will let you know if your guess was high or low. And, you'll do well to remember the number. When you make another match you'll get another guess. Remember, every time you guess at the number or uncover an unknown square, you're helping your opponent. It may turn out that your last guess was just what he needed to make his match--unless he hasn't been concentrating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends on a note that I'm sure is familiar to all of us. When the &amp;quot;secret number&amp;quot; has been guessed, the computer announces the winner and offers a list of all prizes accumulated during the game. Congratulations -- and then what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What else... a commercial!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
