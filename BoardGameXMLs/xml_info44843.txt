			<description>Each player has a little board with 3 x 3 squares which show three roosters, three cats and three dogs. There are individual square tiles face-down on the table. The player whose turn it is picks up one tile, looks at it and places it face-down on one square of his/her board, claiming it is on a matching animal. If another player doubts that, he or she can force the player whose turn it is to flip up the last tile. The player who was wrong has to discard two tiles from his/her board. Players who can cover rows, columns or diagonal lines on their boards get points, whoever has most points in the end, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
