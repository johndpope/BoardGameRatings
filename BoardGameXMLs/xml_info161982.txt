							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Bark</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bark the dog is trying to get his friends and possessions back from jealous monsters who have stolen them all.  In each level you must (via arrow keys and space as action button) navigate around a maze collecting all the items and rescuing any of Bark's friends that you meet.  You start off only being able to play as Bark but as you rescue his friends you can control each of them as well, and each has a different ability.  The levels have puzzle elements including activating switches, moving blocks, evading monsters and unlocking doors.  There are 39 levels in total over nine worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
