			<description>From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to Play:  Each player is dealt 25 cards by the dealer.  Cards are placed one-at-a-time in an empty slot in the card tray to make 10 poker hands, five across and five deep.  Once placed, that cards cannot be moved.  When each player has filled his/her card tray, players bet on each of the ten hands to win points.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to score 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
