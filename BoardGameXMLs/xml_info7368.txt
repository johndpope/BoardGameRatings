			<description>(from the publisher's web site:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Wind Rain, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria is an operational/strategic level game covering one of the great 'what ifs' of the Second World War &amp;ndash; a Japanese attack against the Soviet Far East. This attack, pitting the elite Japanese Kwantung Army against the full-strength divisions of the Soviet Far East Armies was not simply a hypothetical scenario, but one that the Japanese prepared for and seriously contemplated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two variants are offered: a 1941 attack roughly concurrent with the German assault against European Russia in which the Kwangtung Army faces some of the best units of the Soviet Far East Army and a 1942 scenario in which the Kwangtung Army, reinforced by a large mechanized force, squares off against a still large, but not as strong, Soviet Far East Army garrison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity - Medium&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability - Medium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
