							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World of Darkness: Gypsies</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Lands Unknown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supernatural creatures of the World of Darkness tend to think of humans as little more than animals, ignorant of what really goes on in the shadows around them. The Gypsies think this of the supernaturals. The Gypsies have seen things which would turn a werewolf's fur white and make a vampire's fangs fall out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Times Undreamed of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They've had dealings with all the supernatural creatures, from the vampires in their fortress cities to the wraiths in the shadows and from the werewolves of the wild to the mages in their libraries. They know the time of reckoning is coming -- and they're ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A World of Darkness: Gypsies includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the Romani families of power who have traveled the Earth for millennia;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the role those nomads have played and continue to play in the World of Darkness; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules to create Gypsy characters, the special powers they have used throughout history and ways to use them in chronicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
