							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chasing Rabbits</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;One day, three Californian surfers, in search of perfect waves, take a shortcut across a farmer's field in their old-woody-surfwagon.  The farmer, sensing a surfer's hunger for the sport, reluctantly grants permission to trespass.  His only request, &amp;quot;don't let the rabbits out of the pen - or they'll reproduce and eat my produce.&amp;quot;  Well, curiosity doesn't kill the cat here, but it does create a stir, when one surfer inadvertently opens the pen containing the rabbits the farmer had retrieved from his property.  Now, faced with humiliation and banishment from the farm, and their shortcut to good waves, the surfers must catch all the rabbits.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To be the first player to have all his/her rabbits make into (sic) the safety of the brier (sic) patch. Each player always has two moves; rabbits first, and the woody second. (The 'White Die' moves the Rabbits, the 'Blue Die' moves the Woody).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
