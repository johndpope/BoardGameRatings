			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who writes the funniest caption?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iceland's funniest comic artist supply the drawings - and you make the joke. That's how Skr&amp;iacute;p&amp;oacute; is, a disgustingly funny Icelandic boardgame which makes the family roll on the floor laughing. In Skr&amp;iacute;p&amp;oacute; even the most absurd captions are hilarious...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick a drawing and put it in the supplied clip and place it in the middle of the board. Every player except the judge makes a caption for the drawing. The captions are read aloud and the judge picks the funniest caption and tries to guess which player wrote which caption. The funniest caption earns the author 4 spaces forward on the board, each correct guess earns the judge 1 space forward. The winner is the player who gets to the finish line (25 spaces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
