			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Game for small children to help them learn about animals and what sound they make.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a board with 5 animals on it - sheep, cat, cow, dog and a pig. Each animal has a different colored background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then all wooden tiles are shuffled. Each tile has a picture of an animal on one side, a colored circle on the other side. All tiles are shuffled good and placed the colored circle upwards. Now starting with the youngest player, they turn around tiles. When player turns around a red circle and it has a cat on it (which has a blue background), he/she need to do red animals voice (cow) while doing the cat move (sitting straight and doing ears). If that player is successful, he may place that tile on his board, covering that picture (cat).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When player turn around a blue circle tile, with a blue picture (cat), he/she just need to make a sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all 5 tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
