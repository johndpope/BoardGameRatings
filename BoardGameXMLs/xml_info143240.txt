							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AT-43 Unit Box: Fire Toad U.N.A.</name>
									
			<description>Toads are the Type * AFV of the UNA in AT-43 and come in four different flavours. Toads are quick with 25 movement, They are deadly, with a wide assortment of weapon loadouts for every situation, and they are cheap. While not having the armour of the Red Blok, Toads are very resilient when in a Mind company. This list gives all AFV&amp;rsquo;s a repair for free so a unit of 3 toads can repair 3 damage a turn. This is before you even start to throw Steel Trooper Engineers into the mix. The toads are fairly quick and are great for flanking the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire Toad&lt;br/&gt;armed with 2 laser guns the Fire Toad is the jack of all trades. It can take out everything from afv&amp;rsquo;s to infantry. This is the most common variant of toad used in many lists because of this fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light Prince&lt;br/&gt;A hybrid between the Iron Rain and the Fire Toad, the light prince packs a MG and a laser gun. It is able to throw 3 mg shots and 1 lasergun shot at its target. It still retains the ability to engage AFVs while being able to put out enough fire to have a hope of killing infantry that are in cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Rain&lt;br/&gt;This guy is a battlesuit killing machine. A full unit of Iron Rain&amp;rsquo;s put out 18 MG shots a turn. When shooting at a type *** infantry unit in full cover you&amp;rsquo;re bound to score a few wounds due to the sheer number of dice. The Lancelot is better suited to killing more lightly armoured units and grounding those suits that don&amp;rsquo;t have stability (Red Blok and Therians). if you&amp;rsquo;re taking these guys, its to neutralize your opponents ungroundable battlesuits. Otherwise you&amp;rsquo;re better off with Lancelots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lancelot&lt;br/&gt;The Lancelot is an infantry killing monster. with 2 grenade launchers it puts out a lot of indirect fire. Note that the card is a misprint and each grenade launcher only gets 1 shot instead of the printed 3. Even still, a unit of 2 of these guys can get the all important double damage template. This weapon grounds units and ignores cover so it is a better choice if you are facing Red Blok or Therians as their type *** infantry can still be grounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains: &lt;br/&gt;-1 figurine: Fire Toad Mk IV, 2 light grenade launchers, 2 light laser cannons, 2 light MG&lt;br/&gt;-8 cards - Fire Toad, Fire Toad Sgt., Fire Toad Light Prince, Fire Toad Light Prince Sgt., Fire Toad Iron Rain, Fire Toad Iron Rain Sgt., Fire Toad Lancelot, Fire Toad Lancelot Sgt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
