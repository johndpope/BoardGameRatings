			<description>From Retailer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A compact game for full-size fun! Turn playtime into Bible-time with this fast-paced family card game. It's similar to Uno, but in addition to matching colors and numbers, players must answer questions about Bible facts, characters, and stories. Perfect for long road trips and rainy afternoons, you'll increase your knowledge of important Bible characters and events, and it's so much fun, you kids won't even realize they're learning! Do U Know? is great for the whole family, especially ages 5 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
