			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Learning from their mistakes from the 1950's, the North Koreans are set to launch another invasion of the South all along the 38th parallel in order to bring about reunification under Kim Jong Il's rule. With the United States heavily committed across the globe, the North feels it cannot lose. Will the communists drive the Allies into the sea or will the American and South Koreans press on past the Yalu and bring total peace to the region?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this, you'll get the game's mapsheets, rules, charts, etc. While you'll need to provide the pieces from various sources - of which those will be clearly obvious. This involves the use of most &amp;quot;Axis &amp;amp; Allies&amp;quot; components with some extras as denoted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
