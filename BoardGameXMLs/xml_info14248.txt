							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flying Squad</name>
									
			<description>The game is played on a square grid and represents a manhunt by the police and a race to safety by the fugitive. One player plays the Fugitive and the others are Police. The Fugitive player wins by reaching the home space at the center of the board by exact count, otherwise the first Police player to capture the fugitive wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement of the police units is governed by the arrow on the space that they start on, while the fugitive moves in a circular path in the order that the spaces are numbered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Squad was a nickname dating back to 1920 when Scotland Yard bought two motor vans for use by members of the Special Squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
