			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sims: Online was a massively multiplayer online game that was in operation from 2002 to 2008. Players could choose to live in any of fourteen different cities. Alphaville and Blazing Falls were the most heavily populated and gave the feel of big cities. The game simulated a working economy completely run by players. Players could live with roommates, get a job or start their own business. Player cooperation was an important part of the game. Players' skills ratings determined the amount of money they made in their endeavours. Furthermore, The Sims: Online incorporated most objects from all expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
