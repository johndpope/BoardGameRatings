							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Air Conflicts: Vietnam</name>
									
			<description>Experience the Vietnam War, one of the most explosive wars of all time, that was fought extremely heavily armed! Witness the experiences of the brave pilots of the US Air Force.&lt;br/&gt;    After a battle there can never be only winners! Get yourself carried away by a thrilling and emotional story and, besides heroic moments, experience the dark sides of war.&lt;br/&gt;    Brand new missions, tailor-made for helicopter pilots! Besides jet fighter missions you must complete special helicopter missions, where the whole equipment of the choppers needs to be used.&lt;br/&gt;    Take control of whole squadrons! Instead of controlling just one airplane, you can control every aircraft in your squadron in the respective missions.&lt;br/&gt;    Equip your airplanes and helicopters with real weapons! All possible plane-weapons-combinations (chopper-weapons-combinations) are based on real models.&lt;br/&gt;    A real setting combined with arcade gameplay! Every airplane can only be equipped with a limited amount of ammunition. You can avoid this restriction as you switch between the different planes of a squadron.&lt;br/&gt;    A huge war machinery for you to choose from! The game contains a total of more than 20 airplanes and helicopters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
