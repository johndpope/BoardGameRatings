							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gale Sayers Football</name>
									
			<description>A professional football game licensed by Gale Sayers post-NFL career. A standard set of playing cards (with specially designed Gale Sayers card backs) is used. Players call out their play, pull a card, then check the play sheet to see what result the playing card provides. For instance, if you call a screen pass, then pull a red 10 out of the deck, that's a touchdown. A black 10 results in 0 yards gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with board of football field, score board with two leg stands, Gale Sayers cardboard cutout figure and stand, ten-yard distance marker, two play results sheets, and deck of cards with two jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover is marked Gale Sayers Football, but instructions always refer to game as Gale Sayers' Action Packed Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of special note is the comment on the designer printed on the inside of the box: &amp;quot;This game was created by Don Kingston, with assistance on its refinement by his son, Kevin. Kevin Kingston perished, along with the entire University of Evansville Basketball Team on December 13, 1977. To his memory this game is dedicated.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
