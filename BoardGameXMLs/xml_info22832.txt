			<description>From the rules page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If you don't know or understand golf, this game will teach you. If you do know golf, this game will be a challenge to your knowledge and ability.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a one-page insert that came with a Kellogg's product (Pop-Tarts, I believe) and, despite the name of the publisher, is not a computer game. Play results are determined by drawing cards from a standard deck of cards, instead of using dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is just one in a series of about 6 sports games distributed this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
