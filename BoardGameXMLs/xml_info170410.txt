							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colossi</name>
									
			<description>Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deluge of large, mysterious meteors have fallen from the sky and struck the lands of Astralevia. Each meteor contained a monstrous, rock colossus that has come forth from its crater, hellbent on devastating the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As dire as a threat these Colossi pose, more than a fight for survival emerged once the rare and powerful Cosmic Ores that compose their bodies were discovered. These special ores are capable of producing weapons and tools of uncanny properties. And so, those guided by greed, power, new order, and even peace (to keep this commodity out of the wrong hands) have quickly assembled bands of warrior-miners to harvest this extremely valuable resource from the Colossi. These warrior-miners&amp;mdash;known as Veinreapers for their ability to crack apart the Colossi through their rich veins of ore&amp;mdash;have been equipped with special Pickaxes forged from Metal Shards scattered by the meteors&amp;rsquo; impacts&amp;mdash;the only metal able to penetrate the coarse flesh of the gigantic creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will play a band of Veinreapers fighting for the greatest share of Cosmic Ores. The outfit that mines the most ores will rise as the strongest power within Astralevia, taking control of the nation and winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns placing Veinreapers in Kill Formations against Colossi on the game board while collecting Metal Shards and forging the special Pickaxe that their warriors are equipped with. Each Colossus can only be killed and mined by Veinreapers placed in a specific Kill Formation. The number of Veinreapers engaged against a Colossus and the properties of your warriors&amp;rsquo; equipped Pickax determine how many Cosmic Ores you mine from each Colossus. The game ends when all Veinreapers have been placed and the player who mines the most Cosmic Ores based on these placements wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
