							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign: A strategic race for the American Presidency</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the Presidency with one of the following strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Capture first place in 14 different State Primaries.&lt;br/&gt;2. Capture first place finishes in 3 State Primaries in each of the 4 voting regions.&lt;br/&gt;3. Accumulate a total of 1100 delegate votes from any number of States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a candidate for the American Presidency, your task is to win as many State Primaries, delegate votes, or voting regions as possible...Though it is wise to enter this game with on particular strategy, circumstances may force you to switch strategies later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While moving your pawn clockwise on the board you will encounter situations that require you to give and receive votes. These votes will allow you to compete in State Primaries. A player who enjoys an abundance of votes, but who fails to play them at the Poll, will never gain enough State Primaries or delegate votes to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
