			<description>Time to hit the beach! But rather than just finding a toasty spot in the sun and enjoying it, you're worried about everyone else horning in on your patch of paradise. Time to apply Sunblock to see whether you can force other aspiring sunbathers off the sand with their heads hanging in shame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, players set up the beach, complete with a large umbrella for shade, four beach chairs and four rubbish bins. On a turn, the player rolls the die, then takes one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Add a yellow, red or blue umbrella to the beach.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Move the big umbrella, which takes up four pips on the board, to a new location.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Move your beach chair to a new location, but not adjacent to a rubbish bin.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Move a rubbish bin to a new location; anyone who now has a chair adjacent to this bin must move the chair to a new location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you knock something off the beach or can't move or place an item on the board as directed, you lose the game and must head home. The last player left on the beach wins. Variants include a crab that blocks off additional spaces as it moves around the beach and more moving umbrellas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
