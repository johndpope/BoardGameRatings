			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHADOWS OF THE MYTHOS AMIDST THE HORRORS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CROWDS GATHER BAYING FOR BLOOD, WHILE THE &amp;ldquo;CHOP-CHOP-CHOP&amp;rdquo; OF THE GUILLOTINE CALLS OUT&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time of struggle, intrigue, and horror. A divided country, where the upper class enjoys the bounty of wealth, and the poor cannot afford a load [sic] of bread. Where the cries of anger and rage at life&amp;rsquo;s injustices find momentum, sparking the people to unite and cast away the old regime for a brighter and more hopeful tomorrow. In time, hope will be replaced with fear as The Terror descends upon France, and the guillotine cries out for blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reign of Terror is an epic two-part historical scenario, set during the French Revolution, and playable as a stand-alone mini-campaign or as an historical interlude for use with Chaosium&amp;rsquo;s premium campaign Horror on the Orient Express.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Part One, set in 1789 amid the stirrings of revolution, sees the investigators descend into the catacombs of Paris and brave the tribulations of courtly life, where debauchery and wickedness bring there [sic] own terrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Part Two, set during The Terror, catapults the investigators into a conspiracy, where spies and agents seek out those who would destabilize the new regime. Caught amongst the chaos and dangers of Paris, the way must be found to stop a nightmare that would plunge France and the rest of Europe into darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book provides a stand-alone setting, with a plethora of historical details to help the Keeper bring the Revolution to life, as well as new investigator occupations. Alongside the scenarios of Reign of Terror is a range of scenario seeds, each providing the roots for extending play and building a longer, more in-depth campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If used with Horror on the Orient Express, this book provides an exciting and action-packed &amp;ldquo;living handout&amp;rdquo; to engage players in the full horror of the Comte Fenalik at the height of his powers, bringing new insights into the parent campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with both options of play are six ready-to-go pre-generated investigators, as well as a full timeline for the French Revolution, luscious full-color maps of Paris, Versailles, and other locales, and a bibliography for further research and reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liberty! Equality! Fraternity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
