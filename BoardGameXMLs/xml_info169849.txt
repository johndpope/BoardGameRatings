			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Father, beloved, renown by everyone for his calm demeanor and kindness. But he has a secret! Beneath his mask hides a vicious serial killer, known to the world as &amp;ldquo;The Butcher.&amp;rdquo; And when need pushes him to the brink, the cold calculating man finds himself making the little mistakes needed to turn him into the suspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least two players are required to play &amp;ldquo;The Suspect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is not to win or lose, nor is it to prove or disprove the Suspect. Instead, the game is intended to give the players a live-action experience similar to TV shows such as Breaking Bad (or Dexter), in which an inquisitive, meddling wife makes the life of Chemist more interesting and unpredictable. This game can be played while in a car, or at the comfort of your own home. To play this game, you will need a smart phone (if you are in your car), or a little object you could hide in your hand (such as a marble or a a die) if you are at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
