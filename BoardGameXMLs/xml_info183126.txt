			<description>The charge is set, the choppers are primed, and the riding conditions are nearly perfect. It's time to shred this slope like no other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Avalanche, each player assumes the role of an adrenaline crazed snowboarder, and participates in an event where riders deliberately race an avalanche (and each other) down the mountain. It is of course important to stay in front of the snow, and to try and finish the event first, but what really matters to these shredders is bragging rights. In the end, whoever has the most to brag about wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players will simultaneously choose up to three action cards to bet, and place them face down on the table. Once everyone has decided which moves they want to try and pull off, they reveal their cards, and each player rolls in turn order for the resources they need to successfully complete their actions. Some actions are easier to pull off than others, but will usually grant you either fewer bragging rights, less combo, or less movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has completed their rolling phase, the avalanche is advanced, and anyone who is caught by it must subsequently roll for an immediate rescue. Once they've managed to successfully latch onto a helicopter, they lift out, land one space in front of the avalanche, and a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
