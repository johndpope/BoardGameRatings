			<description>[From the back of the box]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hey, you! Over here! It's me, Plok! Waddya mean, you don't know who I am? Here on the island of Akrillic, in the magic archipelago of Poly-Esta, my flags are all over the place. Here, they call me Top Banana, Head Honcho, Numero Uno, Big Cheese -- you know, King!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At least, some of them call me that. Would you believe there are still a few stubborn holdouts who refuse to recognize my supreme authority? But now they've gone too far -- they've stolen my favorite flag!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I know what you're thinking: who would do such a despicable thing? I'll tell you who -- the nastiest, foulest, most loathsome critters in all of Poly-Esta: Fleas! And I'll bet that rotten Flea Queen is behind it all! In fact, she's probably teamed up with the Shprouts, Rockyfella, Womack Spider, and every other troublemaker around here.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Well, they're really in for it now. Besides my amazing, stupendous ability to fire my arms and legs at will, I've got my nifty jetpack, off-road truck, 'copter, and secret supervehicle. By golly, we'll show 'em who's boss!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So c'mon, already -- let's go get 'em!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
