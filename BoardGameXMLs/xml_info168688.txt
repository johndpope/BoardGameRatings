			<description>The Golden Fleece Cup is the most coveted championship in the world of sheep soccer. Players take the roles of the two teams who've made it to the championship game. The rules of sheep soccer are vastly different than the game played by humans. So, players will need to strategically place their sheep throughout the board as they jump, nudge, kick, and block the ball as they try score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheep Soccer is a strategy game for two where players use their three sheep pawns to try and score three goals before their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
