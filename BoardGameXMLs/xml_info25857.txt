There are 5 teams of each 2 cyclists (plastic figures). Tactics- and bad luck card plus 4 dice make the game complete. Each team has one climber and one rouleur.

The board is divided into different &amp;eacute;tappe sections and has an interesting mechanism to determine time differences for the overall classifying. Winner is the player whose team does best for the overall lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
