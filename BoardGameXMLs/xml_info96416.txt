							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Just William Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Game based on characters and incidents from the books written by Richmal Crompton.&lt;br/&gt;44 cards, in 10 sets of four and 4 special cards featuring William himself and his 'sworn enemy' Violet Elizabeth. Players try to be the first to collect 2 sets.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in their turn draws a card into their hand and then passes a card from their hand to the player on their left. You try to keep card sets where you have more than one card in the set (s), and have to hope you draw a matching card from the deck or you need a player on your right to pass such a card to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
