							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Viking Raid</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2-4+ Vikings ... The most Scandinavian player goes first.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build a ship, give it a crew, and set out for a destination. Along the way encounters are faced. At the destination, the Vikings must battle the local inhabitants. Defeat the locals, pillage, plunder, and return home - all in a days work for Viking raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two decks of cards, the Viking Deck and the Encounter Deck. The Viking Deck contains Ship, Crew, and Destination Cards. The Encounter Deck contains Sea, Defenders, and Treasure Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has successfully completed three raids or all other players have been sunk. The player with the most Gold wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
