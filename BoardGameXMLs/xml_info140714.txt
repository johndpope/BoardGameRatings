			<description>Pre-school children's game, from the Rupert Fun book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, make a spinning wheel with six sides, as shown in the diagram. Make a hole in the centre of the wheel and push a stump of pencil through it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two players are allowed to choose three squares each. One player might choose cement, nails and bricks, another might choose screws, glass and wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take turns to spin the wheel, which is shaped in such a way that one of its names will lie on the table when it stops. If this name is one of the squares that the player has chosen, then he scores a point. Otherwise he does not score&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to reach a pre-agreed total number of points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
