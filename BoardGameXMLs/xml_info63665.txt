			<description>The Spiro box contains two dice rolling games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1st game is &amp;quot;Spurensucher&amp;quot; (pathfinder):&lt;br/&gt;Each field on the gameboard with 7 concentric circles has two footprints that point to different directions. The field you land on shows which direction you have to go your next turn. The player who reaches the center field first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd game is &amp;quot;W&amp;uuml;rfelroulette&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 21 pawns. On your turm you roll 3 dice and have to place 3 of your pawns on the 9x13 fields board. Each field has one side of a six sided dice on it. The 3 fields you place your pawns on have to be next to each other. The player who first placed all his pawns wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
