			<description>The object is to find a word that begins with two letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card, a little phrase has a word in white. Each player or team has a few chips that show two letters. It should be the first to announce a valid word, starting with those letters, to complete the sentence. A word may be refused by a vote of players. Who complete the sentence first may remove one of his token out of his supply. &lt;br/&gt;The first player who has no more tokens left wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
