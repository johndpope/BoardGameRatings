			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the Dark Ages, in the ancient kingdom of Nerd, and all is chaos. King Melvin has died without an heir and the country has fallen into the hands of four powerful and vile WARLORDS. A power struggle is taking place to see who will emerge as the new King. You and the other players are these WARLORDS and, as you brood in your castle, you will have to decide what combination of military might and skilful diplomacy will lead you to victory. It would be foolhardy to wage war against all others simultaneously, yet . . . will the alliance you make stand the test of battle? Should you double-cross him before he screws you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
