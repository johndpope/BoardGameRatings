							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spindlecave River: Rogue&#039;s Nook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The famous Spindlecave River flows for hundreds of miles beneath the mountains, flowing through absolute darkness for most of it's route, but also through various locations and ruins along it's length. One such location is Rogue's Nook, a small settlement populated by exiles, smugglers, thieves, charlatans and other unsavoury types. With shanty towns and a black market, you're sure to find a buyer for that stolen item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 30 x 30 map depicting a shanty slum town deep within a cave. The rooms are cavern chambers carved from the rock, and the site is divided by the Spindlecave River that flows through it. The settlement has a handful of living areas, a tavern, various food and good stalls, an alchemist and a fortune teller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
