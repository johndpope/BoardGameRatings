			<description>eXtraDICTION is a crossword-type game with some superficial similarities to Scrabble. However, play is quite different, with a trivia element added. Because this game is intended as an educational tool for learning English, much of the information on the cards is also in other languages.  From the publisher (edited for brevity):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In eXtraDICTION, the clues and related answers are selected by the players from a set of playing cards....  Playing card sets are divided into three main categories: vocabulary, general knowledge, specific subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answers are written into a grid of squares, but the location of the answers is decided by the players. The answers may be words, idiomatic expressions, dates, numbers or mathematical or scientific formulae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded for each answer written onto the game board.... Each square on the board has a pre-alloted value. The board is divided into several contiguous zones. At each turn, the points scored by the eligible player are calculated by totaling the value of each of the squared occupied by the letters or characters in the answer and multiplying that by the number of zones that the answer passes through or into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
