							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Canvas Quest: negociação</name>
									
			<description>Game to teach negotiation skills and also The Business Model Generation. This is a methodology to help entrepreneurs to establish a successful business model based on a graphic approach called Canvas. The Canvas has 9 areas that any strategic plan and/or business plan should focus: Key Resources, Key Partners, Value Proposition, Customer Segments, Customer Relationship, Key Activities, Cost Structure, Revenue streams, Channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player or group of players will represent a character. The character is one of the managers a typical company will find. Sales Manager, Production Manager and HR Manager are some examples. Each character has some expertise and this expertise allows him to have some skill cards. The game has 5 boards, each board is a company of the same corporation. Each company has a sales goal and the corporation also has a sales goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round a new crisis/opportunity must be faced by the players, that must co-operate to get the business results desired. They must discuss the crisis/opportunity, suggest a solution to the problem and add skill cards with enough points to solve the problem. The players roleplay their character, move the character thru the board representing the Canvas areas, get new skills, negotiate with the other companies for resources and pick actions to help the company goals. The game ends after 3 hours of play and the results are analized to check if the goals were achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
