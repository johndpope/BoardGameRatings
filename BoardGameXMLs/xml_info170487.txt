			<description>In Elegy for a Dead World, you travel to distant planets and create stories about the people who once lived there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three portals have opened to uncharted worlds. Earth has sent a team of explorers to investigate them, but after an accident, you are the sole survivor. Your mission remains the same: survey these worlds and write the only accounts of them that outsiders will ever know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you explore, the game helps you create the narrative. You begin on Shelley&amp;rsquo;s World, now devoid of life. A bloated, red sun scorches a landscape of towers, sculptures, and cryptic machinery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you encounter these elements, Elegy will cue you with a series of writing prompts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many stories to write and many places to visit, from the crumbling museum, stone faces and sweltering plains of Shelley&amp;rsquo;s World to the central planning station on Keats&amp;rsquo; World to the desiccated shores and frigid tundra of Byron&amp;rsquo;s World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each world offers multiple sets of prompts, each intended to inspire you to write a different story about it. Elegy might ask you to write a short story about an individual&amp;rsquo;s final days, a song about resignation, or a poem about war. In the more advanced levels, you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes get new information halfway through your story which casts a new light on things and forces you to take your story in a different direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
