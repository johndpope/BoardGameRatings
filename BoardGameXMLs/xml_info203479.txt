			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn of the Battleship simulates naval warfare from 1890 up to 1904, just before technology began to quickly change in the years leading up to WW I. During this period, there are no all-big-gun battleships, aircraft, gun directors, or radios. In the 1890s, 1,500 yards was considered effective range, and 3,000 yards was long range. If you've played other naval games, you'll have to get in real close if you want to hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn of the Battleship gives the player a taste of what it was like to command a ship or formation during a late 19th/early 20th century sea battle. A player with little or no experience in naval combat can quickly learn the basic principles of naval warfare, and use them in the game to fight and win. Tactics that worked in history will work in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can not only to recreate famous naval engagements such as the battles of Manila Bay and Santiago de Cuba, but also the myriad of &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo; battles between the rapidly growing fleets of Europe, Japan, and America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have played other Admiralty Trilogy games, this one uses the same terms and game system as the others (Harpoon, Command at Sea, and Fear God &amp;amp; Dread Nought). That makes it easy to learn and you know it will be accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
