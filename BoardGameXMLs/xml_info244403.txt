							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Along the Chesapeake</name>
									
			<description>It is the summer of 1814, and the British Navy controls the Chesapeake Bay. With that navy is a small professional army, fresh from the battlefields of Europe and Napoleonic warfare, ready to land on the shores along the bay and bring this war to an end. Their targets are Norfolk, Washington and Baltimore, the heart of American ship building and maritime industry. Standing in their way is a large disorganized militia and a handful of marines. The historical campaign resulted in Washington being burned, but now the decisions are yours...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;War of 1812 Campaigns&amp;quot; uses the game system from Worthington's &amp;quot;Blue and Gray&amp;quot; series adapted to this era. War Along the Chesapeake is Volume 1 and will be followed by Volume 2: War Along the Great Lakes and Volume 3: War Along the Gulf Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
