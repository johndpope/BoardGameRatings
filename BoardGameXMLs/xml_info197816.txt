			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who you are? You're a breeder! Become a llamaherd of your llamas, alpacas and guanacos - choose animals by their common characteristics and herd the flocks to get the points! Beware of malicious ducks - they will gather to hinder you in achieving the goal. Use the help of benevolent Dalai Lamas and cunning llamarustlers - but beware! - Your opponents may try to use them against you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title Lamokrady is a neologism, which comes from Polish words &amp;quot;lama&amp;quot; (llama) and &amp;quot;kraść&amp;quot; (to steel). It's catchy and familiar because of the similarity to word &amp;quot;koniokrady&amp;quot; (horse thieves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game players try to collect sets of llamas with common characteristics. Every llama features 4 characterstics and players want to play sets of 3 llamas with 1/2/3/4 common characterstic in order to gain 1/3/7/13 points. Other than llamas the deck of cards consist of disturbing ducks and helpful Dalai Lamas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player choose one of these actions:&lt;br/&gt;1) Play and score set of 3 llamas (with optional help of Dalai Lama) and draw 3 cards&lt;br/&gt;2) Play a set of 4 ducks and draw 4 cards&lt;br/&gt;3) Draw two cards from the deck and propose two cards from hand to next player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player was proposed with cards from previous player, instead of doing a normal turn she must do the following:&lt;br/&gt;4) Discard them at the beginning of her turn and perform a normal turn&lt;br/&gt;5) Accept the cards and propose two cards from hand to next player (this will count as a turn)&lt;br/&gt;6) Accuse the giver of proposing a duck&lt;br/&gt;6a) If the accusation was right, the current player receives 2 points, draw two cards from giver's hand, give her back the cards proposed, may perform action 1) or 2) and propose two cards for next player.&lt;br/&gt;6b) If the accusation was wrong, the giver receives two points, the cards proposed are discarded and the accuser loses her turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the deck is depleted. The player who gathers most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
