			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veletas is a drawless territory game for two players: Black and White. It&amp;rsquo;s played on the squares of a 10x10 square board, which is initially empty. Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A piece is a shooter, a black stone or a white stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A trapped shooter is a shooter that can&amp;rsquo;t make any legal move in the current position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board starts out empty. Black starts the game by placing three shooters on empty squares of the board, and then White places the remaining four in the same fashion. In both cases, no shooters can be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to any other. This restriction doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On his turn, a player can (but is not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any other pieces. Then, the player must place a stone of his color on an empty square which is on the same straight orthogonal or diagonal line as the destination square of the moved shooter (or any shooter, if none was moved), with no other pieces in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) can&amp;rsquo;t move or shoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this moment, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that haven&amp;rsquo;t been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game. Stones on top of shooters aren't part of any groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smaller versions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     7x7 board with three shooters. Black places one shooter on his first turn, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     9x9 board with five shooters. Black places two shooters on his first turn, and White places the other three. Whoever claims three shooters wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Boardspace.net (real-time, AI option)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
