			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plundered Hearts is an interactive fiction computer game created by Amy Briggs and published by Infocom in 1987. It was released simultaneously for several popular computer platforms of the time, such as the PC and Commodore 64. Plundered Hearts was Infocom's first (and only) game in the &amp;quot;romance&amp;quot; genre. It is Infocom's twenty-eighth game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a move that was formerly unusual for Infocom but increasingly common after its acquisition by Activision, Plundered Hearts casts the player in a well-defined role. The lead character is a young female in the late 17th century who has received a letter. Jean Lafond, the governor of the small West Indies island of St. Sinistra, says that the player's father has contracted a &amp;quot;wasting tropical disease&amp;quot;. Lafond suggests that his recovery would be greatly helped by the loving presence of his daughter, and sends his ship (the Lafond Deux) to transport her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game begins, the ship is attacked by pirates and the player's character is kidnapped. Eventually the player's character finds that two men are striving for her affections: dashing pirate Nicholas Jamison, and the conniving Jean Lafond. As the intrigue plays out, the lady does not sit idly by and watch the men duel over her; she must help Jamison overcome the evil plans of Lafond so they have a chance to live happily ever after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
