			<description>Love Means Nothing is a real-time tennis game for exactly four players. Players volley back and forth, rapidly playing the correct defensive card that also says where that response shot is headed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays with standard tennis scoring, so you can play a single game up to a full match. With only a count of five Wimbledons to respond, screwing up is inevitable, so when your partner drops the ball, you'll quickly see that Love means nothing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
