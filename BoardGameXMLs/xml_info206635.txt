			<description>Untamed: Life of a Cougar allows you to experience the life of a Mountain Lion (Puma, Cougar). You will fight other mountain lions for territory, find a mate and raise cubs of your own which will grow into adults as your parenting skills are put to the test. Hunt prey both big and small as you level up to become a more effective and lethal hunter, and fight off predators which pose an ever present danger to you and your cubs and ultimately come face to face with Man in the form of hunters who will waste no time to put you at the center of an active hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
