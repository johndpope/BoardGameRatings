			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game simulating the battle of Plassey 1757. One player is the Army of the East India Company. The other player is the Bengal Army. An Anglo-Indian Force of 3,000 men defeated a Bengal Army of 50,000 men.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a custom card deck. Each deck has five types of cards: Leader, Unit, Artillery, Defense, and Special. The cards depict elements of the historical campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players fight a battle by playing melds of cards. The meld having the higher total force value wins the battle. The winner of a battle takes one Territory Maker from the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to control all five Territory Markers. At the start of the game the British have two Territory Markers and the Bengali have three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
