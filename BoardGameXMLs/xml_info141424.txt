			<description>Ever wanted to make your friend bark like a dog three times, while rubbing their belly and slapping their knee? Then we have the perfect game for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules Lawyer, by designer Nathan Hansen, is a fast-paced, light-hearted, family-fun card game for 3 or more players with ever-changing rules. Each player takes turns altering and then obeying the current rules (&amp;quot;Laws&amp;quot;) of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to fulfill three Goal cards in your hand, therefore you must change the Laws (or hope someone else does) to your advantage. But beware, if you &amp;ndash; or someone you spot &amp;ndash; doesn't perform all of the Laws correctly or in order, you may lose some of your Goal cards, or players could steal Goal cards from you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for parties, family, and friends, see what rules you can come up with in Rules Lawyer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 2 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 2 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
