							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Real Texas</name>
									
			<description>The Real Texas is an action adventure game that plays like a mashup of Zelda: Link to the Past and Ultima VI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sam, an ordinary Texas rancher, is on holiday in England when he falls into a blue portal and lands in The Strange Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the game like? Is it more exploration or more shooting?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a pretty even balance between exploration/problem solving, and shooting/dungeons. There are no standard fetch quests or the like but the NPCs in the game all play a part in the unfolding of the story. You can open drawers or other furniture in peoples' houses, search things, store your items wherever you like or drop them on the ground-- a full inventory system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can interact with most objects, whether they do something or not, and NPCs have conversation trees as well as a day-and-night cycle. The game itself takes place in a fairly &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; area, so exploration is more focused on gradually unlocking new places or connecting them together rather than travelling to whole other towns. There's only one town in the game but it's really detailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a keyword system, which is used for trying out secret actions you might have thought of, or mentioning certain key phrases to NPCs. It's definitely not a text adventure game where you have to type very often, but it's super fun to figure out a secret topic to mention to somebody, and hear what they have to say. Typing in keywords is a comparatively minor part of the game, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
