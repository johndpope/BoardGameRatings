			<description>The Legend of Kage 2 is the sequel to The Legend of Kage, released for the Nintendo DS in Japan on March 13, 2008 (22 years after the original arcade game). It was released to North American retailers on October 8, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of either Kage, the ninja from the first game (armed with katana and shuriken), or Chihiro, a kunoichi from Iga raised by Hanzo Hattori (armed with kusarigama), both loyal to the shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa. Their mission is to rescue princess Kirihime, who was kidnapped by the demon-controlling villain Yoshiro Yukikusa and his right-hand ninja Yukinosuke Kiri in their attempt to overthrow the early Tokugawa shogunate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kage and Chichiro each have a personal story and 17 different ninjutsu techniques to master. They have skills such as abilities to climb vertical cliffs, hanging from ceilings, and blocking enemy attacks with the sword (which could also be done in the original game). The game introduces ninjpo skills such as Bunshin no Jutsu, a technique that creates deadly duplicates of the player. Mastering ninjutsu will enable players to launch powerful elemental attacks and summon monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Legend of Kage 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
