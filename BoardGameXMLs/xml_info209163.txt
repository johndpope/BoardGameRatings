			<description>Baumland, a.k.a. Bauland, is a communication and negotiation game in which the parties involved &amp;mdash; industry, agriculture, construction, ecology, and politics &amp;mdash; all try to nab the most valuable sites for themselves. The first four parties try to grab the best ground, with certain locations having different values for certain parties, while the politicians try to win together with one party (without being too obvious about it in order to avoid new elections).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different versions of the game make play more complicated through the introduction of secret collaborations. Be as honest or as mean as you like &amp;mdash; it's up to you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
