			<description>Wander is a collaborative, non-combat, non-competitive MMO game focused on narrative, exploration and joy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin as a giant tree. Storms that affect the known planets transform you, and continue to influence your path. A rare flower has many powers that can alter your course. Enchanting opera singers guide you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you explore, you begin to discover others in the the sprawling rainforest. Working together, you unlock new experiences, piece together the plot and enjoy the varied beauty that Wander has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wander features a gorgeous landscape, large scale non-competitive play and immersive sound design to create a world like no other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
