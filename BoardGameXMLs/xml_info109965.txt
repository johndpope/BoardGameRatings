			<description>Race game with some novel twists.&lt;br/&gt;The track on the board takes you on a journey to England. 18 picture cards are shuffled and placed face down on numbered circles at the top of the board. On your journey, should you land on the same numbered square as one of the circles above, you take the face-down picture card. This card is a souvenir of your trip and will score the points indicated. Only the first player to arrive at a square that is linked to a circle above, can take the picture card.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach England gains 10 points. Now everyone counts up the points on their souvenir cards and the player with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;One unusual rule. If you arrive home with the Slave-Girl (souvenir?!) cannot arrive in England with such a find. It must be returned to the board and he can choose any other souvenir card that is still unowned. England would appear to be the only country in Europe that bans slaves! By the way, if you want a Slave-Girl of your own, the place to go is Istanbul (square 65).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
