							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dave Mirra BMX Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Dave Mirra BMX Challenge brings you all the air and sick tricks you would expect from a game with Dave Mirra's name on it. You'll be challenged to racing and trick competitions to prove your skill on the ground as well as above it. Sophisticated bike and rider physics give the game realistic responsiveness, letting you feel every hill, snap every trick, and squeeze every bit of speed out of your rider. Lose your form, and you'll feel those same physics drive you into the ground mercilessly. Kiss the sky or the concrete . . . it's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
