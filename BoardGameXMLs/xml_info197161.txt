			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soul's body has died, and Arbiter has come to guide them into the afterlife. First, though, they must face judgement. Their sins and virtues must be weighed, and the consequences of their actions in life will be explored. Only then will they be permitted to pass beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heart and Feather is a roleplaying game designed for one player and a GM and should take less than two hours to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player of Heart and Feather represents the Soul being judged. The GM represents the Arbiter. The Soul would like to be judged to have lived a good life, and should attempt to cast their actions in the best possible light. The Arbiter is there to ensure that the important events of the Soul's life are laid bare, and pushes the Soul to see the full consequence of their actions in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
