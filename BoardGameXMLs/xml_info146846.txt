			<description>In Tricky Track, a simple game of strategy, elephants and cats compete to reach the end of a track of shapes &amp;mdash; but they need to be wary of traps as dogs will push the cats back while mice will scare the elephants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, each player takes one elephant and one cat of the same color, then places them on their starting positions at opposite ends of the track. On a turn, a player rolls the die, then advances either his cat or his elephant to the next position on the track with the same shape as the one shown on the die. If a player decides to advance the cat and it lands on a mouse, it jumps to the next position with the same shape &amp;mdash; but if it would land on a dog, the cat jumps back to the previous position with the same shape. Similarly, if he would advance an elephant onto a mouse, the elephant instead jumps backwards to the previous position with the same shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to advance both his elephant and his cat to their respective ends of the track wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
