			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHOENIX LAIR is an arcade style game comprised of 10 boards and 10 speed levels. It is unlike any game on the market today. Multiple strategies, an interlude jousting challenge between boards, bright and lively colors and music add to the already superb play of this completely unique and different game. Game Play: The game begins at board one and advances to higher boards after successful completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many obstacles are encountered on the various boards as points are accumulated. At the beginning of each board, the Phoenix must leave its lair in search of enemy eggs. The Phoenix flight is controlled in height by the joystick button, and in direction by the joystick itself. After successfully destroying at least six of these eggs the Phoenix must return to the far right side of its lair. Points are awarded based on the total number of eggs destroyed and the time in which it took to complete the mission. A fast mission will result in additional bonus points. You begin with 5 lives and gain additional lives at boards 7, 9 and 10. PHOENIX LAIR is all machine language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
