			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Note that all details for this game are preliminary. This game has not been released, and since its announced release date has long since passed, this game might never be released. This listing serves as a historical record; you are invited to submit corrections or update this section if additional information comes to light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reins of Power is a huge board game of contemporary or near-future geopolitics, superpower diplomacy, and global conflict. Each player takes on the role of the head-of-state of a world power, from the US to the European Union, and attempts to steer this power to global supremacy. Each player also takes on the role of another player&amp;rsquo;s domestic political opposition and attempts to thwart that player&amp;rsquo;s every move. Execute regime change in Third World countries, combat terrorism, and project your power with carrier battle-groups. Expect lots of plastic figures, including carriers, submarines, tanks, and mushroom clouds, lots of cards, dice, markers, and other great components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
