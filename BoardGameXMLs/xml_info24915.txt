			<description>This game, one of several in existence with the title of &amp;quot;Airport&amp;quot;, was published as a promotional game for Zurich Airport. Zurich Airport has been branded as &amp;quot;Unique Airport&amp;quot; and this game is duly published by &amp;quot;Verlag Unique&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board which represents sections of the airport departures area from check-in through to the fuselage of the plane itself. Each player has eight &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; and has to shepherd them through from the check-in desk, via a transit desk and a boarding desk. Each player has three action points each turn and four different actions are available. Actions include, besides moving a piece onwards, trading cards in for victory points. Victory points can be earned in various ways including visiting shops and the restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the first player embarks all eight pieces on the plane. The winner is the player with most victory points at this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is described in the Spielbox review as reminiscent of the Malefiz game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
