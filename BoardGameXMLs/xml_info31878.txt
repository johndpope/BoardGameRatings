			<description>Which Way, Please? is a map reference game for children Ages 4 and up. It is designed to teach small children about the concept of grid maps. It consists of six collecting boards divided into nine grid squares, and 54 picture cards that magnify the village images on the collecting squares. The picture cards have grid references on their backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three games that can be played. The Solo Game asks the child to go through the picture cards one by one and match the grid references to the correct square on the right collecting board. When all cards are placed, the child then turns the cards over to see if the pictures correspond to those on the boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lotto Game doles out the collecting boards to each child. Each child in turn takes a card and shows it to everyone. If a player recognizes it as one that belongs on their board, that child gets the card. The first one to fill up the board is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Skill Game, the boards are connected to create a large village. The cards are turned up one by one, and the first child to call out the correct grid reference wins the card. The child with the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
