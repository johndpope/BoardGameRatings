							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Light on the Mountain (SW)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A Light on the Mountain it is 1943 and a group of brave Allied investigators are asked to attend the testing grounds at RAF Acaster Mablis. Their mission? To carry out a check on a group of scientists working on a revolutionary propulsion system that is nearing completion and is now ready for final testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, all is not quite as it seems and the Investigators will soon be plunged into a thrilling adventure which takes them way beyond the narrow confines of their mission parameters, to confront monstrous foes, probe a dark conspiracy and explore a mystery as pitiless as the mountains themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Light on the Mountain is the first episode in Achtung! Cthulhu's Living Campaign, and it can be played as a standalone adventure in its own right, but it is also the first part of a series of free, linked adventures which will appear periodically, all leading toward our epic Forest of Fear campaign book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
