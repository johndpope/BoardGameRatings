			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;You are US Army soldiers tasked with clearing the road between Kabul to Kandahar of IEDs during the invasion of Afghanistan. &lt;br/&gt;This works draws on a number of things that have been rattling around in my brain recently: the TV series &amp;lsquo;Generation Kill&amp;rsquo;, boards games &amp;lsquo;A Distant Plain&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;The Grizzled&amp;rsquo;, and number of magazine articles about the war in Afghanistan. It also draws on both &amp;lsquo;The Quiet Year&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;The Fall of Magic&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Comments&lt;br/&gt;Playing soldiers in Afghanistan is quite original. I like the idea of the physical layout of the cards representing the road to Kandahar; it&amp;rsquo;s a neat marriage of mechanics and theme. It seems like the stories that come out of this one could be really intense and emotional. - Jason Cordova&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was one of three winners in the 200 Word RPG Challenge 2017200 Word RPG challenge 2017[/rpgseries]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
