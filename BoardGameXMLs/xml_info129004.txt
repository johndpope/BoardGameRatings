							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ganymede Job</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover and introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You prefer to call yourselves freelance specialists. Others prefer to call you corporate mercenaries, but what&amp;rsquo;s in a name? Besides, the pay is good, and as the man once said: It&amp;rsquo;s a dirty job but someone&amp;rsquo;s got to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On face value it looked like a juicy contract: infiltrate a corporate lab on Ganymede and steal an item of interest to your employers. A simple piece of corporate espionage. You go in, you grab the goods, and you get out.&lt;br/&gt;You thought all you had to fear was getting caught. You were wrong. Very wrong...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ganymede Job is a short Cthulhu Rising adventure designed to be played by a group of up to 6 players in one gaming&lt;br/&gt;session. It is a prequel to Escape Velocity from the Chaosium monograph Jovian Nightmares, and owning this publication is&lt;br/&gt;a distinct advantage to Keepers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
