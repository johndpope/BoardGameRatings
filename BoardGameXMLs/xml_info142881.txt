							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inverse World Accelerated</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inverse World &amp;ndash; so named by outsiders, who came from beyond the world&amp;rsquo;s crust. Inside, they found a massive, windy void, with a glowing star shining in the center. A ring of islands orbits this star, and far above lies a ceiling of stone. The Inverse World is on the inside of a planet, and could even be inside of an already existing campaign world, if you dig deep enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The locals call it a different name, however: Invells. Invells is a mystical place, where an imprisoned god casts light and rain up to the top of the world, and then it all drains back down to the center. The great god Sola is trapped in the center of Invells, a massive burning star that created the light and rain from which all life in Invells was formed. Well, most life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invells is a bizarre world, filled with all manner of flying fish, strange monsters, wondrous machinery, and Sola&amp;rsquo;s children, the three spirit-blessed races. Airships, great chains, and winged angels bridge the open gaps between the floating islands. Shanty towns of wood and iron cling to the top of the world. Great cities of light and gold are hidden within the sea of clouds surrounding Sola&amp;rsquo;s cage, a molten sea of gold with a god trapped inside. There is much to see, and all of it is just out of reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse World Accelerated is a supplement for the Fate Accelerated Edition tabletop roleplaying game, set in Invells, a wholly different sort of fantasy world. Inverse World is built around the idea of making fantasy fantastic again, by introducing a world unlike any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes everything you need to play Fate Accelerated Edition - no other books required! It also includes information on the various types of explorers and people found in Invells, along with detailed and highly customizable character creation options. Inverse World Accelerated introduces the Inverting mechanic, allowing you to make the most out of bad rolls, and features a unique method of character advancement built around Discoveries - you improve by learning more about the world around you and adapting to what you've discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also introduces the new setting of Invells, but it does so with an aura of mystery and a bit of strangeness &amp;ndash; nothing about Invells is locked in place except what the players say about it. Rather than list solid facts about anywhere, Invells is full of Rumors, and you play to find out what exactly is true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
