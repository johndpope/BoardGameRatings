							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Friendship Game</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rules-light storytelling game focuses on developing a shared narrative among friends.  It is assumed that the players are friends and also that their characters are friends; the game is not intended to involve much confrontation or opposition and any that does arise is dealt with by a simple dice mechanic.  Characters are defined by narrative descriptions only and play involves exchanging tokens to track relative status.  Play proceeds in phases with the narrative focus shifting between characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sister game, Oxident - Western Whitewashed Workers,  explores the other, not-so-happy, corners of relationships and life.  The two games offer slightly different implementation details of the mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
