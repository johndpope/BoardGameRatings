							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike Fighters Project 1</name>
									
			<description>Strike Fighters Project 1 is a combat/flight simulator that primarily centers on a fictitious conflict in the Middle East between the Kingdom of Dhimar and the Empire of Paran from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Although the countries and conflict may not be real the aircraft and weapons used are completely accurate. The conflict mirrors a typical 'proxy' war between the USA and USSR where Dhimar gets help from the United States and Paran uses imported Soviet equipment and expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Fighters Project 1 was released in 2002. The initial reviews reflected a poor, unfinished game that had some exceptional 3D models of aircraft. This was the result of an early unfinished version of the game being sold by a leading US chain store, possibly through the publisher's haste to get the game onto store shelves. European users were sold a version which was upgraded with a &amp;quot;Service Pack 1&amp;quot; that rectified many of the problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are thousands of free modifications for the game, most of them to a very high commercial standard. The strength of the game lies in what the game player can make of it because about 95% of the modifications can be carried out by most users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Strike Fighters: Project 1&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
