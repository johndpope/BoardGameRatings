			<description>HELP CHIPS SAVE HIS VILLAGE &amp;ndash; ONE POTATO AT A TIME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Potatoland, where our hero, Chips, and his fellow citizens feed potatoes to the Potato Monster in order to get their food, supplies and luxury items. But when the beast suddenly collapses and all the potatoes disappear, Chips and his friends are lost with no idea how to survive. That&amp;rsquo;s where YOU come in.
