			<description>Author's summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There it sits at the top of the closet, collecting dust, only remembered briefly during moves or when looking for winter coats. The shoebox. It&amp;rsquo;s old and worn, and has that cheap cardboard smell that was never meant to withstand the test of time. Still, for all of its flimsy mix of glue and tree pulp, it has since become a vault for old memories not often revisited. Pieces of the past you don&amp;rsquo;t look at, but don&amp;rsquo;t discard either. Contained within, amid photographs and old spoons and movie ticket stubs, is a lifetime made tangible. The story of your relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to open up the shoebox and relive the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoebox is a role-playing game for two players, who together tell the story of a relationship from beginning to end through a box of keepsakes collected over that relationship. It may be joyous or tragic. It may be a whirlwind romance, a summer fling, or a love for the ages. But it is a love, or was at some point, and the course of love never did run smooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
