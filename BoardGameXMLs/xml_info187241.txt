			<description>Fliqochet is a dexterity area-control game where players take turns flicking game pucks across the game board attempting to accumulate the most points by successfully getting their pucks to rest into designated scoring zones. A Match is played over a number of Rounds and Games. A Round consists of flicking 9 pucks each. At the end of any Round if a threshold of 100 points or better is accomplished by one or both opponents then the player with the higher tally wins a Game. The first player to win 4 Games wins the Match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
