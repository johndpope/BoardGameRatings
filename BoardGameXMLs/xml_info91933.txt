							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chili Con Carnage</name>
									
			<description>Chili Con Carnage is an action/adventure third-person shooter video game. It plays very closely to the terms of Max Payne, but is not as themed toward Grand Theft Auto as its predecessor Total Overdose was. Chili Con Carnage is developed by Deadline Games and published by Sci Entertainment in Europe and by Eidos in North America. Total Overdose was released September 27, 2005. Chili Con Carnage is not actually a true sequel to Total Overdose, as it goes by a different title and has a story that has nothing to do with Total Overdose. Many reviews of the game classify it as a remake of Total Overdose for the PlayStation Portable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chili Con Carnage,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
