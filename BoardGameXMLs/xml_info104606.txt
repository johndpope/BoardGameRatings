			<description>An English soccer game. You get 25 players, enough for two teams plus two substitutes.Every player has a moveable leg that, when let go, can kick the ball for a shot on goal or a pass to a team-mate.&lt;br/&gt;The board is a large green baize cloth and you get plastic goals.&lt;br/&gt;And enamel paints are enclosed in each game so that you can paint your team in your favourite team's colours.&lt;br/&gt;On its release, the game used Martin Chivers (a famous England centre-forward at the time) to promote the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
