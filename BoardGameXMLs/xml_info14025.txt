			<description>With just the right mixture of skill and luck (this is politics, after all), you'll find yourself increasingly caught up in the excitement of a hard-fought Presidential Election that goes down to the wire. Find out what it really feels like to be a politician forced to take positions on issues that please and placate--but don't alienate--the various constituencies and interest groups necessary to reach the critical 270 Electoral Votes needed to win the election.&lt;br/&gt;    You decide which states to focus on, which interest groups to cater to, and which regions of the country to concentrate your efforts in. The game reflects actual current demographics and issues. The Democrat will have difficulty winning traditionally Republican states and vice-versa. Eleven states are key swing states, the same states that were considered &amp;quot;battleground states&amp;quot; in the 2004 election.&lt;br/&gt;    Larger states tend to stay undecided through most of the game keeping the final outcome in doubt until the very end. Other aspects of the game allow a player who is  behind a constant possibility of being able to catch up. Once you start playing you won't want to stop. Once you finish a game, you'll want to play another.&lt;br/&gt;     It is a great 2 or 4 player game. In the four player game each Presidential candidate has a VP running mate.&lt;br/&gt;As teammates they each focus on winning states in different parts of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
