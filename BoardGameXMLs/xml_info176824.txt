							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yashima: Legend of the Deep Woods</name>
									
			<description>The sunlight trickles through the foliage as you set foot into the Deep Woods. Here, the kami are as treacherous as the sinister vines on the forest floor. Treat nature with respect, however, and the leaves just might part to welcome you. What hidden secrets await you, guarded in the thick heart of the wood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yashima: Legend of the Deep Woods is a fifth-player expansion to the fast-paced combat game, Yashima: Legend of the Kami Masters. This expansion adds two new kami masters and one new kami, adding a tantalizing array of new character abilities and strategies to the core game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gives you everything you need to add one additional player to the base game! &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Are you ready for 5-player free-for-all combat?&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Combine with Yashima: Legend of the Icy Peaks expansion for epic 6-player team-based showdowns!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play as Dokubaba, the plague hag, stricken with a vile poison. Use your noxious abilities to drain your foes&amp;rsquo; health every turn. Make them fall, before the disease consumes you!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play as Toru, the jolly druid, with the power to magically grow plants as easily as he laughs. Sow seeds in the bellies of your enemies, then make them explode for a painful surprise!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Join spirits with the Fox kami, the elusive guardian of the forest. Use your agility to attack first, then use your strength of spirit to play more tome effects, while preventing the effects of your foes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
