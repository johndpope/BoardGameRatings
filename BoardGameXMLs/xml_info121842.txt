			<description>Rules for a grand tactical Napoleonic miniatures game.  Infantry are mounted three figures to 1&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot; base representing about 400 men.  Calvary are mounted two figures to a 2&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot; stand representing about 300 men and horses.  Artillery are mounted two men and a gun on a 2&amp;quot;x3&amp;quot; stand and represent about 200 men and 8 to 12 guns.  Each turn represents one hour of game time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his a turn, a player moves any and all units up to their movement allowance, then declares attacks.  An attack is resolved based on the combat factors of the units, the unit characteristics, and terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook contains no information on how to design scenarios.  Players sometimes recreated historical battles or historical what-ifs.  Sometimes they played miscellaneous forces with no historical context.  Many games were played as part of campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
