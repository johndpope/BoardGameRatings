							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Tomb of the Dragon Mages</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a thousand years the Dragon Mages reigned supreme in the land. With their armies, monsters and magic, the sorcerous rulers constantly strived to expand their empire, while the conquered populace lived lives of fear and servitude. Then a series of wars brought an end to the Empire of the Dragon Mages and altered the very landscape. Ancient sites still exist, though, where the lost wealth and magic of the Dragon Mages can be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the tomb of the Dragon Mages and search for lost wealth and magic. But beware, the treasure is likely to be guarded by traps both magical and mundane and no one knows what creatures may lurk within the halls. Universal Adventures Tomb of the Dragon Mages includes 18 Encounter Cards, 18 Event Cards, 9 Sarcophagus Cards and 9 Search Cards. With the cards you can generate encounters, events and the results of search actions as adventurers explore the dungeon. And with the all new Sarcophagus cards you can discover what lies within a sarcophagus the characters discover. Like all Universal Adventures products, Tomb of the Dragon Mages can be used with any fantasy adventure rpg, solo or with a group, with or without a GM. Tomb of the Dragon Mages can be used independently or in conjunction with other Universal Adventures products. Use the Dungeon Deck to create the adventure site or use a map of your own. With Universal Adventures products you&amp;rsquo;ll always have a way to play your favorite fantasy rpg&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
