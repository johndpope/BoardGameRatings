			<description>Coin Rail Yard is a Solitaire game (1 player) where the player will take on the duties of the yardmaster for the game's Rail Yard. The player will operate the Locomotives which will break-down arriving Trains and build-up departing Trains.&lt;br/&gt;   The player will run through one of the sixteen scenarios, keeping track of how many turns that it took to complete the day's work. The final score will be determined by the number of turns plus any penalty occurred for mistakes. &lt;br/&gt;   There is a small amount of randomness in the game. There is also some flexibility in how the rail cars are arranged in the yard before the first Train arrives. This randomness and flexibility means that a scenario need not play out the same way the second time through. The game also comes with the guidelines for how to generate your own scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;   Several expansion maps are planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
