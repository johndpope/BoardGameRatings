							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dishonor Among Thieves</name>
									
			<description>Five to seven players band together to steal gold and treasures from three buildings. They must work together to be successful, but as any thief knows, your own gain is your number one priority. Competitive Cooperation is needed to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will either all fail together, or will work together to make it to the end of the game where the player with the most victory points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have a set of actions available every turn that will help (or hurt) each other success in their missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As dishonorable a thief as you are, open negotiation is part of the game. For example, why don't I give you two gold pieces to play that bad card on Ryan (sorry Ryan) instead of me?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
