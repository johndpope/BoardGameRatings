							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speeding Train</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the rails the sandy desert stretches in either direction to the very horizon, at least when the dust storms, which are quite common here about, don't severely  restrict visibility. On some days one might not even be able to see beyond the reach of his arms. Currently though it would be possible to enjoy the monotonous panorama dotted by small rocks and the occasional cactus while the train speeds along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is, with its ten freight cars, actually quite short compared to other trains on this route. It is after all not one of the trains pulling hundreds of heavily loaded ore carts. It is not one of the trains returning the empty carts either. This train's sole purpose is to supply the few maintenance stations along the route and the mines at its end, with water and other necessities. Among other things it carries the monthly pay for the employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
