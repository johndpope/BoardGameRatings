							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maidenheim Book II: The History of Scythae and The Fate of Man</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Scythae has a long history, much of which has been lost in antiquity. Once, there were many great libraries filled with tomes and scrolls, histories and legends of that which came before and that which has long since passed. During the Wars of Man, much was lost and destroyed, burned and forgotten by the conquering tribes and nations that founded Ancient Carthia. In their victory, they destroyed what they could of the past so that no one would remember their deeds, rewriting history to suit their own designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
