			<description>A card game of commanding armies.  Players take turns in this game building armies to smite their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player shuffles their own deck, and draws 5 cards, along with some resource markers, to begin the game.  On each player's turn, the following phases are worked through:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready Phase: the player either draws a card from their deck into their hand, or gains one gold, and all expended cards are readied (untapped, ala Magic: The Gathering).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production and Upkeep Phase: All cards that may produce resources may do so now.  If they do, they are expended (turned face down).  After resources have been collected, minion's salaries must be paid from the player's resource pool.  Any minion whose salary isn't paid is discarded from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Phase: Use resources to buy more minions and resource producers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack Phase: Declare attacks against the other player with your minions.  The defending player determines which of their minions block.  Any unblocked minions deal damage to the defending player's health.  When a player's health is reduced to zero that player loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Phase: Discard down to 5 cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to reduce the opponent's health to zero while preventing yours from receiving fatal damage.  To do this, a clever combination of resource management and strategy in attack is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
