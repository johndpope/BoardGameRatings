							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Art Gallery Game</name>
									
			<description>The game uses an Artist and Collector metaphor. Similar to &amp;quot;real life,&amp;quot; artists try to &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; (compile) enough art work to have a gallery exhibition and art collectors also try to &amp;quot;collect&amp;quot; (compile) enough work from varied art periods to have a gallery exhibition. Whoever completes their collection first not only gets to have their own gallery exhibition, but they also gain recognition, fame and fortune. And, best of all, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contests:&lt;br/&gt;1 board, &lt;br/&gt;4 player pieces (cubes of primary colors), &lt;br/&gt;1 die, &lt;br/&gt;4 Collector easels and 4 Artist easels (2 sections each), 108 Gallery cards (includes 4 Wild cards and 4 Punishment cards), &lt;br/&gt;100 Question cards, &lt;br/&gt;18 Forgery cards &lt;br/&gt;7 artist&amp;rsquo;s Portrait cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
