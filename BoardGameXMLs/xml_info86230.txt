							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Michael Jackson: The Experience (Wii/PS3/Xbox 360)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Jackson: The Experience is a multiplatform dancing game. The game is based around dancing like Jackson, and the soundtrack is comprised of a collection of his songs including &amp;ldquo;Smooth Criminal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Black or White&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay varies slightly between platforms, but the general mechanic is the same: while the song is playing, the player must mimic Michael Jackson&amp;rsquo;s moves on-screen to gain points. For the Wii edition, the game tracks movements through the Wii remote, and it is possible for the player to simply move their arm in the sequence desired by the game. The PS3 and Xbox 360 editions, however, are designed for the Playstation Move and Kinect, respectively, and are based around full body movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Experience also includes a Karaoke feature that scores players on their singing prowess as well. This option can be turned off for those players that simply want to dance. The Wii version does not have karaoke scoring capabilities, but will scroll the words to songs while they are played. The Wii version allows up to four people to dance simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is also available for the PSP and DS as a rhythm game, which has the players tap along to Jackson&amp;rsquo;s moves using the buttons or stylus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
