			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you are a hitman, an assassin who eliminates targets for anyone paying the right amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your skill is stealth, approaching your enemies unseen, firing a bullet from a neighbouring rooftop, hacking automated defences or demolishing a building to eliminate everyone inside, you are always in demand. With the protection of the Guild, you need not fear retribution once you escape the scene of the crime &amp;ndash; the scrubbers have your back. Every trace of you, every piece of camera footage, everyone who will testify that you were there will vanish without a trace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that falls to you is the kill itself and, in that, you're an expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Era: Hitman is a game that gives you the best of both worlds: reality-bending superpowers and the mandate to use them however you like as long as you succeed in your mission!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by video game titles such as Hitman and Assassin's Creed, this game places you in a modern setting where your mission is to eliminate your target by whatever means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
