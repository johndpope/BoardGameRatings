			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GameMaster's Apprentice deck is a set of tools meant to be helpful for anyone running a roleplaying game. The randomizers on the cards aren&amp;rsquo;t linked to any particular game system, setting, or even genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general purpose of this deck is to create and arbitrate the sort of story ideas and decisions often made by a GameMaster, but which can sometimes be randomized - perhaps to make the decision more &amp;quot;fair,&amp;quot; or maybe just to help the GM come up with something totally new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 120 card faces in this deck contains a set of fourteen randomizers. While each randomizer has a specific purpose for which it was designed, I did my best to make the cards as flexible as possible. How each randomizer, or the deck as a whole, is used depends entirely upon the needs of the group, Game Master, or player using them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item contains general instructions and numerous pages of print-and-play components (cards) designed especially for use with ALONe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
