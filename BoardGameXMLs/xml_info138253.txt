			<description>Space Dogsbody is a quirky game of space exploration, resource collection, and reputation management. The players fly around space mining asteroids, fulfilling menial missions, ferrying tourists, dodging pirates and upgrading their ships, trying to make a name for themselves and some quick cash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40% of the board starts off face-down, and players will have to explore these tiles by flying onto them, hoping to find sources of valuable minerals or lost space stations offering powerful upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also tourists who will pay to be carried around space, as long as the players have a Spare Bed for the tourist to sleep on in the cargo bay. Upgrades like Business Cards will increase the reputation payout for completing missions, and the players can sell Advertising Space on the side of their ship for another source of income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players acquire reputation in each of four categories, all of which carry sizeable monetary rewards for certain levels. Merchant reputation comes from selling resources, Freelancer from fulfilling missions, Hacker from installing upgrades on your ship, and Vigilante from destroying pirates with lasers or explosives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
