							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Videocart-17: Pinball Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for 32 different game options for 6 different games with 11 paddle sizes. We guarantee you will break out in a cold sweat before you break in to an upper level of fun in this exciting game cartridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIN BALL CHALLENGE (Basic Game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paddle appears on the screen and the game starts. You get a total of 7 balls served whether you are playing alone or with someone. The object of this game is to bounce the ball off your paddle and chip away at the 3 colors of blocks. You receive points for each block you hit. Each of the 3 color levels is two blocks thick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lowest or green level is worth 1 point for each block hit; the middle or blue level is worth 4 points; and, the top or red level is worth 7 points for each hit. You will recieve 384 points for eating away all the blocks in the 3 levels. If you accomplish this, for example, in 5 balls; another block wall immediately appears and you will keep going for the 2 remaining balls. The object of Pin Ball Challenge is to get the highest score for 7 balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term Pinball in the title is misleading -- this game is actually more similar to Breakout and not at all like Pinball (hence the note at the start of the instructions about the game causing you to &amp;quot;break out&amp;quot; in a cold sweat!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six different games, named in the manual as follows: Pinball Wiz, Cooperation Partners, Crossover Partners, Pro Challenge, Block Shot, and Double Block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32 different game modes are created through various combinations of the following options: Paddle Shrink, Changing Paddle, Ball Speedup, Invisible Blocks, and Pro Speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
