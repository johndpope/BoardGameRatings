							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penal Battalion</name>
									
			<description>You find yourself part of a Penal Battalion somewhere on the Eastern Front during World War II.  Your unit's current job is clearing minefields.  You can't exactly refuse to work, but there's no need to rush headlong into eager compliance with every order, is there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penal Battalion is a very simple solitaire card game of strategy.  The object is straightforward: if you go BOOM, you lose.  If you survive through the whole deck, you &amp;quot;win,&amp;quot; and get to do the same thing tomorrow...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Panzer Digest #1.  Requires a standard deck of 52 playing cards and several markers (pennies, buttons, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
