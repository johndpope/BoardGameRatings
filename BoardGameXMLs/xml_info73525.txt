			<description>Potlatch is the Pure Card Line revision of The Great Potlatch. With revised gameplay, revamped roles, and a new card system, a lot more than the format has changed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of Native Americans engaged in a six-day festival of rituals, offerings, totem carving, and gifting.  The player with the most respect at the end of the 6 days wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 different roles to choose from: the Elder, the Carver, and the Shaman.  Each role grants the player different abilities.  Each tribe card can be used in several different ways: it can be given as an offering to the ancestors, combined with offerings to be carved into a totem, or discarded in a certain combination to start a ritual, with each scoring a different amount of points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, cards can be given as gifts during the daily potlatch to help determine status within the tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
