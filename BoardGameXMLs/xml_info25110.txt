			<description>From the box description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Out! is the ultimate card game for those who love to be part of the action at all times!  This 60 card deck with its blistering action cards makes everyone a target and a power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt seven cards; then it's time to PLAY BALL!

Use awesome Action cards like the Double Play card to throw opponents' players out and draw again, bomb pitchers and remove them from the game!  No one is safe in this game -- play Action cards on any opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
