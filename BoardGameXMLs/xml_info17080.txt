			<description>Colledge is a drinking/party board game for coed players, aged 21 and over (due to adult themes and alcohol). The object of the game is to reach the top of the board and graduate from college first. When players land on certain squares, they must draw cards, collect money, or make rules that must be followed by the other players. &amp;quot;Spell cards&amp;quot; require players to do such things as have phone sex, fake an orgasm, and spend time in a closet with another player. &amp;quot;Challenge cards&amp;quot; involve activities such as trivia questions, arithmetic, playing quarters, arm wrestling, and drinking. According to the Justintime website, Colledge gets players &amp;quot;laughing, drinking and hooking up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
