			<description>DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;It's Christmas time, but somehow, the spirit of warmth and goodwill has gone astray.  The tree IS greener on the other side; and certainly, the presents look more expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So... since your neighbours won't be giving all that lovely loot to you, you're just going to have to take it by stealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruit an army of elves.&lt;br/&gt;Build up your defenses.&lt;br/&gt;Steal your neighbour's presents before they steal yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player needs 1 deck of cards.  There is no limit to the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 6 cards in front of them face-down, representing 6 presents under 6 branches of their Christmas tree.  Each branch comes with a decoration card; these are defenses (e.g. Tinsel  barbed wire, Fairy lights  electric fence).  During their turn, players may play elf cards to form squads, then send the squads of elves to attack their neighbour, attempting to steal their presents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elf Defense uses the mechanics of a Magic: the Gathering circle of death to allow any number of players to join in, without significant downtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL&lt;br/&gt;A player is eliminated when they have no presents remaining.  When there is only one player left, the player who has captured the most presents is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADDITIONAL INFO&lt;br/&gt;Elf Defense is an entry for the Christmas print &amp;amp; play competition here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/569801/christmas-print-and-play-game-design-contest-1st&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/569801/christmas-print-and-p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
