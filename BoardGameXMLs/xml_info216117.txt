							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Presidential Knife Fight</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clones of the former Presidents of the United States battle it out to become the Supreme President of These United States! Each body at your feet and every turn around the arena is another vote in your pocket. Get rid of the opposing Presidents by killing them, corrupting them, or having them dragged away kicking and screaming. Survive the carnage by dodging, bribing, and making treaties with your opponents. Your own President may be lost in the fight, but another will always rise up to take their place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presidential Knife Fight brings long-dead Presidents back to life for ruthless combat and historical satire in a card game for 3-6 players. The first 43 Presidents- George Washington through George W. Bush, are all represented in card form, each with a unique ability based on their time in office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game with 3 President cards and gets to choose which order to play them. Maybe George Washington to go first, then Bill Clinton to escape every danger, and clean up with Teddy Roosevelt, the unstoppable killing machine. Gain votes by killing opposing Presidents, surviving a full turn around the table, or through special abilities. Get 5 votes to win the game and become Supreme President of These United States!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player gets 3 actions which they can spend on stabbing their enemies, drawing cards, playing cards, or using their presidential ability; allowing them to build their turn as offensively or defensively as they'd like. Presidents can die from wounds or be thrown out of office from corruption, but dead players re-enter the fight with a new President at the start of their next turn, ensuring no one is out for too long. Players use a shared deck of Action cards, filled with Attacks to kill your enemies, Reactions to keep you alive, and Executive Actions to change up the game. Steal someone's cards with the Patriot Act, have your Scapegoat take the fall for you, or rig the re-election to make sure you never lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
