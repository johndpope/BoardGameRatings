			<description>In Shut Up &amp;amp; Take My Money, you take on the role of fledging game designers using crowdfunding to pitch your game ideas. Be the most creative and convincing player to become the next superstar of the gaming world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, the players combine Idea Cards with one Project Card to create different games. Then, when they are all ready, the players take turn pitching their games to the other players and answering potential questions. Finally, the players vote for the games they liked the most and the least, and earn Fame Tokens accordingly. After 4 rounds, the player with the most Fame Tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was selected by Cards Against Humanity as one of eight finalists for Tabletop Deathmatch 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
