			<description>Lo Tarot is edited for the purpose of &amp;quot;easiest Tarot trick taking game with full 78 cards&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played with 4 players. Only one surviving bidder becomes the declarer and plays against the other 3 players (1 v.s. 3). The purpose of a normal game is take and get enough point-cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) You must play a card of same suit as lead from. &lt;br/&gt;2) If you have no same suit card as the lead, you must play a trump.&lt;br/&gt;3) If you have no same suit card as lead and trump, you may play any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all players pass the bid, the object of the game changes to something called Ramsch. Ramsch means not to take point-cards. At Ramsch, every player fights each other (battle royal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
