			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroyer Command is a naval simulation released by Ubisoft in 2002 and developed by the now-defunct Ultimation Inc. The game placed the player in command of a destroyer during World War II, featuring campaigns from both the Pacific War and the Second Battle of the Atlantic. Customized missions may be played and players can select the opponent's forces and their own. Players can also have the chance to choose the difficulty rating in different games by adjusting the different realism ratings such as Table Fog and Unlimited Ammo. One of the features was the ability to play against owners of Silent Hunter II online, allowing both destroyer and U-Boat commanders to square off against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
