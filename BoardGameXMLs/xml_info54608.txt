			<description>It has been 2 days since the zombie outbreak. A handful of clich&amp;eacute; characters have managed to survive the onslaught by holing at the center of the town. But a rescue never comes. Worse still, the zombies are beginning to gather on the town. As their numbers grow, so does a strange intelligence in the undead hordes. Time grows short. If the characters wish to survive they have to do it themselves by escaping to the outskirts of the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Posthumous, half the players will command a single cliche character apiece, while the other half direct hordes of themed zombies. The town's layout, characters' and zombies strengths and weaknesses are all randomized each game, making every play through a distinguished experience. While on the surface, Posthumous's humor celebrates the proud history of the Zombie Flick, the game is at its core one of cunning and tactical use of your entire team's abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Posthumous's unique mechanics reduce downtime and keep the players plotting, laughing, and guessing. Games of up 10 players can expect their games to last no longer than games with only 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
