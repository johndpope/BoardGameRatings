							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Olive Tree</name>
									
			<description>There are many ways to promote the growth of an Olive Tree so it may endure through the centuries. Cutting branches and grafting them onto the strong rootstock is one way to ensure longevity. Another benefit is pruning back some branches in order to propagate the growth of others. Water is also very essential because the tree will require the former and latter rainfall. Even though this all has a physical application of how to maintain a healthy tree, the Bible uses this concept to express spiritual lessons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In John 15:5 Christ says He is the vine and we are the branches... If we take that into account then the people in the Bible that followed God's commandments are &amp;quot;those branches&amp;quot; of The Olive Tree. Through the course of history Egypt, Assyria and Babylon, just to name a few, were all bent on suppressing or destroying God's people by any means possible. Will God's people make it past these tough trials?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many Bible games that do trivia. However, this is the first and only that focuses on learning the Bible timeline and where those people are placed in history. Have you ever wondered who Apostle Timothy followed? In what century was Moses? Where is Mordecai in the Bible? How long was Adam's lifespan? All will be answered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Olive Tree is a co-operative Bible timeline game that reveals God's &amp;quot;Spiritual Family Tree&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;People of Faith&amp;quot; written about in Hebrews 11. Points are accumulated in the game by naming the correct Bible character from the Branch card and connecting it to the correct level of Root or Vine cards. The game has 9 Timeline Rounds. Will you bear enough &amp;quot;Fruit Points&amp;quot; by the end of the 9th round?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
