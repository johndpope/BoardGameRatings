			<description>Wooden game of the Maxis line, specially designed with big pieces, easy to grab, to allow kids and elderlies to play together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six up consists of a vertical wooden piece with six vertical tracks made of holes. Each player has six wooden tokens (red and blue). In turn, each player rolls a die and chooses a token to go up one of the tracks. If a token lands in a hole already occupied, it ejects the previous token. If a token reaches the top of its track no one can go up this track no more. Game ends when all tops are reached. In the case of a tie, count the highest positions of tokens that have not reached the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
