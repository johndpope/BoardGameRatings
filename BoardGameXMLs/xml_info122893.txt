			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a noble's daughter is kidnapped by a &amp;quot;creature,&amp;quot; the player's are asked to bring her back&amp;hellip; for a fee. Their only clue is a small amount of green blood left behind by the creature. Following this clue will ultimately lead the players on an overland journey to a crypt filled with tricks and traps. &lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the first fan-created DragonQuest adventure available online The Crypt of the Dark Ones, is intended for five to eight characters of combined mercenary and adventurer level.&lt;br/&gt; Notes from the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure will take from 20-30 hours of gaming time and the characters will have to apply problem solving skills. This is not a &amp;quot;hold the party's&amp;quot; hand as we go through the dungeon adventure. It will take all the skills that the characters have and all the intelligence also to complete it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
