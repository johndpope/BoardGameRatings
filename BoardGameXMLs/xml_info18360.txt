							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Worst-Case Scenario Card Game: Dating &amp; Sex</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook &amp;quot;Dating &amp;amp; Sex&amp;quot;. Reading the book may be of some assistance in playing the game but is not necessary. The box says that it is &amp;quot;For 2 or more Adults&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should be emphasised as this Worst-Case game does deal with very adult themes involving among other things, STDs, how to put condoms on, removing bras, and, well, dating and sex! All in a non-judgemental matter of fact way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to carry a date who has passed out&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to survive static cling&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to give a Swedish Massage to impress your date&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to have sex in an elevator&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May be used as a travel game or as a supplement to other games in the series like the original or Travel version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each one of the cards has a question and 3 alternative answers printed on front and back, 108 questions in all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  current player has the question and all answers read to them. They then choose which of the answers is *most* appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to get 5 questions correct is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are printed different colours black/yellow on their opposite faces which makes it easy to tell when you have gone through the first half of questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
