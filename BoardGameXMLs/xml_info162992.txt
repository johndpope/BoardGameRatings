			<description>Early Jet Air Combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MiG Alley Ace is a quick and easy jet air combat game, it is meant to cover air combat from 1945 to the start of the missile age. The game is based on Avalon Hill&amp;rsquo;s Mustangs game. MiG Alley Ace was created with a hex-mat and miniatures in mind, but could be played a regular hex-map with counters. A hex-map and counter-sheet have been included with these rules. You will have to mount and cut out the counters yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
