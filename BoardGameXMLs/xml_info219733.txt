							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Mizuchi</name>
									
			<description> Mizuchi was recently awoken by the blood of Asama Takashi and he is sworn to protect her twin, Matsu. Swooping into battle he uses tail, tooth and claw as weapons against any who oppose the rule of the Prefecture of Ryu. His ability to quickly and easily traverse the battlefield have already proved the difference in many confrontations. Many within the Prefecture say that Mizuchi is a gift from the Kami&amp;rsquo;s and a sign of their right to rule.&lt;br/&gt; Blister contains one miniature, one 40mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
