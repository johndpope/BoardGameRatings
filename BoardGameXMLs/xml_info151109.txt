							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moscow vs. Barbarossa, 1941</name>
									
			<description>A small-scale (9 hexes from Smolensk to Moscow, 27mis/43kms per hex) Battle of Moscow game, MvB41 has 32 Russian and 22 German corps-to-army-level units, and takes 2-3 hours to play 8 half-month turns (or less, if Moscow is taken).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MvB41 draws on many design concepts and much research from my other games, including and especially from my new division level Battle of Moscow game, Barbarossa's Climax: Moscow 1941&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for most of my other games, the game's system uses Disruption to simulate momentum of advance/retreat and inertia.  A powerful German panzerkorps has a combat power of 4, and German units have step reduction.  The airwar is abstracted as in BC, and there is a Katyushas (rocket) unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat odds round-off (including UP) and expansion rule is retained from Barbarossa's Climax, as are other rules, but much more playably in the smaller - more introductory level - format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is free to print off, assemble, and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
