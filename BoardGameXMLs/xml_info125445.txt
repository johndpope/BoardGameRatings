			<description>This is an umpired miniatures wargame with true fog of war and hidden troop values. All combat systems are integrated in the game and have been computer tested. The game may be played at the divisional, corps, or army level depending on how many troops you might have and how much time you have to conclude the battle. Balanced armies may be attained by using the Historical Correction Table, thus offering the chance of a one-sided game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are interesting command, morale and terrain effects for each game. Artillery is well catered and very realistic results should be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appendices include campaign suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed, but very fast playing. All you need are the troops, the rules and one kind friend to act as the umpire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
