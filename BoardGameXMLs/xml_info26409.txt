			<description>This is a 'small' card game where each player represents a specific planet but as it goes with this type of games (and comparable to the games Mafia and Werewolves), this info is not passed on to other players. So, it's up to you to try and keep this a secret while trying to reach your goals... &lt;br/&gt;What's your goal anyway? Eliminate each and every other 'foreign' player [meaning : players who don't belong to your planet] and try to end  up with a group of players that all hail from the same planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented at Essen 2006 and more info on &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.trof.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.trof.nl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
