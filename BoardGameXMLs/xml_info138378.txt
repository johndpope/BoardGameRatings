							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Small But Vicious Dog</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Small But Vicious Dog is a mashup of Moldvay/Cook B/X D&amp;amp;D and WFRP 1e.  The rules are available from the designer's blog and consist of separate cover and body documents.  The cover includes a cover page (blank), title page and table of contents, the body document contains the rules alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a fantasy world where the men are Baldrick, the dwarves are punk, and the dogs are small but vicious. Welcome to a world of bawds, grave robbers, excisemen and witch hunters; a place where &amp;ldquo;Blather&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Flee!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mime&amp;rdquo; are legitimate skill choices; and where all material on the insidious threat of Chaos is officially interchangeable between settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome (back) to the Grim World of Perilous Adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whisper it (that fanboys may not hear and descend a squealing), but for all the charm of its skewed familiar 16th century milieu and the lurking horror of Chaos, Warhammer Fantasy Role Play was little more than a modcop of classic Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Yes, our beloved WFRP was yet another &amp;lsquo;fix D&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo; fantasy heartbreaker, albeit one which had the clout of the biggest name in British gaming behind it. Whole chunks of the system were lightly disguised D&amp;amp;D mechanics adapted to a roll under d% system1, and many setting&lt;br/&gt;elements not gleefully ripped off from Tolkien, Leiber or Moorcock were already established D&amp;amp;D tropes by the time WFRP was published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's ok. Indeed, that's part of why all right thinking people &amp;ndash; Brits, Italians and Poles especially &amp;ndash; love WFRP. To paraphrase a better man than I: we took an American invention, soaked it in a witches' brew of Bosch, Durer and Dor&amp;eacute;, Mervyn Peake and Tom Sharpe, Blackadder, The Young Ones, pints of bitter, cheap weed, Iron Maiden and The Damned, and then we played the hell out of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what this ill considered rules hack is about. Your humble author &amp;ndash; a dirty little yahoo from a rainy, grimy, post imperial isle in the northern seas &amp;ndash; decided to have a go at welding D&amp;amp;D and WFRP together. Why? So I could play games of WFRP ish misery and despair with rules of B/X ish brevity, thus achieving personal gaming nirvana. This here resulting travesty is a 90% pure game mechanics kitbash with minimal background material or context. I won&amp;rsquo;t even pretend I can pr&amp;eacute;cis 20 odd years of background material into 32 pages or so. If you want all that good stuff you should hunt out a copy of WFRP itself; it is worth your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoy my little love letter to *real* WFRP (the one that came complete in a single fat book). But &amp;ldquo;If you know a better hole, then go to it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
