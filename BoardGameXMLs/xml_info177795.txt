			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLANG was intended as a historical Medieval game. It had a successful KickStarter and a prototype was created and delivered as a donor reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was cancelled because the prototype was technically innovative, but the game-play was poor. Too much focus was put on historical accuracy and not enough on making it sufficiently fun to attract additional investment. Additional fundraising efforts failed and forced the team to cut their losses and disband in search of steady work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
