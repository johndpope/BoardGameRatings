							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Xen&#039;drik Expeditions Fastplay Characters - Level 7</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate rapid play with new players, the organize play campaign promoted a large number of &amp;quot;fastplay&amp;quot; characters built at level 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from easy use, every fastplay character was keyed to a specific Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures figurine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player used a fastplay character and that character's specific miniature, a bonus feature was unlocked.  Note that experience points gained when using a fastplay character could be transferred to the player's default character if the fastplay character and the player's default character were the same character class.  Note that most fastplay characters were aligned with a faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character builds at this level were named.  Several were provided as two-page sheets and several were provided as four-page form-fillable sheets:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Changeling Sorcerer/Wizard/Ultimate Magus&lt;br/&gt;        Daelkyr Half Blood Ranger/Impure Prince&lt;br/&gt;        Elf (High) Spellthief&lt;br/&gt;        Gnome (Rock) Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Goblin Ninja/Assassin&lt;br/&gt;        Halfling (Lightfoot) Rogue/Thief-Acrobat&lt;br/&gt;        Human Favored Soul&lt;br/&gt;        Human Knight&lt;br/&gt;        Lizardfolk Ranger&lt;br/&gt;        Orc Knight&lt;br/&gt;        Warforged Scout Scout&lt;br/&gt;        Warforged Wizard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
