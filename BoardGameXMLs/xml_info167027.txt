			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world where you wear your heart on your rump in the form of a cutie mark, and show your true colors via coat and mane, friendships may seem easy, but they ain&amp;rsquo;t. Beasts, magic, and daily dull-drums combine to teach valuable lessons about diversity and perseverance, but can also test your tolerance for fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playset is based in the world of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, a recent incarnation of a number of My Little Pony toy franchises owned by Hasbro. You are a pony, the ruling class of critter in Equestria, with bright colors and a cutie mark on your rump that says something about who you are. Find your way to friendship, and most of all, have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Friendship can be a Fiasco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
