			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of art Critics. How utterly wonderful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lead Critic discovers artwork that pushes the boundaries of art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Critic adds to a public discussion, while also making a private review, perhaps a gushing review or perhaps a cutting one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critics earn points by echoing others' secret reviews while avoiding, or perhaps deliberately making, a review that's just blowing smoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the Player who earns the most points at the end of the final round. Such a Critic may retire at the height of fame and notoriety, leaving all the other plebeians to continue to scramble around their petty excuses for art and critique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C'est le vie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
