			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Middle-earth and The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game are full of adventures, and your road goes ever, ever on. Sometimes, when the mood strikes you&amp;mdash;or when your heroes take a wrong turn&amp;mdash;you may see that road darken&amp;hellip; and then darken again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare Decks allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios recast within the darker and deadlier shadows of Nightmare Mode. Each Nightmare Deck introduces new encounter cards that you exchange with specified cards from the adventure's standard encounter deck. The result is a more challenging adventure that comes full of novel and thematic new twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The N&amp;icirc;n-in-Eilph emphasizes the difficulties of making swift passage through the marsh with a series of quest stages featuring the Time X keyword that shuffle back into the quest deck if you can't fully complete them in time. Accordingly, it's vital to make swift progress through each Stage 2 and Stage 3, lest you find yourself in danger of threating out as your heroes begin to sink in the mire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than alter the quest structure in any significant way, The N&amp;icirc;n-in-Eilph Nightmare Deck ratchets up the tension by introducing a number of effects that reinforce its central concept&amp;mdash;your repeated cycling of quest stages. In Nightmare Mode, you don't just have to move from quest stage to quest stage, you have to do so while your staging area fills up with Creatures and locations that trigger disruptive Forced effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
