The realistic physics system of JAM puts a smile upon your face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't look for boundaries like in other racing games, 4x4 Jam doesn't limit the area. You can really drive as far as you wish!&lt;br/&gt;The game offers 100% total freedom to race across the varied terrains without any limitations.&lt;br/&gt;Listen to 9 licensed rock tracks during the intense races.&lt;br/&gt;Challenge your opponents on icy mountains or hot sand dunes and experience the excitement of hill climbing with custom build off-road vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;You will see that reaching the gate on the top of the hills is not always so easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-modes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jam&lt;br/&gt;High-speed dash to race through a series of gates placed randomly on the terrain.&lt;br/&gt;A marker constantly indicates the most direct route between the vehicle and the next gate.&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to pass a gate and earn more points in more difficult modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off Road Race&lt;br/&gt;If you are a more traditional racing fan, Off-Road Race mode will give you high-octane excitement.&lt;br/&gt;Rocks, potholes, mud holes, trees and various objects will turn your route into adventurous victory&lt;br/&gt;But often the more daredevil driver will succeed over those who opt for strategy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Race&lt;br/&gt;Pedal to metal lap based race on the bumpy roads where you must go through a sequence of gates.&lt;br/&gt;Follow the arrow to find the next gate and feel free to smash into your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Ride&lt;br/&gt;Explore the map and put your car to the test.
