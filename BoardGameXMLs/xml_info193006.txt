			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was confirmed, albeit unofficially, on July 17, 2008 by actor Gary Oldman during an interview with G4's Kristin Adams. Despite prior speculation, no further announcements were made regarding production of the game, even upon the DVD and Blu-ray Disc release of the films on December 9, 2008 in the United States. According to a Newsweek article, the lack of a game at the same time of the movie's release may have cost an estimated $101 million in missed revenue. Pandemic Brisbane, who were responsible for developing this game, has since been shut down and the project cancelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Dark Knight (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
