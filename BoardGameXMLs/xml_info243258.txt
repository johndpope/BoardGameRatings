							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manhattan: Promo Cards Mini-Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This small expansion consists of 10 cards as is for the game Manhattan (1994).  An 11th card contains the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are shuffled, placed face down, and the top card is drawn at the start of each round.  They result in an additional fourth step in the scoring at the end of each round.  Points will be awarded based on the conditions listed for each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some sample cards:&lt;br/&gt;FOUNDER - each player scores one point for each building he started, but doesn't own any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VILLA - each 1 story building with at least one empty adjacent space scores one point&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAKE NEWS - There is no extra scoring for this card.  However, when scoring is about to begin, the next scoring card is revealed and that new card will be the scoring card for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are standard Euro mini-size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
