							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sword &amp; the Dove</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword &amp;amp; The Dove is a short adventure for characters that are nearing the end of their first career or just beginning their second, although if run correctly the adventure may be run for characters with any number of advances. In the adventure the characters are robbed at a coaching inn and have a good idea of where the thief went, but they are in-fact being tricked by the innkeeper into becoming an unwitting extermination squad. The innkeeper is under investigation by a Witch Hunter of Verena who is searching for a covenant of mutants that are supposedly live near the inn. The innkeeper has been providing supplies to these mutants and the Priestess of Shallya who is leading them, but he is now fearful that if the Witch Hunter finds the mutants, they will speak as to who as been selling them food. He&amp;rsquo;d rather just see all of them killed before they can be interrogated by the Witch Hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
