			<description>Deer Hunting Card Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of box:&lt;br/&gt;Every hunter dreams of stalking down that once-in-a-lifetime buck - the perfect 12 pointer, the 200 pounder or maybe even a record size rack. Finally, there's an exciting card game that lets you experience the thrill of deer hunting anytime, anywhere. You'll be amazed at how closely the playing strategy and results simulate an actual hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw an initial hand of 5 cards, trying to acquire enough Buck Cards with the minimum number of total &amp;quot;points&amp;quot; needed to &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; the deer with a Shot Card. Along the way players will draw Problem Cards such as &amp;quot;other hunter in area&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;major wind&amp;quot; preventing one from taking a &amp;quot;shot&amp;quot;. Remedy Cards will be played to get rid of Problem Cards. After everyone bags a buck or after a set number of times through the deck (days of the hunting season), whichever comes first, the player with the largest buck wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has multiple sets of values on it that are used in various phases of the &amp;quot;hunt&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
