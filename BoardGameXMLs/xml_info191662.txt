							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Roleplaying Poem about Logocentrism</name>
									
			<description>Abridged from the original post:&lt;br/&gt;This one is about stories where conflicts aren't resolved, where goals aren't achieved, where life is meaningless and where mysteries stay mysteries. Think of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, or the truth of what happened in Run Lola Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I started thinking about it when I realized how logocentric most roleplaying is. So often it's about achievement, discovery, resolution, and meaning. I started to wonder what a game would look like if it weren't about those things. This is a primitive version, but, for me, somewhat of a revelation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
