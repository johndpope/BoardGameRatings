			<description>(From Games Magazine): &amp;quot;Before bridge there was whist, a much simpler card game to learn but nonetheless a challenging game of strategy for four players.  Now there's Open Whist, a modern variation that two, three, or four players can enjoy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Whist was originally designed so that 2 or 3 players could enjoy whist.  In the two player variant, both players have 2 hands each.  They are playing both the role of themselves and their &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; in 4 player whist.  The main difference is that all of the cards are played face-up in a pattern that only allows certain cards to be played at any given point in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
