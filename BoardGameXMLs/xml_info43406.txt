			<description>Shortstack consists of a deck of 60 square cards, each containing a different comic panel portraying a scene from the journal of Major Robert Shortstack. Three different games are detailed in the included booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1 (3-6 players) has the players dealt a hand of 5 cards, then redrawing and exchanging cards until they have created a cohesive 4-panel strip at the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2 (4-6 players) has the players dealt 6 cards, which they then must create a 4-panel comic strip as quickly as possible. The judge will then choose the best out of the first 3 submitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3 (2-4 players) has the players dealt a hand of 5 cards. One random card from the deck is placed in the middle, and each player on their turn must place a connected card next to the one of the cards on the table. If player does not have a card to connect they must draw a card from the deck. The player who gets rid of all their cards first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing with the cards minus the game mechanics is also encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
