			<description>RoadKill is a open world action-adventure video game developed by Terminal Reality and published in 2003 by Midway Games. The game has been described by Midway as &amp;ldquo;the only mission-based combat driving game set in a post-apocalyptic world.&amp;rdquo;[1] Indeed, RoadKill&amp;rsquo;s gameplay features many characteristics of famous automotive combat franchises such as Twisted Metal with the attitude of Grand Theft Auto; however, despite receiving decent reviews by the gaming community, RoadKill remains a relatively obscure title to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RoadKill is set in an alternate history inspired by classic post-apocalyptic road films like the Mad Max series and Death Race 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1980s a deadly plague known as &amp;quot;The Rot&amp;quot; was released and killed off most of the world's population and brought nearly all the world governments to their knees. In the midst of all the chaos a man named Mason Strong who before the plague has a long employment history such as a taxicab driver, used car salesman, bouncer, demolition derby driver, and even a short-lived tour in the army. Today Mason finds himself on Earth which has gone haywire. Which no longer has anymore law and order, where gangs engage in open warfare throughout communities every day and every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mason must work his way up the ranks of the gangs, surviving as best as he can in a new planet without any laws, politics, or justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;RoadKill&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
