			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruesome Gangs is an exciting Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&amp;reg; compatible product line providing the Game Master with a collection of non-player characters (NPCs) designed to work together from the perspective of backstory, game mechanics, or both.  The groups are presented at different Challenge Ratings to increase their utility for multiple gamers.  In addition, this allows player characters (PCs) to encounter one of these groups early in a campaign and then again after both teams have gained experience with minimal extra work for the Game Master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the entire team is unsuitable for inclusion in the campaign at the time, then NPC stat blocks can be used individually as needed.  A mixed approach can also be interesting.  By introducing a single foe into the campaign, this product gives a number of friends or allies that foe could call upon after running afoul of the PCs!  This gives the Game Master a ready-made answer to who would the NPC go to for assistance, or even who would come to avenge his death at the hands of the PC party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using This Product&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product presents the overall history of the NPC team as well as the backstory for each individual member of the gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each NPC has four stat blocks (CR 4, CR 9, CR 14, and CR 19) demonstrating his progression and growth over time.  As a visual indicator, the color of the name bar designates which stat blocks from each NPC are of equivalent Challenge Rating along with the CR text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each gang is comprised of multiple members which can include a mixture of races, class levels, and templates.  This section helps the Game Master compare different gangs&amp;rsquo; capabilities and make-up at a glance without having to review each stat block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Members&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bylarko Grigoryev &amp;ndash; CE male human&lt;br/&gt;    Caderon of the Planes &amp;ndash; LE male half-elf&lt;br/&gt;    Djoris Flamehearth &amp;ndash; NE female halfling&lt;br/&gt;    Sisiorra Moonmeadow &amp;ndash; LE female elf&lt;br/&gt;    Whisper &amp;ndash; CN male sylph&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An effective team of arcane killers, the Cabal of Abstruse Enigmas presents a dangerous challenge mixing summoned monsters, flashy spells, and close-quarters combat.  The group is incredibly efficient but contain a number of stresses and secrets that keep them on the edge of internal collapse.  They are masters of dungeon delves and provide an excellent rival or foil for exploring adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is assembled with an underlying vendetta against drow, which provides opportunity to crossover from foe to friend in certain situations.  Their obsession with magical artifacts, spells, and forgotten lore leads them to seek the obscure all around the world.  It is in these dark forgotten places where their murderous intent is revealed, leaving no survivors to tarnish their reputations in civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
