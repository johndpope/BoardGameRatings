							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Two Ocean War</name>
									
			<description>Rare add-on for Avalon Hill's 'War at Sea (second edition)' and 'Victory in the Pacific' series but also a standalone game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes (688) 1&amp;quot; square styrene counters that can be used with the original games or with the included (4) maps and a (48) page rulebook for combined global game. The maps are 21&amp;quot; x 27&amp;quot; and there are two Pacific and two Atlantic maps with a total of 39 areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a standalone game, The Two Ocean War allows double-blind player movement via two copies of the Atlantic and Pacific theater maps. During the movement phase, players place their fleets on their own game boards, unaware of the other player's moves. Once moves are completed, both players go area by area on both maps, resolving battles between fleets placed in the same areas on the two different maps and to resolve combat and determine victory points awarded for each sea zone. Combat is similar to the Avalon Hill sea games, using six-sided dice. Rolls of 1-4 are no effect, 5 is a disable (ship returns to port), 6 is a hit causing a subsequent die roll for amount of damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is superior to the Avalon Hill sea games in some regards. Highlights include larger fleets (CL-class ships for all nations are represented in addition to the other ship classes in the AH games), more sea zones, and the blind movement resulting in often surprising battle lineups in particular sea zones. Additional rules let small ships torpedo big ones under certain conditions, and since the game represents fleets worldwide, there are opportunities for some Axis ships to change theaters just as the Allied ships can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
