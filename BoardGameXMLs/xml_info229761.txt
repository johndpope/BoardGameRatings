			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beasts of the Sunny South Seas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: South Pacific brings you an awesome array of marvelous and menacing creatures from the open oceans and archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean, from Indonesia and the Philippines in the west across Australia, New Zealand, and the far-flung islands of Polynesia. These cunning creatures range from CR 1 to CR 16 and include monsters malevolent and benign. Some are amazing exemplars of exotic animals given new life like the hungry thylacine, the absurdly adorable platypus, and the iconic kangaroo, or their neolithic forebears like the flightless moa and the toothy megalania lizard. Others are mysterious half-human races that keep to the shadows of the wild like the Sumatran orang-pendak or the oceangoing adaro shark-people. Deathless horrors lurk in the shadows like the bloodthirsty polong of Malaysia and the dismembered penanggalen and manananggal of the Philippines, alongside blight-spawned demons like the kapre jungle hunter and the plague-bringing papinijuwari of Australia. Some monsters of the South Seas are made rather than born, with constructs like the colossal coral golem and the titanic tiberolith! As if a dozen and one existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new tiddalik is a strange trickster, an ever-thirsty mystic frog that is peaceful by nature, but whose prodigious consumption threatens all around it unless they can untangle the riddle of its mirth. In addition to the featured creatures, we bring you a collection of terrific new taonga treasures perfect for injecting a bit of Australian and Polynesian flavor into your campaign, from hei tiki amulets to clever boomerangs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
