							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Age Turning Points: Vega</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the planet Vega, the collapse of the hyperpulse generator network signaled the beginning of four years of chaos. Beset by terrorists, foreign invaders and the shattering of the planetary militia in a devastating civil war, the world descended into a seemingly endless spiral of death and destruction. Ruthless warlords divided the land and fought amongst themselves to claim what little remained of the old Vega. With the Republic suffering its own troubles, there was scant hope of relief from any outside force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then the Bears came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enacting contingency plans created decades earlier, the Rasalhague Dominion sends its forces to stabilize several worlds of the Republic. But their reception is anything but warm and the Clanners will have to face local resistance and malicious outside influences to save Vega from itself. Isis Bekker and her Raging Bears are up for the task, but will they have the strength and the time to see it through?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Age Turning Points: Vega uses Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even creating their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a &amp;ldquo;Vega flavor.&amp;rdquo; The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Vega, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players&amp;rsquo; imaginations are the limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
