							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Actual Sunlight</name>
									
			<description>Actual Sunlight is a short interactive story about love, depression and the corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game puts you in the role of Evan Winter, a young professional in Toronto, as he moves through three distinct periods of his life. The story is linear, unavoidable and (hopefully) thought-provoking. You experience his perceptions, fall under the consequences of his decisions, and meet everyone who didn&amp;rsquo;t change him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is minimal, and serves only to move from one part of the (admittedly) text-heavy story to the next. The game fiercely attempts to be worth it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actual Sunlight is not appropriate for children. It features mature themes and an adult-workplace amount of profanity. And it does so immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
