			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fabled Rod of Wonder! Tool of wondrous power or infernal trap&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most intriguing magic items ever to cross the pages of tabletop roleplaying is the rod of wonder, which calls forth a new and often amazing (though sometimes disastrous) effect each time it is activated.  The traditional rod of wonder had twenty-two random effects&amp;hellip; how about two-hundred and thirty two?  How would your game be affected by such effects as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The aid of an empyrean angel or a pit fiend?&lt;br/&gt;    Losing a class level, to be replace by that of a different class?&lt;br/&gt;    The target becoming pregnant?&lt;br/&gt;    Target and wielder switching bodies?&lt;br/&gt;    The wielder growing wings of bizarre appearance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This myriad of effects is not all!  The Rod of Wonder from Purple Duck Games also includes 5 new magic items themed on the rod of wonder, introduces the mercurial Wondrous Society, whose cell-like groups pursue their goals aided by the iconic rod of wonder.  Finally, Rod of Wonder presents the wondrous adept, a 10-level prestige class that focuses on using the rod to wield power in ways other classes could not dream of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like the raw power of chaos and what it can do to your game, get Rod of Wonder from the entropic entities at Purple Duck Games, where our games are what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
