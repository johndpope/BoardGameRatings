							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Papa Pear Saga</name>
									
			<description>Papa Pear Saga is a physics-based game with a tropical theme and over 290 levels. The game format features elements of pinball and pachinko. Players have to shoot &amp;ldquo;Papa Pear&amp;rdquo; from a cannon at the top of the screen in order to have him fall into buckets at the bottom of the screen. If players select the right trajectory and power, Papa Pear will hit different elements such as acorns, other pears and carrots. This will help clear the screen, making it easier to hit the buckets and improve the score for the level. Different levels have additional objectives, such as eliminating the right number of acorns or carrots within the allocated number of shots. Once Papa Pear has landed in all the buckets, the level ends in a &amp;ldquo;Pear Fiesta&amp;rdquo; as all remaining Papa Pears dive into play. Papa Pear Saga was launched on King.com in June 2012, on Facebook in May 2013 and on mobile in November 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
