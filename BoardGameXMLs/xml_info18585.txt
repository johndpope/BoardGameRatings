			<description>From the Mesomorph Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tapestry contains three attractive new strategy games for two or four players played with a unique set of stained wooden tiles and colored pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first of the games, called Tapestry, players build the board as the game progresses, adding light and dark tiles, placing pawns to access regions, and sliding tiles to strategically alter the landscape and block opponents. When the board is complete, the player whose pawns access the most territory triumphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Towers the board starts off full size but shrinks as players race to construct towers before bearing them off the board to earn points. It is tempting to try for the high-scoring tall or single-color towers but if you take too long or allow your towers to become isolated, your opponent may end the game before you are ready to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conveyor is a strategic race game in which the object is to move pawns across the board, starting from your seating position. Each turn players also have an opportunity to alter the pattern of light and dark tiles by shifting a row or column. Players strive to be first to move all their pawns across the shifting landscape of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the three games presents different challenges and satisfactions lasting 30 to 60 minutes, and the unique tile distributions each time insure that no two games are ever the same. The Tapestry set includes 26 light-stained tiles, 26 dark-stained tiles, 8 red pawns, 8 yellow pawns, 4 white pawns, 4 black pawns, a cloth bag, and a rule booklet. The games are best played on a smooth surface such as a glass or wood table.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
