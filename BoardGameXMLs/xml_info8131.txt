			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mecha!(tm) is a fast-paced miniatures combat system that remains true to the Japanese anime giant robot traditions from which it was spawned.  Explosions, missile exchanges, down and dirty hand-to-hand combat, and lethal firefights are the trademarks of this high-action and easy-to-learn game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A relatively simple rules set for playing a game of anime-style robot combat, they are complete enough to include a limited points-based construction system plus rules for continuing campaigns.  The system uses primarily d6's plus a d10.  Movement rules include support for &amp;quot;mode changing&amp;quot; (from walking robot mode to hover mode to jet flight mode), and support three-dimension movement, using &amp;quot;Battlepoles&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;138+ pages (probably another dozen pages at the end of the book are unnumbered, containing unit design templates and reference pages).  Artwork is all black-and-white, with mostly hand-drawn art, but includes quite a few photographs of models being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
