							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood &amp; Guts 2.0: British Aircraft of World War II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been few, if any, times in history when a nation&amp;rsquo;s air force proved as important as the British Royal Air Force did during the dark, early days of WWII. Europe lay at Hitler&amp;rsquo;s feet and a British Expeditionary Force had fled the Nazi war machine at Dunkirk, leaving Hitler in control of Western Europe. Only one power remained defiant against him: Britain and their &amp;ldquo;war monger&amp;rdquo; leader (as Hitler would often describe him), Prime Minister Winston Churchill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nazi plan for the invasion of Britain, Operation Sealion, required air supremacy to work, in order to counter British control of the seas. The resulting air battle, known to history as the Battle of Britain, has become one of the legendary air battles in the history of the world. It not only prevented Operation Sealion from being attempted, it was the first crack in the fa&amp;ccedil;ade of Nazi invulnerability. This work provides statistics for the major British planes that fought for the British in WWII, allowing the game master to bring the Battle of Britain and many other famous air encounters into his Modern WWII games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the following aircraft: Albemarle (1940), Blackburn Roc (1939), Blackburn Skua (1938), Boulton Paul Defiant (1939), Bristol Beaufighter (1940), De Havilland Mosquito (1941), Fairey Albacore (1941), Fairey Barracuda (1943), Fairey Firefly (1943), Fairey Fulmar (1940), Fairey Swordfish (1939), Gloster Meteor (1944), Hawker Hurricane (1937), Hawker Typhoon (1941), Lancaster (1942), Supermarine Spitfire (1938), Westland Whirlwind (1940).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
