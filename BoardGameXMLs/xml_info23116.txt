							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Santa Clause</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This murder mystery game is rated for Mature audiences, but could be played by older teens. The murder does take place at the party. There are a few past affairs. There is a character who nips the bottle a little &amp;amp; one who practices VooDoo. Both of these situations are handled in a humorous manner to keep things light &amp;amp; non-offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Santa Clause is a contemporary murder mystery game that takes place at the Christmas Party of the law firm Lie, Cheat &amp;amp; Steal. With this many lawyers &amp;amp; politicians involved there is sure to be plenty of back stabbing going around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time for the annual Christmas Party for the law firm Lie, Cheat and Steal, a powerhouse law firm with influential ties to business, government and politics. This party is one that everyone is just dying to attend. Quite literally that is. Mr. A. Big Scam, who was the next in line to become Partner in the firm, was found stuffed up his chimney in the Santa suit he was going to wear to the party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone leaked a statement to the press stating that Mr. Lie will be announcing his retirement and replacement at the party tonight. With Mr. Scam dead who will be the one to get this lofty and very sought after partnership?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: While there is a murder that takes place before the game, in keeping with our standards there is also a murder that takes place at the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/santaclause.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/santaclause.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
