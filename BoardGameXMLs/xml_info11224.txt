			<description>From the publisher...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conscience is the fun way to learn right from wrong and help children build the foundation to make the right choices in life! A multi-award winner, the game promotes family dialog  on tough issues that children are facing at younger and younger ages. It's unique, timely and a family essential for 2-6 players Ages 5 and up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 9/11 terrorist attack has underscored the importance of talking to children early and often about issues of right and wrong and character. Conscience gets the conversation started around a back to basics framework children remember and apply! It is fast-paced, interactive and lecture-free! It is designed to help teach absolutes and as a jumping off point for deeper moral, ethical and spiritual conversations. It is low cost preventive medicine and children, parents, teachers and counselors love the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conscience includes simplified rules and Jr. cards for younger children (Ages 5 - 7) and more challenging objectives, issues and game play for older children (Ages 8 and up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
