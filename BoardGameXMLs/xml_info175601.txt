							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der Fall Marlies Reinhold</name>
									
			<description>A murder mystery dinner-style party game in which each player is assigned a role and players try to find out who the murderer is. Each player has his/her own information booklet, and five game rounds are spent discussing clues and inconsistencies until players vote on who to accuse of the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This case is set in the Berlin of the golden 20s. The producer of a silent movie is hosting a press dinner behind the scenes to present the newest star actress, Marlies Reinhold, to the public. Celebrities and press representatives are waiting for Marlies' entrance when the host appears alone, reporting he has just found Marlies murdered. Since the set had been closed to anyone but the people present at the dinner all day long, one thing is certain: The killer is among those present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
