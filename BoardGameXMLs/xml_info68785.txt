			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEADLY GRACE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon the waves, the ships of the elves are now only seldom seen.  Once the ancient race ruled the oceans and none dared challenge their mastery but now the new races have taken up the challenge of the sea and sail with vigour to all corners of the world.  Many have forgotten the elves, but their rule of the waves has by no means been surpassed.  The elves go to sea for many reasons; to defend the waters of their nations, to trade with the lesser races or simply to dare the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elves at Sea: Never before covered history and information on the sea-borne clans of elves and their total mastery of the ocean.  Covering traders, explorers, and warriors in exquisite detail, players and Game Masters alike may discover the true secret behind the elves' supremacy on the waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crews: Elves do not hire out their services to just any captain and even then can prove extremely expensive.  However, for the captain who will settle for nothing less than the very best, gold cannot hire a better crew than one comprised solely of elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weaponry: New shipboard weapons employed by the elves, including the Heavy Ballista, Fire Tower, Bound Bolts, and Naptha Elven Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of the Elves: Nearly 20 new vessels are featured, covering the entire vista of elven ingenuity in ship design.  From the glorious and rarely seen Sea Haven to the deadly fast Elemental Ram, few pirates are foolish enough to challenge an elven fleet at sea, be it from the explorer, trader or warrior clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
