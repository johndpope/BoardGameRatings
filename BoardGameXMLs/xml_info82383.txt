			<description>Pssst is a ZX Spectrum video game made by Ultimate Play The Game in 1983. In the game Robbie the Robot  has to protect his plant (a Thyrgodian Megga Chrisanthodil) as it is attacked by various insects (Interstellar Space Slugs, Scuttling Leeches and Menacing Midges), each of which needs a different repellent. The game was written by Chris Stamper and Tim Stamper. This game was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pssst&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
