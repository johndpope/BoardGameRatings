			<description>Dragons: Wettflug zur Dracheninsel (&amp;quot;Dragons: Race to Dragon i=Isle&amp;quot;) is a game based on Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon 2. In the game, the dragon riders attempt to reach the Dragon Isle, while the dragon Screaming Death tries to prevent them from doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each game, the board is created by lining up island tiles, starting with Viking Island (start) and ending with Dragon Isle (finish). The islands between start and finish come in four different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds. Each round, one player plays Screaming Death, while the others play a dragon rider. Each dragon rider has a hand with colored island cards. Each turn, each dragon rider selects one of these cards. At the same time, Screaming Death selects one color of islands to attack. Then, everybody reveals their cards. Each dragon rider that has selected the color that is being attacked by Screaming Death cannot move; the others move to the next island of their chosen color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when two dragon riders have reached Dragon Isle, or when the dragon riders can no longer move because the deck of island cards has run out. The first dragon rider to reach Dragon Isle gains two coins; the second rider gains one coin. If no dragon rider reaches Dragon Isle, Screaming Death gains three coins. If only one rider reaches Dragon Isle, Screaming Death gains one coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues with a new round, until each player has played Screaming Death once. Then, the player who has collected the most coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spooky, an earlier version of this game, had the players as ghosts moving through a castle, with each player taking a turn as Merlin to try to stop the ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
