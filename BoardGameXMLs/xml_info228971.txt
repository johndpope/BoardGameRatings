In front of him waiting for a lot of dangerous traps and obstacles. The game will be available on PC and android devices. Features&lt;br/&gt;Hardcore and at the same time relaxing game. The project uses a quiet, meditative music, and the passage is not always dependent on the speed of movement - sometimes it's better to wait for the right moment.&lt;br/&gt;The game is not use boring dialogs, characters communicate and express their emotions and desires using clear icons.&lt;br/&gt;A large variety of mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;The ability to go beyond, literally.
