			<description>J.J. &amp;amp; Jeff, known in Japan as Kato-chan &amp;amp; Ken-chan (カトちゃんケンちゃん), is a side scrolling platform game for the TurboGrafx-16. The Japanese version is loosely based on the then-popular comedy television show Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan which Vin Di Bona Productions used as its inspiration for the popular television show America's Funniest Home Videos. The game is best remembered for its off-beat characters and enemies, and toilet humor, including flatulence and urination in the Japanese release. The game is often criticized for being too censored or sanitized when translated for America with most reviewers feeling that the Japanese version was superior in humor and gameplay. On May 28, 2007, it was released on the Wii's Virtual Console in North America, and in Europe on June 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J.J. &amp;amp; Jeff are bungling detectives in the same vein as Inspector Clouseau. They are out to solve a kidnapping case. In the Japanese version, Kato-chan &amp;amp; Ken-chan, it is based mostly on the &amp;quot;Detective Story&amp;quot; segments of the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;J.J. &amp;amp; Jeff&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
