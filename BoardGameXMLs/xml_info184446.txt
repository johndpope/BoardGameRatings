			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cuckoo's Nest Rules System is a live-action roleplaying game (LARP) that utilizes several traditional tabletop RPG character building ideas.  Players create their persona, or Character, by assigning Values to Attributes, namely: Strength, Endurance, and Aura.  Values range from 0 to 3, with an &amp;quot;Average&amp;quot; human having a Strength and Endurance of 1 and an Aura of 0.  Increases in Value may be purchased with accumulated experience.  Players next define Virtues and Flaws, each with specific game effects.  Finally, players select Skills that the character has developed through training and experience.  Within these broad definitions, players may then define their characters as they like--so long as they observe the restrictions these definitions impose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play in The Cuckoo's Nest Rules System is refereed, and players must comply with about a dozen referee commands (most based around safety and event management).  Combat is free-form, live-action, with five rules (all based around safety).  Spells strike automatically.  Hits by weapon or spells cause damage and players must track damage to six body locations (Head, Left Arm, Right Arm, Torso, Left Leg, Right Leg).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
