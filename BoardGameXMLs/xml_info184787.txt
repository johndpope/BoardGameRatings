			<description>Buried Treasure is distributed as a ten-page DOC adventure and a one-page PDF keyed map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ben Grady married his wife, Eva, just after they graduated high school back in the 50&amp;rsquo;s.  To support them, Ben enlisted in the army, retired, worked in the civil service on base and then retired again.  He and his wife were very happy together until she died a year ago at the age of 67.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ben loved his wife dearly and has been unable to cope with her death.  He has been spiraling into depression ever since.  After much urging, his son finally convinced him to seek help and his therapist recommended him to the Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
