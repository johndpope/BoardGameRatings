			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mastermaze, possibly the most challenging game ever printed in Compute!, uses a special Atari technique, page-flipping, to create a maze with up to 32 levels.  For VIC, 64, PET/CBM, and other Microsoft BASIC computers, we include the maze-generating subroutine which is at the heart of this spectacular game for the Atari.  If you are of very sound mind, you can even struggle down through an invisible, multi-level maze, but the author cautions that you get the consent of a psychologist before attempting it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mastermaze was written by Kenneth S. Szajda and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 33, February 1983.  Although several systems had partial source-code listings, only the Atari version was a complete, playable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Compute! Issue 40, September 1983, David Butler authored &amp;quot;Mastermaze Update for the Atari&amp;quot; which provided type-in source code for &amp;quot;a machine language routine for the Atari version that greatly speeds up the maze generator.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
