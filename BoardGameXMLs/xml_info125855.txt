							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trivia Puzzle</name>
									
			<description>Trivia Puzzle is a trivia game in which players select 1 of 6 puzzles of equal size (# pieces per puzzle) and race to be the first to complete their puzzle.  Players obtain pieces of their puzzle by correctly answering a question from a trivia card during their turn.  During a player's turn, another player pulls a trivia card from the box and reads the category out loud.  The active player then decides a factor of difficulty (1,2,3,4 or 5...1 being the easiest and 5 the most difficult) for the question as there are 5 questions per card for the topic.  If the player answer the question correctly, they randomly pull that number of puzzle pieces (1-5) from their puzzle box and begin building their puzzle, at which time their turn ends.  Turn passes to the next player for incorrect guesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: there are over 3,000 question and 20 categories to choose from  (Science, Math, Sports, Media, Famous People, Firsts &amp;amp; Mosts, Games, Animals, Movies, Places, Literature, World Events, General Trivia).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
