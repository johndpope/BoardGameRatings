			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2050.  The world has been thrown into chaos.  Corporations and governments battle for control of the world's economy, while those on the street struggle to survive starvation and oppression.  Street gangs control the outer communities, while the city's P.A.S.A.T. maintain control of the Federal Zones with Powered Armor.  In the Wastes, Maxer tribes roam the landscape in search of fuel.  The Corporate Sector lies protected from the rest of society behind walls and menacing fortifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology has led to the downfall of mankind, as humanity is replaced by mechanical parts.  Cybernetic warriors roam the burned out cities in search of fame and fortune, as civilization and culture have reverted into barbaric and savage factions.  Fortune and the search for new technology pits corporation against corporation.  You either work for a corporation or you die on the streets from starvation.  Life is hard and cheap!  Most cannot survive in this harsh new world, but you are different.  You might have what it takes to survive in Cyberworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
