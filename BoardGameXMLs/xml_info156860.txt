			<description>Nostromo is a game of search and escape on a dynamic board that resembles a spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must escape from the ship, but before they must getting the items needed for this, preventing xenomorfos. One player, whose identity is hidden from the rest, has a mission to thwart the escape of their peers. Throughout the entire game no player is eliminated, but change its goals according to their role&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of 30 circular sectors. Players move around the board according to the result of a dice roll . The primary mission of the players is to get the items needed for to escape and bring them to the escape ship (one of the sectors). These objects are hidden in 7 different rooms (each room is also a sector). Players must arrive these rooms through corridors (which are also sectors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, each player can move between sectors and even rotate them to get into them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During setup, a number of threats (dice) equal to the number of players are placed on the board. These threats are eliminated by the players when the reach their position. If a threat reaches a value of six, it becomes a xenomorf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each work shift and before the start of the next, each threat is increased, an event card is read and moves the xenomorfs towards the nearest player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player succeeds in bringing the third neccassary item to the escape ship, the player in the escape ship with the most points is winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
