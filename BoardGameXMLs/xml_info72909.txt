			<description>&amp;quot;Simon the Sorcerer 3D (also known as Simon 3D), was released by Adventure Soft on 13 April 2002 for Microsoft Windows. The story follows where Simon the Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe left off but some time in the future. Simon finds himself trapped in a strange world, involved in a race against time to beat Sordid to his only route home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 3D graphics, a first for the series: Unfortunately, due to the game being delayed for almost two years, Simon 3D looked outdated when compared to other 3D games on the market at the time. However reviews stated that the game has a massive game world with over 10,000 pieces of voiced dialogue. Adventure Soft's own website claims that there is over 40 hours of gameplay over the two discs. The sarcastic attitude and cruel humour of the series carries through to this instalment, bringing it up a level from Simon the Sorcerer II.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Simon_the_Sorcerer_3D,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
