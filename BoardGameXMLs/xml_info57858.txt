			<description>From the Back Cover: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I saw a shrink today. He was real a real nice guy, offered me coffee, told me everything would be okay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't think so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He asked me that one question. I hate him for asking it. Why did he have to ask that question? I can't answer it, I would if I could, heck, if I could answer it I probably wouldn't be here right now. I wish I knew the answer, it's so easy, it used to be. At least, I think it did. I don't know anymore, I don't know anything for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But why? Why did he have to ask it. He just looked me in the eye and asked: &amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you know who I am? Do you remember me?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter into a twisted and convoluted campaign adventure dealing with corporate deception, cop-killers, psychiatric hospitals, cults and powers so great that no one could imagine existed. Be prepared for an adventure that will take the characters into previously uncharted realms of the mind, and explore the horror of the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember Me? is set in the Alternate Reality Universe for Cyberpunk 2020. It is recommended for 3-6 very experienced players due to its complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RECOMMENDED FOR MATURE READERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
