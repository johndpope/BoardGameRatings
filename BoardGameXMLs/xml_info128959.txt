			<description>Children's card game. 36 cards comprising of 30 Cabbage cards (with 1 to 3 cabbages on them), 2 Snail cards and 4 Hedgehog picture cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the cards are shuffled and the first player takes the top card. If it is a Cabbage card, he lays it in front of him. If it is a part of the hedgehog picture, it is placed in the centre of the table. If it is a Snail, the player must return it to the deck of unused cards together with all his Cabbage cards. The pack is then shuffled again. Then the next player draws a card and follows the same instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all four parts of the Hedgehog picture have been revealed and the winner is the one with the most cabbages in their possession at that time. (Note: the rules say the most Cabbage cards wins but this must be wrong or, otherwise, having 1, 2 or 3 Cabbages on the cards would be meaningless).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is one which extends, that is, the inner sleeve slides down to reveal the character up a tall ladder and watering her cabbages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
