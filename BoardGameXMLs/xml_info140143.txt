			<description>Under Construction: Poland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are currently observing the largest construction boom in Poland since the reconstruction after World War 2. These days not storks but steel cranes are characteristic features of Polish landscape. Building and structures are being erected everywhere. New ribbons of asphalt cut through the fields. Sleek spans of slender bridges join river banks. Ring roads encircle towns and cities. Multi-level junctions resemble gigantic works of abstract art. Polish engineers use state-of-the-art technology and heavy construction equipment. Local communities wholeheartedly support the development of transport infrastructure. An architect, a landscaper, a construction mech operator have become dream professions for a child and ideal occupations of a prospective son-in-law.&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Poland! Soon, 100 years after Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski and Tadeusz Wenda the country on the Vistula will need you for the national construction effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under construction: Poland is a family board game, which with the subtle touch of irony and strong sensce of humor treats of building roads and highways in Poland. Players become managers, their goal is to finish all the contracted jobs faster than the opponents. Engineers, workers and dozens of very special machines are ready to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turn players decide either they work in the office or on the building site.&lt;br/&gt;In the office players draw cards from the market and use special cards such as: Recruiter, Archaeologist, Supplier or Site Manager. Those cards make the game easier for the player, but harder for the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;On the building site players bulid infrastructure by discarding relevant cards and placing tokens on the map. They can also get rid of Arachaelogist or use special cards: Local Community or Employee of the Month. &lt;br/&gt;After finishing one of assigned contracts player gets 3 extra cards from the market.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever complete all of his/her contracts first is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The players have different number of contracts and infrastructures to be build, but the game is very well balanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest advantages of the game are illustrations and high quality of materials used for its production. The board consists of 16 elements, shaped with great likeness to the polish voivodships. The network of roads and highway reflects ambitious plans of national infrastructure. Last but not least, few dozens of tokens and over 150 beautifully painted cards makes this game a &amp;ldquo;must have&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
