			<description>Spacebabies N Robots is easy to play a board game with little strategy and lots of fun! The premise is simple, each player has four robots (pawns), carrying babies. Player has to get all his robots to the escape pod while facing scary alien creatures, death blocks, and opponent traps. The first player to get all his/ her robots to escape pod wins. The players will be equipped with certain weapons and power-ups which can be used strategically. Maximum of four people can play this game. BE CAREFUL! The fate of the space babies depends on a roll of dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;-This game has three different maps with distinct look and feel. &lt;br/&gt;Some rules will vary according to maps.&lt;br/&gt;-This game can be played by 2,3, or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;-The main objective is to get all the robots (pawns) to the escape pod (middle area) for their evacuation before other players.&lt;br/&gt;-Players can choose to play solo or form teams based on their preferences.&lt;br/&gt;-Each player will get 4 robots (pawns), 6 cards and custom tiles (2 or 3 depending on the map).&lt;br/&gt;-The custom tiles will be used as traps for opponents.&lt;br/&gt;-Certain custom tiles can be used for own advantage.&lt;br/&gt;-The player can kill other opponents and get killed by other opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;-To start the game, a player will have to roll either 1 or 6. &lt;br/&gt;Every roll of six will grant a bonus roll.&lt;br/&gt;-The player can move any pawn in the active play area on a dice roll.  &lt;br/&gt;-For a single dice roll, you can move only one pawn. If you get a bonus roll, you can use that role for another pawn.&lt;br/&gt;-If your pawn reaches a block (a tile in the active play area), and if opponent's pawn is there, player&amp;rsquo;s pawn will kill it and take its place. &lt;br/&gt;-Player will get a bonus roll for a kill.&lt;br/&gt;-The player can use cards to his/her advantage. (Refer to card info and rules)&lt;br/&gt;-The player can use custom tiles as a trap as well as for own advantage. (Refer custom tiles).&lt;br/&gt;-A pawn reaching the destination area/ escape pod will give grant one bonus roll to the player.&lt;br/&gt;-While stuck in a trap, if the player has no cards or doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to use cards, the player can try and roll 1 or 3 to get out of it. If the player fails, the pawn will die. Also, if a player rolls 6, failing to roll 1 or 3, the player can use the bonus which he/ she got from a roll of 6 to try and roll 1 or 3. If the player fails again, he can use the bonus on any other pawns in the active play area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
