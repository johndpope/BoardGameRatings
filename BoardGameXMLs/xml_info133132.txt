			<description>Wizard's Quest is a fantasy-themed area control wargame in the 1970's. It's simple &amp;amp; fun to play with up to 6 players. After the rise of modern euro games, I found the game has lots of potentials to be upgraded to the next level. Since the game is out of print for a long time, I decided to redesign this game in 2011. The project is named Advanced Wizard's Quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWQ is not an expansion but an all-new game or sequel to the old game. There are new rules, tokens &amp;amp; cards. The only thing reused in base game is the map. However, you don't need the old WQ to play this game. All the game components are available for download in the file section below. New races, monsters, unit types, treaures &amp;amp; events are added with a new alliance &amp;amp; treasure hunt system. However, I retained the unique random native spawning &amp;amp; monster attacks system in the original game which is the spirit of Wizard's Quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is the game setting:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Three centuries has past since the Orcs were banished from Marnon. The old kingdom from Eric's line was splited into three clans. Each clan claimed their lords being the rightful heir to the throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, there are reports that natives of the island are coming back...but not just the Orcs this time. There are the Elves, the Dwarves &amp;amp; the Lizardmen. They all came back to reclaim their homeland since ancient times. However, the greatest threat is not from the natives. There are rumors that a dark force emerged from the ruins of the abandoned castles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added to the chaos is the return of two great monsters, the Dragon &amp;amp; the Hydra. Various monsters are also reported everywhere. People begin to believe that the protector of the island, the great wizard, Peacemaker, was dead. Yet there is a legend saying the great wizard may come back one day, but in a very different form....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The constant expansion of the frenzy natives finally pushed the humans back to the coasts. Seeing this as a chance, some warlords declared their independence from the old kingdom. New flags are flying over the castle in the north. This marked the end of the old kingdom &amp;amp; the beginning of a new era - the Age of Heroes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
