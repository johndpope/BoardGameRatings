			<description>In Tycoons, players will roll the dice in order to move to adjacent provinces of Canada, states of the USA or into Mexico. As they move into new areas, they will have to either draw a &amp;quot;Sale&amp;quot; card (which will give them money) or a Disaster card (which will make them lose money or some other detrimental effect.  While the game is a simple roll-and-move with random effects that appear through drawing cards, the purpose of the game is educational. The publisher states that by playing the game multiple times, &amp;quot;each player will automatically learn every province, state and [about] Mexico and their capital cities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach a specific amount of money (set by the players before the game begins) will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
