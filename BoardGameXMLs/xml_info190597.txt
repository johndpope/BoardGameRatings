			<description>Each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board. The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; spaces. Movement is determined by a die. All players move around the board on their own track in the shape of a triangle. All 4 triangles together form a star, so the players may capture each other's pawns at the intersections. Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all pawns &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published between 1923 and 1937.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
