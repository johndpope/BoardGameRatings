			<description>TrigO&amp;trade; is a creative board game that teaches the rudimentary concepts of trigonometry. The game has six levels of play ranging from beginner to advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 6 playing pieces of the same color, one for each of the trigonometric functions. There can be 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;Players will learn the names of the six major trigonometric functions: SIN, COS, TAN, COT, SEC, CSC. Advanced rules provide you with concepts of the four quadrants and the signs for each function in each quadrant.&lt;br/&gt;Players will learn the ratios of the sides of a right triangle for the six major trigonometric functions. The triangular playing pieces are specially designed to show the direction of rotation for your playing piece around each triangular path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple rules for the novice is called the &amp;quot;Beginners Game&amp;quot; In this game you will learn the names of the six functions and what constitutes a triangle.&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Direction Game&amp;quot; a player will find that there is a clockwise and counterclockwise direction of movement.&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Function Game&amp;quot; requires you to start your playing piece such that it moves onto the numerator for the trigonometric ratio of your playing piece and then onto the denomator for that playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Many Triangles Game&amp;quot; a player will make use of smaller right triangles to shorten the distance of travel.&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Quadrant Game&amp;quot; the player will find that there are four quadrants on the playing board with a specific sign for each trigonometric function as represented by the playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Function Sign Game&amp;quot; the player will need to observe the sign for each playing piece for the quadrant it is in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
