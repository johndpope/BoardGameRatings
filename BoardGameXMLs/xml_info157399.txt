							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirate Ring</name>
									
			<description>This unique strategy game is a challenge to master, placing you in the bid for a fleet of pirate ships. But pirates love only gold and easily switch sides. When the tide of battle turns, will you have enough ships to win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game takes only minutes to play and engages you with different strategic options and level rewards. Pirate Ring has the timeless appeal of a classic boardgame. With tactics uncharted, you'd best be clever to defeat the Captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features HD art and animation, Game Center support, and tournament scoring. The glory of the fleets can be yours, if you dare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of this game is its puzzle board, a configuration of ships and rings and coins. When the game resets, the opening setups keep changing too, forcing you to change your strategy each time. Victory can come in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just be careful because every move is critical and the game can be won or lost quickly. To play Pirate Ring well is to read the board for hidden advantages. Each small move has a ripple effect and unlocks new outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like the challenge of Chess or Sudoku but you can't find the time in your busy day, then this is the perfect puzzler for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
