							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game â€“ Roam Across Rhovanion</name>
									
			<description>Roam Across Rhovanion is the second Adventure Pack in the &amp;quot;Ered Mithrin&amp;quot; cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. After venturing deep into the Grey Mountains, your path leads to the orcish stronghold of Gundabad. Before you can infiltrate this fortress, however, you must forge an uneasy alliance with a treacherous Goblin and travel across Rhovanion in search of his lost items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack's sixty cards include the first hero to bear the Woodman trait, forming the foundation for an entirely new type of deck. Additionally, the pack contains three copies each of eight different player cards, including some that bring some relief to the encounter deck itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
