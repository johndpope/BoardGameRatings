			<description>Play a soccer match. In The Beautiful Match, players have a hand of seven offensive and defensive cards (5/2,4/3,3/4,2/5 chosen at start of the match) and two bonus cards. The players who controls the ball plays offensive cards which, combined with a die roll, give the result of action (move of the pawn on the pitch and possession). The defender can play defensive cards (challenge and closed down) which give a result with a die roll (die negative modifier for attack action, foul, take possession of the ball, etc.). When the pawn is near the goal you can shoot (roll dice; you read the result on a chart). All off soccer is here: substitutions, red cards, corners, free kicks,clearance,cross,...moreover the game could easily be modified with houserules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
