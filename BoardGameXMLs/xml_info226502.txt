							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gladiator Gauntlet</name>
									
			<description>Gladiator Gauntlet is a solitaire microgame where the player fights up to 6 rounds of enemies in the colosseum, attempting to win glory and reknown. The player fights each enemy in sequence, matching their own dice versus the enemy's. Whoever wins each dice match causes damage to the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gladiator Gauntlet utilizes a unique mechanic which dynamically ties your health to your combat rolls. With your health represented by two dice, you can choose to lower your guard to deliver a heavy blow and replace a low-value combat die with a high-value health die, or you can play defensively and replace a high-value combat die with a low-value health die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful, though, because if any of your health die reach 0, you lose that die permanently, reducing your options later on. Earn glory to modify rolls and carefully manage your health and combat to defeat all rounds and win the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game received the following awards in The 2017 9-card Nanogame PnP Design Contest:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Place: Best New Designer&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place: Best Artwork&lt;br/&gt;7th Place: Best Overall Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
