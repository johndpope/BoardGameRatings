			<description>Factions is the free multiplayer release of The Banner Saga, a role-playing, turn-based strategy game putting you in control of a clan of battle-hardened viking warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your customizable team of fighters from an ever-growing roster and battle online against friends and enemies across gorgeous landscapes in combat that feels like nothing you've played before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build Your Team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Factions, you don't just play one character; you name, upgrade and build an entire clan of warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earn Renown for each kill you make in combat, win or lose, and use it to train your characters in the Proving Grounds, forging your own unique strategies for the next fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real Tactical Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most strategy games give you dozens of ways to do the same thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions features an original combat system that hasn't been seen before in strategy games, emphasizing real choice over random chance.  When you win it's because you were better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art Of The Sake Of Art&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the American master Eyvind Earle, the look of The Banner Saga is a mature art style you won't find in any other game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character under your command is a living person, painstakingly hand-animated in the style of classic animated films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Living Land&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rich world of The Banner Saga is evolving throughout three full-length campaigns, and Factions exists within the same story, changing as events unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Strand isn't the last place you'll call home.  In the future, clans will unite to build their own cities and even vie for territory.  Your role in this has only begun...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
