							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Something Went Wrong (ZOECon Edition)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Well, that's 264 points of damage. You splatter Hunk all over the common room. The patrons shriek in horror and run out of the inn, occasionally slipping on blood and entrails. You're now alone in a room that looks like a vat of beef stroganoff exploded in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something Went Wrong is a new, simple and extremely fun competitive fantasy RPG in which things go wrong. Everyone's the GM and no one is, but not all at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of skilled adventurers go on one last adventure to secure their futures and fortunes. Something they&amp;rsquo;ve all done, any number of times. And then something goes wrong. Featuring almost 5 classes, literal tons of gold and monster knitting circles, you won't want to miss out on this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise is simple! As experienced adventurers, your characters succeed at just about everything in game. The only exceptions are hitting monsters with weapons and hitting monsters with spells. For those, you'll have to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns as the GM leading their group of characters through one or more encounters. Every round of each encounter features another player taking the roll of the GM. The goal? Use your experience to cause the other characters to fail spectacularly! The last character left standing wins all the loot and gets to brag about it at the local tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something Went Wrong is a quick game which can be played with zero preparation. All you'll need are a d6, a d12, some paper and pencils and a good dose of humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation takes roughly 5 minutes and a game can be played over the course of an hour or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now with 1000% more NPCs! The ZOECon version of this game is inspired by the folks at Dead Gentlemen Productions and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment - specifically their Gamers, Gamers: Dorkness Rising and JourneyQuest properties. With a new character class, the Bard, new misabilities and new artwork, you'll love this game even more than you love other games of similar types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
