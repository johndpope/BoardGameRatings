			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arcane Armory for 4th Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;reg; contains over 130 new magic items for magic users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How much magic is too much?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you really have to ask? Can you ever have too much magic? The little gnomes here at Creation's Edge Games don't think so. That's why they created this supplement; a book of magic items for magic users. That's right; we don't even think that characters with magic flowing through their veins have enough magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;reg; game supplement contains dozens of new magic items designed with warlocks and wizards in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring extraordinary artwork from rising fantasy illustrator Carlos &amp;quot;Celurian&amp;quot; Torreblanca and stunning stock art provided by Sade, The Arcane Armory presents dozens of unique new armor, masks, rods, staffs, tomes, and wands you won't find anywhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
