			<description>My Barter Game is a fun interactive game for ages 7-700.&lt;br/&gt; How to play&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice and land on a square, say the accountant which allows you to buy a trade card. Trade card have values on them of cash or trade and are able to be redeemed at the location listed. You only start this game with $100 cash and $100 trade so you need to use your trade to get you cash. When you go around bottom line (our start) you have to pay $200 in cash (one of the rare things in this game that specifies cash as opposed to being able to use either for anything).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are twists like shark attack or gold mine where you either earn a fortune or loose one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything in My Barter Game is trade-able so if you want to continue play and someone needs help you can bail them out, or if they are on a square you hold the card to you can trade them something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
