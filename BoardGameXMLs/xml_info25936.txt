			<description>The gameboard is a map of the United States displaying 128 cities. There are four types of cities. Depending on the type of city a player&amp;rsquo;s pawn lands a player may raise funds, spend funds to get vote chips, declare vote chips for a state in the hopes of getting a plurality to earn that state&amp;rsquo;s electoral votes or go head-to-head with another opponent in a debate. Lines connect the cities to regulate the movement of the players&amp;rsquo; pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players divide $72 million dollars and each chooses a different city to start the game. To move, a player rolls the die and advances that many cities unless the roll in a one and that allows a free move to anywhere on the gameboard. The city landed upon regulates what a player&amp;rsquo;s actions are on that turn. After taking one&amp;rsquo;s turn the player advances the calendar pawn one day. The game is over after seventy-two days. The players add up their votes and each state&amp;rsquo;s electoral votes are awarded to the player who has the most votes. Ties go to whomever rolls the higher number. States where no one has any votes goes to the player who has declared the most popular votes in that region. The player who has the most electoral votes is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
