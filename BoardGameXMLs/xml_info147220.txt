							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Equals: The Number Strategy Game</name>
									
			<description>Players use number combinations and strategy to get rid of all their cards to win the game. The two face up active cards are added, subtracted, multiplied or divided to create &amp;quot;target numbers&amp;quot;. At each turn players put down one or more number cards that add up to (or Equal) those target numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also 8 different Action Cards that add variety, strategy, and surprises to the game. The game can last under 10 minutes if a player can get rid of the cards in just a few turns, or it can run up to about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get better, faster and more confident with numbers just by playing Equals. This makes Equals perfect for families with children and classroom teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
