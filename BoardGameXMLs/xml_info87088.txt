			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duck Attack! is an action-adventure game developed by Will Nicholes. The game was developed as a retro-style game for the Atari 2600, and has a similar feel to games of that generation. The story begins with a mad scientist creating a group of mutant, fire breathing ducks that lay Plutonium eggs. These eggs are to be used in a doomsday device, and it is up to the player to collect them and stop the scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a robot that has been sent into the scientist&amp;rsquo;s lair. Contact with the ducks or other obstacles results in losing a life. The game was released in both cartridge form and as a downloadable ROM pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
