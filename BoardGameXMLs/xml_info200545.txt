							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elevator</name>
									
			<description>The idea of Elevator is to get rid of all your cards. All the cards are dealt out at the start. You start with five cards and take cards from your own stack as you play. &lt;br/&gt;Save your wilds for when you need them, try and stop your neighbor from going out by sacrificing and taking the pile, or change the elevator to &amp;quot;going down&amp;quot; if you know your neighbor has high cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is in the game:&lt;br/&gt;A sturdy box with 3 decks of cards, (marked for easy separation when playing with less players). &lt;br/&gt;Instructions for gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
