			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was a little kid, my brother introduced me to the game of Dungeons and Dragons. The local Co-Op has the Basic Game box set as well as a host of D&amp;amp;D action figures and toys. One of the toys that I was allowed to buy was a bendy Neo-Otyugh. Since those young days, the otyugh has always been my favourite monster of the Dungeons and Dragons and now Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. So it is with great joy that I release: Otyughnomicon: Typhoon-Kissed Otyugh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains the typhoon-kissed creature template, two templated otyughs (aberration and magical beast versions), a tropical island encounter complete with a young bronze dragon, a typhoon-kissed otyugh and a tribe of grindylows. As usually, this release contains new art from Michael Scotta and tokens for the typhoon-kissed otyugh and a handful of grindylows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
