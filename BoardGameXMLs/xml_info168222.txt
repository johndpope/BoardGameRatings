			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir Reginald Lichlyter, owner of the Wine &amp;amp; Spirit Emporium, is back to bring you hundreds of new alcoholic beverages from standard ales, fantastical wines, and magic liquors! This tome provides expanded rules for drinking (while keeping the mechanics simple), breaks down the various types of beverages (while providing hundreds of examples), and even provides an assortment of rare alchemical and magical booze to keep any dwarf happy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every drink presented in this book comes with a detailed description of its color, taste, and production process as well as how it is typically served, where to find it, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's not all! Inside you'll also find simple rules for your adventuring party to run their very own tavern or inn! Pour over the lists of supplies you'll need, study the various types of establishments, and roll the dice to see what types of profits you made today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
