							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Romeo Exxet</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Romeo Exxet, The Supreme Inquisitor, is the most preeminent figure in the Inquisition. His name is whispered with a mixture of fear and unconditional devotion. Every part of him, from a single strand of hair to the last drop of his blood, emanates true power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As foretold in ancient times, he is the chosen of the light, the embodiment of the dynasties of the seven Beryls. Blessed since the instant of his birth, Romeo has always been a giant among ants. His natural presence is such that even the most powerful Inquisitors and elementals kneel before him and serve him as if his word is law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leader Warrior - Light Church - Level 75&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exterminator of Gods: Attacks made by Romeo against Characters with a medium or large base use his secondary Damage attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Conflagration: When Romeo dies, he makes an attack on all Units within 3 inches of himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dies Magna (Ki, Attack) - +2 Attack / +3 Damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caedus Celestia (Ki, Attack) - +6 Attack. To use this attack Romeo must have 8 or fewer Life Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pray (Special, Effect) - Place a &amp;quot;Miracle&amp;quot; token on Romeo. To use this ability, Romeo must sacrifice 2 Life points. Limit: Once per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
