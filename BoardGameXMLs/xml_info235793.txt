			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Saturday, April 24, 1926, Daredevil Owen the Fearless fell to his death while atop an airplane. The tragedy occurred when the pilot refused to land the plane despite quickly moving dark clouds forming as he worked the craft into the sky. The plane entered a large dark cloud formation and never exited. The crowd witnessed a black burst of energy, then Owen falling to his death. What is not known to the public is that Owen was found in two pieces, bitten in half. Since the tragedy, the dark clouds and terrible weather have huddled in a five mile circumference over parts of the Miskatonic Valley, with the air station at the epicenter. Air station meteorologist, Dr. Benjamin Orr, who runs the Miskatonic Valley Meteorological Station here, is absolutely stumped. As the days pass, the fortunes of the air station, and the area, begin to worsen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
