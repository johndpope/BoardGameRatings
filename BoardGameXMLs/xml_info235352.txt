							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Westermark</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Westermark is a prosperous, civilized Duchy at the westernmost part of Morien. Jutting out into the sea toward Lengoth-Ytame, it was for almost two centuries the Duchy of Fitzlan, ruled by the powerful Fitzlan family. However, just 12 years ago the 9th Duke of Fitzlan was deposed and exiled when the long-lost Princess Celethien Rialus was discovered by a group of adventurers and saved from her mystical imprisonment. For over 200 years, Celethien lay in enchanted slumber and faded into legend, with many stories swirling around her sudden disappearance overnight long ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
