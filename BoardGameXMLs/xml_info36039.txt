							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Master</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players take the role of founding fathers of a medieval town. The best builder earns the title of Guild Master.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a custom deck of 116 cards. Each card specifies a type of Location and the Resources it provides. Some cards also specify additional Resources that are provided when they are combined with other specific Location cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players obtain cards by drawing them from the deck and trading. On each turn, a player declares which type of Resource category to build, and then plays any cards of that category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of the turn that the last card is drawn from the deck. The winner is the player whose town provides the highest scores in the most number of Resource categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
