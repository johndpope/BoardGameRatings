			<description>From the Publisher / Developer Website:&lt;br/&gt;Victorious Boxers: Revolution takes full advantage of the unique capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to give players an authentic real-life boxing experience. The various moves include punches like jabs straights uppercuts and hooks as well as defensive maneuvers like ducks and sways. Players can enjoy several rounds with their friends or play through the deep and compelling Story Mode as they follow the story of Ippo Makunouchi a high school student who is bullied by his classmates as he rises to the top of the professional boxing ranks.Various control schemes allow eager players to punch and weave with their body to make the action appear onscreen for the full boxing experience as well as less strenuous options and even Classic Controller compatibility. The viewpoint is positioned right behind the player s transparent fighter to further enhance the feeling of being right there in the heat of battle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
