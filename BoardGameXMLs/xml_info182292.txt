							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talontessa</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cruel, beautiful and vain race of talontessa&amp;hellip; a deadly, feminine touch to the post-apocalyptic wastes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the region, these all-female creatures are known by different names, including Junk Jezebels, Sickle-Sues, Hook Hussies, Blood Brides, Hook Girrrls and Claw Maidens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the mortal enemies of skullocks, ruthless to slavers, prone to robbing travelers and always on the look out for a handsome man to either seduce or ensnare. Tribal, petty and obsessed with their looks and social status in their sisterhood, the talontessa are unpredictable and should only be approached with caution. Yet, regardless of their odd ways, passions, use of poison, traps and moody natures, they can make for great allies and are as likely to help excavators as hinder them.  Unlike any other Creature of the Apocalypse in this line, loners of this race can also be utilized as player characters and this PDF comes with rules for generating such lithe, multi-limbed adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 13th, and temporarily the final, free creature of the apocalypse. This special addition is 11 pages long and includes a d20 mutation list, disposition towards travelers table, d100 loot table, as well as rules for creating player character talontessa and a player handout art only sheet. We have more COTA creatures in the works but they will be part of a &amp;lsquo;for purchase&amp;rsquo; sourcebook which includes all the previous beasts plus 6 never before seen mutant freaks. Stay tuned for that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although crafted for The Mutant Epoch role-playing game, using the Outland System Game Mechanic, a GM can easily modify the stats for the talontessa and use these feisty, velociraptor clawed hunters with another post-apocalyptic game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
