							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alternative Civil War: 1861</name>
									
			<description>Alternative Civil War is a 28mm scale miniature skirmish wargame set in an alternate world. Impossible science collides with ancient powers and mythical beings clash with courageous soldiers over the American Civil War battlegrounds in a conflict that has transcended its own frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a skirmish game of miniatures of the finest quality, cast by some of the best professionals in the industry. The game ranges from 6 to 16 models per side and the rules are easy. It has a deep tactical component, using one or two 20 sided dice to resolve every action in a single roll. An elegant system of alternating turns will keep both players on the edge, avoiding long waits while your opponent finishes his turn and creating a swift and dynamic battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game incorporates the mechanism of a Tactical Impulse Pool: a limited resource that will grant you benefits such as re-rolling, gaining additional actions or activating skills. Players will need to strategize where and when to commit their resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
