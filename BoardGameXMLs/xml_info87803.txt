			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the World of Galendor.  In this book, the first of a series, you will be introduced to Sol, the capital city of Rashangar.  You can lead your adventurers through this city, lose them in its mazes, let them sample delicacies, taste its daily life and even introduce them to Sol's ruler, the great Lord Nalar Orst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly every aspect of life within the city has been laid out in detail, and even beginning Fantasy Masters should have little trouble running fantasy adventures based in this city or the surrounding countryside.  Note the openness that permits the insertion of original ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each book in the World of Galendor series is designed to stand alone, though if players wish to expand their field of play, they should obtain the other books, which provide a continually unfolding campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Galendor may be used with nearly any fantasy gaming system.  However, it was designed with Advanced Dngeons and Dragons* in mind since the largest percentage of fantasy gamers play by that rules system.  (This world is not specifically sanctioned by T.S.R. Hobbies) or any other publisher of fantasy role-playing systems, and as such is readily playable by any system.  This world does contain some conventions which make it compatible with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons*.  These are explained in the appendix on conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this book is mainly concerned with the city of Sol, Encounter tables and map of Rashangar have been provided to allow play outside the city's walls.  The encounter tables are differentiated by type of terrain, and should be used b y the Fantasy Master to determine what types of creatures or people may be encountered by adventurers roaming the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Advanced Dungeons and Dragons is a trademark of T.S.R. Hobbies, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
