							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Recruiting for Kitchener&#039;s army</name>
									
			<description>Goal: Collect as many (visiting = recruits) counters as possible before a player reaches Dover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played on a board carrying a map of the British Isles.&lt;br/&gt;Players move round the map according to the throw of dice.&lt;br/&gt;Similar to 'Snake and Ladders' you gain or loose movement points, depending on the space your turn ends (==&amp;gt; see table on the board). Luckily you also may collect counters entering the big cities.&lt;br/&gt;The player who reaches Dover finishes the game, collecting 10 additional counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical background: &lt;br/&gt;Horatio Herbert Kitchener, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum and Broome, 1850 - 1916, British field-marshal. &lt;br/&gt;His excellent reputation was used to recruit men for the 'killing fields' of WW I. He and most of his staff drowned when his ship struck a mine off Orkney.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
