			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spoils of War is the latest entry in the Beginner Baubles line. Released monthly, each new issue in the series is packed to bursting with weird and wonderful prizes just waiting to be greedily devoured by the gluttons at your table. In addition to the baubles themselves, each supplement also includes fully-playtested new rules and mechanics, outstanding presentation and production values, a torrent of premium-quality artwork, and extra materials designed to help you get the most out of the series. Additionally, Beginner Baubles are completely setting-neutral, ready to be dropped into almost any fantasy world that allows for magic items and objects. Best of all, adopting a completely modular approach, each entry in the series can be used as a standalone supplement or in conjunction with any others that you acquire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginner Baubles: Spoils of War presents 20 dangerous and deadly baubles perfect for use on the battlefield. Soldiers, gladiators, warriors, mercenaries and sellswords, fighters, barbarians; and anyone else born for battle will find an instrument of war perfectly tailored to their needs here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spoils of War includes the following baubles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    J&amp;ouml;tynnbaen. This weathered, decaying old maul-turned-meat-tenderizer serves as an able weapon in the ongoing war against troll encroachment.&lt;br/&gt;    Nordenzeik . Despite its size and weight, this stone greatsword of a forgotten kingdom is far better at preserving the peace, than it is at taking lives.&lt;br/&gt;    Pavise Shield. Designed to be wielded by specialized archers and bowyers, this enormous shield introduces a new armor type to 5th Edition, Tower Shields.&lt;br/&gt;    Sprocket of the Warmonger. Once belonging to an infamous siege weapon, this impressive cog comes with an even more impressive history. It grants those who bear it tremendous luck, seeing them through great trials and tribulations.&lt;br/&gt;    Marching Sabatons. These platinum boots serve as a tremendous boon to anyone undertaking a long and difficult journey, and to those who accompany them.&lt;br/&gt;    Bokar's Sticker. This extra potent crossbow attachment provides crossbowmen with a defense against melee attackers whilst also adding a new weapon type to 5th Edition, Bayonets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
