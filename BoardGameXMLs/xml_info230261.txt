			<description>Ah Here Now is a game celebrating the more wicked side of Irish humour. A party game for bastards, gobshites and thunderin' bitches aged 18 and up.&lt;br/&gt;It is to all intents and purposes Card Against Humanity, but with a distinctly Irish twist. It plays the same, the rules are the same, but if you haven't lived in Ireland it's likely a large portion of the humour will be lost on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Players draw 10 answer cards. Player 1 then draws a question card and each of the other players submits an answer, replacing with a new answer card from the deck so they always have a hand of 10. Player 1 will then select the card which they deem the winner, and the player who submitted that card gets 1 point. It is then player 2s turn to draw a question card. Play continues until one person has accrued the agreed upon points total, at which point they are declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
