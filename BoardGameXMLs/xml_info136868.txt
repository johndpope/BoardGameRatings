							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starship Troopers: Roughnecks</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Troopers: Roughnecks is an action game for mobile phones based on the classic book by Robert A. Heinlein that also spawned a movie and TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Roughnecks are a special elite squad of the Mobile Infantry, Earth's front line of defense against the vicious Bugs who intend to wipe out the human race. You take the role of John Rico, squad leader of Roughnecks, as you embark on planetary missions against the vicious aliens. Mission objectives very, ranging from seek-and-destroy missions to escort and rescue operations. Most of the time though, your goal is simply to blast the alien arachnids before they have a chance to get at you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
