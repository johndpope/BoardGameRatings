							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Draw Poker</name>
									
			<description>Draw Poker is part of Classic Games' Collectors' Series Dice Games, which is based on the card game of the same name. The game includes nine over-sized six-sided dice that feature every card in a standard deck (including two jokers). The dealer randomly selects five dice for a player to roll. After rolling, the player can then opt to trade up to four dice for four new dice, which represents drawing new cards. The dice are then given to the player on the left. Players must keep track of what &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; have already been played in a hand so that no one can have a duplicate. Any duplicate cards must be rerolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes chips and a scorecard for betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
