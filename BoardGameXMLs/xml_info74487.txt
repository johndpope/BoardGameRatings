			<description>&amp;quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist, released in Europe as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist and in Japan as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Return of the Shredder is a side-scrolling beat 'em up based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) franchise, and was also the first TMNT game released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;April O'Neil is reporting from Ellis Island when, in a sudden flash of light, her audience and herself witness Manhattan Island suddenly starting to shrink. Shredder then hijacks the airwaves and announces to the world that this was only a demonstration of the power of the Hyperstone, the treasure of Dimension X. With the Hyperstone in his possession, he now has the power to take over the world. The Turtles have no choice but to go after Shredder and stop him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of The Hyperstone Heist is roughly based on the second Ninja Turtles arcade game Turtles in Time, which was also released for the Super NES during the same year. The controls are similar to Turtles in Times, but the ability to dash is now assigned to a specific button and the player can no longer throw enemies towards the screen. There are a total of five stages (&amp;quot;New York City&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A Mysterious Ghost Ship&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Shredder's Hideout&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Gauntlet&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The Final Shell Shock&amp;quot;), which comprises a combination of new levels created specifically for the Genesis game (3 screens are shared between SNES Turtles in Time and Genesis The Hyperstone Heist) and the sound, gameplay, and graphics of Turtles in Time. The bosses includes Leatherhead, Rocksteady (having the same design and attack pattern that he had in the first arcade game), Tatsu (Shredder's right-hand man from the first two live-action film and the game's only original boss character), Stockman (in his human form like in the first arcade game), Krang, and Super Shredder. In addition to being Tatsu's only appearance in a Ninja Turtles video game, The Hyperstone Heist is also notable for being the only game to feature Rocksteady as an enemy character without his partner Bebop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_The_Hyperstone_Heist,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
