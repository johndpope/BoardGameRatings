			<description>From the front of book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Faer&amp;ucirc;n&amp;rsquo;s fate is being shaped in Netheril. You can hide behind your belief that this is all about other lands, other people, other lives; but in the end, your lands and your people will be caught up in this struggle like all the rest. So decide now. Which side are you on? A Living Forgotten Realms adapted adventure set in Hillsfar in the Moonsea region for characters levels 14-17. This adventure is found in Issue #180 of Dungeon Magazine, part of D&amp;amp;D Insider. Dungeon Magazine issues may be found on the Wizards of the Coast website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://wizards.com/dnd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://wizards.com/dnd&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adaptation document does not present adjusted stat blocks for low/high tier; any legal table of characters levels 14-17 can play, but bear in mind that the stat blocks in the adventure were written for a party of 16th-level characters, so tables at the low end of the P2 level band might find this adventure very difficult. At least one person at the table (either a player or the DM) must have an active subscription to D&amp;amp;D Insider. We recommend that you allow at least eight hours of playing time to complete this adventure (the equivalent of a two-round LFR adventure).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
