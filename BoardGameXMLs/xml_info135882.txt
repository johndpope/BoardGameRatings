			<description>Welcome to a roller coaster sim like you've never seen! &lt;br/&gt;Roller Coaster Rampage is a fast paced, high-scoring, competitive rollercoaster simulator with destructive environments!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to perform the best manual maneuvers, collect the most gems, link to the most track sections, and gain first place on the leaderboards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finished coaster creations, built in real time, can be saved and uploaded to Steam Workshop to be downloaded and ranked by the Steam community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roller Coaster Rampage revolutionizes the coaster genre by introducing on-the-fly track construction and deformation. In previous games the coaster riding experience was a passive, non-interactive experience. Roller Coaster Rampage introduces an innovative approach, and a specialized procedural coaster engine that allows players to build coasters in real-time as they ride them. Players leave behind a trail of procedurally-generated coaster tracks and supports, which then become obstacles as the player circles back. While riding players can also dynamically connect to isolated track segments like loops, cobra rolls, bat wings, and barrel rolls. With these innovative game features and engine technology players can now build coasters while enjoying a fast paced, arcade style, roller coaster racing simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
