			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nature is not good, nor is it evil. Its children could as easily save a forest, as burn one down. Living embodiments of nature have often been portrayed as either avid protectors or reclusive and dangerous hermits. This has been especially true of sentient plant species. However, most of all, nature is unpredictable. Perhaps it was in this spirit the oaklings were born. When the first oaklings marched inexplicably from the forest, the tree huggers cheered a new ally. After all, oaklings have all the hallmarks of a friend of the wood; being basically medium sized living trees with green leafy faces. However, the oaklings cared little for conservation. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Oaklings are an industrious species that has little regard for sentiment or emotion. Coldly logical, the oaklings took up branch to their own cause; the betterment of themselves. Like nature, they are not inherently good or evil; they could as easily take up sides with a goodly king as they could a deplorable dictator. So catch some sun, grow some roots, and spread your leaves. This powerful new PC race can come crashing into your game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
