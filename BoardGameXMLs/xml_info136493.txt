			<description>This is a game related to Halma or Chinese Checkers played on an 8x8 board. Each player of 2 players starts with 16 pieces in a 4x4 quarter of the board in a corner. No captures are made, but pieces can move vertically or horizontally only either jumping in an empty space immediately beyond an adjacent piece or into an adjacent empty square. If a jump is made, the same piece can jump again indefinitely i the board position permits. A win is either by being the first to occupy all 16 spaces of the opponent's starting position or having the most in the other player's starting area when either player has no legal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notaly it improves on some of the faults of the related game Grasshopper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken on its own, it is a game where every move to a player's own advantage is likely also to benefit the opponent. Therein lies the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
