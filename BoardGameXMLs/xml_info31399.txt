			<description>This is a family trivia game based on a popular TV quiz show in England.  There are four categories of trivia questions with difficulties ranging from basic to advanced, which makes the game more suitable for a family.  The game includes a buzzer and a flip card scorecard for each player, and a timer for the game.  Whoever is in the lead when the timer goes off is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
