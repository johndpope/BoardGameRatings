							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OPFOR Full Spectrum War</name>
									
			<description>Warfare is no longer just guns and bombs. It incorporates all types of Political Power. The army calls this PMESII (Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure, and Information), or FULL SPECTRUM WARFARE.&lt;br/&gt;In this simulation, you will see some of the factors that commanders now must contend with to beat win a FSW (Full Spectrum War).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 3 decks; a terrain deck, an OPFOR political power deck and a BLUFOR political power deck.  Nine territories are drawn to be contended for.  Players play cards out of their hand one at a time, to vie for the terrain and it's victory points.  In this unique system, the different political power cards (Military, Commerce, World Opinion, etc) have different values depending on the territory being contested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to win over half of the territorial points is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
