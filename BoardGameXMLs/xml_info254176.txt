			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware! The Creature Compendium is a full-color book gorgeously illustrated by the talented Jen Elliott. The book features over 250 new creatures, some familiar and most anything but, all aligned with rules for creating your own monsters, animals, and villains. Even players that have read the book may be surprised by a storyteller with an eye for customization, and within are the tools you need to tailor challenges for the players at your table. Our creatures are bound to keep your players on their toes, and maybe cost the unwary a few of those squirming appendages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
