							<name  sortindex="1">Neuroshima Hex! Tactic Cards</name>
									
			<description>Mini-expansion designed by Michał Oracz! Set of 6 cards - three for each player, compatible with both 2.5 and 3.0 editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards allow to change the situation on the board at critical moment, save the key unit and even keep the token for later! Huge opportunities, but remember - you can use each card only once, so you really need to think if now is the right moment...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASE&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, during drawing new tiles, you can put one of the drawn tiles on the Base card instead of mandatory discarding it. There can be only one tile lying on the Base card. During any of your following draws, you can draw this tile instead of one of the randomly drawn tiles, then you must remove the Base card from game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEDIC&lt;br/&gt;At any time during the game, when any of your units receive wounds, you can use the Medic card. This unit is treated at this moment as if the Medic module was connected to it. After using, Medic card is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TACTIC&lt;br/&gt;At any time during your turn, you can use Tactic card to choose one of the three following effects: Move, Battle, Push back. This card replaces corresponding instant tile. After using, Tactic card is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
