			<description>&amp;quot;Battlefield: 1942: The Road to Rome is an expansion pack for the Battlefield 1942 videogame. It was released February 4, 2003 by Electronic Arts and developed by DICE. Six maps featuring battles that took place in Italy  were added (Such as Operation Husky and the Battle of Anzio), along with eight vehicles, including the German Bf 110 and the British Mosquito fighter-bombers and the M1 Stuart light tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;French and Italian forces are included, which has little impact on gameplay. Engineers can now mount a bayonet on their rifle for hand-to-hand combat. The Italian Breda Modelo .30 and the British Sten SMG have been added. There are a new set of multiplayer game filters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maps&lt;br/&gt;    * Battle for Anzio&lt;br/&gt;    * Battle for Salerno&lt;br/&gt;    * Monte Cassino&lt;br/&gt;    * Monte Santa Croce&lt;br/&gt;    * Operation Baytown&lt;br/&gt;    * Operation Husky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlefield 1942: The Road to Rome received generally positive reviews. IGN gave it a 9.1, and GameSpot game it a 8.9. Criticized was the lack of new multiplayer modes, lack of new weapons, (having only the Breda Modelo .30 for the Italians) , and no stability increases. A favored feature were the map designs.
