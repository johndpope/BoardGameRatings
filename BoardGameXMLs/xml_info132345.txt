			<description>Card game intended to be played on a long car journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a hand of four cards and when they spot something on their hand of cards they can declare it and score the points on the card. They then get another card and play on. At the end of the journey, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simplified version for younger children is played the same but cards that have a word in Blue, the player can ignore that word e.g. Spot a yellow car and the word yellow is in blue type, then the player just has to see any car to score. In this version everything spotted scores 1 point regardless of the point score on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advanced version is also described where players can collect sets of cards with the same symbol on the card. If they can get four of them, they can just declare them all (without seeing the objects on the cards) and score accordingly. Not sure why this advanced version exist but there you are, it does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
