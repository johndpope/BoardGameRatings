			<description>[From the box]&lt;br/&gt;A card game for the swine in all of us&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party Pigs may be played with friends or any other group of swine. To win you will want to scarf up the most points by cleverly combining the cards in hoof (hand) with those in the pig pen (community cards) to make the best piggy poker hands possible.  While you are busy scarfing up points you will need to keep a sharp look out that some scheming pig doesn't stick you with the Dirty Swine card.  An evening of pleasure for two to six piggies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
