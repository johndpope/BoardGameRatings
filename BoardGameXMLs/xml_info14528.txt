			<description>The Celebrated Jumping Frog Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven happy frogs are trying to get onto a lily pad. You must help them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create seven different colored frogs from LEGO, using the supplied directions, along with several special LEGO &amp;quot;frog rakes&amp;quot;.  Place the frogs around the edge of a table with a 'lily pad' (which should be a round flat piece about the size of a coaster) in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll two dice to determine which frog(s) to prod with their rakes.  Score points for frogs that land on the lily pad - or land in silly positions.  Highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also available in the Cheapass title: Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the website: &amp;quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog Game is another product of the idle minds of James Ernest and Cheapass Games. Carol Monahan gets credit for requesting a mindless game about frogs, and Steve Jackson gets credit for mentioning in a public forum that it was a great game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
