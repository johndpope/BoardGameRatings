							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fire Call</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;During the earlier days of firefighting, volunteer fire brigades used deception to compete with one another in order to be the first responders on scene, and subsequently receive payment from the property owner's insurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire Call positions you at the front lines of modern-day firefighting with a heated twist reminiscent of the combative early years.  As you battle opposing fire departments, pull out all the stops to gain control of the most districts by collecting equipment, sabotaging opponents, and successfully completing fire calls to win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game objective is to become the Fire Department (player) with the most occupied districts by collecting and using the necessary equipment to complete Fire Calls. Once all the districts are covered, the Fire Department with the most occupied districts wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players roll the die and move their markers along the track. The space they land on can have one of a number of effects. Players may gain fire equipment, have the opportunity to complete a fire call and occupy a district, gain cards for special effects later or sustain on-the-job injuries and be put in hospital. Players will also gain ranks throughout the game, starting off as Firefighters and being promoted up to Fire Chief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When fire calls are completed by players, the corresponding district is covered and occupied. Immediately after all 11 districts are occupied, the game ends and the player with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
