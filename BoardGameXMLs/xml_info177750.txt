							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild Cats</name>
									
			<description>Wild Cats is a social game for 3-6 players. Players are one of six cats riding in a police car back from an arrest. Deal out the cards randomly and follow the rules on the cards. Do whatever! Interrogate your opponents. Grill them (not literally). Maybe you'll make bold statements that coincide with your role? There is so much room for exploration, but remember to follow the rules on your card and don't look at your opponents' cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Good Cat, you need to suss out the Bad Cat and get the Wildcat to also vote for the Bad Cat. If you're the Bad Cat you want the opposite. But if you are the Wildcat, you need to get someone to vote for you, and figure out exactly who it is to create a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are ready to vote, count to 3 and point at the player that you want out. The player with the majority of the votes is eliminated. Reveal your cards to see who won!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
