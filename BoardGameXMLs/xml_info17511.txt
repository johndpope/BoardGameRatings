			<description>From the Crosstown Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far away, in the land of Elm, there is a majestic tree reaching up to the clouds. Legend has it that he who successfully reaches the top of this giant will gain untold fortunes and become ruler of a vast unknown land. But this is no easy task. The branches of the tree on which to climb do not stoop low to the reach of man&amp;hellip; they are but twigs when viewed from the ground. All that you dream of the kingdom is yours by successfully building a ladder to reach the first branch. Beware though; others are trying to get there first! They will stop at nothing to see you fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Not available anymore from here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/ctg_rungs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.geocities.com/ctg_rungs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
