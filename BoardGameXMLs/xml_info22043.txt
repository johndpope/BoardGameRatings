			<description>This vintage constellation card set game by the Naturegraph Company of San Marin, California, comes with four different games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Guess the Constellation:  Teams attempt to guess the names of the constellation cards held by a game leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Deal Constellations:  Two or more players attempt to guess the names of the constellations on other players cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Map the Sky:  Players attempt to place cards in relation to the north star.  (A star map is typically needed.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Star Relay:  Two teams with flashlights attempt to locate the most constellations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Perhaps holes could be poked through copies of the cards in order to project the constellation onto an inside wall?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with cards representing 30 constellations that are visible in the Northern Hemisphere.  A 1956 planet guide was also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was adapted from the book, The Stars, by H. A. Rey (Houghton-Mifflin Co., 1952) with permission from the author and publishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
