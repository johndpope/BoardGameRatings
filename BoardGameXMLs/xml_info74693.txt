			<description>From the Game's  Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the late 15th Century, Gideon Crane a scholar, philosopher, mathematician, astrologer and poet (and some say sorceror) found, by experimentation that he could enter the dreams of his subjects, if certain conditions held.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After further experimentation he perfected the method, and began to use it to expel demons which possessed many people in those dark times, and become an exorcist (to add to his many other qualifications).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his travels, both in the realworld and in Dreamscape he encountered others who had the ability to enter another person's dream, either themselves or more often, with help from him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He set up the order of Dreamscapers, whose sworn duty was to rid the world of the demons of the night. It was found that the people who had this ability to venture into the dreams of others, most often came from ordinary walks of life, but in the Dreamscape, they became warriors of extraordinary capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was also found that there was a tendency for Dreamscapers to fall into one of 4 main classes, which became named, by Crane as follows:- Chargemaster, Dreamshaper, Dreamwarrior, and Gadgeteer. With this specialization, the Dreamscapers began to hone their abilities and found their powers to be seemingly limitless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the ages descendants of the original Dreamscapers continued their battles against demons of sleep. The period of the thirty years war across Europe and the English Civil War were particularly busy for them as indeed was the time of the Salem Witch Trials across in New England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After this time, however, apart from one or two minor surges of demon plagues' the call upon the Dreamscapers diminished, until at present there are no Dreamscapers. However, the descendants of the original Dreamscapers still have a sub-concious memory of their past exploits and all it needs is somebody who knows how to bring that subconscious memory to the conscious thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demons are beginning to creep insidiously back into the dreams of 20th Century man. A strange, enigmatic man called Gideon Crane starts to track down descendants of the Dreamscapers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
