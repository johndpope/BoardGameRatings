			<description>Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In HEXAMINOS, players must get rid of all their hexagons by placing them on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of his turn, each player gets a new hexagon in his reserve, in addition to those already acquired. The player has 2 moves per round. For his first attempt, he may decide to exchange all his hexagons by clicking on the button &amp;quot;Switch&amp;quot;. In this case, he loses his turn. Otherwise, he can place two hexagons on the board respecting the number they hold. An hexagon must reach as many hexagons already placed as its number indicates. (Example: An hexagon with the number 3 must touch 3 and only 3 other hexagons on the board.) The hexagons with no number are Jokers. They can be placed anywhere on the game board. In compensation, the player receives an additional hexagon. If a player cannot play, he passes his turn by clicking on the blue hexagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In solo mode, the player must fill the board according to the placement rules explained above. For each hexagon placed, the player gets a new one in its reserve.   A counter shows the number of spaces remaining. Try to fill everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
