							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spartacus: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Spartacus is a solo game. The player represents Crassus attempting to defeat Spartacus and his Slave Army. His objective in this is to acquire personal prestige, and so it is important to the player that Spartacus is destroyed or driven from Italy before Pompey or Lucullus arrive with their veteran armies, who will presumably make short work of the slaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
