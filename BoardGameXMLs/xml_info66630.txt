			<description>A Player's and Dm's Guide to the Radiance of the Moon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many theories as to the nature of the moon itself. Some say the moon is a great ball of pulsing fire, void of meaning or life. Others use rituals to obtain collections of the liquid known as moonwater, and so say that the the entirety of the moon must be made of the same magical liquid, floating eerily as a giant celestial raindrop. Some priests or witches see the moonlight as a blessing from an ancient goddess or other entity, and claim that she herself makes up the shape of the moon, or else that it is her domain, having long abandoned the sea of the gods in order to viscerally convey to mortals the majesty of the moon goddess. The last major speculation may well coincide with some versions of the goddess theory, and it supposes that the moon is a great, floating boulder that glows with the light of either some quantified or otherwise mysterious force. This theory is supported by the existence of the Moon Tablet: a great piece of rock upon which is written many secrets of the moon and its magics.&lt;br/&gt;The Lunar Scrolls contains 31 pages of content, including four paragon classes (a multiclass-only class combined with a paragon path), four short character stories, an epic destiny, a page of feats, two pages of magic items, six pages of rituals, and five pages of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
