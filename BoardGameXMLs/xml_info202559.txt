			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters belong to one of four archetypes (Elder, Hunter, Mystic, Guardian), each associated predominantly with one of the four classic elements.  Characters have an Attribute in each element which determines how many dice they use in a pool to resolve actions based on that element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was submitted partially incomplete; additional work would be needed before the game would be fully playable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
