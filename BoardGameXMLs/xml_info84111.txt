							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Edition Pi: Core Spells</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Edition Pi&amp;rdquo; is an attempt by me to fix several of the problems with both 3.0 and 3.5 editions. To this end the best or most hassle-free versions of different rules from these versions was used. In many cases this required some things to be changed, or new material to be added, which was not in either version of the basic rules. This project is intended to be an open-community project; at least as far as flavor text and donated artwork is concerned. In order to help meet that goal, the prices are being kept as low as I can make them, and still justify publishing the system. Essentially this means that the more people help me out with this, the less I have to charge for it. And of course, everybody who helps will receive acknowledgement for doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
