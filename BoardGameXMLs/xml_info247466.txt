							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of Zakelana (5E)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly three hundred years ago the young Zakelana was refused admission to an academy of wizards because &amp;ldquo;girls are witches and not wizards.&amp;rdquo; Undaunted, she sought impromptu lessons from adventurers while serving drinks at the local tavern. From this humble start, she became one of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest wizards.  In addition to being famous for her mastery of extra-dimensional magic, she was well known for her gift for turning foes to allies and for having a very broad definition of what counted as a legitimate target for adventuring. This approach earned her the anger of many powerful people who sent assassins or monsters to exact their vengeance. Whenever possible, Zakelana attempted to persuade any would-be killer to switch sides. The best-known example occurred when a rival mage sent a creature to torment Zakelana in her dreams. According to the tale, Zakelana was able to win over the creature with the gift of a pony named &amp;ldquo;Giggles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In her later years, she retired from adventuring and one day simply vanished. Some speculate a final experiment failed and banished her eternally to some other dimension. Another tale relates how one of her many enemies finally killed her. In any case, she vanished but left behind a tower and a magical gateway to the space containing the tower. Some tales claim that the guards of the tower are monsters Zakelana won over but could not allow to roam freely. The tales also speak of the great wealth and magical secrets within the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower of Zakelana is intended for a party of 10th-12th   level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
