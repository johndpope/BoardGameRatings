			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CDF Starfighter is a 90s styled space combat simulator which is inspired by Freespace, Star wars, Wing Commander and various sci-fi tv series such as Babylon 5, BSG, and Space : Above and Beyond. With a lot of games being dynamically generated, open world, multiplayer and stats based, CDF Starfighter offers a more scripted and controlled space combat sim with a huge focus on single player and a story-driven non-linear campaign mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire game is played out in first person from the briefings to the missions themselves.  The game offers instant action and various simulations and challenges as well as the non-linear campaign mode.  The game is designed for next gen technology and designed in every way for VR comfort, gameplay and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
