			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One-Shot Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with OSRIC, 1E and 2E game systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for 4-6 player characters of levels 4 to 6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of D&amp;ugrave;n Loachas, or Fort Valour in the Common tongue, is a walled village located in a lightly wooded area by a river. It lies in lands under the control of the city-state of D&amp;ugrave;n Bhriste (The Shattered Fort in Common). D&amp;ugrave;n Loachas is located on the borderlands between civilized nations, and while it is technically under the control and protection of The Lord of D&amp;ugrave;n Bhriste, that shining city is far away. For all practical purposes, the folk here are on their own, and must fight off the lawless groups that seek to take advantage of the gaps in authority on the borderlands. The village has seen its fair share of attacks in the past, and has a well trained militia for that very reason. The folk of D&amp;ugrave;n Loachas are proud of their role as vanguards of justice on their nation&amp;rsquo;s frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Late one night your characters come upon the village while seeking shelter at the end of the day. The guards are polite, it seems a safe place to rest, and its border location might provide some lucrative &amp;ldquo;opportunities&amp;rdquo; for adventures, so the party decides to stay the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, during their first night&amp;rsquo;s stay the city comes under attack by invaders and the party ends up pressed into service, fighting to defend the village. In fact they fight to save their own lives, as the assault force intends to leave no survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outmanned, out maneuvered and desperate, the villagers of D&amp;ugrave;n Loachas are counting on you - will you save the day?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains a completely original ONE SHOT adventure, fully detailed and ready for immediate use with very little preparation by the GM or the players! A quick night of role-playing fun right at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find amazing Old-school style art and a detailed city map of Fort Valour, tagged with all the information needed to run the adventure and detailed encounters for each area! This module also includes a fully detailed overland map of Fort Valour and its Environs, done in the Old School style, and complete with information on geography, local settlements, defenses, and areas for further exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes a carefully crafted set of SIX PREGENERATED CHARACTERS, ready for immediate use in the game by players or the GM. Each of the six players is presented fully ready to play with all of the necessary stats and gear. As a BONUS, these PCs are specially laid out so the GM can simply print out the page, cut out the sheets, hand them out and the players will be ready to go with their own handy mini character sheet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also include special addendums with detailed listings of some fantastic NEW MAGIC ITEMS and a NEW MONSTER, the HALF-ORGE, a new race for OSRIC with rules for its use as an NPC and player character race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module provides wonderful background information and additional areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in the author&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding campaign world, which now comprises FOUR different kingdoms: Jarlburgh, Alderburgh, The Red Eagle Barony, and D&amp;ugrave;n Bhriste. This adventure&amp;rsquo;s defense of Fort Valour takes place in the southernmost portion of these known lands, on the borderland with the danger filled lands to the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book features 20 pages of excitement and thrills, with multiple areas to expand your adventures, and it is sure to please discerning GMs and players everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
