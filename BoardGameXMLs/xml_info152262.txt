							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second World War at Sea: Torpedo Boats</name>
									
			<description>Between 1923 and 1945, the German Navy built a series of small destroyers called &amp;ldquo;torpedo boats.&amp;rdquo; They served as escorts, but often sailed with the cruisers and battleships in the role of fleet destroyers. A number of them appear in Arctic Convoy and Bismarck, on the small square pieces we use for minor warships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torpedo Boats is a set of 70 &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; pieces portraying every German torpedo boat that saw service in World War II, plus some that weren&amp;rsquo;t completed like the big 1941 Type boats. The pieces themselves are made with the same scorchless technology as our ultra-thick ones, but are about the same thickness as The Kaiser&amp;rsquo;s Navy (to make them blend in easier with Arctic Convoy and Bismarck) with no scorching or ash residue. All seven classes of torpedo boats built by the Germans are represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are larger alternative pieces, to replace the smaller pieces supplied with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
