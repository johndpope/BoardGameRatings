			<description>The Mighty Endeavor is the 17th game in the Standard Combat Series (SCS), and covers the Western Allied Invasion of France in 1944, the crossing of the Rhine River in early 1945 and the final push into Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can land at the places of their choosing and manner along the coast of France in an effort to liberate France and the Low Countries from German occupation and to cross the Rhine and take the German industrial cities along that river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mighty Endeavor - expanded edition is both an updated version (with errata corrected, a couple of counters added, and other counters made to conform to the Expansion) covering the Western Front from the D-Day landings until the end of April 1945 and an expansion to the original game that adds the Eastern Front from just east of Warsaw during the same time period and a small map attachment that adds the Brittany Peninsula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the same allocation of responsibilities as the game Battle for Germany (SPI, 1975), one player controls the Western Allies and the East Front Germans while the other controls the Russians and the West Front Germans. The two players compete by seeing which grouping of Allies can conquer as much German territory as possible&amp;mdash;while they also play against their opponent to stop the opposite front. Never a dull moment as both players are always playing one side or the other at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenarios start the campaign at various points and as an added feature, the game includes a 16 Dec 44 (Bulge) campaign start for the Western Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 10 to 15 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 15 miles / 24.1 Km&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Corps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents (Original edition):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;One countersheet (280 1/2&amp;quot; dual-side printed counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page SCS-specific series rulebook &lt;br/&gt;One 16-page TME specific rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents (Expanded edition):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full-color map&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 28&amp;quot; full-color map&lt;br/&gt;One 8.5 x 11&amp;quot; full-color map  &lt;br/&gt;Two countersheets (560 1/2&amp;quot; dual-side printed counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page SCS-specific v1.7 rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One 16-page TME-revised specific rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One 16-page TME-Expansion rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Two 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source: MMP website and user's description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
