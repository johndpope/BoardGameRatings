			<description>The object of the game is to go on a journey round and round any of the four circular routes and collect five picture cards from each of the wildlife, people, flowers, places and birds symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the die and move, landing on a symbol and collecting a picture.  Sometimes the picture has instructions to move ahead or back, so a player's turn isn't over until no more movements are directed.  After five of one symbol have been collected, a player is penalized cowrie shells for every future landing on that same symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who collects 25 cards and has the highest number of cowrie shells left (thus a player collecting 25 cards first is not necessarily the winner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
