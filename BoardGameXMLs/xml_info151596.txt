			<description>A 2-5 Player game that pits mobs against each other, fighting for territory while building and fortifying their own empire. This is a light resource management game with dice battling, card management, and medium to heavy card strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to take over all opposing territories or remove the other players from the game by killing them or crippling their resources/ability to the point of defeat. As one of the Gang Boss's in the game, during your turn you can assign your men into certain locations to extort money (to be used to buy or upgrade items/weapons); train your men with upgradable abilities to spy, fight, influence, or lead better; visit the black market auction with other players for high caliber items, or lead full scale attacks against others to try to overrun their businesses and territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 5 different decks (54 cards per deck) that represent different mobs, such as the Italian Mafia, Chinese Triads, Japanese Yakuza, Urban Dynasty, and Latino Cartels. In addition, other decks currently available separately are the 5-0 and the Russian Bratva.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Types of cards include Boss Cards, Recruitment Cards, Action Cards, Gear Cards, Black Market Cards, and Event Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
