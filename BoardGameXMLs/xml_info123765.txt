							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Army of the Dwarves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains stats for both standard OGL play and Feast of Crows unit conversions. Army of the Dwarves also contains expanded siege rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master craftsmen and builders, delvers into the earth, smiths of unsurpassed quality and fighters of a steadfast and strong-willed temperament the dwarves are accomplished at war but rarely muster above the surface save in times of great peril for all the lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the dwarves' battles, most of the dwarves' lives, are spent deep beneath the surface of the world, delving their homes, building their fortresses living and dying without sight of the sun. They are one with the rock, stoic, unswerving and patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greater number of the dwarves' wars are conducted in the caverns and keeps below the surface and fought against one terrible enemy only, the endless march of the goblinoids. The bitter feuds between the dwarves and the goblinoids are legendary and their battles and skirmishes in the dark heart of the world all but unceasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarves are not the speediest of combatants but they do have a mastery of crafting and technology that others lack and they have specialist tactics and methods suited to their underground battles. Neither is magic their greatest strength, though they have their faith. Dwarven battles are about taking and holding ground while making a slow, implacable advance. Steady and even progress towards a goal or the bitter holding of ground, denying even an inch to the enemy no matter how fierce the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
