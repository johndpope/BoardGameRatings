			<description>In Lifetime, each player must try to correctly estimate the lifetime of a famous person and must place a year card between the birth and death year of that person. In clockwise order, each player places one of cards at the card row in the middle of the table, taking care not to go under the birth year or over the death year of the famous person.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Whoever can't place it correctly, must take all the previously played cards. The winner is the player who either successfully places all of his cards in one round or who has taken the least cards at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
