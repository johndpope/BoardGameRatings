			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take control of a SHIELD agent and customize the agent by gaining experience, leveling up, and equipping various weapons and uniforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any given time, the player teams up with two Marvel heroes, each with unique skills and abilities. Players start with only a few heroes available, and many other heroes locked. These heroes are leveled up in a fashion similar to the main character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay itself consists of turn-based fights that pit your agent and heroes against one or more waves of one to three enemies each.  There are various side goals that can be fulfilled by assigning recruited heroes to them for a fixed period of real time.  There is also a player-vs-player battle mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses many social gaming conventions, such as time-as-resource and multiple currencies which can be purchased through micro-transactions to speed up advancement and acquisition of hero allies and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continually introduces new content, including new heroes, new special missions and new rewards for player-vs-player dueling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
