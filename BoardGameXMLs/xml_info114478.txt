			<description>Silenzio is a recation game in which a play mode is determined, then the players flip open round animal cards. Depending on the mode, either everyone has to either make the sound of the animal in the picture, or a movement, or it depends on the color of the animal card in question. The last player to do the correct action or the first player to do something wrong has to take the card. The player who gets rid of his/her cards first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
