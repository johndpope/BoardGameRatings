							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Endurance: The Fitness Game</name>
									
			<description>Endurance - The Fitness Game is designed to combine the fun of a board game with physical fitness and good nutritional information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die, move around a track and perform fitness execises for points to rid themselves of a pre-dealt set of cards.  The first person to get rid of all of his cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game cards may be gained or lost depending on certain players actions.  Coloured cards must be matched to the gray fitness cards before an exercise can be performed and the card discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endurance - The Fitness Game is a fun and interesting way to stay healthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
