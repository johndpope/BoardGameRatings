							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Find the Bug! Agile</name>
									
			<description>You play an IT professional responsible for an agile team. Using test-driven development, you will create user stories, test other players&amp;rsquo; user stories and integrate components to&lt;br/&gt;earn victory points. The game can be used to teach agile testing but also works without its theme as an economic engine game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You earn victory points in different categories but it is the points in your weakest category that determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Code is represented by colored cubes and components by tiles with slots for input code and output code. The players take turns to perform one of the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Program: Take code/s or exchange for victory points.&lt;br/&gt;2. Model: Play one user story. The expected output is chosen by you and known to all players but the required input as per the user story is only known by you.&lt;br/&gt;3. Develop: Play two input codes on Another player&amp;rsquo;s user story. If you fail, try again next turn. The other player gets codes equal to the color of the input. If you pass, you get victory points equal to the color of the output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a component is developed (i.e. both input and output is known), it becomes a component that can be integrated with other components and share code with each other so that the output of one component is used as input for other components. By integrating components in this way, you get victory points equal to the color of half the output. The bigger the module, the more victory points you earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge of Find the Bug! - Agile is to find the right code for the right user story and plan your gameplay so that the code received from your current task can be used for the&lt;br/&gt;next task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique mechanism of Find the Bug! - Agile is the way code flows between components, challenging the players not only to find the right code but also to plan forward so that they&lt;br/&gt;have the right code at the right time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
