			<description>Valor &amp;amp; Vengeance simulates the dramatic pinnacle of General Wrangel&amp;rsquo;s offensive to seize the key city of Tsaritysn (Stalingrad in WW2).Armed British manned tanks and supported in the air with the 47th Squadron, the White forces struck along the Volga River.&lt;br/&gt;Partly through deception and strategy that soaked off  the Red&amp;rsquo;s most powerful force: Budyonny&amp;rsquo;s Cavalry Corps, which had opposed the White cavalry corps&amp;rsquo; under the esteemed Mamontov up to the 29th.  Pulling back to regroup, Budyonny&amp;rsquo;s  men continued to be held in check. When Mamontov attack simultaneously on the 29th, it effectively canceled out any chance that Budyonny would be involved in the White attack from the south. Had this not happened, Tsaritsyn would have been a bloodbath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map scale is about 800 yards per hex. Each combat unit is one battalion for non-AFV units. For Tanks ,Armor cars Aircraft, each counter is one AFV\AC. For weapons, each counter is four weapons. A game turn represents TWO hours of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One 11 x 17&amp;quot; mapsheet depicting the terrain the battle was fought over&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 2 player aids for charts and tables. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One set of 280 &amp;frac12;&amp;quot; playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
