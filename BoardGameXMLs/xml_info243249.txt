			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alvin is a great arcade game.  You are commanding a highly maneuverable ship seeking to destroy several enemy cities.  You are attempting to bomb these cities while at the same time trying to avoid their defensive fire (Missile Command in reverse?).  Also, your radar has been damaged so that you can only see downwards.  This would normally not be much of a problem except that you also have to contend with high-flying enemy aircraft.  As long as you are above these aircraft you have the advantage and are safe.  However, high level bombing takes considerable skill.  Therefore to achieve your goal the best strategy is to swoop down for a bombing run while the enemy craft is out of range and quickly retreat to the skies.  A fun game.  Requires 16K.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
