			<description>You are a goblin entrepreneur who has just opened your very own drink stand - but you are not the only game in town! Fill your stockroom with ingredients to make the drinks customers crave, all the while scheming to destroy the competition. Do you have what it takes to thrive, or will you fall to your rivals' cunning? Find out in Goblinade!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblinade is a 2-4 player card game in which players collect ingredient cards in order to stock their &amp;quot;pantry&amp;quot;. Customer cards lie face up in the center of the table, each with a list of ingredients. When a player has the ingredients listed on the customer card they may collect that customer. Each customer has a point value ranging from 1 to 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game players may steal use action and reaction cards to steal ingredients or customers and sabotage other players. &lt;br/&gt;Players may choose to play to a set point value (suggested 7 points) or play until all customer cards have been collected, at which time players get one more turn. Whomever has the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
