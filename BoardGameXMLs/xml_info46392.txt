			<description>HERITAGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copyright 1975&lt;br/&gt;Charles McAllister Hall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The text below is from the introduction in the rules booklet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Genealogical Research Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Heritage&amp;quot; introduces the concept of genealogical research as a game.  One of the basic components of this game is the &amp;quot;Pedigree Card&amp;quot; shown in a diagram below.  It will be noticed that in each case the parents are to the right of their children. The Father is always on the upper line; the Mother is on the lower.  The numbering system begins with the person whose ancestry is being sought.  Number 2 on the chart is the searcher's father; Number 3 is his or her mother, etc.  It will also be noted that all male names have even numbers and all female names have odd numbers.  Another interesting fact is that each father is double the number of his child.  Hence if Number 2 is a Smith, Number 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. would also be Smiths.  This could go on indefinitely, and in spite of the infeasibility of putting 10 or 15 generations of ancestors on one chart, one can easily relate to a certain ancestor 13 generations back on one of his surname lines by the pedigree number of that ancestor.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
