			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off the Beaten Path is a collection of five short adventures for 5th Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons but can also be easily adapted for other game systems. Though stats are provided for 5th edition you can easily adapt these adventures for other game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off the Beaten Path Vol. I: The Isle of Klamacki is a perfect way to bring together a group of adventurers for the frst time that do not know one another. The players begin the adventure on a prison ship being taken to a far away island deep within the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have all been convicted of various crimes. Let your players come up with what they were rightly or wrongly convicted of. They are told they must keep a lighthouse lit for the next fve years upon the island as their punishment. A supply ship will come every six months to bring them provisions for the lighthouse. They are told to stay within the walls guarding the lighthouse and not to venture onto the island for great evil awaits them there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
