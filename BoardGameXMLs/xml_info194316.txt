			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blockade is a Game-in-a-Can scenario presented by Storyweaver Productions, and is an excellent way to start gaming in the High-Space universe. It is structured by major scenes, with key people and plot points described within each. We recommend the Game Master becomes familiar with each scene, and encourage the heroes to &amp;lsquo;go their own way.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE STORY SO FAR...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commander Alexandra Pang smiled as the Wrath of Light &amp;amp; Heat slotted into a high-altitude orbit over Sat-G3, directly eclipsing &amp;lsquo;Industrial Facility S-25&amp;rsquo;, the small Astatine processing facility operated by Smaw Commercial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Smaw facility, this is Commander Pang of the Armada warship Wrath of Light &amp;amp; Heat; you are now under blockade and will remain so until you comply with U.R.C. directive 625.8 paragraph 57.c.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just saying the words made Pang warm inside.The response came after several minutes delay. &amp;ldquo;Sturmian warship. We do not recognise your authority here... and what the hell is U.R.C. directive 625... whatever!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Received, Smaw facility. Your lack of knowledge of a legal directive does not concern me. All docked vessels, and vessels on approach, are now under blockade. All vessels on an outbound trajectory that traverses our sphere of orbit are to return to the facility. Failure to comply will be treated as a breach of this legal blockade. The Armada exercises its right to enforce U.R.C. law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Pang expected, there was a sudden rush of small craft away from the Smaw facility towards the nearest other orbital, Icecastle, a Froster Commercial owned facility.&amp;ldquo;Firing solutions coming in now, Commander,&amp;rdquo; said the weapons officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;No. Let them go. There are too many to shoot them all. It would cause problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weapons officer shrugged, wondering if the Commander was having an exceptionally good day to let these law-breakers get away...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure is a a quick diversion for your heroes&amp;hellip; An ordinary trip turns into an &amp;lsquo;interesting opportunity&amp;rsquo; when an Armada warship interdicts an Astatine processor owned by a powerful Commercial. Why are the Armada suddenly enforcing the obscure by-laws of the U.R.C.? Is this one captain&amp;rsquo;s personal agenda, or part of a larger power play? With several Commercials now involved or impacted, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see the line that separates the players from those being played. And when the lights go out, and the air starts to run out, who will think of all the lives suddenly in danger? Blockade can be played as part of the Anti-Pattern campaign for High-Space, or as a self-contained adventure for a group of timely heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
