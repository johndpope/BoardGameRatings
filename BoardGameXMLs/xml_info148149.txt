							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hatch Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hatch Room is a full-color, 20 x 20 inch, floor plan of a Hatch Room, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;WARNING! CAUTION! DANGER! Hatch room off limits. Do not approach control panel or hatch. Leave now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a small map of a hatch room leading outside the area or opens to an underground level. This product includes image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT). Visually the hatch looks rusty and worn as if it is was used for a very long time or has fallen into disuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is intended for near or far-future Science Fiction games. The weathered look of the hatch room also makes it also a fit for Horror themed Science Fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hatch can be used in many ways. It could be used an escape hatch for an escape pod. The hatch can be used as part of a spaceship, star port, or space station as an entrance to an escape pod or as an airlock used by astronauts or engineers to go outside the ship and conduct repairs. It could also be used as part of the space station or a terrestrial facility that is used to seal a lower level or secret area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One adventure could be the group finds a derelict space station or an abandoned planet side facility. They explore the old, rusted, and dilapidated facility (the rusty side of our Sci-Fi Tiles can be used for this part) and at the end they find the hatch. A robot attempts to stop them from entering the area and opening the hatch, at first nonviolently, and then becoming aggressive if they approach the control panel or the hatch itself. Once the robot is offline or out of commission, they can open the hatch. When they open the hatch they find robots much like the first, but they behave much more aggressively, trying to kill them on sight. As they progress through the area, they eventually find a powered down computer room. If they manage to get the power back online, they find it has a killer AI and it activates several defensive systems externally and puts up several firewalls. If they can hack the AI, they can find out what happened to the space station or the facility and also may be able to find information worth thousands of credits. The group finds out that the AI took over the facility or ship, but the crew of the facility or ship managed to hack into one of its robot drones, ordering it to shut off the power to the area, and then guard the hatch. Video recordings show that the AI slaughtered the entire crew of the station before the robot managed to turn the power off to the section, escape, and seal the hatch. The group finds plans for the construction of the computer and the robots that may be valuable to the right buyer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
