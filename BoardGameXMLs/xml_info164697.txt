							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rumplebum Academy for Bug-Based Baking</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the Rumplebum Academy for Bug-Based Baking! You have enrolled at the finest culinary school for young Trolls in all the Kingdoms! Under the guidance of Chef Cordelia Rumplebum, you will be taught the fine art of baking delicious foods with only the finest ingredients: crunchy, juicy, savory bugs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rumplebum Academy for Bug-Based Baking is a lighthearted memory and set-collection game. The players are trolls who are going out into the forest to turn over rocks, looking for bugs. They'll use those bugs in the recipes they bake back at the school. But they'd better be careful, because sometimes they'll turn over a Knight who might attack! Then again, they might find a beautiful Princess to help with the next dish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
