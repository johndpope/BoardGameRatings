							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WorldWise Geography Card Game: USA</name>
									
			<description>A simple but effective series of games for learning the exact whereabouts of countries, oceans, and seas around the globe. Each player is dealt ten cards. The top card on the draw pile is flipped over to begin the play. Moving left, the next player has to play a card that borders the card on the top of the play deck. If a player does not have the necessary card, there are some other options. The player can bluff, or other players can call the bluff. Either the bluffer of the questioner will have to draw cards, depending on the card that was played. The player can also play a wild or a super wild card if they have one. Wild cards restart the play deck and super wilds can be designated by the player as any card from the deck &amp;ndash; and the next card played would have to border this card. First player out of cards wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
