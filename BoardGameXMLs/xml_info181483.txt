			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Emergency! Operations teams Alpha, Beta and Gamma to the briefing room! Prepare to intervene on the timeline! GRAmel's line of time travel adventures takes you through the mists of time to stop chronoterrorists, prevent time anomalies and save the continuum from obliteration! The Tomorrow Bomb: Kaboom! Second World War. With a single atomic explosion London is wiped out by the Luftwaffe, during the Battle of Britain. But, wait a minute, the Nazis aren't supposed to have an atomic bomb! The Operatives are engaged in a race against time (no pun intended) to save the whole of modern history! Nazis, heartless killers, a trickster from the past, and the shadow of atomic annihilation await the players in this scenario. The Mirrors of Carthage: A mysterious temporal anomaly is detected by TimeGuard in Syracuse, Italy, 212 BC, just a few days before the famous battle in which Archimedes, the mathematical genius, was killed. Is it just a natural phenomenon, or something darker happening in the far past? Sieges, battles, forbidden cults, and the subtleties of Roman politics await the Operatives in the age of the Punic Wars! Sunday Files Expansion - Inventors of the Timeline: In this expansion you'll find useful information about the Patent Office, a special branch of Timezero which must watch over the greatest minds of the timeline. In this appendix are detailed several known and unknown inventors of human history, men and women who with their discoveries greatly furthered the advance of mankind. These same people, if not monitored and controlled, could wreak havoc throughout the entire continuum! In addition there are special rules tweaks to help you play an inventor-type Operative!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
