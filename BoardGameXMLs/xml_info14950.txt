			<description>Kung Fu Dice is a Free Game (downloadable pdf from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.deep7.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.deep7.com&lt;/a&gt;, go to site map and then Free Downloads) of kung fu dice combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;A fast and furious dice game where you pit luck and skill against your worthy opponent. Includes easy to learn rules to get you started in about 5 minutes, as well as more advanced play variations for when you're ready to become a Kung Fu Master! And talk about affordable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using six-sided dice to represent limbs and a 4 sided die to represent avoidance, players roll together and compare the values.  Matched values are removed and remaining values are scored as hits (minus the value of the 4 sided die.)  Weapons are represented as special 6 sided dice that can only be countered by other weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple, fast game of luck.  A few optional rules exist that add a tiny bit of strategy.  All in all, a decent combat system for an ultra-light RPG, or a fun way to batter one another without thinking hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
