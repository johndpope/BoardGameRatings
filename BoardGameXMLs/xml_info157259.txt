			<description>A print'n play, pit and peebles inspired African themed game. During the medieval times, kingdoms and empires rise and fall in the African continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is simple, it uses a mancala/oware/awele style mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player, take control of one of the four kingdoms, rise, expand, and collect resources before falling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will do so using a &amp;quot;pit and pebbles&amp;quot; gaming mechanic, sowing your cubes and harvesting with the last cube you sow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also use cubes from new comers (Europeans, Chinese, Persians, Arabs...) as Africa become a land of conquest. &lt;br/&gt;You can sow and harvest player cubes with these cubes, but you can't harvest new comers' cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So new comers will slowly gain control of the land as players use them, and players' kingdoms will fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, when there are no more players cubes, the winner is the player who has harvested the most cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 2-4 players, from 6 y.o. The board is language independent, rules are in French, soon in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
