							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Genre Compendium Volume I</name>
									
			<description>Full title: Fantasy Genre Compendium, Volume I: Species, Professions, Gear, Magic and more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a big long title like this, you will likely guess that this book is for fantasy roleplaying. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s for &amp;ldquo;fantasy,&amp;rdquo; but we wanted &amp;ldquo;fantasy&amp;rdquo; to be more than crawling through corridors, hurling fireballs, crossing swords, and killing monsters. That is why our fantasy is a bit different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Fantasy Genre Compendium, we talk about present fantasy as a genre in literature, comics, and film, but also rooted deeply in folklore and fairytales. Now, this genre is coming to the Cartoon Action Hour rules system, an Origins Award-nominated roleplaying engine known for quick and easy gameplay, using only a 12-sided die for all actions. The rules of Cartoon Action Hour have been specifically licensed from Spectrum Games for this project, and the highest amount of attention has been paid to a full compatibility of the compendium with the Cartoon Action Hour rulebook, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FGC Vol. I is lavishly illustrated by highly skilled fantasy artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FGC Vol. I is also the first roleplaying game book that uses photographs of painted miniatures as illustrations. The miniatures shown are high-quality resin figures by Fenryll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
