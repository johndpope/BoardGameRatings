							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lump Hag</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster of the Week product line takes its inspiration from the television trope of the same name: a convention by which a weekly television production might introduce a new freak, villain, or beastie in every episode, allowing the episode&amp;rsquo;s themes and topics to revolve around the latest &amp;ldquo;big bad.&amp;rdquo; Monster of the Week aims to arm GMs with creatures and villains perfect for such a role. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to populate a memorable encounter or a villainous story arc, our Monster of the Week is made for maximum creepfactor and memorable &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this installment&amp;rsquo;s pages you will find the true and terrible description of the lump hag &amp;ndash; a twisted crone with tragic origins. Disquieting and gruesome in the extreme, the lump hag makes an excellent choice for horror-themed adventures and encounters, as well as those designed to illicit feelings of uneasiness in your players. The lump hag might also serve well for certain sorts of mystery adventure, as each hag might incorporate elements of local history into the truth of her own origins. Take a seat by the fire and read on, my friends, and hear the tale of a once-lovely lass turned mindlessly-miserable, hunchbacked old crone; a tragic hag whose doom she inherited from her equally-monstrous mother&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
