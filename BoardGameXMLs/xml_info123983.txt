			<description>This is a Subbuteo replica using the HW miniatures of the 70s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains everything you need to play the good old Subbuteo, two teams with &amp;quot;moulded-type&amp;quot; miniatures (blue team and red team), two goals, two white balls and a cotton made soccer pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Subbuteo, the rules here are alla about the flicking with your fingers of miniatures depicting actual football players. Any miniature can touch the ball no more than 3 times, after that you have to use another miniature. If another your miniature touches the ball, the previous miniature regains the maximum touches avalaibility. If you miss the ball, or this touches any of the other side's players, the ball possession passes to the adversary. Other rules include details to address situations like penalties, off-sides, free-kicks and such. This is after all a total Subbuteo-clone even in the popular ruleset that, from the 70s, has seen little or no change at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone not happy with the new Subbuteo 2012 edition can still buy this one then!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
