			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventuring Party is approached by a noblewoman to locate her fianc&amp;eacute;e who has not yet returned from an expedition into the hill country. After tracking him to the secluded house of a legendary mystic, the PCs are encouraged to &amp;ldquo;prove their worth&amp;rdquo; - if successful, they willl discover what has happened to the lost fianc&amp;eacute;e and obtain the riches he sought. In so doing they must solve a series of puzzles involving magic mirrors and battle Evil Twin versions of themselves. Just when they thought it was time to claim their reward, they discover that the mystic was really a necromancer who has summoned Allips (spectral remains of those who commit suicide) to block their escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for 4 characters of levels 7-9 with sufficient experience points awarded that characters should be able to advance one level at its conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
