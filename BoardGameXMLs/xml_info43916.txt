							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Odd Lots</name>
									
			<description>You are a member of the Odds &amp;amp; Sods Club, a group of eccentric billionaires (are there any other kind?) who spend their considerable leisure time at police auctions looking for their favourite Objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lots at police auctions are a mixed bag; each contains some things you like a lot and some things you&amp;rsquo;d rather not have. Of course, you don&amp;rsquo;t go to the auctions yourself (people would talk); you send a servant over with instructions to bid so much and not a penny more. And if you lose out to one of your clubmates...well, you&amp;rsquo;re ashamed to admit it but you might be a bit of a sore loser...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the year, you want to end up with as much of your favourite stuff as possible. Still, it is important to have a balanced collection, too. Oh, and while you&amp;rsquo;re at it: try not to spend as much money as the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Odd Lots is a self-published game which (I hope) will debut at Origins 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
