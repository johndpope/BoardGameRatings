							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">At Neuve Chapelle</name>
									
			<description>At Neuve Chapelle provides a tactical re-play of the World War I battle. The British attempted to reduce a poorly-defended German salient centered on the town of Neuve Chapelle. Plans were to expand a breakthrough and with cavalry and infantry reserves take the Aubers ridge line. However, poor communication and coordination and the weather conspired to slow the initial British successes and allowed the German army to rush reinforcements into the area. Among other game features, designer Michael W. Kennedy uses offensive artillery and defensive artillery fire, British command checks, and a unique assault combat mechanic to simulate the bloody struggle. (Sourced from the White Dog Games website.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a series of 14 turns which represent the three days of The Battle of Neuve Chapelle. Each day is divided into four turns with a separate night turn in between. During the day turns, both sides will fire artillery (weather permitting), move, and attack. During the night turns, both sides will dig in new trenches on the new front lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game simulates early trench warfare and makes prominent use of artillery and the defensive advantages of trenches. Weather conditions and British communications among the four divisions are determined randomly each turn. Each assault phase contains a defensive artillery and defensive combat phase, making defense a major component of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several hexes that have victory point values. The British win by controlling as many of these hexes as possible. The Germans win by preventing the British from achieving this objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
