			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in this game are Romans, doomed to repeat the same day over and over again - unfortunately, it's the day they all died in a volcano eruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have two Attributes (Physical Capacity and Mental Capacity).  These Attributes determine how many Skills a character may have in that area.  Skills are determined by the player during play, not selected during creation (most of the game is determined through play).  Each Skill has an associated color Rank.  In opposed actions, the higher color Rank automatically wins.  In a tie, each Rank also has an associated number (1-10) and the highest number wins.  However, the opponents then switch numbers.  Thus, e.g. two &amp;quot;Blue Rank&amp;quot; characters engaged in a lengthy series of opposed actions will switch back and forth in victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the game was published as a series of forum posts, each containing elaboration of a portion of the game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
