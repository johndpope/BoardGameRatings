			<description>This simple children's game from the Clementoni Young Learners series of games is based on dominoes. The playing pieces consist of a starting piece  (a crossroads with 4 roads leading from it and attached spinner) and 24 domino-like tiles with 2 vehicles on each of varying types and colors. To start the game each player is dealt an equal number of the vehicle tiles and the crossroads is placed in the centre of the table. The players then take turns spinning the spinner, and must attempt to place one of their tiles on whichever of the roads is pointed to. Tiles placed must match either the color or type of the vehicle currently at the end of this road. The winner is the first player to get rid of all of their tiles. Some strategy is provided by one of the tiles being a police car which can be placed at any time and permanently blocks off the road it is player on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
