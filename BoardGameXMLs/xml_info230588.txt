			<description>All that exists of this game is the board.  It is not known whether their was a spinner or die/dice were used to move the players along. Number of players is unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game looks to be about the Spanish American War (the enemy flags are Red and Yellow, similar to the Spanish Flag of the time). The theater could reflect the battle for Cuba. Possibly reflecting the Naval battle of Santiago Bay in the lower center and San Juan Hill as the final point the players are trying to attain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
