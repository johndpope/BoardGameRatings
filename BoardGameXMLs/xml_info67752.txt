							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ogre City of Drahk&#039;Suhl</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my experience, ogres are stupid, lazy creatures possessing little more than a rudimentary intelligence.  They are nothing more than brutal killers, scavengers, and raiders, with a dim-witted hatred of anything resembling civilization.  However, I once overheard two of them speaking among themselves of a legendary city, a place where ogres and their kid could meet and trade without fear of harassment from the more &amp;quot;civilized&amp;quot; races.  They named this place Drahk'Suhl - a city hidden beneath the ancient shoulders of a dormant volcano, at a gateway to the Lower Earth.  At that moment I vowed that I would find the legendary Drahk'Suhl, or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I found Drahk'Suhl infamous among giant races, a place where traders swap weapons and booty, where food and drink are plenty, where underlings do one's every bidding, and where gladiator pits slake the most bloodthirsty appetite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One might say the opportunity for adventure in such a place is great.  But this is true only for those with a brave heart, a keen wit, and cunning wiles...a person such as myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
