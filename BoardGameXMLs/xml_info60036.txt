			<description>Despite the name, this is a dice game, involving rolling six dice to simulate an 18 hole, Par 72 round of golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by a leather goods company in Milwaukee, WI, this dice game was not widely published outside of the Midwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanism for scoring a hole is based upon a couple of factors, including the number of shakes of the dice that it takes to roll a result which meets this criteria, setting aside the desired  par dice after each shake:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Par 3: 3 threes&lt;br/&gt;Par 4: 4 fours&lt;br/&gt;Par 5: 5 fives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player rolls this result on the first shake, it's considered a hole-in-one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player rolls three &amp;quot;jumping jacks&amp;quot; during a single shake it is also considered completion of a hole. If this takes one shake it is also a hole-in-one, if two it is worth a score of two on a hole, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there are also &amp;quot;red joes&amp;quot;. These cancel par dice and jumping jacks when three are rolled in one shake, and the player is issued a penalty stroke due to being in a hazard. For example, if this occurs on an initial shake, the player earns two strokes for that shake instead of the usual one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scores are tallied for 18 holes, based upon the par rating for each hole on the scorecard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
