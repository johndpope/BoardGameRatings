			<description>From the Game Manual:&lt;br/&gt;Rowan's Battle of Britain is one of the most ambitious simulations of aerial war ever produced. A player can take the role of a commander on either side of the conflict and can follow the entire campaign from July 10th to September 15th 1940, or can take part in one of twenty-eight specially designed individual flying missions. Some of the Luftwaffe's 1,000 aircraft raids are reproduced, affording a unique insight into what it might have been like flying against, or with, such numbers of aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 'Campaign' Mode the player can select one of four starting points to enter the air war. The campaign begins with attacks on British coastal shipping by the Luftwaffe, who then move on to attacking radar installations, coastal facilities and airfields.&lt;br/&gt;This is followed by concentrated attacks against the RAF&amp;rsquo;s major airfields and aircraft factories, which leads on to the final showdown during the 'Blitz' of London in September 1940. Players can take the role of a commander dealing with the strategic overview of the conflict using authentic campaign maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
