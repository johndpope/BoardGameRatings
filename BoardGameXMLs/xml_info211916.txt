							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Restoration of Ilkannon</name>
									
			<description>The ruins of Ilkannon have been discovered! After being lost for centuries, you now have a chance at learning about the heart of that mythic civilization! Choose your character and begin your adventure into the wilds! But watch out! The curse which brought Ilkannon to ruin is still housed within its walls! Restore the city - but make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t unleash corruption upon the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play one of four characters: An adventurer, a politician, a scholar, or a mechanic. Each person has their own goals within the city, and each one has their own faults that make them susceptible to various curses. The ultimate end goal is to find four power crystals to revitalize the city or to find one item to bring back to tell of their great discovery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four main stats which each character has: Corruption Resistance, Movement, Restoration, and Ingenuity.  Corruption Resistance is how susceptible a character is to the dark forces still at work in Ilkannon.  This is used mostly during events.  Movement is how far the character can move on their turn.  Restoration is how many tiles a character can restore on their turn.  Ingenuity is used for events, and is based on how well the character deals with certain situations outside of their normal state.  Corruption Resistance and Ingenuity affect how many dice the character rolls during certain events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Ilkannon is composed of sixteen tiles, laid out in a grid of four by four.  These tiles are double sided, with one side being Wilderness and the other side being the Restored city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn order is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Move or Restore&lt;br/&gt;2) Draw an Event&lt;br/&gt;3) Corruption activates. This only happens once part of Ilkannon is Restored. If no tiles are Restored, Corruption sleeps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
