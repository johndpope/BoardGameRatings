							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Order: The World Domination Game</name>
									
			<description>New Order is a fun and exciting card game for 2-4 players of 12+ years old, and it is all about conspiracy theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In New Order each player is a leader of his own secret society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For hundreds of years these organizations have been fighting relentlessly to control hearts and minds of humanity. Each society tries to attract as many famous and powerful people as possible to join its cause.Why? Obviously, to be the first one to establish the New World Order on the Earth! &lt;br/&gt;And to do that you've got a whole arsenal of methods: bribe the leaders and ruin your opponents' negotiations, use blackmail and cover up your tracks, impose sanctions and wreck havoc on global financial markets. By all means you've got to reach your goal, and failure is not an option! Long live the NEW WORLD ORDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn:&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of 3 rounds. Each round players draw cards from the Characters deck and try to convince these characters to join their secret societies.&lt;br/&gt;The player, who goes first, is called active, and he or she turns the top card from the Characters deck, corresponding to the number of current round, face-up. Then the Negotiation phase begins. &lt;br/&gt;Negotiation phase is the main phase of the game. Players draw cards to facilitate recruiting, play Event cards to ruin their opponents' plans, and so on...&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;After the Negotiation phase the next player clockwise becomes the active player. When the 3rd round Characters deck is depleted, the game ends. A player who managed to collect the most Influence points total on his Character cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One game takes about 30-60 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
