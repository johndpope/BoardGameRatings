			<description>From their Web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dash and Percival Robber, owners of the Robber Rubber Chicken Company, makers of fine novelty goods have been murdered on their island mansion. Who did it? There are only eight of you on the entire island?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Jenkins Jenkins: Loyal English butler. His last master was a member of Parliament before his untimely death in London. Jenkins keeps to himself, just like a man who might have something to hide.&lt;br/&gt;    Mary Maide: The brothers' young maid. It would sometimes take her an hour or more to wake up Dash in the morning. He must have been one sound sleeper.&lt;br/&gt;    Dr. Rex Kilpatient: Well-to-do and handsome, Dr. Kilpatient likes excitement in his life: Fast cars, exotic vacations and the wild living. He says he is at the island to give Percival his check-up, but is that the whole story?&lt;br/&gt;    Tony &amp;quot;The Knife&amp;quot; Rigatoni: His nickname doesn't come from the the Swiss Army Knife he always carries with him and no one is completely sure why he is on the island, except of course Tony.&lt;br/&gt;    Genevieve La Vamp: When Dash jilted her last week, she threatened to murder him. Funny, she was invited to the island by Dash's brother, Percival.&lt;br/&gt;    Tom Peeper: The Robber Rubber Chicken Company's lawyer. A real prince of a guy with $800 binoculars for &amp;quot;bird watching.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Myron Smith: The Robber Rubber Chicken Company's accountant. Ever heard of keeping two sets of books? Ha! Myron has a set for every day of the week.&lt;br/&gt;    Ruby Robber: The brother's niece, only surviving relative, and since both brothers are dead, heiress. And there is the matter of that ruby that was stolen from the museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    8 invitations to mail to your guests.&lt;br/&gt;     1 cassette tape to set the mystery up and guide you along. (A script of the tape is also provided in case you do not have a cassette player handy.)&lt;br/&gt;     8 Character Packets which contain the information for each of your guests.&lt;br/&gt;    4 evidence baggies containing actual physical evidence your guests will want to examine. These include the two torn playing cards found on the dead bodies, a buffalo nickel (of all things... hmmm.) and an interesting letter found folded up in Percival's pocket.&lt;br/&gt;    Other supporting materials, including a map of the island, a floor plan of the house, a timeline of events, etc.&lt;br/&gt;    Nametags for your guests with their character's name.&lt;br/&gt;    Game instructions for the host and the guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
