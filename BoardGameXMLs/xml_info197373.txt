			<description>A party game for people who like to tell stories that make no sense. For two players or more, but best with at least three, players tell the story according to the image on the card they play. Players can sabotage other players by killing cards in their hands, reversing the order of play, making them miss a go altogether, etc. There's no text, leaving the images totally open to interpretation, and the winner is the first person to lose all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
