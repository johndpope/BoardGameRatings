			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third installment in Konami's famous series of dating simulation games. Tokimeki Memorial 3 retains the same game system as in the previous games, adding the aspect of choosing what to wear for the dates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player simulates 3 years of high school, and may each week choose what to concentrate on: Studies of various kinds, socializing, exercising, polishing his face, etc. Depending on what the player chooses, different stats will rise and sink, and depending on these stats, random &amp;quot;encounter&amp;quot; events with girls will occur. The player can then phone the girls he's encountered and invite them to dates, on which he might or might not impress the girl. The goal is to have one of the girls confess her love as the three high school years are at an end. However, Tokimemo 3 did not have the kind of intern parody humour as the first game did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokimeki Memorial 3 featured full 3D cel-shaded graphics, and an improved system from Tokimeki Memorial 2, allowing the in-game characters to actually say the player's name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
