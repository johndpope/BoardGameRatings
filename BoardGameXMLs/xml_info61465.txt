							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Summoner&#039;s Keep</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture This...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs have demolished your home-brewed dungeon and haughtily look upon the treasure trove. The group's rogue walks briskly around the riches and looks back with a wink, confirmation that no traps exist. How sweet the spoils of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the PCs stumbles upon a mundane-looking key amidst the coin and widgets. Surprised, she calls upon the band's wizard to discern its properties and sadly, the key is not magical. It must open a portal or box within the dungeon. The PC picks up the key. With a flash, the group is ripped from their skins and hurtled through magical veins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sand Begins to Fall...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are faced with the dangers of a strange desert keep and must discern clues to a strange riddle while being assaulted by exotic monsters, difficult terrain and time itself. The PCs have entered The Summoner's Keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will You Survive...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summoner's Keep is a one-night adventure that combines unique role-playing with a ton of innovative combat encounters. The module continues LichHaven's Campaign SideKick Series and is intended to be thrown at a party of unaware adventurers during an existing storyline. It is intended for 6th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
