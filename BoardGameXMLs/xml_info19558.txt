							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellbinding</name>
									
			<description>Spellbinding is a word game where the objective is to successfully identify a scrambled word while in the center space on the board and controlling the dice. The board consists of three concentric circles, divided into spaces, and a large center space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player is in control of the dice, the player to his right is the SPELLBINDER. The SPELLBINDER is the game's arbiter. His duties are as follows: he selects a card from the deck; he scrambles the letters of a word on the card, which is indicated by the board or the second die; he presents that scrambled word; he determines who is the first to correctly identify the word (and whether a tie has taken place). The other players have one minute to identify the word. The first to identify the word gains (or keeps) control of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;If no player correctly identifies the word, play continues to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This process continues until a winner is determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
