			<description>This unusual game contains cards which show clothes, two dice and a rotary clothesline on which the cards are &amp;quot;hung up to dry&amp;quot; with clothes pins. Each player gets an additional card with a child wearing four pieces of clothing and has to find them on the lines. But the cards can only be taken off the side facing the player, and he or she can only see the back side of these. In each turn, a regular and a color die are rolled. The rotary line is rotated by as many sides as the regular die determines, then a card with a pin in the color die's color can be taken off. So it's all about memorizing where which piece is. The first player to collect all four cards of a set is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
