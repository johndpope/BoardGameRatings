			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well met, Friend! Have you heard about this chap named Joe from Throwing Dice Games? He was telling me all about Joe's Book of Enchantment. I haven't stopped telling people all about him and his new product. I mean, he's a great guy and all, but he seems to think people care about enchanters. Ha! Those poor, misguided wizards who prey on the weak willed! No upstanding adventurer would travel with their likes. As much as I liked the guy I just had to feel sorry for him and his misguided product. I mean, Joe's Book of Enchantment makes using enchantment magic more attractive if you choose to believe the hype. (Isn't marketing just another Enchantment effect?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you look like someone who agrees with me. Who needs eight prestige classes focused on creating or preventing Enchantments? Who needs over 70 new Enchantment spells or over 30 new magic items and abilities? I suppose the new uses for skills could benefit everyone. And I guess that out of the more than 20 feats, many are useful for non-Enchanters. However, only a DM would care about the 10 new creatures and one new template or the sample NPCs and Organizations. Although thinking about it now, crafty adventurers may gain some insight from them. I did like the non-magical perfumes and additional bardic music. Most unsettling though is his tendency to tinker with the rules. What are Composite Skills, Feat Templates, Charm Tokens, Magic Item Abilities and Colossal+n Creatures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
