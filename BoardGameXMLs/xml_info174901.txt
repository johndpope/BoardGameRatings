			<description>Anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase. &lt;br/&gt;On this game a card is drawn. All players, at the same time, should try to write as many words as they can using all the letters that are shown in the card. Whoever makes more words, gains more points!&lt;br/&gt;Some words are easy to make, but there are others that will demand more knowledge and memory effort from your part.&lt;br/&gt;A very dynamic and challenging game where you will want to defy your knowledge every time a new card is drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
