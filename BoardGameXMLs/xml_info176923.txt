							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coal City</name>
									
			<description>What a nice city with its mines, its citizens and its corruption&amp;hellip;?;&lt;br/&gt;So you are in Coal City. As you understand from the name, this city will never run out of coal. But what happens with all the other necessary resources? These are located at distant stations and the price is tempting. You assume the role of a rich coal mine owner who lives in the city. So put your train in action and collect those resources before the others! Then you will have the opportunity to raise your status in town with many ways. Some of you will choose the legal way and deliver those resources to the city while others will keep them for their own benefit or to make conspiracies with powerful people. Each one of you will find his way to raise his status in order to ensure the power of the city. The corruption, the outlaw activities and the antagonism have their honorary position in this city. Good luck to you all and watch your back&amp;hellip;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
