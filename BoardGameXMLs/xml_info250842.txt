							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kaiinese Drakeling</name>
									
			<description>A Cugel-Level Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our rogues are back in Kaiin after adventures in the Scaum Valley (or some other locale) and looking for a base. However, finding a secure dwelling in Kaiin is not as easy as one might hope &amp;ndash; as landlords are penurious, slow to perform maintenance, and quick to find reasons to expel tenants who prove to be of unsound character. Of course, various ruins may be occupied on the outskirts of town, but self-appointed patrols of &amp;lsquo;Occupancy Monitors&amp;rsquo; (semi-organized thugs) charge a high fee - and deal out rough justice to those who resist. A solution is at hand: Nerijs, the &amp;lsquo;owner&amp;rsquo; of the Odkin Prospect Hotel2, has two important issues he needs help with, and requires a bold and unknown (to the folk of Kaiin) group of resourceful adventurers to aid him. Firstly, he is having trouble with a particular bunch of residents, and wants them out - and will welcome more reliable persons in their place. Secondly, he and three friends have been working on a daring plan that they hope will change their fortunes forever. Below (Scene 1) we detail several options as to how the PCs may connect with Nerijs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
