			<description>An instructional race game from start to panel number 42, illustrating the Exhibition at Crystal Palace 1851.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2-6 player game. Order of play is determined by throwing a die. Each player is given a different colored counter and 4 tokens which he throws into the pool when required to do so. There are 22 country squares which are put in a pool. When a player reaches a space marked PRIZE, he draws from the pool the ticket with the same number and also the name of a nation. The game ends when a player arrives at spot number 76, which must be reached by exact roll. Players overshooting the end game spot pay 3 tokens to the pool and go back to number 50.
