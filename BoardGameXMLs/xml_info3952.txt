							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quad Checkers</name>
									
			<description>Quad checkers is an abstract strategy game where 4 players move small discs on an 8x8 board, attempting to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; an opponent's pieces. It is very similar to the basic Checkers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, players may only move in a diagonal direction. If a player's piece cannot move to a square, as an opponent's piece is occupying it, the piece is instead moved to the following diagonal square and the opponent's piece is removed from the board (captured). If the following space has another piece in it, the aforementioned move cannot be made. If, in capturing a piece, you are in a position to capture another piece, you may do so until no further pieces can be captured. This is the only time multiple moves may be taken per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quad Checkers differs from the original game in that, adjacent to each edge of the board, is an additional 8x3 grid. This is the starting point of the playing pieces for each of the 4 players. From here, pieces move out into the main grid where the competitive play takes place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is lost for a player if he/she cannot move or if all of his/her pieces are eliminated from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
