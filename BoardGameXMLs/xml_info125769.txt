			<description>Motor racing game published in the P&amp;ouml;ppel-Revue magazine, Issue 72.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The track is marked in small squares. Each player uses a different coloured pencil. In a turn you can set your speed, which starts at 1. This lets you move one square. On subsequent turns you can increase or decrease your spped by 1. So a car travelling at speed 3 may, next turn, go down to 2, go up to 4, or to stay at 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your move is drawn on to the board, so different colored pencils or pens is essential. All movement must be in a straight line for each move, so you can only change direction on your next throw, and so on. Thus, it is possible to crash if you go too fast around a corner. Forward planning is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The torturous track is, in effect, a figure of eight. First car home, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
