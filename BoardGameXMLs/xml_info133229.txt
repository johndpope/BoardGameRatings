							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superbike Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race on 12 of the world's most exciting Grand Prix courses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your 1000cc Superbike growls and rumbles beneath you...the starter's flag slices through the air...and off you roar on the ride of your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Superbike Challenge, you'll race at heartpounding speeds of up to 200 mph as you battle to take--and hold--the lead against superb riders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge a friend. You'll each have your own bikes...your own instruments...and your own screen. Or race against the computer--perhaps the toughest competitor you'll ever face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lean into the turns, screaming your way around 12 of the world's most famous Grand Prix courses. From Austria's Salzburgring to Silverstone of Great Britain...Belgium's Spa to France's Bugatti. Each with its own authentic layout, its own distinctive scenery. But who has time for sightseeing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll be too busy keeping an eye on your hard-riding competitors. Plus the on-screen instrument panel that shows your speed, RPM, lap times, race position and the course layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, you'll need to maneuver your Superbike as you hurtle along: accelerating, braking, shifting gears up or down, steering with your body. (But look out: Lean too much--or too little--and you'll wipe out!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start by sharpening your riding skills. Then, prepare to take on all 12 Grand Prix courses...and prove that you're the Superbiker the world's been waiting for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 Or 2 Players. (Twin screens let you each have your own perspective.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 Or 6 Superbikes in each race. (The computer controls the ones that you don't.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Keyboard or joystick control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3 Levels of challenge: Beginner, Pilot, and Pro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Save features lets you take a break between races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     12 authentic International Grand Prix courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
