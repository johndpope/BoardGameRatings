							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Full Metal Conquête</name>
									
			<description>Published in Backstab magazine n&amp;deg;43 (March/May 2003 - FC Publications [Asmod&amp;eacute;e / Halloween Concept]) as an homage to the original and very rare game Full Metal Planète.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 years after the mineral gold rush from the Full Metal Planète game, the spacecrafts are returning to the mother planet only to reach it after a nuclear war that devastated the Earth. Instead of joining forces, the 2 groups continue their rivalry in trying to save the remaining survivor who are hidden in bunkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Metal Conqu&amp;ecirc;te allows 2 players to try to save survivors on a devastated Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no change in the rules. Water was replaced by radioactivity, but everything works the same with different names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map is 13 x 30 hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the game (i.e. rules, counters, map) is on the central poster of the magazine. Counter must be glued on cardboard and cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is produced in French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
