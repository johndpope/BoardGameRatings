			<description>With no two games ever the same, The Grid is a dynamic card-driven game for 2 to 4 players set around one of the most intriguing, disruptive and unnerving breakthroughs of the 21st century: self-aware Artificial Intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a world-leading scientist, you race your fellow researchers to take control of the Grid: a set of technological pillars that once discovered, will lead to the first true AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, you do not only compete with others. In an unusual twist, you also face off against a fledgling, rapidly-evolving AI who also seeks to command the Grid - the very parts that make up its being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To take on The Grid, you&amp;rsquo;ll research 12 critical technologies like robotics and cognitive science, protect them from AI attack with firewalls, manipulate The Grid to claim a strategic advantage, or reclaim a pillar overrun by the awakening artificial force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your mission to harness AI, you&amp;rsquo;ll use Development cards to give you research-enabling brain power or influence. But your fate is not entirely in your hands; progress will continually be shaped by Contingencies that reveal unexpected traits within yourself, deliver useful power-ups to accelerate research or introduce game-changing events - such as AI Attack - that can instantly change the balance of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path to AI supremacy is clear. Collect tech and victory tokens as you research technology pillars, or overtake them from opposing forces. Complete critical secret missions that strengthen your claim of AI control. Once the Grid is fully developed, the scientist with the most points has won, unlocking the infinite potential of AI for all of humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be careful not to focus too much on the scientific rivalry. The juvenile AI also seeks control of The Grid. When the time comes, put aside differences and work together to repel it&amp;hellip; or risk giving this artificial force the power to escape into the world and confront mankind with an uncertain future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you set out to master The Grid, you do so with numerous decks of exquisite cards and tokens that have been carefully crafted to immerse you in a futuristic frontier of self-aware intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight to harness the phenomenal power of The Grid. But be sure to control it&amp;hellip; or it will control you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
