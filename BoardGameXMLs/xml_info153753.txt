							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde</name>
									
			<description>Just in time for the witching hour, the vampire, the witch and the headless butler have arranged to meet in the ballroom of the villa Schauerstein &amp;mdash; but why has the mummy shown up here? And where is the witch?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde, players first construct the villa, placing the walls in the box, then sliding cardboard characters on their cardboard &amp;quot;wands&amp;quot; through some of the ten slots. This villa then has a light placed inside it before a roof is added. Each round, a player is challenged to place two characters into the center of the villa. This player moves two of the wands so that the characters inside the villa are pushed forward; she then peeks through a peephole to see whether she's correct, and if so, she gains a scoring token after other players get to verify the characters. After a player collects her third token, finish the round so that everyone has the same number of turns. Whoever has three tokens wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde includes a variant in which each round the active player is challenged to place three characters in the center of the villa (instead of two), and opponents guess whether or not this player was correct. After the active player pushes in the character wands, each opponent secretly places either a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; token in hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If the active player was right, she gains two scoring tokens while each opponent who guessed &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; earns one; if she's wrong, then each opponent who guessed &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; earns one token. The winning threshold in this variant is 8-10 tokens, depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
