							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkfast Classic Fantasy Advanced Classes: Ducks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkfast Classic Fantasy Advanced Classes: Ducks is a guide for players and Labyrinth Lords alike to introduce duck characters into fantasy adventure campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product of an ancient curse by a long-dead arch mage, ducks are small, grumpy beings with horrible attitudes and a weakness for all things magical. The real reason that the arch mage chose to turn an entire village of people into ducks has been lost in time. Most scholars claim it was an act of revenge or punishment of some kind for a rude or malicious act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ducks add a certain amount of whimsy to any adventure or campaign. Inside this class book you will find FOUR duck player character classes for Labyrinth Lord and other Basic Edition Fantasy games. You will also find a handy naming guide, a reasons for adventuring table and a quirks table. Labyrinth Lords will find handy write ups of common duck encounters and a handful of adventure seeds designed to involve duck characters in any existing fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
