			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s that you ask? What&amp;rsquo;s a Splode? Well a Splode is the most magical and cute of all the magical and cute creatures in the world! You see, few people realize that the world around us is a dark and quiet place. It&amp;rsquo;s all quite depressing actually! Thankfully for those of us that are afraid of the dark, the Splodes are here to bring music and light into our world! It&amp;rsquo;s an important job that the Splodes are eager to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, for the first time ever, a device has been invented that allows you to assist the Splodes with their important task. By interacting with the Splodes you can trigger a chain reaction of music and color that will bring life to the world around you. Do you have what it takes to assist the Splodes with their important mission?&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy all the fun game modes, random music and beautiful graphics on your iPad, iPhone 4 retina display, iPhone, or iPod Touch. Also, stay tuned for future updates featuring new music, additional game modes and other surprises!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
