			<description>From the developer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you thought Santa's elves were crazy before, just wait until you see them on vacation! The mischievous crew has escaped from the workshop to hit the sand and surf in Elf Bowling Hawaiian Vacation, and they're stirring up trouble all over the island!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your sunscreen and flip flops, these elves mean business-funny business that is! Knock down your pins...er...elves and your opponents with cool bonuses like extra speed and boxing gloves. Keep your opponents on their sun-kissed toes with dirty tricks like oil slicks, sand paper and magnets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From cruise ships to volcanic cliffs, Elf Bowling Hawaiian Vacation will take you on a crazy bowling adventure through exotic locales with the zaniest characters around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
