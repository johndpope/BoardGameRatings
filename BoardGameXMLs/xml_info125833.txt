							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carousel</name>
									
			<description>Carousel is the overarching name for a series of prototypes that played around with the same core mechanic. The concept is simple: There is no good or bad card in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card has every action on it, shuffled around a series of slots. On the center of the table there are several places, each with a number which matches one of the slots. The place in which your characters is defines the slot you can use on all your cards. You'll want to control that character to use your cards as best you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the base mechanics were set, the game went through several themes: Time travel, gangsters robbing a bank, delivering mail, delivering pizzas. It immediately made the game easier to learn since the players had a train of thought they could follow. The game adapted to each of the themes, and grew with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its latest iteration is called Multiuniversum and is going to be published by Board &amp;amp; Dice later this year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
