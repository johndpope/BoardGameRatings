							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tit Tat Toe: Marble Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a vintage Parker Brothers table game that combines pinball or pachinko with Tic Tac Toe. Judging by the art deco/American &amp;quot;streamline&amp;quot; design, the best guess would be that it dates from the mid-1930s to early 1940s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing field consists of a Tic Tac Toe grid with holes in each square surrounded with wooden pegs inserted at various points to serve as bumpers. Players alternate hitting a metal lever to launch marbles up a chute and onto the playing field in an attempt to get their marbles to settle into the squares. As with Tic Tac Toe, the winner is the first to get 3 marbles settled in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
