			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;Stolen Property&lt;br/&gt;A One-Round Shadowrun Virtual Seattle Tournament&lt;br/&gt;by Stephen W. Gabriel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;It's 6:30 AM and the ring of your phone is mixing with the sound of distant sirens and traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claudia pops ip on screen, &amp;quot;I've a job for you, som Johnson misplaced his cutlery. Go to the airport and open locker 2216. Inside is a box with the pertinent information on a datachip and a credstick with the retainer. There is also a folded up sword stand and two shuriken provided by the Johnson for the mages, althought I'm not sure what good this will do. This one is open and shut, find the sword and call me, then put the sword into locker 2216, the final payment will be waiting for you. Johnson is not interested in retribution abd he requests that this be done as neatly as possible. The total fee for this is 60k, the retainer is for 20k. You can pick up the key at the main information desk under (insert one of the character's names).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
