							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lockdown</name>
									
			<description>Note that Lockdown was originally published in pdf form as a 1st edition book and then updated to 2nd edition and republished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So your heroes have captured yet another super-villain. Where are they going to put them all? In prison, of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lockdown is a sourcebook for Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds, describing a prison for super-convicts. It details all four levels of the Buckner Ridge Superhuman Penitentiary, the first privately run super-prison. You get details on the prison's layout, operations, and staff, including its super-powered guards. Lockdown has profiles on various inmates and factions within the prison, as well as a description of the nearby town of Buckner Ridge. Lockdown saved its failing economy, but is it worth the price of having a prison full of the world's most dangerous super-criminals in its backyard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lockdown comes with numerous adventure ideas and ways to use the prison in your own Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds campaign. You can make it a background element or build an entire game where the characters are convicts! Plus, Lockdown comes with a secret: a conspiracy that could bring the prison crashing down and threaten law and order across the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that Lockdown was originally published in pdf form as a 1st edition book and then updated to 2nd edition and republished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
