			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's the 10th micro-adventure. Boy, that went quick. I allowed myself to go beyond the one-page format because I wanted to use a larger font. I'm too old to try and read a font that looks like mice ran over the paper with inky feet. Enjoy Village of the Plague Zombies. Think of a B-horror flick on a Saturday night with a big ass bowl of popcorn. That's how I see this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one from the village has been heard from in the past week. The reeve did not deliver his required amount of grain to the manor. The lord of the manor wants his grain, the folks want to know if their friends and family are safe. The guards report they have engaged walking corpses along the road. With the harvest, no one has the extra time or resources to investigate. Adventurers go forth and do what you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
