			<description>Players compete to become the new King's Engineer after the old one blew himself up. &lt;br/&gt;The goal is to win 10 points worth of challenges by assembling cards into 'Works' and entering the works in Challenges as they are dealt. Different combinations of cards produce different works. Special cards provide the opportunity to do things like add special parts and steal other characters' cards or works.&lt;br/&gt;Can you win the Tinkers' Trials to become the new King's Engineer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
