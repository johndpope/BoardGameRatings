			<description>You start with 6 elements (no, not just 4) and proceed combining them to form new ones, in order to recreate the entire known world/universe of hundreds of elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 1400+ discoverable Elements, divided in 26 Realms, but grows substantially with updates and your suggestions. In fact if you have an idea for a combination or feel that two elements should react, the game provides a direct link for the suggestion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note this game and its combinations were built from scratch and not copied from other games. Finding some key elements can be a (reasonable) challenge but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fun otherwise. A multiple hint functionality that doesn&amp;rsquo;t spoil too much of the research process and send you on the right track is available in the &amp;lsquo;World Status&amp;rsquo; page. If you are really &amp;ndash; really &amp;ndash; stuck please check the Blog. Feel like a combination should behave differently? Leave a comment in the blog!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Status Page shows the Realms and their discovered elements, also by clicking on an element tile you can see the reactions where it takes part. A scoring system is included (but completely optional, you can enjoy the game ignoring that) where you get big rewards for key elements or unlocking new realms. You can see a few &amp;lsquo;Target&amp;rsquo; elements in the scoring help page and a you get a Random Target Element of the day too !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can also see information about an element by pressing on its name on the World Status page, to open its Wikipedia page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is free with ad support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
