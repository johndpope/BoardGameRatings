			<description>DROD RPG: Tendry's Tale takes the DROD franchise in a new direction by combining the puzzling elements of DROD with the RPG fare of player stats, one-on-one monster duels, and loads of treasure for the taking. Tendry's Tale is an innovative concept that is not your typical RPG at all, but a puzzle game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Tendry, a member of the Stalwart Army, who is trapped far beneath the surface after battling a menacing Underground Empire. He might not be the ideal warrior, but he's got a lot of panache to make up for his lack in prowess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes DROD RPG different from the typical role-playing experience is that it contains no randomness. Enemy encounters, items, areas and treasures are all carefully designed to bring you a series of engaging, well thought-out puzzles that are a joy to solve. There is no grinding and each area is a completely unique experience. Movement is turn-based, and you may play as quickly or slowly as you want. Play this game to relax and contemplate, or take advantage of its large depth and optional elements of challenge and replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining DROD's straight-forward interface and flexible puzzle widgets with the staples of RPG-like play makes for a unique gaming experience. Along with a powerful level editor, online features, and an enthusiastic player community, this is a game you can enjoy for years. &lt;br/&gt;13 interlocking puzzle levels with over 350 rooms, filled with traps, secrets, and surprises. &lt;br/&gt;25 swords, shields and special items to find, each with unique capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;Many other game elements based off DROD's singular puzzle experience. &lt;br/&gt;Dozens of monster types and boss enemies with varying abilities and behavior. &lt;br/&gt;Powerful campaign editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
