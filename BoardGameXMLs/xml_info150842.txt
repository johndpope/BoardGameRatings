			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the froghemoth. These strange creatures seem like they would be more at home in a sci-fi pulp setting than the average fantasy game, and this is played up in their entry in the Pathfinder Bestiary, which teases of an alien origin. This book imagines three varieties of froghemoths that might have developed on other planets in other conditions, which can serve a fantasy campaign just as well as the original, or make for an exciting encounter should your players choose to venture beyond the stars. First is the arctic froghemoth (CR 8), the product of a frozen world, its tentacles end in barbed harpoons, and its icy breath slows those affected by it. Next is the volcanic froghemoth (CR 16), which prefers a warmer clime, and can spit globules of burning pitch that remain on the battlefield and serve as a dangerous obstacle, and which possesses a dangerous fire aura that helps protect it from its crippling weakness to cold. Finally, the deep froghemoth (CR 19) may well be the last remnant of an ancient space-faring race of proto-froghemoths who populated the stars. In addition to being more intelligent than its kin, it is much larger, with a body that sweats acid and the ability to surround itself in a cloud of deadly spores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
