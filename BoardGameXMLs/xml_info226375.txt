							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hasch&#039; mich auf der Autobahn</name>
									
			<description>Each player gets 1 car. Movement is determined by a standard die (1-6) and a color die (red, blue, green). The color die indicates the direction of movement at the crossroads (red = left, blue = right, green = any). If movement starts in a city, any direction can be chosen. There are 5 different kinds of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Hasch' mich auf ter Autobahn: The players start in the center space (Berlin) and try to catch one another. The last player on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Fuchsjagd: One player (Fox) is hunted by all the other players. The fox has to reach all cities marked with &amp;quot;F&amp;quot; to win the game. Any player who catches the fox has to assume the role of the fox, while the former fox is eliminated from the game. The last hunter wins the game, if he catches the fox before he has reached all his destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Sternfahrt: The players start from a city marked with &amp;quot;St&amp;quot;. The first player to reach the center space (Berlin) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Streckenrekord: The players starr from Berlin and try to get as far from there as possible. Each player who returns to Berlin is eliminated from the game. The last player on the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5)Grenzfahrt: The players start in a city marked with &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; and have to travel to all other cities marked with &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;. The first player to achieve this and returns to his starting city wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published between 1936 and 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
