							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raid on Tonwell</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instant Adventure for 4-6 characters levels 5-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up until two days ago, folks in the town where you've been staying only knew the nearby village of Tonwell for its magnificent cathedral. Two hundred years in the making, the cathedral is a monument to how much work and dedication a simple farming community can put into its house of worship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, Tonwell has been overrun by savage barbarians. Burning and pillaging, they struck without warning or provocation, showing no mercy but reveling in atrocity. Now there are refugees from Tonwell here on the streets, terrified and desperate. They say the barbarians raiding their village enslaved all they could, and slaughtered those they couldn't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the refugees, a priest named Carawyn, has discreely spread the word that he has a secret mission for those who are brave enough to venture into Tonwell. His mission has your interest because, as all adventurers know, &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; usually also means &amp;quot;lucrative.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
