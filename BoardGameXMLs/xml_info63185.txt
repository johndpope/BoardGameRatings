							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World War II in Europe Rummy</name>
									
			<description>World War II in Europe Rummy is a rummy card game for two to four players based on the war in Europe. Players alternate playing as the Germans, attempting to cement their foothold in Europe, and the Allies, attempting to hold off the German advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forces in each European region are indicated by colored cubes on a game board. Melds and runs of cards allow the player to initiate attacks against the opposing forces, while layoffs allow for the buildup of additional troops. Play continues for eight turns (represented by the years 1938 to 1945), or until Germany is defeated on its own soil. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
