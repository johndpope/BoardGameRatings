			<description>In the far future two factions fight over galactic territory and resources.&lt;br/&gt;Control one faction in this strategy game to annihilate your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total Annihilation features are fast strategy game where you build up a massive number of units (macro management) to obliterate the enemy. In order to build up your army, you will have to take risk by taking control of the maximum number of metal deposit scattered on the map. The more you control, the more you build but the more you will face enemy threat on your metal extractor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In total annihilation, you control a supreme unit, the &amp;quot;Commander&amp;quot;. This unit is both the most powerful and the most important unit.It can build buildings and kill units in a single shot, but loose it and you re defeated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total Annihilation also present a wide variety of units, from grounds to air, but also include hovercrafts, ships and submarine. all (100+) units have their strengths and weaknesses. Learn your enemy pattern in order to create the most annihilating combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total annihilation includes a two story campaign for both sides. There are also a wide variety of multilayer maps (both against IA of players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later, TA proposed additional packs of units and map (see extension). &lt;br/&gt;Also, more recently, fans proposed a wide variety of mods to render TA still actual. You can now control up to 10000 units or add a mod to transform TA into some well known strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The total Annihilation franchise is known to have unofficially been followed by the &amp;quot;Supreme Commander&amp;quot; franchise.
