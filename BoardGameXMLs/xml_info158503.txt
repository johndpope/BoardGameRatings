			<description>Sight Word Spy 1 is a fun and challenging game designed to reinforce sight words and develop spelling skills. The game contains 57 of the first 100 sight words children need to learn to become fluent readers. Each card has one sight word that matches with every other card in the deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game in a whole group, pass out one card to each student. The other cards are placed around the room. Children travel around the room to find the sight word on each card that matches with one of the words on their card. Children can write the matching words and/or make a tally mark for each match they find as they go around the room. Students can also work with a partner to find the matching words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing in a small group, one card is dealt to each player with remaining cards face up in a pile in the center.The first player to find their match calls out the word and takes that card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
