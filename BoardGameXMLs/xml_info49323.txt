			<description>The baby elephants have lost themselves in the savannah while playing and their elephant mothers start out to look for them. Nobody knows which player &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; which elephant, all players may move all elephants. Who manages to bring &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; elephant to the baby elephant of the same color, has won. Each child rolls the dice and moves those elephants, whose colors show on the dice, if the same color comes twice, the elephant moves two spaces. A nicely made variant of the color dice movement, the children love the secret stone marking ownership of an elephant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
