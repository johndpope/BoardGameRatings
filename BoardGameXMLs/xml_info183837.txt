			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ranger has been a part of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons since almost the beginning, and it remains one of the most popular classes in the game. However, feedback on fifth edition D&amp;amp;D has shown that the ranger lags behind the other classes in terms of power and player satisfaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following revised design of the ranger builds on the class&amp;rsquo;s unique traits, creating a new set of class features for 1st level to 5th level. These features are designed to make the ranger feel distinct and interesting while still remaining true to its identity within the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
