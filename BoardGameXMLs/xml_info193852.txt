			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Pick a team. Use the cards to enhance your team, or to sabotage others. Battle to dominate the board and be the last team standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;Start by drafting a squad of six Stick cards, each with it's own attack/defense rating and special ability, then placing their corresponding Stick Markers on the battlefield. Play then goes around the table with each player moving their Stick Markers into position, playing cards to enhance their Sticks or harm their opponent's Sticks, and rolling the dice to resolve battles until only one squad remains on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
