			<description>A simple truth: touchscreens are fine for dialing numbers and entering text, but they were never meant for advanced game playing. That&amp;rsquo;s where Zeemote wireless technology comes in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Zeemote, you instantly move from casual to serious gaming. Which means you can design mobile games with an entirely different level of functionality. Zeemote lets gamers get their fingers out of the way. It brings console-style gaming to the ever-growing world of mobile devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why leave all the fun to those playing at home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
