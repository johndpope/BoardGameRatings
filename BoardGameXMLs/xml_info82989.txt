							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hornet: Naval Strike Fighter</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assume the role of a U.S. Navy or Marine Corps F/A-18 fighter pilot and fly joint operations for the West with your Air Force F-16 brethren. Hornet: Naval Strike Fighter is the only fighter simulation that lets you create cooperative missions with F-16 Falcons in seven Falcon 3.0 theaters of war: Panama, Israel, Kuwait, Korea, Japan, India and Bosnia. It's you and your squadron against the Soviet MiG-29 squadron and its complement of supporting aircraft and ground forces. Whatever you and your wingmen decide, this fight will be the ultimate test of your dexterity, agility and teamwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The completely authentic F/A-18 cockpit design features a large Head-Up Display and three multi-function displays including easy-to-read engine monitors, Hughes AN/APG-65 multimode radar, Maverick missile targeting display, and combined Horizontal Situation Indicator/Color Map. Test yourself with challenging carrier landings, complete with standard naval 3/4-mile approach, &amp;quot;meatball&amp;quot; electro-optical landing guidance system, and hook-and-wire arrests with four wires (can you catch the #3 wire for a perfect landing?). Once you take off, there's no turning back. Your wingmen are counting on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     F/A-18's fast acceleration and tight turns allow &amp;quot;turn and burn&amp;quot; team tactics against enemy MiGs&lt;br/&gt;     Challenging carrier landings with digitized radio calls from the LSO for lineup and graded landing&lt;br/&gt;     Team play on a network with teams of Marine Corps F/A-18s and Air Force F-16 aircraft vs. the deadly MiG-29s&lt;br/&gt;     New theater of war: Bosnia&lt;br/&gt;     Compatible with Operation: Fighting Tiger and MiG-29: Deadly Adversary of Falcon 3.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
