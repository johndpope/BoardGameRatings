			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Go forth and colonize the stars. For we must forge the power to crush the enemy and make our universe pure again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Stellar Crusade, two fanatical groups embark on a mad race to control a small, but vital star cluster. It is an exciting strategy game of exploration, economic power and military conquest on an interstellar scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore. As the leader of one faction, your first task is to send out exploration teams to grab the best planets in the star cluster and colonize them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build. Next, you must build up your economic strength to prepare for war. This entails allocating raw materials and production points to build shipyards and maintenance facilities; train and supply troops, engage in research and development; establish farms, mines, refineries and factories. Remember, wars are never won by the poor or poorly-prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquer. To win a star war, you need starships. In this game, you can design your own and arm them with a host of offensive and defensive weapons. Group your starfleet of scout ships, cruisers and battlecruisers into task forces, each led by a commander of your choice. Although these task force commanders come rated for skill levels and experience, you won't know how competent they are until after their first battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play against a friend or the computer. There are seven different scenarios with multiple levels of difficulty: three short, three medium and one long campaign that spans decades!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
