							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Addams Family</name>
									
			<description>The Addams Family is a platform game based loosely on the 1991 movie of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Addams Family the player takes control of Gomez Addams who must explore the Addams Family mansion and free the other family members before making his way down into the family vault to battle The Evil Judge and rescue Morticia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Addams Family is an early example of a sandbox system, as from the start of the game the player has access to all but the final area of the mansion and is free to explore sections in any order. The player must travel throughout the Mansion and grounds, avoiding traps and defeating enemies by jumping on them in a similar way to Super Mario Bros. The player can extend his life bar by finding and defeating sub-bosses, as well as pick up power-ups including Golf Balls, Speed Sneakers and a Fencing Sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versions of The Addams Family was also released on NES, Sega Master System &amp;amp; Sega Game Gear, although these versions  were drastically different from this one, including different graphics, layout and a less open game play. Other versions of the game were also released for Game Boy, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 &amp;amp; ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NES and Gameboy versions of The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt are actually edited ports of The Addams Family, with Gomez replaced by Pugsley and Money replaced by Candy. The games are otherwise virtually identical, although some sections and parts are shortened or missing altogether (for example, the Crypt and Freezer sections are both reduced to just the boss battles in Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
