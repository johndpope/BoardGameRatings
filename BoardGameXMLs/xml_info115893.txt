			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are built on my Spirits of Steam &amp; Sorcery expansion of FATE3, but where SoS&amp;amp;S allowed you to play in a magical steampulp Victorian era, Spirits of Chrome and Cyberspace (hereafter referred to as SoC&amp;amp;C) moves into the near future, to a world where the corps have great control over the world, chromed street samurai run in the shadows, and magic has returned to the world, bringing with it goblinization of a significant percentage of the world&amp;rsquo;s population, the awakening of dragons and deadly insect spirits, and street mages for sale to anyone with the nu-yen. This is version 1.1, and features an expanded Lore section with sample spells, how to build new Lores, Matter Lore was renamed Transmutation, Cantrips are now a stunt and were replaced by the new Technomancy lore, and Summoning now requires a Stunt (each Lore now has at least 1 stunt).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
