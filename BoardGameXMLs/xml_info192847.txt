							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ferrovias de SÃ£o Paulo</name>
									
			<description>S&amp;atilde;o Paulo State had a rich railway history! Through the rails of several Railways Companies were transported an important portion of the State&amp;acute;s wealth. Many of these goods were transported to the major cities of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, cities from other States and others ended up down the hill and delivered to the ships from Santos Port, from where they journeyed to remote places. Amongst the carriage of this wealth also traveled over the rails passengers wagons, at a time when distances were tricky to overcome by steam locomotives which slowly crossed valleys and plains. &lt;br/&gt;From a broader view, it is possible to state 8 companies excelled in this endeavor:  Cia. Sorocabana de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Paulista de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Mogiana de Estradas de Ferro, Estrada de Ferro Araraquara, S&amp;atilde;o Paulo Railway, Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, Estrada de Ferro S&amp;atilde;o Paulo-Minas and Estrada de Ferro S&amp;atilde;o Paulo-Rio. Each of these railway companies had their own height but, after the Government&amp;rsquo;s decision to prioritize the road transport, they decayed over time. Nowadays, little remains from many of them but stations, warehouses and rails hidden by the tall grass and oblivion. They were vandalized, destroyed and gone leaving no sign of the passengers, products, wealth and history. Sad closure of a rich and beautiful story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferrovias de S&amp;atilde;o Paulo brings all railways companies in full operation, where products have to be transported through the cities or sent to Santos Port to meet the needs from other destinations. Players have to move their train compositions, buy and sell products, transport them to several railways of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo State while negotiate with other players through their &amp;ldquo;Agent&amp;rdquo;. The market constantly changes the value of the products so players will have to prove their abilities to explore the best time to buy and sell goods. Additionally, players&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Agents&amp;rdquo; will have to negotiate with other players &amp;ldquo;Agents&amp;rdquo;, as well with the &amp;ldquo;Negotiator&amp;rdquo;, an independent agent controlled by all players. &lt;br/&gt;Each player start with 1 train composition represented by 1 Locomotive and 1 Train Wagon. Throughout the game, players will be able to improve both their locomotives and train wagons to become more efficient and acquire other train compositions. Finally, players can also buy shares from several Railways Companies, shares from Mining Companies (essential for the Coal Market) and shares from Telegraph Company. &lt;br/&gt;Ferrovias de S&amp;atilde;o Paulo is an economic game where the most successful player claims the victory by holding the biggest amount of money. More than a game, history will come to life as players revive the time where people and history were transported in old wooden train wagons, pulled by steam locomotives which insisted on meeting the challenges of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We wish you all a safe journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
