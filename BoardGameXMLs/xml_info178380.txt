			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Time Pilot '84: Further Into Unknown World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space-Pilot II is a clone of the arcade game Time Pilot '84, with a few differences. The original arcade game has ground targets as well as air targets, but these are missing from the C64 game. The C64 game does however have a multiplayer mode with up to 8 players on-screen at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to the original Time Pilot, with the player piloting a space ship over an 8-way scrolling background. Each level is set in a different time period. Surviving for a certain length of time jumps to a different time period, but in this version of the game there is little to differentiate the different time periods (unlike the original Time Pilot where each time period was clearly set in different historical wars - WWI, WWII, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
