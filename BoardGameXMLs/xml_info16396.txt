							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stock Rush! A Week on Wall Street</name>
									
			<description>BRIEF SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stock Rush is a Strategy Board Game that uses an Interactive Device called the &amp;quot;Market Display&amp;quot;.  PLAYERS WATCH THEIR STOCKS FALL, RISE, CRASH and SKYROCKET . . . RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES! For added excitement, players also Mine for Gold and participate in a Gold Rush!  The &amp;quot;Game Play&amp;quot; in Stock Rush is so unique and diverse that it spans many game categories including: Strategy, Family, Party, Simulation, Educational, Action and Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 10 Players, Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DETAILED SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play begins on The Opening Bell space and a peg is used to keep track of the trading day.  Players can play a regular game and spend a full business week on Wall Street [Mon-Fri] or they can play a shorter game by starting on Wednesday.  The game usually ends when the trading day peg reaches &amp;ldquo;Game Over&amp;rdquo; which is the slot after Friday.  Other ways the game can end are: &amp;ldquo;Market Collapse&amp;rdquo; in which all companies go bankrupt; One player left in the game after all the other players go bankrupt and All players are trapped in a Cave In.  At the end of the game, all players liquidate [sell] their holdings to the bank and the player with the most cash wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STOCKS . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players buy and sell [Trade] stocks at the current market price shown by the &amp;quot;Market Display&amp;quot; [4 Stocks comprise the market in the game, A,B,C and D]. The stock prices are affected by news and rumors that randomly occur throughout the course of the game. There are two types of news and rumors that occur: Market News and Rumors affect the entire market; and Company News and Rumors which only affect a given individual company. Although rumors occur at random; how long they remain alive can be strategically predicted. The longer a rumor remains alive the higher the chance it will be confirmed or dispelled on the next turn. Consequently, players must trade accordingly; they must decide on 4 Criteria: [1] Buy or Sell?; [2]Which Stock to Trade?; [3] How many Shares to Trade?; and most importantly [4] When to Trade?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMMODITIES [MAINLY GOLD] . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stock Rush name was inspired by the California Gold Rush of 1849. As a result, a significant portion of the game is dedicated to that historical event. Players randomly mine for Gold and participate in many Gold Rushes throughout the game. During a &amp;ldquo;Gold Rush&amp;rdquo; players may become trapped in a &amp;ldquo;Cave In&amp;rdquo;.  Trapped players may escape on their own or be rescued by other players.  &lt;br/&gt;Once players accumulate Gold they may strategically sell any amount they wish on the &amp;quot;Gold Exchange Market&amp;quot;. They must sell according to 3 Criteria:&lt;br/&gt;[1] How much Gold to Sell? [2] At What Price to Sell? [3] When to Sell?  The other commodities in the game are Groceries, Toys, Clothes and Gear&amp;hellip;the STUFF we use in our everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
