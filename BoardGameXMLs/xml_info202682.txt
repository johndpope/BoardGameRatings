			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAGIC AND DEATH IN A TIME BEFORE HISTORY BEGAN...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the fall of Atlantis, its far-flung colonies quickly slipped into barbarism, and the final remnants of a once-great culture were swept away by the desperation of people just trying to survive. One of the last masters of the tradition of Philiamancy was Burnick the Love Witch. This is the story of her final battle against the Druids, her arch-enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Love Witch contains three exciting tales that mix high fantasy and horror by master comics-scribe Marv Wolfman, with gorgeous art by Ernie Colon, Don Heck, and others. The book also contains an all-new feat and talent-based magic system that can be brought into any d20 System and which is far more flexible than is typical, as it is not tied to any class- or level-based abilities. The system is the brainchild of Steve Miller, one-time contributor to the Ravenloft and Dragonlance game settings, and it intends to more accurately reflect how magic works in most fiction, comics, and film sources. Although framed in terms of Atlantis, it was easily be divorced from the source material and applied generically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
