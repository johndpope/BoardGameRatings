							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sickly Symptoms</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diseases  are the bane of all living beings.  They bring weakness, injury and possibly death and we can&amp;rsquo;t even see them.  For those that would take up the life of an adventurer, disease is an ever-present threat. Unsanitary camps, the jaws of filthy creatures and spoiled rations all threaten to cause sickness.  Unfortunately, in game this threat often just manifests as an abstract loss of stats or life.  Well, never fear, your friends here at Healing Fireball Publications are here with a collection of symptoms to spice up the diseases in your world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
