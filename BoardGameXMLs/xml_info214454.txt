			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Furyondy Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times are tough and the King has many enemies. It is said that heroes are made and not born, and that it is how you react when called upon that shows what you are really made of. In this case, information has come into your possession and it needs to be acted on immediately. Will you wait to give it to those more capable than you or will you seize the day, act for those who cannot act for themselves and protect a nation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investigative adventure for characters level 2 through 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
