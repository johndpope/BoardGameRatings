							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Hokibo, Kurama Samurai</name>
									
			<description>Where the Suzume are the most common, the Kurama are a rarity at the hatching. They are the largest, proudest and strongest warriors amongst the Tengu. Hokibo being a prime example of the Tengu warrior caste. There are few who can be called his equal with a blade, but as the Tengu are taught one&amp;rsquo;s mind must be as keen as the blade they wield. Hokibo&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of tactics lets him know what the enemy are planning sometimes before they do. His fluid strikes slice steel like rice paper, in combat a single flex of powerful wings can launch him to his feet or force smaller foe away.   &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
