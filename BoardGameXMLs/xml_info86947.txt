			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game publisher Digital integration specialised in more realistic style arcade games. Not sims, but more serious than conversions of real arcade games, they still remained very entertaining and appealed to older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Gunner puts you in the position of both pilot and bombardier on a mission over Europe. You must defend your bomber from attacks by fighter planes, and then accurately bomb your target. The game takes you through various missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was written by R J Swift, who is given a credit on the front cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card insert includes Softlock, one of the early attempts at what is now called DRM. After loading the game, the player must enter a code number printed in 10 columns on the insert. Since Spectrum players could buy plug-in boxes which saved games in mid-play, this Softlock was easily avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
