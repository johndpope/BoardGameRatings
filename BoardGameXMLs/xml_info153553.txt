			<description>The Game of Hurt Feelings is a party game for 3-8 people where questions are read aloud each turn and each player votes for whom they feel the situation or trait best applies.  Then, all players place wagers on what they think the outcome will be.  Players are awarded points and the game continues until the last turn is completed.  Then, the player with the fewest points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
