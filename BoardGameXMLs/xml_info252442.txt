			<description>BeamNG.drive is an immersive vehicle simulator offering near limitless possibilities to explore driving, stunting, crashing, and customizing vehicles. The soft-body physics engine at its core creates an authentic and visceral driving experience with the most realistic and violent car damage to appear in a game.  The vehicles and open-world environments are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. Vehicle modifications have realistic effects that come naturally from the in-depth simulation. With years of meticulous design, research, and combined experience behind it, BeamNG.drive is a simulator that pushes the limits of what you can do in a simulation game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOFT-BODY PHYSICS&lt;br/&gt;BeamNG.drive features detailed soft-body physics, simulating every component of a vehicle in real time using nodes (mass points) and beams (springs) for the most detailed, authentic, and versatile simulation ever seen in a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VEHICLES&lt;br/&gt;BeamNG.drive comes with more than 20 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, ranging from compact cars to huge trucks, with more to come. Vehicles can be customized with different wheels, suspension, engines, spoilers, body kits and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENVIRONMENTS&lt;br/&gt;BeamNG.drive features 12 sprawling, beautiful open world environments with hundreds of miles of road to explore, with everything from tropical jungles to barren deserts. Drive vehicles on every kind of surface imaginable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESTRUCTION&lt;br/&gt;BeamNG.drive features the most realistic damage model ever. There is no predefined damage and no limit to how much a car can be destroyed. Every body panel is simulated and crumples like the real thing in a crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONFIGURATION&lt;br/&gt;BeamNG.drive is highly configurable and runs on a broad range of computers. Performance is highly scalable. Any input device can be set up quickly and easily, from gamepads to full-fledged sim racing setups with H-shifter and clutch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMMUNITY&lt;br/&gt;We have a vibrant community of enthusiasts promoting interesting discussion and creating exciting vehicles, terrains, and gameplay scenarios. Come and join them, and download their mods from the repository!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG.drive provides many possibilities beyond a typical racing simulator. Explore fields, forests, trails and towns, or explore the physics in the testing map. Choose from over 20 vehicles ranging from a comical 3-wheeler to a modern German sports car to a big American dump truck. Gameplay options cover a range of disciplines including time trials, destruction, jumps and stunts, cargo delivery and vehicle chases, and even driver training!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BeamNG.drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck &amp;ndash; the stuff other games don&amp;rsquo;t let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan, hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, or stage massive pile-ups, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can modify vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths &amp;ndash; or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG.drive gives you the freedom to do what you want, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t force you to do anything that you don&amp;rsquo;t think is fun or interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
