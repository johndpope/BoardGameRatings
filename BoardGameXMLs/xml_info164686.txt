							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Epic Monster Tea Party</name>
									
			<description>In this 2-4 player game, you are the monster, and you relax at the end of a busy day by grabbing heroes from the labyrinth to flavor your tea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns blindly choosing a hero from the labyrinth bag. Heroes may be &amp;ldquo;squished&amp;rdquo; to use for their special ability and discarded, or they may be placed into the monster&amp;rsquo;s teacup to drink later for victory points. Once all of the heroes have been plucked from the labyrinth, each monster finishes drinking their tea, counts the victory points in their stomach, and the one with the highest score may belch and rejoice, for they are the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple, family-friendly tabletop game can be played in under 20 minutes with 2-4 players. While adults may be playing for points, kids seem to have more fun squishing the heroes and using their abilities to spill, steal, or trade teacups with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic Monster Tea Party can be enjoyed by everyone, young and old! It's simple to learn, quick to play, and the artwork will charm your socks off!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
