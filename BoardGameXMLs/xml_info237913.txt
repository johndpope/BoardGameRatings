							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unholy Bull</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most cities take great pride in arena combat, but few follow the ancient tradition of bullfighting. These battles once pitted expert fighters against prized bulls in fights to the death - all to the cheers of a massive audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That all changed upon the discovery of sentient animals. Suddenly the general public became repulsed with the idea of bullfighting, opting to follow other forms of entertainment instead. In a last-ditch effort to save their businesses, some arenas hired necromancers to reanimate and empower bull corpses. This side-stepped any pesky ethical problems while creating a brand-new market for arena combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outside of a few occasions where the undead have escaped their pens, the move has been fairly successful. Many patrons take great pride in &amp;ldquo;grooming&amp;rdquo; their bulls to be both effective and theatrical in combat, adding bone armor or arcane symbols for visual effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when a fan-favorite bull such as Zomb the Unholy is killed? There are usually enough profits to make resurrecting the beast a mere inconvenience. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s the problem with killing animals for entertainment when they&amp;rsquo;re already dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t bother answering if you&amp;rsquo;re a Lawful Good Cleric. Nobody cares what you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
