			<description>In the middle of the table, there is a battery-driven coconut which makes a sound when a player puts his/her hand on it. &lt;br/&gt;The players hold cards and simultaneously place a face-down card in front of the player to the left. These are then picked up. A player who holds cards of only one kind hits the coconut as fast as possible. Everyone else then puts their hand on it, too. The hands form an order. Now treasure cards are flipped up (as many as there are players). The first player (whose hand hit the coconut first) has the first pick, then the next one, etc. Treasure cards contain actions that can be executed immediately or contain positive or negative points. &lt;br/&gt;When the treasure cards are used up, the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
