			<description>From the publisher's brochure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The 10x10 grid of the Transpose board serves for several excellent games. In &amp;quot;Transpose,&amp;quot; be the first to exit 8 checkers off the board, but watch out... some opposing pieces may switch places with yours! In &amp;quot;Peregrine,&amp;quot; circumnavigate the board's perimeter to bring 5 checkers to the exit point; they can travel as stacks to advance more quickly, but also risk greater setbacks. In &amp;quot;Upper Hand,&amp;quot; cover or capture all opponent pieces. And in &amp;quot;Amazons,&amp;quot; block in the opponent's four pieces with arrows: where an arrow lands no move can cross, and each turn adds another block to the board. Four other good games, plus some solitaires, are included. Challenging and entertaining for 1 and 2 players, Ages 8 and up. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
