			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Tradition Of&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;br/&gt;Metamorphosis Alpha&lt;br/&gt;Brings You An Exciting New Concept&lt;br/&gt;In Fantastic Role-Playing Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever encountered a moose with quills?  Or a teleporting woodpecker with a double brain and a poison beak?  How about a nearly invincible jaguar, complete with the ability to change its body density and emit a sonic shriek, but which fears birds?  These are but a small sampling of the mutations which could inhabit the many worlds of METAMORPHOSIS ALPHA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vast starship, a virtual world in itself, carrying colonists, livestock, and the flora and fauna of Terra is struck by a cloud of an unknown form of radiation while enroute (sp) to a distant star.  Chaos reigns when the radiation kills most of the crew, and in the ensuing madness the knowledge of what the ship is and where its destination lies is lost to the survivors - and there are many survivors.  Intelligent mutated animals and plants now populate the vessel, and these compete or perhaps cooperate with the humans aboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In METAMORPHOSIS ALPHA, you are aboard the stricken starship and struggling to survive, trying to gain knowledge of the strange devices and mechanical apparatus of the vessel, attempting to learn the secrets of the strange &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; you inhabit.  As a player, you may be a human or a mutant - human or otherwise.  Your course is up to your skill and imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;METAMORPHOSIS ALPHA is a role-playing game in the grand tradition of DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS.  If you enjoy the worlds of medieval swords and sorcery, you will love what you find in the fantastic and fascinating worlds of science fiction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
