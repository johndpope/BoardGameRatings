							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Maker: Dragon Attack!</name>
									
			<description>Come to think of it, the Dragon may be the one who was attacked. The humans showed off their own power stealing the Dragon's treasure, and taking it as their own. Finally the Dragon let out its anger, and began its revenge on the human kingdom of Silverado. The nearby villages burned from its breath, and every temple was destroyed. The Dragon proceeded towards the Royal Palace. Is there anyone who can stop the Dragon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Attack is a simple fantasy boardgame. The player becomes an adventurer, and traverses Silverado, forming a party to stand against the Dragon. However, killing the Dragon is not the only objective. To revive the ruined Silverado will require a vast amount of money. In the end, when the Dragon is slain, the player with the most treasures becomes the true victor, and achieves glory for a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The above is my translation of the introduction to the game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a hex-and-counter style of game, where you move around the map, and turning over hidden counters to find enemies, allies, and treasure. However, anytime you roll a '1', the Dragon moves along a pre-determined path and destorys a village/temple. If noone can defeat the Dragon before it destroys the Royal Palace, everyone loses, making it a game where the players both compete against each other for treasure and against the game itself because of the Dragon-imposed time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
