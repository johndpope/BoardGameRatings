							<name primary="true" sortindex="6">The &quot;Trivia&quot; Game of Sheboygan, Wisconsin</name>
									
			<description>This game was made as a fundraiser for the Accents of Sheboygan, a color guard team. The spaces on the board are business sponsors or lists of individual sponsors, featuring such historical local classics as Zurheide's Ice Cream and Prange's, neither of which still exist. The trivia cards are a mix of general trivia and Sheboygan history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice and move. The first to answer 12 questions correctly gets to try to answer a question from the Jackpot. The first to answer a question from the Jackpot wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
