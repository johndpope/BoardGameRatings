			<description>There is no text on the back of the book. An excerpt from the Author's Notes inside is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A to Z Rules For Ancient Warfare is a fast playing set of rules for 25mm and 15mm miniatures. It is compatible with all basing systems, army organizations and army lists. It will enable you to play a game with 300 to 400 figures per side in about four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the rules is the initiative-impulse movement system, the command control system and the morale system. These are the most critical areas determining the flow of the game. They are also areas of great flexibility and changes can easily be made to meet the requirements of different army compositions or scenarios.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
