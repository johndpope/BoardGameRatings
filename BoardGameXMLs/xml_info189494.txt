			<description>Victor Vran is an action role-playing video game developed by the Bulgarian independent development studio Haemimont Games.  The setting of the game resembles Gothic-fantasy fairy tale where both magic and science have place in the world. The player assumes the role Victor Vran, a demon hunter who arrives in the fantasy city of Zagoravia, to help its inhabitants fight off a demon infestation of unknown origin.  Victor Vran follows in the footsteps of demon hunters who have come before him, none of which have survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat of Victor Vran combines action RPG elements and reaction-based moves which allow the player to dodge attacks and avoid damage. The game features jump mechanic which is used in combat and in solving vertical puzzles and reaching secret map areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hero has no specific character class. Players can tweak their character by changing freely different weapon classes, consumable items (e.g. potions or bombs) and spell-like demon powers. Destiny cards and hero outfits grant various passive abilities. Each weapon class offers one basic and two special attacks which can be combined for special bonuses and effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game world is divided in large areas representing the districts and the surroundings of the city of Zagoravia and adjacent dungeons. Each area has 5 specific challenges which grant various rewards upon completion. The player can tweak the difficulty on every area and dungeon by using special Hex items which grant buffs and bonuses to the enemies within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victor Vran features cooperative multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Victor Vran&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
