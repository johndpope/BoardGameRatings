							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nyctophobia: Vampire Encounter</name>
									
			<description>The night is cold and dark. It's hard to see where you are or where you've been. &amp;quot;A road trip gone awry&amp;quot; is a charitable description of the world you and your friends find yourself trapped in. No one will ever believe you. Vampires aren't real. Right? Well, tell that to the bloodsucker that's been hunting you. Tell that to your friend who wandered off into the forest with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nyctophobia: Vampire Encounter, you attempt to outrun and outsmart a vampire who is hunting you. The forest is a dark and lonely place. Players must blindly navigate it while wearing blackout glasses, trying to find and rescue their friend &amp;mdash; &amp;quot;the familiar&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; who the vampire has kidnapped and hidden in the forest. Only the vampire can see what's going on around them. The hunted players have the navigate the board through touch and memory only!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nyctophobia: Vampire Encounter differs from Nyctophobia in that the hunter player takes on the role of vampire instead of the axe murderer or mage in the original game. The vampire can control the familiar and the player who is leading them out of the forest, leading to tricky situations for those in the dark. The game includes two pre-set maps for players to work through while they're trying to rescue the NPC familiar and return them to the car without anyone dying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
