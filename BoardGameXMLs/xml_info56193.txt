			<description>Introduction text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argosy Command&lt;br/&gt;A game of starship miniatures combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are designed to allow players to quickly design fleets and get right to playing. Battles involving over a dozen ships per side should be resolved within a couple hours play easily. While not as detailed or full of options as several other games available, this should be appropriate for even small children to understand and enjoy until they are ready themselves to move on to more challenging rule sets. Above all, it is hoped that the rules presented here provide an enjoyable experience to all that choose to play, for a game that is without fun...is simply not a game at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ships portrayed within the Argosy Command universe travel between stars by means of wormholes and may represent various races as characterized and postulated by the likes of H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, and other such literary notables at the turn of the 20th Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
