							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ravager - A 5th Edition D&amp;D Class</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Ravagers; born in the fires of combat these warriors have a sole focus on the battlefield - eliminating their foes in a wave of blades. Lacking the discipline of other fights the Ravager relies on relentless attacking to overwhelm their foes. Later these savage righters go on to adopt blood rituals to give them strength or become veteran warriors capable of skilled feats of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This class provides players with a mix of fighter and barbarian playstyles to offer a new experience. Lacking the constitituion of the barbarian or armour of the fighter, the ravager is a character designed to deal out as much damage as they can.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Author's Summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
