			<description>Football related card game. 56 cards featuring 21 different footballing terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of cards. The 'match' kicks off by the first player to have an Ansto&amp;szlig; (Kick-Off) card. If no-one has such a card, each player in turn draws another card from the stack. This goes on until an Ansto&amp;szlig; is drawn and played. Next player must play a card that is the logical action after the kick-off. A check list is provided so you can see which action card is acceptable. The game continues like this until one player runs out of cards. That player wins the round and the other players get a minus score depending on which cards they still have in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points after an agreed number of rounds, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
