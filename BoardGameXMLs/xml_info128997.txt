							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Era Report: 2750</name>
									
			<description> from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the treachery of Stefan Amaris, Kerensky's Exodus and the Succession Wars, the realms of the Inner Sphere were united under the banner of the Star League. As the pinnacle of culture and technology, the six Great Houses and four territorial states of the League reaped the benefits of universal peace and justice, the fruits of their combined efforts enriching the lives of billions across the heavens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...Or so the legends claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, the Inner Sphere of the 2750s was far from serene and light-years away from just. Though admired for its monolithic power, the pinnacle of mankind's greatest experiment - the Star League - stood at a fateful crossroads, with feuding House Lords and rebellious territories only waiting for every chance to strike against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Era Report: 2750 pierces the luminous veneer of what many Inner Sphere and Clan historians alike have considered to be the golden age of BattleTech history: the height of the Star League era. Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of every major Inner Sphere faction active before the fateful events described in Historical: Liberation of Terra. Notable personalities, military forces and an overview of the technological capabilities of the Star League age are also provided, along with special advanced-level rules for campaigns set during the time, whether played using the Total Warfare core rules or those found in A Time of War: The BattleTech Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
