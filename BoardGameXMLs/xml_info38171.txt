			<description>&amp;quot;CCG style rules for Tarot Decks. There are so many nice Tarot Decks it&amp;rsquo;s a shame not to game with them. Card game for 2+ players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in the Tarot deck is classified as a Character (with a designated Force value), Event, or Modifier Card. Character Cards stay in play until they are killed. Modifier Cards are attached to Characters. Event Cards are discarded as soon as they are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with fifty Life Points. Each time a Character sustains damage, the amount is deducted from the controlling player's Life Points. The object of the game is to reduce your opponent to zero Life Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
