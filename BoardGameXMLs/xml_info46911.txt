			<description>From the publisher &amp;quot;So what's the big deal about this game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elfs is funny. It's a dead-on poke in the eye to the notion of wise, soulful &amp;quot;elves&amp;quot; perpetuated by all too many fantasy role-playing games. Elfs is funny not only to read, but actually to play. This is a real RPG meant for more than giggles and a couple of con demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elfs offers a genuine innovation for role-playing. I won't bore you with some discourse on &amp;quot;Director stance,&amp;quot; but check out the illustration on the bottom of this page: see what that elf just did? He meant to cut off one goblin's head, but went and cut off that other one's by accident!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's what the Elfs mechanics do - they permit you to state one outcome or action, and your character to state another. Guess which happens more often? Yours! This means that the elf characters are rarely successful in what they try to do, but game events proceed in the way that you, the player, consider to be the most fun. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
