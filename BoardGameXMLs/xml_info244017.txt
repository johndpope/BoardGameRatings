							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flora &amp; Fungi: Underground 1</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Collection Of Interesting Infestations For Your Next Dungeon:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flora &amp;amp; Fungi: Underground 1 is the first in a series of fantasy supplements that detail new, exotic plants, fungi, and lichens. In this initial collection there are six different specimens designed to spice up the features of a fantasy underground location. Each specimen has their own basic stats, including the habitat and environ that they are found in, their general size, the frequency of such growths, and notations regarding their description and general interest. Each flora and fungi presented in this supplement is designed to provide both game flavor and useful mechanic notes. Many specimens have some monetary or commodity value, a few have specific game effects. Game notes are provided at the end of each description to assist the Game Master with the implementation of such offerings towards the Game Master's chosen rules system and fantasy campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a sample entry from the file:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Lace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Type: Mildew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environ: Dungeons, crypts, caverns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat: Walls and ceilings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Size: 3 foot diameter patches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frequency: Colony of 1d4+3 patches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interest: Arcane effect&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost lace is a pale bluish white mildew that favors growing along walls and ceilings of dungeons and crypts. Although it can be found in deep caverns, the mold tends to favor areas of where corpses gather and heavy foot traffic occurs. For this reason, as well as special arcane abilities (see below) that the mildew possesses, it has been argued by some scholars that ghost lace is the result of wizardly experimentation rather than pure natural occurrence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost lace is well known for its mystical properties. Constantly reproducing, the underground rooms in which the mildew thrives are misty with the presence of spore clouds. Each patch of mildew creates a constant spore cloud that covers a 5 ft cubic area. Although these spore clouds are surprisingly harmless to breathe in (even for individuals with severe allergies), the spore clouds have a unique ability in regards to counteracting against invisibility. Any character or creature that benefits from an invisibility spell or affect is outlined (and thus visible) by the ghost lace spores should any part of their body/form come into immediate contact with the spores. This effect remains as long as the individual/creature remains in the spore clouds and for a full 1d6+4 minutes after leaving the immediate area of the spore clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
