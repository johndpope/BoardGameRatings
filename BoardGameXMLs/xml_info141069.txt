			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ambush was devastating. The entire Xenogryph starforce was waiting to cut your star fleet to ribbons. Over 100 star cruisers have been destroyed through this treachery and it is a sheer miracle that you have survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, facing the overwhelming odds, you assess the situation. You and crew must destroy four heavily defended space forts and all of the trackers, fighters, and launches that the&lt;br/&gt;Xenogryphs can hurl at you, and you must react instantly, fearlessly, correctly. There is no room for error. There is no one that can stop the Xenogryphs but you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivor pits you and your crew (1 to 4 players) against incalculable odds. You can fly your starwedge Cruiser solo, with one or two gunners, and/or a propulsion engineer, across a scrolling galaxy of danger and excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck has served you thus far trooper, but only your skill can make you the Survivor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
