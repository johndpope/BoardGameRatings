			<description>The biggest vault in town is empty! Was it Gloomy Gary, Burgling Beth or Wicked Wally? The players investigate who left the fingerprints on the crime site and who has an alibi. Only the player who can quickly combine numbers, identify the right suspect and, with the right operation card, take him into custody will win the game as the best &lt;br/&gt;crime solver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the quick reaction game Nabbed!, twelve criminal suspects are arranged in a circle, with a police officer placed next to one of the suspects. Each player receives operation cards numbered 1-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, someone reveals a profile card that shows three suspects, then another player rolls the die. The symbol on the die tells the players which of the three suspects on the profile card is the criminal. Players race to count the number of steps the officer must go to reach the criminal, then reveal the corresponding operation card from their hand. The player who reveals the card first checks whether the answer is correct by moving the officer the indicated number of spaces. If he was right, he collects the profile card; otherwise all other players receive a profile card. Whoever collects six profile cards first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
