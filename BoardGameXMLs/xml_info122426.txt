			<description>Magtspillet (The Power Game) is a political incorrect game about Danish politic, which can be played by 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You strive to collect the largest team of ministers, to be able to take power in the &amp;quot;Tinget&amp;quot; (Danish Parliament), and become statsminister (Prime Minister). Betrayal, lawbreaking and slander are just three of powers the players can use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magtspillet uses a broad selection of politicians from the last 25 years from Folketinget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are dealt out, and players take turn to select any card from their collection, choose a category, and beat a random card from an opponents hand. Whoever ends up with all cards, or just the most cards after a predetermined time, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can also be player like Top Trumps, where the categories are: Scandals, Years in power, Party memberships, Minister seats, and Books published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
