							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Denbury Resources Oil Game</name>
									
			<description>[From the &amp;quot;Rules of the Game&amp;quot; booklet]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;The object of the Oil Game is to add the most oil reserves by taking carbon dioxide from Jackson Dome to the old oil fields in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player &amp;quot;transports&amp;quot; carbon dioxide along the pipeline by moving his/her token along the pipeline and claims the tertiary oil reserves from each oil field that is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who either accumulates the most oil or reaches the winning target for the number of competitors playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember that this game differs from the real world because Denbury had the only carbon dioxide source in the area.  Effectively, it's like playing this game with only one player!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-&lt;br/&gt;-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[comment by tcanderson71, an oil geologist in Wyoming]: Actually, this is very much like the real world -- here in Wyoming, there is only one current CO2 supply, owned and controlled by ExxonMobil, located in the LaBarge Field in southwestern Wyoming. It feeds into a CO2 pipeline delivering it to Chevron in Rangely Field in northwest Colorado, then Anadarko Petroleum at Monell Field and Merit Energy in the Lost Soldier and Wertz Fields (south-central Wyoming), and finally to Anadarko at the Salt Creek Field in east-central Wyoming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
