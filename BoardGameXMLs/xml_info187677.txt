			<description>It's a fast-paced race with Lightning McQueen and his friends. Bring your favorite heroes at the finish line first and win the thrilling race! &lt;br/&gt;But be careful, several obstacles are awaiting you during the route, before the winner can roll to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a pawn and places it in square one.&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, place Lightning McQueen at the center of the action platform and press it flat. Look&lt;br/&gt;as it turns, and in what hole he randomly ends.&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 9 holes has a different action\power that you have to perform.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to cross the finish line wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
