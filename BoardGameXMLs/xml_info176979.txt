							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gregor&#039;s Portrait</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere deep in the Russian wastes north of Moscow, a great upheaval of dark power has taken place.  A well-established vampire lord, undisputed ruler of his domain for over four centuries, has been overthrown and murdered by a powerful thrall, Gregor Petrovich. With the loss of their master, the disciples, servants, and followers have either abandoned Gregor's cause, or been murdered by the new master's few supporters.  Much weakened, Gregor nurses his wounds in his master's former castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This changing of the ranks has provided something of an opportunity.  Seven years ago, Gregor's master abducted the famous Italian painter, Armino Pasquarelli.  Although Gregor murdered most of his master's slaves and cattle, he has kept Armino to paint one final portrait.  When this portrait is completed, the artist will be drained of his blood and fed to the wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party has been hired to infiltrate a vampire's castle and rescue an old painter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the adventure is a set of full color battle tiles for use in the game, so jump into a nightmare and have a blast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
