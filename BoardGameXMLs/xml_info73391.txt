							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire</name>
									
			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though marketed as a standalone add-on to Jagged Alliance 2, Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire is more of a remake of the original. The story and gameplay have been tweaked but are basically the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the new/modified content include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- higher overall difficulty, with better enemy AI and higher numbers of enemy troops;&lt;br/&gt; - new weapons and equipment;&lt;br/&gt; - all enemy military facilities are much more difficult to attack, due to the addition of minefields, fences, alarm and defensive positions;&lt;br/&gt; - the Arulco population is more loyal to the regime;&lt;br/&gt; - the drug cartel is now a part of the government and much more dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the game was released before QA testing was finished, and thus contains a number of bugs (some of them carried over from Jagged Alliance 2 and later fixed by fanmade patches).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
