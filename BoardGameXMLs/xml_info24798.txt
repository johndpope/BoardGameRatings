			<description>An exciting game of Travel &amp;amp; Trivia using a factual world map as your playing board.  Players start with airline itineraries &amp;amp; travelers checks and need to be the first player to visit all the cities on their itinerary, collecting the appropriate visa, and return to their country of origin all the while managing their money, navigating detours &amp;amp; diversions.  The first player to collect 10 visas and return to their country of origin is declared the winner.  PLAY:  Players must announce their intended destination before the role of the die which will determine the amount of the fare.   The die role will determine the destination and the cost by displaying full/half or free fares.  If a player rolls divert, transit, geography or general knowledge then they must take the appropriate card from the board and their travel is suspended or diverted depending on the instructions of the card.  Many times players may answer trivia questions about their particular region to allow their flight to continue to their previously stated destination, however, a wrong answer usually keeps the player grounded or relocates them to an undesirable location.   Money is collected by opting not to fly and answering trivia questions or a combination of both.  The Australian game designer recommends this game for ages 12+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
