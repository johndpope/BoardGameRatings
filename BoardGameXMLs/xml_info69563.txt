			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ninth game from Thalamus for the Commodore 64; Creatures was a platform action game designed and programmed by Apex Computer Production; the two brothers John Rowlands and Steve Rowlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main game was a platform game that can be described as a slow run and gun, where the player gradually advanced through the right-scrolling stage. After each other stage, there was a so-called &amp;quot;Torture Screen&amp;quot;, where the player was to prevent a fellow cute furry from being horribly and blood-splatteringly slaughtered. These Torture Screens were not scrolling, but a plain platform puzzle that consisted of shooting enemies, pulling levers and doing stuff in the right order and with the right timing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;John Rowlands: Programming&lt;br/&gt;Steve Rowlands: Music, graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
