			<description>From the packaging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turned out to be the toughest case of your detective career. Clues have lead to nothing but dead ends. Nobody is talking. Meanwhile, The crime boss you are after is still operating from somewhere. You are about to throw in the towel. But wait! Something breaks. You trail a stooge of the crime organization to a cheap, shoddy hotel, hoping to pump some answer out of him. You break into the hotel room and with the butt end of your trusty .44 magnum, you knock him out cold. This could be the lead you've waited for. Maybe, just maybe, if you could find some clues...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a text adventure game with graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
