							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fate of Inglemia</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Strategic Campaign outline features a Very High Magic setting for Very High Level characters. It is designed to allow the characters to alter events on a world shattering level. Incorporating elements of the Elemental Dimension of Magic, Inglemia goes back to the Prime Material roots of the eternal conflict between the Jeshatan and the magic hating Knah'tan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fate of Inglemia is not a module. It is a product designed to give the GM a primer to establish a set of parameters for an Epic campaign involving the City State of Inglemia and its encounter with their ancient cousins, the Jeshatan of the Elemental Dimension of Magic. This product incorporates elements from the products The Elemental Dimension of Magic EDM001 through EDM013. Thematically speaking, the game is designed for characters of around PL 13, allowing them to go up in level every two sessions well into the epic levels and beyond. While it is certainly possible to use this product for a low level game, the GM also has the tools to allow his players to be movers and shakers on a primal level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the core strategic campaign was originally designed to have the players be agents that defend Inglemia, they could just as easily be agents bent on its destruction. Inglemia certainly is not without plenty of enemies nor is it without flaw. While it is a fantastic place, there is still rot at the core and it is primed for change; whether good or ill is up to the players&amp;hellip;and you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
