							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Elfheim Eagles</name>
									
			<description>The Elfheim Eagles are notable for eschewing the fancy outfits and extravagant parties of Elven teams past in favour of drills, training sessions and even more drills. The fans may have disapproved at first, but after the Elfheim Eagles nudged out Nurgle&amp;rsquo;s Rotters to win Blood Bowl XX they became known as one of the finest passing play teams to ever grace the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-part plastic kit contains the components needed to assemble The Elfheim Eagles, an Elven Union Blood Bowl team. The team consists of 6 Linemen (4 of which are actually Linewomen), 2 Blitzers, 2 Throwers and 2 Catchers, each of whom are as impressively-cheekboned and beautiful as you might expect from an Elven team. The heads and shoulder pads are interchangeable between the miniatures, meaning your team can look unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a host of extras in the kit &amp;ndash; 2 turn markers, 2 double-sided score coins and 6 balls, 4 of which are encrusted with opulent gemstones. Supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases and an Elven Union transfer sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
