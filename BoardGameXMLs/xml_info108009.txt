			<description>From publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card game duel The Fighter (Men can do anything!) has been created based on the popular Russian reality-show about mixed martial arts: M1-Fighter. Now, anyone can step into the ring and participate in fights with their TV heroes! Swings and uppercuts, throws and low-kicks, holds and yellow cards &amp;ndash; this original fight simulator contains all those elements which we love to see in the martial arts. The game presents eight fighters: actual participants from the TV show. They all have unique fighting abilities: strength, speed, stamina and coordination. Using their skills, the fighters attack each other, avoid hits and maneuver in an attempt to gain a tactical advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique game mechanics lie in the interaction of the move cards and 40 multicolored dice. However, to win, you will need not only luck, but also the ability to plan your actions and turn the game situation in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
