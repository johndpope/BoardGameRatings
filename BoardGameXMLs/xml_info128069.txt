			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario can be used to introduce Strands of Fate to new players or be dropped into an ongoing campaign. It is designed to be played in an hour or two. Sample characters are included for players who wish to jump right into the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting&lt;br/&gt;Nippon is a fantasy version of medieval Japan with the Samurai ruling class and all of the social structures. However, Nippon has these additions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Magic exists&lt;br/&gt;         Mythical creatures exist&lt;br/&gt;         A nonSamurai character while still socially bound to follow the orders of the Samurai lords may defend himself from an attack by a Samurai. (Historically if a nonSamurai fought and/or killed a Samurai they were guilty of murder regardless of the circumstances.)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situation&lt;br/&gt;The son of the local Daimyo (feudal leader) has broken his leg in a bad horse riding accident. The break is severe and the local healers are unable to set it properly. The Daimio has ordered one of his Samurai to escort a Bonze (priest/healer), an ashiguru (Peasant Warrior), and a hunter/tracker to find a Kappa (mythical turtle man) that is rumored to live in a nearby stream. Some Kappa are known to have special knowledge in the treatment of broken bones and the Daimio hopes that this one can be convinced to teach the Bonze this ability. Kappa are also known for using a form of Sumo wrestling that can break bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
