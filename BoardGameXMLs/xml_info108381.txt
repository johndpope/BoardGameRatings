			<description>B.C. is a strategic tile laying game using elements of abstract strategy and deck building games to tell the story of four rival tribes battling it out for control of vital resources on the Pre-Historic earth of Leakey, Von-Daniken, and &amp;quot;Eegah!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes control of one of four tribes: The Aliens,  Great Apes, Homo Sapiens, or Neanderthals, and attempts to gain control of the largest part of the prehistoric landscape, as represented by a grid marked by variable terrain features. Each tribe begins with a small selection of Tiles, and then must spend further actions to place those Tiles and earn &amp;quot;Enlightenment Points&amp;quot;, which can be spent on new tiles and new options for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when there are no further plays left on the board. Victory goes to the Tribe whose player has taken control of the most sections of the board. In the case of a tie, victory is determined by the number of Enlightenment Points still controlled by the Tribes at the end of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
