							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enemy 585: The Last Henchman</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;In Enemy 585, the &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; has rampaged his way through all 8 castles and defeated the final boss, finally to return home and rest.  In his wake of destruction he destroyed all the henchmen...  except one!  Somehow, Henchman 585 has avoided squashing, and now it is up to you, a sentient collection of square blocks, to guide him back to the hero's home for revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, you move and rotate a group of blocks so that they are positioned to manipulate the movement of the henchman, who moves forward until he comes to an obstacle of at least two blocks (in which case he changes direction).  By providing bridges or obstacles, you can change his path to reach the end of the level, as well as help him hit switches, kick old enemy helmets, or otherwise manipulate items along the way.  As an additional challenge, there are several coins to collect in each level for bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as being made in a retro style, this game toys with many of the conventions of early platformers.  For instance, the main direction of progression is to the left, and you start at level 8-4, trying to reach level 1-1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
