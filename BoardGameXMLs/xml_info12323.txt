			<description>Players race to go from start to finish on a gameboard. The first to the finish plays the quiz. This player draws a chance card to determine the amount of money needed to win the quiz. A player starts with $50 and risks increments of $50 on every question. If the player fails to reach the target amount by five questions and player still has a one-in-four chance of winning with a random draw from &amp;ldquo;the Heartline Phone.&amp;rdquo; The first to complete three of the chance cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is loosely based on a television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
