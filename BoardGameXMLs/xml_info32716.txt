							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5th Column Spy Hunter</name>
									
			<description>To quote the rules:  &amp;quot;Every 5th Columnist Spy that is caught pays the full penalty for his crime whether this country is at peace or at war.  For a while a 5th Columnist spy may escape detection and cause much damage and many heartaches&amp;hellip; but from the days of old... No 5th Columnist Spy has yet escaped.&amp;quot; Excerpted from the rules section A Word About Spies by James Boyle - Former Special Investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th Column  Spy Hunter is a point to point movement game for 2 teams.  Players act as either the 5th Columnists or the Spy Hunters and move around a map of the United States based on Official Number Code from the Decoder (a spinner).  The spinner provides moves based on a separate &amp;quot;code&amp;quot; list for 5th Columnists and Spy Hunters.  5th Columnists score points for ending their moves on designated spots (for example: air naval or army bases to steal documents), the Spy Hunters get points based on failures by the 5th Columnists.   The winner is the first team to 15 points.    Both teams are expected to record their routes so that a second game can be played to crown the &amp;quot;Champion Spy Hunter&amp;quot;.  The teams exchange routes and take turns listing the order of the states they entered and their capitols.  Points are awarded for correct answers. Mistakes cost a team their turn.  The Champion is the team with the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
