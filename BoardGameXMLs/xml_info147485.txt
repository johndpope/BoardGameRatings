			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the couatl, a creature that is exotic by almost any definition of the word. From their South American background (which stands out like a sore thumb in the medieval-European-centric world of fantasy roleplaying games), to the fact that few parties have any reason to ever fight one, it&amp;rsquo;s a fair bet that your game group has never encountered a couatl before. This book aims to provide some couatls that might actually see some use, the first of which is the jet couatl (CR 11), a type of couatl that has fallen from grace and forsaken its heavenly background, as well as its wings, in favor of a variety of new profane powers. Also featured is the primal couatl (CR 13), which is more in tune with the forces of nature than the heavens, and possesses a powerful hypnotic gaze and hallucinogenic venom. Finally, the radiant couatl (CR15) is a paragon of the typical couatl&amp;rsquo;s ideals, but in addition to being advanced and having better spellcasting, its radiant wings can disable those who gaze upon it, and its blood is a fabled cure-all, giving characters of any stripe a reason to come to blows with one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
