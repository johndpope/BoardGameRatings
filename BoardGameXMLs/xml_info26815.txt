							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kong Power Slam Battle Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Each player begins with a hand of five cards. The cards have either a number (from 2-8- some of which also have special powers) or a picture of Kong. In each round of the battle, players simultaneously selects a card and places it face down in front of him. The cards are then revealed and, in general, the card with the higher number wins the round (with some exceptions due to Kong cards and special powers.)&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the round either moves the Kong figure to the first space on his side of the board if he did not win the last round or advances Kong a space if he won the last round. The loser gets to draw a card. In the case of a tie, both players draw two cards.&lt;br/&gt;A player must win three rounds &lt;b&gt;in a row&lt;/b&gt; in order to win the game. If the deck is exhausted before someone has won 3 in a row, the player who has won the most rounds (tallied by keeping the cards from won battles in front of him) wins. A player can also lose by running out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
