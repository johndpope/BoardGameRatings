							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UWOL the quest for money</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UWOL  is a retro arcade action platform game. The player controls UWOL, who goes through screen after screen, collecting coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally designed for the ZX Spectrum by the Spanish collective The Mojon Twins, UWOL has seen a remarkable number of ports on the retro machine scene. It was first ported to Megadrive by a russian enthusiast, then it was converted to the Commodore 64 (released on cartridge by RGCD, later on in a 2-in-1 package cartridge by the same publisher, and then on a 3-in-1 release by Psytronik) and then ported to the unexpanded Commodore 16. A sequel (UWOL 2) was then released for the Amstrad CPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;Despite being super rich and earning 90% of Spain's national income from the videogame industry, year after year, Uwol wasn't satisfied. The money just wasn't enough - what he craved more than anything was adventure (in addition to yet more wealth), so he decided to become a treasure hunter and follow in the footsteps of his gaming heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After already collecting valuable rewards such as the fire that doesn't burn (which looks great in the hall of his house), the proton pistol and proton charger, three pairs of Gremla's knickers, Miner Willy's book of bills, Wally's pajamas, the Sword of Power (although this is just a copy because the real one is still in use) and heaps of Saimaza coffee, Uwol learns that a mysterious and eccentric millionaire has hidden a huge fortune of stolen gold coins within a deserted manor next to Canutos Forest - the so-called Storm Palace. So he decides to emulate his idol Goodie and begin a new quest... A Quest For Money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;na_th_an: design (Spectrum)&lt;br/&gt;shiru: Megadrive port&lt;br/&gt;Algarbi: code (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Owen Crowley: music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Assassin: Commodore 16 port&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
