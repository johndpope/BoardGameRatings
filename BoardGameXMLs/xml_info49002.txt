							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Necroscope</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming from behind the shielding door Harry saw the necromancer sitting there and gasped. It was as if Dragosani's eyes had exploded from within. Their centres were craters in his face, with threads of crimson gristle hanging down on to his hollow cheeks. Harry knew it was over then and the shock of it all caught up with him. Sickened, he turned away from Dragosani, saw his henchmen waiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Finish it,&amp;quot; he told them. And they creakingly advanced on the stricken monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boris Dragosani was quite blind now, and so too the vampire within him, which had seen with his eyes. But immature though the creature was, still its alien senses were sufficiently developed to recognise the inexorable approach of black, permanent oblivion. It sensed the stake held in the mummied claw, knew that a rusted sword was even now raised high. Ruined shell that he was, Dragosani was no use to the vampire now. And evil spirit that it was, it came out of him as if exorcised!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragosani stopped screaming, choked, clawed at his throat. Froth and blood flew as his jaws opened impossibly wide and he began to shake his monstrous head frantically to and fro. His entire body was going into convulsions, beginning to vibrate as the pain within grew greater than that of ruptured eyes and broken bones. Any other must surely have died there and then, but Boris Dragosani was no other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His neck grew fat and his grey face turned crimson, then blue. The vampire withdrew itself from his brain, uncoiled from his inner organs, tore itself loose from nerves and spinal cord. It formed barbs, used them to drag itself head-first up the column of his throat and out of him. Slopping blood and mucus, he coughed the thing endlessly on to his chest. And there it coiled, a great leech, its flat head swaying like that of a cobra, scarlet with the blood of its host...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Necroscope is a role-playing game set in the dark world of Brian Lumley's imagination. A world where paranormal spies, ESPionage agents, and Mind Spies fight a secret war against darker things and one another. The Wamphyri, or vampires, exist, and their age-old evil stretches from the beginning of time to threaten the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are undaunted. You are not a mere human. You are talented. You are an ESPer, with powers undreamed of by your peers. You may be a telepath, a seer able to see into the future, a Shaman able to kill with a glance or perhaps able to talk to the teeming masses of the dead as a powerful Necroscope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
