							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Virhemoth</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the current universe was formed, the ancient primordial gods set the task of shaping it to a four-fold being now known as the Hemoth. Its aspects are normally considered separate, though scholars acknowledge they are inextricably linked by more than just a shared history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the Sarhemoth destroyed what came before &amp;mdash; that universe which can no longer be known to mortals and immortals alike. After this work was done, the Inhemoth set the frame of separation between the planes. Scholars call it &amp;ldquo;the spider,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the wall-builder,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the shelves upon which the many worlds rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What has become of these beings, if they still exist in some form or another, is not common (or even uncommon) knowledge. There are weird, intenebrated wizards who claim to know the truth, and others who go searching the four corners of the world for it. Which of them are scurrilous charlatans and which are madmen driven to their doom by arcane powers? Who can say!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two aspects of the Hemoth are better-known. A pair of humanoids &amp;mdash; one golden, one black &amp;mdash; embodying the motivating forces of life and the elements in this new creation. Cults have grown up around each of this pair, dwindling in numbers over time, only to rise again eons later. The Lohemoth was once the fountainhead of fellowship, harmony, and unity. But he has been greatly debased over the course of millions of years, and now exists only in the form of the golden goliath, a near-mindless divinity enslaved by chaotic magicians. The Virhemoth, on the other hand, still maintains a cult who worships her as the source of all struggle and strife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
