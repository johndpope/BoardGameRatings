			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rodolfo A. Pelvoux (1889 - 1938?) first appears in Turin in the last months of 1918, after spending the war years in &amp;quot;rambling travels&amp;quot;, as he will write in one of his own diaries in the following years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a short time as a guest in some friend's home on the Turin Hill, he buys and furnishes a small independent house in a street by Corso Massimo D'Azeglio, a few hundred yards from the Valentino Park; here he makes his home, with a pair of servants (Filiberto Barba, gardener and handyman and his wife Giuseppina, cook and maid) and soon the place is famous with the neigbours for the loud music - american jazz during social evenings, or more frequently, opera - that a gramophone by a window on the first floor plays on summer evenings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
