							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cardz</name>
									
			<description>Cardz is a set of 78 letter cards.  There are three basic suits with 22 letters in each suit (one of everything except J, Q, X, and Z).  There is also a wild suit which has the difficult letters, one of each vowel, and three totally wild cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included for a number of different games, mostly adaptations of traditional card games (there's Cardz Rummy, different versions of Cardz Poker, etc.).  The game that isn't an adaptation of a card game is very similar to Upwords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Kidz Cardz set was also sold - this has the same deck and many of the same games, but removes the rummy and poker games and adds some simpler ones (one based on war, for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background of the game is of some interest.  It was invented by Hannah Cannon, a 12-year-old girl whose father formed a company to market it and managed to get a fair amount of publicity for it - Hannah was interviewed on Good Morning America and got a one-page writeup in People magazine.  (Her father, Doran William Cannon, is a former screenwriter who seems to be good at promotional activities.)  It was supposedly sold in places such as Waldenbooks and Bloomingdale's, but references to it are hard to find now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
