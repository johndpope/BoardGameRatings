			<description>Lightyears from earth there is a small planet called Caturn-1. In many ways it is very similar to Earth of about 1000 years ago. There are castles, roads, trees and farms but unlike Earth there are no humans! Felines control the planet. Felines from the four great kingdoms, Forest, Fire, Sea, and Sky. For hundreds of years these four great kingdoms have battled for control of Caturn-1. Until Wildwood proposed a battle to end all battles. Each kingdom will send a FELINE FIGHTING FORCE of eight members to battle for control of the realm and the winning kingdom will rule Caturn-1 forever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 8 cats, 2 traps, and 2 food laid out face down in front of them. Players take turns attacking opponents by revealing one card from an opponents field and resolving using numbered battled cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
