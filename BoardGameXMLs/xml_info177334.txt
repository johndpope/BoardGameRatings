							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Slayers</name>
									
			<description>There are stars that have been determined to be causing problems with the balance of the universe. Pilots have been tasked with traveling to these stars and firing weapons at them in an attempt to destroy them and set the balance right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Slayers is a dexterity game where players are tossing, throwing or sliding 3 Star Slayer ship cards at 5 stars with point values on them from 1 to 5. The ships only fire in certain directions. A line is traced from the weapons to the stars to determine if points are gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition of Star Slayers is included on the back side of the cards from the first edition of Bocce Piatta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
