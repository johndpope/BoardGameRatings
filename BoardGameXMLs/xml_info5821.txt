			<description>Players represent Crime Families trying to purchase legitimate businesses with cash acquired through illegal activities, such as money laundering and making hits on other families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a 'Godfather', a 'Counselor', and up to six 'Soldiers'. Each piece moves by roll of a different colored set of dice, each slightly weighted either high (for the Godfather) or low (for the Soldiers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By collecting 'bounty' after making a hit, or transporting a briefcase to the 'transaction area', a player earns money. When he has enough, he may buy a factory, an apartment, or a pizza parlor. When a player has built all three legitimate businesses, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
