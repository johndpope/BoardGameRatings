			<description>A cross between Life and Monopoly with a Monopoly styled board.  This was self-published and has a very groovy 70s cover style and amateur feel to it.  You basically are trying to get enough money to be debt free and own a home (no remaining mortgage left).  First one able to do it wins.  there are some options on who you can control how many dice you roll (normally it is two, but you can pay money to allow you to roll only one or three).  Other than that, it is pretty luck-oriented with Paydays, Inheritance, and Jackpots you can hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
