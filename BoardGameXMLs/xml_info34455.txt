			<description>Two games in one box. Both games were the contest winners of Ravenburgers &amp;quot;Spielesammlung zum Ausprobieren&amp;quot; (Nr. 12023, ca. 1965). Out of 7 games, they were the 2 games with the most votings to get published on their own with new designed game boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Schubs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 board, 5 pawns in 4 colors, 1 die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pawns of the players have to be moved through a landscape, but each pawns needs the help of a second pawn. The cannot succeed on their own.  That forces cooperation, which noone can deny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Remmidemmi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 board (the back side of the board above), 5 pawns in 4 colors, 1 die&lt;br/&gt;In this turbulent game to bring your pawns to their destination, on ways, which directions xou cannot decide allways for yourself. Own skillfulnuess ist as important as dice luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
