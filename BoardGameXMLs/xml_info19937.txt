			<description>The object of the game is to keep the community clean and free of litter by collecting trash and depositing it in trash cans.  Each player travels around the board collecting litter as he lands on circles which picture litter.  He then deposits the litter in his trash container.  The player who picks up the most litter is the winner since he has been the most helpful in keeping the streets and walks clean and in stopping the LITTERBUG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places his litter barrel on the circle marked START.  Each player in turn then spins the spinner to determine the starting player.  The first player to spin GOLD begins the game by spinning the spinner and moving his barrel clockwise around the board to the nearest circle which matches the color shown on the spinner.  When a player lands on a colored space which is blank, he rests there until his next turn.  If he lands on a colored space upon which a picture of litter has been printed, he yells LITTERBUG and then takes one piece of litter from the trash pile at the CITY DUMP in the center of the board, and deposits it in his own barrel.  But, if he forgets to say LITTERBUG, he has to return the trash to the central pile.  If the colored circle is already occupied by a player and has litter on it, the player who lands there second (or third, etc.) yells LITTERBUG and collects two pieces of litter from the pile for his trash barrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a GOLD circle with a picture of a spinner, he yells LITTERBUG and immediately collects two pieces os litter from the trash pile at the CITY DUMP.  He then spins and moves his litter barrel to the next colored space that matches his spin.  If that space has litter on it, he may yell LITTERBUG and collect an additional piece of litter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in turn continue to spin the spinner, advance to the nearest circle which matches the color shown on the spinner and collect litter when landing on pictured circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all pieces of litter have been removed from the trash pile at the CITY DUMP.  At the end of the game each player counts the number of pieces of litter in his barrel.  The player who has collected the most litter is the winner because he has done the best job of cleaning the streets and sidewalks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for ages 4-10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
