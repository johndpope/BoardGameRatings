			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her Name Is Lilly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The daughter of brilliant scientists working for the Parasol Corporation, Lilly is one of the world's foremost chemical engineers working in the field of fashion and beauty.  In the world of Earth in 2016, her products are rapidly becoming ubiquitous, and there's no telling how far she will go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seriously, there's no telling, because in her free time she likes to blow stuff up to free female Incomplete Clones from slavery, and she has a secret lair where she's working on a plan to have the perfect child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those men that have been turning up dead and missing?  Some of them failed to pass Lilly's inspection, and ended up dead.  The missing ones?  They're not so lucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the enigmatic Lilly Celine and her cadre of hyper-dedicated powered armor troops, the Skinless Guard.  Learn all about her plans, and see what can be done about them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Hot Chicks, nothing is ever quite what it seems, but make no mistake; Lilly is a mankiller, and she's only just begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
