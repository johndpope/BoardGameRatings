			<description>Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 jigged playing board, 20 cards, 4 3-D buses, 1 dice,&lt;br/&gt;1 instruction leaflet&lt;br/&gt;Object is to collect cards based on the &amp;lsquo;Wheels on the Bus&amp;rsquo; song. There are 5 cards to collect and place into the slots in your bus. Each card has a coloured top corresponding to the slots, and illustrates a part of the song.&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, the player throws the die and moves round the board. If he lands on a bus stop, he takes the card 'waiting' there. The player puts the card in the corresponding coloured slot in the top of their bus, then everyone should sing and make the actions for the illustration shown on the card. So if the player has collected a windscreen wipers card, everybody sings and makes the actions for &amp;lsquo;the wipers on the bus go swish swish swish&amp;rsquo; etc. No two cards of the same type can be collected. When you have five cards, you make your way to the bus station to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
