			<description>EverQuest: The Scars of Velious (SoV, Velious, or simply the Velious expansion) is the second expansion released for EverQuest, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). The expansion focuses on high-level content (levels 35 and up), providing many extremely powerful monsters to fight and a number of zones meant to be used by large groups of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion takes place on the continent of Velious, an icy continent towards the south of Norrath. The title refers to three chasms in Velious that are said to be the place where the great dragon Veeshan struck the continent with her claws. One of these claw marks is believed to be in a zone known as The Great Divide, an area where the Coldain have established their home in the mountain side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion introduced both Frost giants and Coldain dwarves to the EverQuest universe, as well as a new sect of dragons known as the Claws of Veeshan. Players could ally their characters with any of the three factions, and fight against the others to gain rewards exclusive to their chosen faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion is also notable for introducing the Sleeper's Tomb zone, a locked zone that players could unlock with a key from a quest, and vanquish the four dragons that guarded The Sleeper, a very powerful beast that should never be unleashed. The first players completing this zone led to the first world changing event, where The Sleeper would awaken and rampage his way through Norrath. This however also led to some controversies as the zone itself would change and some items that used to be available before the awakening would no longer be present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scars of Velious also reintroduced Ethereal Planes such as the Plane of Growth, home of Tunare (goddess of nature) and the Plane of Mischief. Those planes, just like the original Planes (Hate, Fear and Sky) required players to have reached the level of 46 in order to enter. Plane of Growth also reintroduced the notion of Planar armor, providing a full set for each class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;EverQuest: The Scars of Velious&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
