							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Used Car Lot</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 40 inch, Battlemap of a Car Lot and Derelict Buildings, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is vandalism of the highest order. Those ganger punks have smashed up every car on my lot!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Used Car Lot Owner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used Car Lot is a single level exterior and interior map of a used car lot in the northwest, two abandoned warehouses to the northeast and southwest, and an abandoned drive-in diner in the southeast. This set includes four vehicles&amp;mdash; two dirty, old used muscle cars, a shattered car, and a rusted, filthy pickup truck&amp;mdash;and six cargo containers&amp;mdash;three slightly used cargo containers with some dirt and grime and three rusted, weathered cargo containers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used Car Lot is intended for use in modern games as a rundown neighborhood or in post-apocalyptic games with the included vehicles and cargo containers for use with those genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Cars! My Cars!: A used car lot owner refused to pay protection money to the local gang and woke up to every car in his lot smashed by baseball bats and tire irons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The used car lot owner reached out to local law enforcement but the gangers smashed all his cameras to bits as well, leaving no evidence of their crime for the police to make an arrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the used car lot owner reaches out to the player characters for help with his problem after the police left after writing their report. He wants the local gang squatting in the surrounding abandoned buildings gone. He wants their faces and bodies smashed and broken like they left his poor cars. After that, he wants the buildings rigged for demolition, with the unconscious, dying, or dead gangers inside. With the abandoned buildings gone, hopefully no new gang will come to the area to take their place. These are criminal acts&amp;mdash;assault and battery, arson, destruction of property, and murder&amp;mdash;but the used car lot owner is willing to pay big money for his vengeance. Alternatively, he offers them a used car as payment. He can also offer them a deal to make their own car from the parts left over from his wrecked vehicles if one of the player characters is mechanically inclined and they don&amp;rsquo;t trust him to give them a good car. He&amp;rsquo;ll also pay them to fix his wrecked cars if they can as well after they do the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
