							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Plains FUBAR</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some arrive on the frontier chased by ghosts of the past, others seek vengeance against those who have wronged them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some have been left for dead, others leave trails of dead in their wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the wild frontier, FUBAR isn't a recent state of mind. Things have been going wrong since Europeans came to the high plains, and when things go badly enough, that's when ghost towns are formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Plains FUBAR is the first genre supplement for the FUBAR roleplaying game. It is designed to provide a few optional rules to tell the stories you'd normally see in western movies and novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
