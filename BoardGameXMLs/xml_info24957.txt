							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pattern Blocks Games</name>
									
			<description>This is a set of rules and tools that allow games to be played with HearthSong's &amp;quot;Pattern Blocks&amp;quot; (PB) (not included). A set of PB consists of 250 flat wooden pieces in geometric shapes: hex, square, parallelogram, triangle, diamond, trapezoid.  The shapes are all the same scale and based on a fundamental angle of 30 degrees - like a super Tangram set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supporting bits include a protractor, a very nice spinner for selecting one of the PB shapes, three d6 (one 'regular', one with the six PB piece colors, and one with angles in 30 degree increments), Tangram and 'mandala' cue cards, and four sturdy game boards.  This equipment (and a PB set) lets you play the five games described in the rules.  The games are a mix of non-competitive pattern-making games, and races to be first to make specific shapes or patterns.  All are well thought out to teach basic geometric principles and/or excite the imagination (as if geometry wasn't exciting enough).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are well-made and are totally conducive to creating new games, the spinner and dice especially.  The skills being taught by the five supplied games are grade school level, but as games I think one or two of these could challenge many adults.  I'm tempted to order a PB set just to try some of them - and of course make beautiful designs in my spare time.  Building blocks of any kind are good clean fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
