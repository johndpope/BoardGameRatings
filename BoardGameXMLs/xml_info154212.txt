			<description>Publisher's Blurb: Revenant is a game designed for one Player and one Narrator to tell a story about passion beyond death. Inspired heavily by films such as Ghost and The Crow, Revenant is about wanting something so bad that you will defy the laws of mortality to see it done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using playsets called Mementos, the Player can create her character with Passion enough to crawl out of the grave and accomplish an all-encompassing Drive. The Narrator is responsible for creating the obstacles that will stand in the Player's way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revenant is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. This PDF is available for free and may be freely distributed under the terms of its license. You are encouraged to come up with Mementos of your own to share with other Narrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
