							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catch Zoboo If You Can!</name>
									
			<description>Find the most matching pairs of Zoboo and his friends to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a basic memory game with a few twists.  The game includes 48 game cards and a 2 1/2&amp;quot; painted, plastic Zoboo figure.  In addition to the 16 pairs of animals, there are 16 extra tiles with the following special rules:&lt;br/&gt;- 10 Take Zoboo Cards: When you get a pair of these, you get to take the Zoboo figure from the table or from the player who has it.&lt;br/&gt;- 4 Lose a Pair Cards: When you get a pair of these, you lose ONE of the pairs you have.  Return that pair and the &amp;quot;Lose a Pair&amp;quot; cards to the box.&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Wild Cards: ANY other card you pick with this card (including Lose a Pair and Take Zoboo) becomes and instant pair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After there are no more matches to be made, players count up all the cards they have.  The player who has the Zoboo figure at this time adds an extra 4 points to their score.  The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
