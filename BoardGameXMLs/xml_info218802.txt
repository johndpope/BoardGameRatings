							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beast of Brookhayven</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;==Brookhayven Needs Heroes&lt;br/&gt;Will You Answer The Call To Adventure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our team of DeepDark Designers is excited to bring you The Beast of Brookhayven, our latest offering hot off the digital presses for use with the 5e OGL ruleset and the materials that can be found for free online in SRD 5.1. Within this 34-page adventure module, you'll find the town of Brookhayven. An usually quiet, backwater town that's currently gripped in the throes of fear and superstition. A terrible monster, known only as The Beast, has made the farmsteads and landholdings that surround the settlement its hunting grounds - and Brookhayven has seen an influx of refuges seeking shelter from the nightmarish monster as a result. However, despite the far-reaching consequences of its sinister presence, not all that much is known about The Beast. It falls to the PCs to investigate the nefarious being, learn more of its true nature, hunt it down, and, ultimately, slay it; all while contending with a terrified populace and a baron whose given himself over to madness, as well as discovering the true nature of a mysterious figure rumoured to be working alongside The Beast. All in a day's work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beast of Brookhayven provides adventuring materials for a 3rd-level party of 3-5 PCs and should see them to 4th-level by its conclusion. It offers optional and modular content, numerous suggestions for expanding on the adventure and really making it your own, and enough materials for 2-6 sessions, depending on how rust your players are at monster slaying. The Beast of Brookhayven provides a standalone experience that doesn't require any other adventures or a lot exposition to make sense of its narrative, although it also pressents an opportunity to be combined with another upcoming adventure by DeepDark Designs that's being developed for PCs of 1st to 3rd-level; Woes of the Whispering Tree. Additionally,  The Beast of Brookhayven is also suitable for use with most fantasy settings and makes few assumptions on the part of the game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
