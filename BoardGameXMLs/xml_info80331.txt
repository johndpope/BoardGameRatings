			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Hack is a first-person-perspective, pseudo-3D dungeon crawler with a gameplay interface based on SSI's own Eye of the Beholder III.  Also like Eye of the Beholder III, the game uses the rules from 2nd edition AD&amp;amp;D, and characters can be created using AD&amp;amp;D's set of classes and races.  However, the game itself owes many gameplay elements to Rogue.  The player controls a single character (rather than a party of up to six as in the Eye of the Beholder series), permanent death with deletion of associated save games is an option, and the dungeon is randomly generated.  The player's purported purpose is to find a magical orb, which invariably involves descending to the deepest level of the dungeon.  The true purpose of Dungeon Hack, however, is to provide the player with a replayable dungeon crawl uninterrupted by the complications of a plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was re-released in a number of compilations, including The Forgotten Realms Archive (1997), The Forgotten Realms Archive (Silver Edition) (1999), Forgotten Realms: The Archives Collection Three (1999), and Gamefest: Forgotten Realms Classics (2001).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
