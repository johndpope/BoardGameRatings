							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keeton Journeys</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game about Keeton, wandering medicine master in a far-off land of older days. Keeton travels across the countryside to villages troubled by natural spirit creatures called yōkai, whose motives and actions are wholly alien to human thought. This game is inspired by the animated series Mushishi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeton intently studies yōkai and knows their ways well. However, this does not always make his job easy. Helping a village troubled by a yōkai often requires sacrifices to be made by all, and some villagers resist that. Keeton must convince them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;In line with the competition's &amp;quot;no numbers&amp;quot; requirement, the rules interpret pipped faces of a d6 as picture types. For example, dots that connect to a straight line (conventionally, &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;) represent &amp;quot;the path&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
