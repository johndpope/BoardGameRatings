			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BroWars is fast, simple and exciting drinking game that can be played at home or in the pub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are TWO different games inside the tube (the game comes in a cardboard tube!) with different set of rules and components. There are called Brewery Variant and Pub Variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Brewery Variant players will compete in numerous quests to gather brewery tiles from the table. Each brewery tile has its color, logotype, cost and arrows in the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player chooses one of available brewery tiles and has to pay its cost which he does by placing enough quest cards from his hand on the table. Then according to arrows on the tile he, his opponent or all players chose one of just placed quest cards. Players then compete in that quest and the winner gets to take the tile they competed over. The looser has to drink. Cards can be also played as special actions that will change conditions for the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game players score points. 1 point for each collected brewery tile and bonus points for collected sets with similar color or logotype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pub variant is a bit more tactical. Each player gets 3 pub tiles and places them in front of him. Then everyone uses coin cards (with different values) and places them face-down below his pub tiles. Players have to defend those coins and steal other players' coins. In order to defend them each player puts 6 quest cards face down in front of their pubs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, a player chooses one of opponents' pubs that he wants to attack and has to initiate a  quest duel depending on the cards that defends the pub. If successful, he then initiate another duel that protects that pub. Otherwise the defender takes up a turn. After beating all quest cards, attacker claims the defender's pub and all coins below. The game ends when one players is left with no pubs. Whoever has the most coins, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
