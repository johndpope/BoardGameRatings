							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Wars: Shaggai Map Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This new map represents the planet of Shaggai, annihilated centuries ago. It is, of course, the original home of the Insects from Shaggai (who made their appearance in Onslaught Two). In those days, the horrendous hellworld Ghroth wandered too near Shaggai, and initiated the process that resulted in Shaggai&amp;rsquo;s complete destruction. The map of course is set during the time of Shaggai&amp;rsquo;s eradication, which is represented by the Worms of Ghroth &amp;ndash; horrendous tools of woe which spread across the surface, leaving oblivion in their wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is divided into hex-shaped areas, representing the insectile nature of the world&amp;rsquo;s native inhabitants. Some are oceans, other land, and the game starts with a single Worm of Ghroth &amp;ndash; a harbinger of ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, each Doom phase existing Worms of Ghroth tend to annihilate the areas they are on, and new Worms are spawned. Eradicated areas actually generate power, and can even benefit the players. For example, if your controlled gate gets eradicated, you earn an Elder Sign. For each unit that is eradicated, you earn 1 Power. The Power gain may not be enough to make up for losing a big monster or Great Old One, but at least it helps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, after all, the destruction has been telegraphed by the presence of a Worm &amp;ndash; so you had your chance to escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shaggai map has other fun elements. For example, you can &amp;ldquo;jump over&amp;rdquo; Eradicated areas, and thus access the map more easily. This does cost a unit though, so be sure to include someone cheap to sacrifice to the hungry void. Also, if the map deteriorates too far, the game can end regardless of whether anyone has 30 Doom yet. In such a case, all players add up their Doom and Elder Signs and see who is victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
