							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World War II: the Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Fast WW2 Grand Strategic game with a card driven system with very few Military Operational Forces (Mof's represented by wooden tokens) on a 22 inches X 18 inches strategic Map board for a 2 player game in less than 90 minutes. The World map is divided into multiple territories connected by land or sea. All Seven Major Powers with many Neutral Countries are included; all theaters of War involved from fall 1939 through 1945 including Research up to the Atomic Bomb. This game is fast and at most there will be less than 6 Mof&amp;rsquo;s per Major Power on the board at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes control of the Axis or the Allies. Each Major Power when it enters the WAR gets its own specific Operational deck of cards that the player can draw from during each round or season to form his hand. The number of cards is determined by the control of key territories and conquered Neutral countries. These cards represent Military forces and Supplies. With these in hand, the player may now create Mof&amp;rsquo;s, move Mof&amp;rsquo;s and initiate land, sea and air combat along with Warfare and research. He may play some, all or no card at all during any turn that is part of a round until each player passes in succession. The game lasts 20 rounds or seasons. Although this game is card driven, a player is never restricted to any territory and may operate any Mof anywhere on the map board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Axis win as soon as they control at least 2 Allied Major Powers.&lt;br/&gt;The Allies win as soon as they control Berlin and Tokyo.&lt;br/&gt;Any other result at the end of winter 1945 is an Axis win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game tries to capture the WW2 strategies and tactics and tries to recreate the feel and excitement of a complete global conflict in less than 90 minutes. Did we succeed? You have the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; </description>
