			<description>Autumn For Barbarossa, (AfB) is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game that was published in Special_Ops magazine #7 (2017), covering the the struggle to seize Smolensk in the late summer of 1941. This marks the end of the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa and the stabilization of the front until the effort to take Moscow in Operation Typhoon in the fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AfB features a small map area and a limited number of units, making it easily accessible for fast or competition play. The entire campaign finishes in 10 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins with the German offensive in full bloom. The German player attempts to rapidly seize as much of the map (in the form of Victory Point locations) as he can. Speed is essential; while he has several cities to reduce, he knows the clock is ticking before Hitler pulls the plug on his efforts. The commanders did not realize this was in the cards, but for design purposes we assume the player feels the pistol pointed at his head. The Germans have copious air and mechanized forces to accomplish their goals...for the moment. At some point determined by the &amp;quot;Hitler Roll&amp;quot;, the German mechanized forces are taken off the map, their air support is cut in half, and the Red counteroffensive strikes in an attempt to turn things around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soviet player stalls, withdraws, and conserves his forces while letting the German offensive expend itself. As the high tide passes, he prepares his rebuilt Red Army for the second half of the game: the Soviet effort to blunt the German gains and recoup their losses as best they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 6 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 7 miles / 11.2 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Regiment to Division&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory (Special Ops edition):&lt;br/&gt;One 16 x 28&amp;quot; full color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page Autumn for Barbarossa rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 3-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need to provide the following:&lt;br/&gt;Two 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;Latest version of the Standard Combat Series rules from - &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/scs.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/scs.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
