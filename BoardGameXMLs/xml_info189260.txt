			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have seven Attributes (Strength, Endurance, Agility, Perception, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) with Scores ranging from 2-12.  Scores are randomly generated or assigned from a standard array.  Characters next select a race (Human, Elf, Dwarf, or Orc) and Skills.  Characters start with 8 Skill points and gain new points with each experience level.  Some Skills are character specialties that grant certain Abilities (roughly analogous to Feats).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution involves a modified D10 roll compared to a target number or defense.  The remainder of the rules list weapons, armor, items, and magic items, explain alchemy, and have suggestions to the Campaign Manager including resources and a bestiary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
