			<description>BARBARIANS &amp;amp; EMPIRES - OCCIDENT ARENA, takes you and your fellow players to the ancient world at the beginning of the third century BC. In this edition you are fighting for the supremacy in the western Mediterranean and Western Europe, the geographical area which the Romans and Byzantines designated as Occident. In the western Mediterranean powers, the Greeks, the Carthagians and the Romans compete for hegemony; in the north are powerful nations such as the Celts, Germans, and Dacians, who, if they are not at war to each other, aspire to the warm, sweet and rich regions of the South. The Iberians fight for their own survival. It was the time shortly after the Celtic storm on Rome, done by Brennus and after the death of Alexander the Great. It was the period of the Punic wars, followed by the beginning of the Germanic invasions of the Cimbri and Teutones, which once again placed Rome at a great danger. They were defeated only by consul Marius after his military reforms. Now you play for the supremacy in the Occident in those last pre-Christian centuries, in which the gates of the Roman Temple of Janus were only closed once. Choose your people and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While playing, you have to successfully develop several skills to win, namely those of a military strategist, a prudent economist and a skilled diplomat. Increase your empire revenue through urban development, conquests and through your navy, which dominates the trade revenue in sea zones. Use your diplomats and support your army leaders or trade with other players, instigate revolts, gain neutral provinces peacefully, manipulate the opposing army commander, or send huge sums of money to support your allies. Secure your domains by garrison troops and fortifications. Build powerful armies, recruit the best of your people to increase the performance of your army, and develop strategies to force your powerful enemies to their knees. Hope, that Fortuna favors you. May the gods be with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reach the supremacy of your nation in the Occident. You can achieve this dominance by leading the victory-chart at the end of 8 rounds or you can eliminate one of your adversaries in a Deathmatch by conquering his last province. Several winners in different order categories are possible. If a last province of an opponent has been conquered by your army, you place one of your markers on the skulls on the game board. No matter how the game evolves, you are one of the game winners, as long as you do not lose your last province, too. Any player remains in the game until he has completely lost his last province (does not apply to the nation of BRITANNIA, they stay always in the game!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
