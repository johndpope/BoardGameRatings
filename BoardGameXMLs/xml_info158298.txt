							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FAzE Nightclub</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music pulses.  Strobe lights flash. Lasers create intricate shapes on the walls and floor, timed perfectly with the music blaring through the massive speakers mounted on the walls.  The dance floor is filled with twenty-somethings that add their own energy to the room as they dance maniacally to the rhythm of the music.  The DJ bobs his head while adjusting the soundboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then a pistol is drawn.  Shots ring out.  A woman screams, and then everything slows to a crawl.  Like a scene out of a John Woo movie, bullet holes materialize in the walls in slow motion as horrified partiers flee the dance floor seeking safety from the fight to come.  Tables are flipped over and people dart for cover behind columns or walls, hoping to escape the carnage...or add their own to the mix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is FAzE Nightclub, an upscale techno nightclub.  Fill it with the enemies of your choice and watch the carnage unfold!  Use it for a boss fight with a criminal mastermind and his minions as they try to enjoy an evening on the town, only to have it spoiled when your players arrive looking for trouble.  Or send horrifying abominations in to attempt to capture your player's as they themselves try to relax.  There are endless possibilities spending a night at FAzE.  Explore them today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Standard 1&amp;quot; = 5' Scale.&lt;br/&gt;     60&amp;quot; x 40&amp;quot; in size.  Print out the entire night club or just print out the sections you need.&lt;br/&gt;     This is a nightclub, and as such, it is a night map, complete with lights and shadows to really make the club pop.  * The undecorated version is a day map, if you really need one for your game.&lt;br/&gt;     Square, and No Grid versions.  Sorry, no hex grid this time around.&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color versions &amp;ndash; These maps are printer intensive, full color versions of each level.&lt;br/&gt;     No Decoration versions - For those that wish to populate the nightclub with your own vision, this is the map for you.&lt;br/&gt;     VTT Map &amp;ndash; If you prefer to play your games online, there is an included VTT map properly sized for use with VTT software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
