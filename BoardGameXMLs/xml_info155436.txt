			<description>From the Publisher: &amp;quot;Join Cinderella and Prince Charming on a magical journey in this Pop-Up Magic Cinderella's Coach game! The gameboard for this Disney-themed game has a beautiful coach for imagining Cinderella as she travels to the ball. You can play the game as either Cinderella or Prince Charming, and move along the path with spins of the spinner. Connect the board to other Pop-Up Magic games (other games sold separately) for a longer path and even more magic. Friend tokens can help you move even farther down the path, and if you reach the enchanted Finish stone on the board, you win!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a spin-and-move race to the finish, with an added memory mechanism, as the player attempts to uncover their &amp;quot;Friend Tokens.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
