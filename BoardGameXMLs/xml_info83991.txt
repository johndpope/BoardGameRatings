							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master of the Amulets</name>
									
			<description>user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is MicroQuest 7 in the Metagaming series.  Unlike other products in the series, this is not a programmed adventure where you look up paragraphs in a book.  It includes an adventure map showing mountains, forests, rivers, etc., and rules for generating random encounters as players explore the map searching for the amulets.  It also includes rules for negotiating with enemies instead of fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dirringar was the Black Council's most powerful Wizard.  Yet he wanted more.  He created cursed amulets for his enemies and mystic amulets for himself.  When Dirringar activated the Great Amulet he'd gain power over all.  But, the Black Council's conjuring exploded the Great Amulet, scattering lesser amulets across Dirringar's Lost Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend holds that Dirringar's mystic amulets may still be sought by the brave or foolish. It's even said that Dirringar's gates can be controlled and the valley's entrance gained by his amulets.  The brave may seek, the clever find and the lucky escape.  Power awaits, can you take it?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
