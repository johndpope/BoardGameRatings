							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penguin&#039;s Night Out</name>
									
			<description>A race game on an ever-changing field for 2 to 4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You've kept your beak to the grindstone with a hard week of catching fish and keeping eggs warm. Now it's time to gather your friends together, group at your nest, then head into town to party the night away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unfortunately there's only one dog sled available to go into town, so the first group that's ready to leave gets to ride in style, while everyone else has to walk. To complicate matters, local drilling is causing the ice to crack and shift unpredictably. The path that you take to get to your buddies may not be there on your way home. On top of that, the Polar Bear Gang has been making life tough, so you'll have to be super-sneaky if you need to go through their territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Even so, you're not going to let these obstacles stop you. You deserve a break, and you'll be darned if you're going to make the long, cold, 60-mile hike to town on flipper. Be the first one to gather your buddies up and get home again and you'll be ready for a...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Penguin's Night Out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To be the first player to collect all of your buddies and return home on an ever-shifting playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A set of double-six dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;    * A penguin pawn for each player. Assorted chess pieces work well.&lt;br/&gt;    * Two buddy tokens for each player. Pocket change is a good choice.&lt;br/&gt;    * Two six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;    * Paper and pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponents take turns moving around the board (made up of dominoes) and altering the board. End your turn in your nest while carrying both of your buddy tokens to be the first group to get your   dog sled into town and win the game. Yippee!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the rules here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/113/penguins-night-out&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/113/penguins-night-out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
