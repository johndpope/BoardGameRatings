							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ryu-Ki System: Sunserra</name>
									
			<description>It is a world of light and darkness, where magic erupts into the world in blazing fountains of raw energy. Where darkness tugs at every heart and evil offers real power to those foolish or insane enough to offer their own humanity in trade. Where heroes harness the power of their own spirit to accomplish deeds far beyond the scope of normal folk. A world where magic and technology had once coexisted in a magichanical paradise that somehow went wrong; only this time, it was the technology that faded away. A world filled with hideous monstrosities and horrible demons that come not from places beyond space and time, but from the evil in a human's soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first setting for the Ryu-Ki System, the world of Sunserra is a gothic fantasy world of sword and sorcery where the players take on the roles of heroes striving to hold at bay the forces of darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
