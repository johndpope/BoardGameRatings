			<description>Kid Klown in Crazy Chase (キッドクラウンのクレイジーチェイス) features the Kid Klown, the player character who must rescue the Princess Honey from the villain Dirty Joe. Players view gameplay from an isometric perspective as Kid Klown pursues a lit fuse in order to stop it from reaching a powder keg. The game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance and features 11 new levels, four mini-games, and a multi-player mode. The re-release was released in Europe and North America in October 2002, while a release in Japan was planned but ultimately canceled. It was met with mixed reception from critics, who found it to be inferior to other games of its type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control the player character Kid Klown as he attempts to rescue Princess Honey from the villain Dirty Joe. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Joe's plans of blowing up a space ship in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown does not make it to the space ship in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. In the Game Boy Advance re-release, the developers added 11 new levels and four unlockable mini-games, as well as a multi-player mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kid Klown in Crazy Chase&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
