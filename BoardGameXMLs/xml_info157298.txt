			<description>Squarit is a played on a board containing 16 squares each surrounded by four spaces for tiles, with each pair of adjacent squares sharing one tile space. Each tile space has a specific tile that can be placed on it. The squares are numbered from 4-64 by fours. The edges of the board are also numbered, from 1-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in two ways. In the aptly-named &amp;quot;Game of Chance&amp;quot; two to five players take turns drawing a tile and placing it on its designated space. The player placing the fourth tile around a square scores the value of the square multiplied by the value of the edge of the board corresponding to the played tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Game of Skill&amp;quot; is for two players. The scoring rule is the same, but here each player starts with half the blocks and can choose which one to play, generally speaking. If three sides of a block have been played this forces the fourth side to be played as soon as possible, and if that is the third tile for another square it forces that fourth tile immediately, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer patented the game some years before publishing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the board shown in the patent is not exactly the same as the published version, as the rules state the squares in each quarter of the board sum to 136.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
