			<description>&amp;quot;Juegos olimpicos&amp;quot; (Olympic Games) is a game for the whole family, consisting of different Olympic events (marathon, long and high jump, hammer throw, sprint race...) wich take place in different boardgames, each with it's own rules and mechanics. After each event, the winners receive individual medals (gold, silver and bronze) and at the end of the Olympics, after having competed in all events (having played in all the boardgames), the one who has amassed the largest number of medals, taking into account its value (a gold medal is worth more than two bronze), is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
