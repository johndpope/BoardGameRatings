			<description>Dallifant is a game of pattern recognition for children ages 4-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 5 chips (the white one is a spare), and you spread out the elephants so that everyone can see and reach them. One player rolls the two dice, and all players look for the elephant that shows the two colours that were rolled. If you spot it, place one of your chips on it. The first player's chip stays on the elephant, everyone else has to take theirs back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there was no chip on this elephant previously, nothing happens. If it had one of your chips on it already, both chips stay on it, and this colour combination is ignored from now on (i.e., there cannot be more than two chips on an elephant). If someone else's chip was on it, they receive their chip back and yours stays on. The next player then rolls the dice, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gets rid of their 5 chips first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two more things: &lt;br/&gt;1) You can hold a chip in your hand, but not hover above the elephants before the dice are rolled.&lt;br/&gt;2) It is recommended that whoever rolls the dice calls out the colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
