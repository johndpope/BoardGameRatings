			<description>Federation Commander: First Missions is a print &amp;amp; play demo version of Federation Commander: Klingon Border that has been stripped down to the essentials. This is a game of starship combat for two players where one player controls up to three Federation heavy cruisers and the other player controls up to three Klingon battle cruisers. Players move their ships simultaneously on a hex map and maneuver for optimal firing positions on the opponent while trying not to leave their own ships too vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes two scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;The Duel -- a simple ship vs. ship battle where the goal is to either destroy the opponent's ships or force them to disengage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iridima Convoy -- The Federation player must defend a freighter convoy against the attacking Klingon player. The Klingon player must prevent at least half of the freighters from reaching their destination or else the Federation player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game also includes rules for tabletop play with miniatures on a hexless surface. This is provided as an alternative to the traditional hex-and-counter rules for those who prefer free-form movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
