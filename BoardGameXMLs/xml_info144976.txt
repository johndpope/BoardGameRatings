			<description>Promised Land is a Book of Mormon themed card game. The object is to use items like the Brass Plates, Tree of Life, and Sword of Laban to overcome obstacles like Wandering, False Traditions and King-men. Other cards include numbers in 4 different colors, skip and roll. Be the first to get rid of all your cards and you'll prosper in the land. Be careful, things can change quickly with the roll of the die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows from 2-8 players, so it is designed for bigger groups and families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Stephen Wood and Illustrated by Jennifer Eichelberger. Published by Covenant Communications, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
