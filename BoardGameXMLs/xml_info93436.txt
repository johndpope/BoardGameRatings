			<description>Zany Golf, also known as Will Harvey's Zany Golf, is a video game with a fantasy take on miniature golf. The game is played in a 3D isometric viewpoint and allows up to 4 players. Zany Golf is a version of mini golf with some features that are impossible in real, physical mini golf. Zany Golf only consists of half a golf course, i.e. 9 holes, although there is a bonus hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the first hole, all players are given five strokes. On completing each hole, the remaining players are given more strokes equal to the par of the next hole. If a player runs out of strokes, he or she is eliminated and the other players are allowed to continue. The game ends when all players are eliminated or when the last hole is completed, and the scorecard is displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Zany Golf&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
