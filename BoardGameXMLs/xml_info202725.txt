			<description>In Imperium:  From Republic to Empire, players control factions of influential Roman Senators, each with a unique combination of attributes.  Factions gain prestige points by successfully leveraging the strengths of their senators, political opportunities, senatorial influence, and treasuries as they engage in various aspects of Roman politics.  Prestige gained through popularity and success but can be just as easily lost through failures and conviction.  Victory is declared when one senator or faction has gained sufficient prestige as to be crowned the First Emperor of Rome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, success will require both competition and cooperation as all factions must work together to ensure the stability of Rome.  Failures of the Senate and unmet public demand will increase civil unrest, leading to revolt.  Excessive war involvement will overextend Rome&amp;rsquo;s military resources.  Spending more funds than what is available will bankrupt the State Treasury.  Any of these situations could ensure the fall of Rome causing all players to lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over approximately 10 rounds until a victory condition is met or until all players are defeated by the game.  Each round is made up of six distinct phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Election Phase:  &lt;br/&gt;Each player will take turns choosing offices to assign to Senators within their faction.  High Offices include High Consul, Low Consul, and Censor.  Lower offices include Praetor and Proconsul (assigned to govern one of the many provinces of Rome).  Player initiative is based on the overall faction prestige and 'bribes' made to the Assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senate Phase:  &lt;br/&gt;Factions holding high office will execute their offices' unique authority to raise legions, purchase grain subsidies, deploy legions to war, and assign Generals to lead.  Players may consult each other, but the final decision rests with those in power.  But beware&amp;mdash;an &amp;lsquo;Assassin&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Mob Incitement&amp;rsquo; card in the hands of a jealous senator played at the appropriate time can severely upset the balance of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Republic Phase:  &lt;br/&gt;Senators now perform their duties in positions throughout the Republic.  This may include: Proconsuls hiring auxiliary legions to enhance provincial defenses, Senators in Rome attempting to persuade others to joint their faction, and even certain senators engaging in corruption to gain needed funding.  Rome must also respond to random events such as public demands, barbarian raids, provincial insurrection, and plagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Phase:  &lt;br/&gt;Wars are now resolved.  If victorious, the general returns to Rome with additional prestige and the potential of war spoils.  A stalemate will cause the general to return to Rome having lost prestige due to eroding public confidence.  A defeat will end in death for the general, an increase in public unrest, and the affected province being overrun.  Victorious generals also have the option of &amp;ldquo;crossing the Rubicon&amp;rdquo; to engage in civil war with the Roman State in an attempt to secure an early win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trial Phase:  &lt;br/&gt;The Censor will prosecute corruption charges of the Senate.  For each successful conviction, the Censor gains additional prestige while the accused may either lose prestige or (in the case of murder or treason) be executed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intersession Phase:  &lt;br/&gt;Because time is the great equalizer--Senators may die randomly of natural causes.  Victory conditions are then checked and the game is reset for the next round of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperium:  From Republic to Empire was designed to be a simplified, more accessible alternative to Republic of Rome (Avalon Hill, 1990; Valley Games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Revised Edition (v2.0), was published in May 2018.  It has eliminated unnecessary complexity from the first edition to provide a smoother, more enjoyable, and less time-consuming playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
