							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 (And More) Male Breton First Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brittany, or Bretagne, is a region and peninsula that is part of modern-day France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breton is an Insular Celtic language in the Brittonic family, most closely related to Cornish and more distantly to Welsh and Cumbric. It is less closely related to the Gaelic languages, such as Manx, Irish and Scots Gaelic. The language was brought from what is now Britain to the region known as Armorica. The language is considered to be severely endangered today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement lists 100 Breton first names suitable for players and NPCs in a Celtic-inspired setting. The names listed have details of their meaning, and alternative spellings, if known. Together with the alternatives, there are more than 100 different names available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is an example from the table:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name: Gab Meaning: Strength of God Alternatives: Gabig&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one the introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
