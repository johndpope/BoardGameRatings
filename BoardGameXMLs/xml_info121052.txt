			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Reach is a set of three introductory adventures for Dungeon World. You are adventurers from Devil&amp;rsquo;s Reach, a little town on the backside of nowhere and people have been disappearing. To make matters worse there are a lot of new faces in town including some weirdo that the mayor brought but no one quite knows why. But the worst bit is that there is a cave, just outside of town that has been silent for years and it just started speaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you and your band of friends going to do? Find out in, Within the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Reach, the first in a series of adventure books that will take players across a wide fantasy world and pit them against pirates, dragons, mechanized undead and a god of pure reason and evil. The full adventure set, Gears of the Worm God, kicks off with a bang and ends in blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
