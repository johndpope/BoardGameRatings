			<description>Math Whiz is an educational and entertaining math quiz game for ages 12 and up. The game can be played by up to six persons or by up to six teams of two or more persons per team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to be a math whiz to win Math Whiz since it is a game of both chance and skill and is designed in such a way so as to allow a player of lesser math skills a chance to win against a math whiz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The math questions are keyed to the red, blue, green, yellow and brown spaces and the Triple Bonus circle. Players may use pencil and paper to work out solutions to the 1001 math questions. The player or team who first earns three each of the red, blue, green, and yellow chips is the winner and moves the player token into the Math Whiz circle at the center of the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
