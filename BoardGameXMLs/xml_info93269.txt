							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Let&#039;s Pilates</name>
									
			<description>Pilates is a body conditioning routine that focuses on building flexibility, strength, endurance, and coordination without adding muscle bulk. Pilates increases circulation and helps to sculpt the body and strengthen the body's &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;powerhouse&amp;quot; (torso). People who do Pilates regularly feel they have better posture, are less prone to injury, and experience better overall health. Now you can learn how to do Pilates, or keep up with your training wherever you go. Let&amp;rsquo;s Pilates is the first Pilates instructional software available for the Nintendo DS, and it's a treasure-trove of knowledge whether you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing Pilates for five years or five minutes. Best of all, with Let&amp;rsquo;s Pilates, you can train anywhere, anytime, without needing to be in class or in front of your TV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
