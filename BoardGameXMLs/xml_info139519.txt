			<description>A Game of Valence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to create the most particles. Players take turns dropping a proton on an empty cell. When a proton is dropped, the surrounding cells are examined in order to determine if an electron is to be created there or not. An electron is created in a surrounding cell if there is a majority of one color's protons surrounding that cell. In that case, the newly created electron takes on that color and orbits the surrounding protons. If the number of surrounding protons of either color is the same, then an electron is not created in that cell, or if the cell already contains an electron, that electron vanishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The score indicators display the total number of particles owned by each player. The game ends when no remaining proton placements are available. The player with the most particles wins. Ties are not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
