							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Front Page Sports: Football Pro</name>
									
			<description>The second version of the game. Front Page Sports: Football Pro was the first PC football game that allowed gamers to join an online league to compete. Each week during a simulated season, league members would send their team files to a designated commissioner to simulate the games. The commissioner would run the simulation and then return updated files to owners (typically via a web page) for the next week of play. Team owners could trade players with each other, make roster moves, and function as if they were real general managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Front Page Sports Football&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
