			<description>[From the back cover]&lt;br/&gt;RETRO is a lively and interactive team game suitable for four or more players, aged twelve and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the collections of London's three major art galleries, there are over two hundred cards with questions and answers on artists, art history, works of art or art techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, you pick up a card and read the question out loud to your team, reading the answer silently to yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your team mates cannot immediately answer the question, you may prompt them by hastily sketching clues using the pencil and pad provided.  No verbal or mimed clues are allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams move famous masterpieces around the coloured squares of a pallet shaped board attempting to collect three of each of the primary colored cards.  The first team with three blue, red and yellow cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
