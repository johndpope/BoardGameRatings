			<description>A game about building nightmares so terrifying you&amp;rsquo;ll see half of them in your dreams afterwards. You have cards representing Night Terrors, and the more of them you combine in the right order, the more monsters will come to life, and the more horrifying they become. Create monsters that will make your opponents gasp in horror. Nourish them with your own fear and make them stronger. Only then will you achieve victory and become the Master of Terror!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Night Terror is also associated with one of four Legions of Horror: Necromunculi, Constricti, Mansters, or Chimeridae. A Terror's legion is indicated by the color of the card's background: blue stands for Necromunculi, brown for Constricti, green for Chimeridae, and red for Mansters. A creature can be made up of any Night Terrors, but players are better off weaving Creatures out of cards that all belong to the same legion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one of the players completes five Creatures&amp;mdash;this player immediately becomes the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn you perform two actions, after which the next person to your left takes their his? turn. You can select any pair of actions out of three possibilities (you can also perform the same action twice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible actions &lt;br/&gt;A) Take a card from the deck &lt;br/&gt;B) Discard as many cards as you like from your hand and take half that number from the deck&lt;br/&gt;C) Play a card from your hand and activate a Creature abilities (if the Creature is complete).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as you complete a Creature (by adding a head to torso), perform all of its abilities top to bottom, starting with the Creature's head, proceeding with its torso, and ending with its legs. Abilities are activated one at a time in a very specific order. You cannot refuse to perform the abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the completed Creature is comprised of Night Terrors &lt;br/&gt;of the same legion (in other words, if all three cards that make up the Creature have the same background color), each of your opponents must discard one card of that legion from their hands before its abilities can be performed. If your opponent does not have an appropriate card, they must discard any two cards.&lt;br/&gt;Creature Abilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Herald: turn over two cards form the deck. Place them in front of you according to the usual rules if you can.   Discard any cards that you cannot play.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Weeper: take any two cards from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Mocker: play one card from your hand according to the usual rules.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Executioner: add the top card from any other player's Creature to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Scavenger: discard any vulnerable (incomplete) Creature.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Devourer: discard the top card from any of your Creatures other than this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
