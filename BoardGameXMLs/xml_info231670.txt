							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars: Imperial Assault â€“ Nal Hutta Swamps Skirmish Map</name>
									
			<description>Head to Nal Hutta to pursue your fortune, forge a temporary alliance, or execute a surgical military strike with the Nal Hutta Swamps Skirmish Map for Imperial Assault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This neoprene playmat offers an ideal play surface for all your skirmishes&amp;mdash;in tournaments or at home&amp;mdash;as it deposits you and your skirmish force atop the planet's bogs. Measuring 26&amp;rdquo; by 26&amp;rdquo;, this playmat features the entire map printed directly onto its surface, ensuring that your setup never takes more than seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra room around the borders of the gamemat allow you to set up your Deployment cards and tokens, as well as handy references for each team&amp;rsquo;s starting setup zones. You&amp;rsquo;ll even find additional copies of the Nal Hutta Swamps cards, and the gamemat evokes the spirit of Nal Hutta with evocative artwork of two of the mercenaries who might have dealings there. On one side, you'll find the infamous bounty hunter Boba Fett, ready to pursue any target the Hutts might name. Across from him, a battle-scarred Rodian seeks to make his own name with his blasters and his wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
