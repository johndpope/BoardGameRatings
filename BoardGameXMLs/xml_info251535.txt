			<description>In this real-time game, the players must simultaneously and continuously play cards on its own boards trying to defeat at least one of the different powers of any of the opponent's cards and take them. The effects of the played cards are instantaneous and change the powers and abilities of other cards in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds until the deck is empty (more players means less time). When this happens, the players count the total strength of the defeated cards, and who has more is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can also be played in constructed deck mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
