			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure game developed by J. and D. Amies. As the captain of the salvage ship &amp;quot;Narwal&amp;quot;, your mission is to find the wreck of the HMS Bearheart and retreive its precious gold cargo. As the ship is sunk near the arctic circle, you'll have to deal with the weather, as well as unstable explosives, hungry wildlife and other diving hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a text parser for command input with only 20 different commands available. The game doesn't have a set ending, it's up to the player to define winning conditions (the game manual suggests two, just finding the gold, or returning as much gold as possible to the port).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
