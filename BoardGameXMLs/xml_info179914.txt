							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlefield: American Civil War edition</name>
									
			<description>The Battlefield 2-player card game from NewVenture Games has been popular for some time. The American Civil War edition commemorates the 150th anniversary of that great conflict, the cards being completely redesigned to depict army units, officers, and civilians from the 1860s. One player assumes the role of the Union, the other plays Confederate units, meeting on the field of battle. In skirmish after skirmish, players deploy their forces card after card, fighting gallantly for their nation's survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the two decks contain 72 cards, from the volunteer infantry with aged muskets, to the advanced firepower of artillery and cavalry. Famous generals take to the field, supported by the Corps of Engineers, civilian support groups, and even the President may make an appearance. Hope to avoid disease and inclement weather, and hope for a prisoner exchange or timely reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
