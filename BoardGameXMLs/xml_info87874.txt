			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1092 in the Age of Itania. King Girart of Mirensa, villified as the killer of children, schemes to bring the Nine Kingdoms under his crown while Safiro of Tivonna engages magi and spies to thwart Girart&amp;rsquo;s ambition. Mad King Bertrant of Ossirenza bears the burden to defend the lands of Men against marauding Krek even as his galleys war on Tivonnan ships to satisfy his raging temperament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wild North the rangers, always outnumbered, battle the depredations of ruthless Kyaksa tribesmen who strike from mountain strongholds. In the steppes to the east the Solok tribes battle each other to satisfy the blood-lust of their gods and raid the West for its riches. The Vashaniin, an ancient and prideful people, spurn involvement in the affairs of Men while they prepare for the coming of a threat more dire than any of the petty squabbles of the West&amp;mdash;an enemy that even now may be probing the defenses of the gray walls of the mountains of the Eastern Divide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of Tarsa is a heroic fantasy Basic Roleplaying game setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASIC ROLEPLAYING MONOGRAPHS are longer works by one or more authors on a subject of import to Basic Roleplaying players. On these products the author has also fulfilled the functions of editor and layout artist; we at Chaosium have done little in the way of editorial. We found these works compelling and thought that you would enjoy them. Through the publication of monographs we can offer our most loyal fans more information more easily, and evaluate the potential of these works for eventual release to the wholesale market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
