							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DHL Worldwide Express Game</name>
									
			<description>This appears to be a promotional game distributed to DHL employees and/or customers (probably employees).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two phases.  In the first phase you move your DHL van around a track on the outside of the board (via die roll).  You can get Dispatch (event) cards and Shipment cards.  When you have five of the latter you have to get your van to an airport space, and you then fly your plane along the air routes in the middle of the board, trying to get to your five destination airports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can in theory go back to the airport where you left your van and start moving that again - the reason to do this would be to try to pick up Dispatch cards that set your clock back.  Each player has a cardboard dial on which they count up to 24 hours.  Cards can tell you to add or subtract hours, and every turn you move your plane takes an hour.  If you reach 24 hours without having made all your deliveries you automatically lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
