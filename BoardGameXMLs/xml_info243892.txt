							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bayhrst</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A series of low stone walls divides and encircles the village. The village itself is a fairly typical, small farming village. The low stone wall is about chest high and is more for keeping livestock from wandering into town than it is to keep any serious enemies out.  Bayhrst is somewhat off the beaten path and does not see a lot of trade. Its one and only claim to fame is the nearby battlefield called the Bone Fields. None of the locals will set foot onto the battlefield as there have been incidents in the past with a few restless dead and old magics still active. The townsfolk are growing increasingly worried about the activity and increased interest from strangers about the Bone Fields. People are spreading rumors and some folks are even thinking about leaving. Emotions are tense and fear is spreading through the town quickly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Instant Towns pdfs provide GMs with interesting NPCs and locations to use with or against your player group. Instant Towns can be interesting stops along the road, temporary bases from which to loot nearby ruins or side quests in between major campaign events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of each Town including tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors, town goings on, any stores, brothels or other significant places of interest in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
