							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman Miniature Game: Commissioner Gordon &amp; SWAT Team</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A dark knight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Jim Gordon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gotham City Police Department or GCPD / GDP are the thin blue line in Gotham. The men and women on the streets that have to deal with everything the city throws at them. In Gotham, with all those costumed characters around, that can be a lot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One notable man in the GCPD is James 'Jim' Gordon. Even as a rookie cop, Gordon planned to remove all signs of corruption from the GCPD. As he rose through the ranks, he gained allies in the form of the Batman and Gothams then District Attorney, Harvey Dent to help him create an honest police department and clean up the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gordon was the man to place the Bat Signal on the GCPD headquarters and while he was once secretive about working with Batman, he now openly uses the signal to call the Caped Crusader if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, as Commissioner, Gordon tries to carry on the fight against crime and corruption from the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even his daughter Barbara has joined the fight as the well know Batgirl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Batman Miniatures Game, the Law Forces are the normal men and women on the street trying to fight the madness around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commissioner Gordon is now a Gotham Veteran. Leading teams of cops and SWAT against the criminals. Armed with his trusty gun and never leaving the precinct without a Kevlar Vest, Gordon can even call in the GCPD Air Support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By his side you can often see Batgirl. While Jim doesn't like her living that life, he won't say no to her help. Able to get around the board with ease, Batgirl is great to send after anyone on rooftops or in hard to reach places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SWAT teams of the GCPD are some of the most well armed, trained and protected professionals in Gotham. Armed with battering rams, riot shields and a range of guns, the SWAT are the Elite force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The street cops of Gotham also join the fight. While they carry less equipment that the SWAT, the Cops can arrest any criminals that have been taken out and light up any targets for the big guns in the dark streets and back alleys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GCPD don't often call on the help of Free Agents but will sometimes make unlikely alliances with those that aren't considered all bad, just misguided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catwoman and Mr Freeze can join along side the cops. Even if it's just to get to the Loot from the crimes they are stopping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gotham City Police are great for those that want to take the normal people of Gotham and prove that costumes, capes and code names can still be stopped by anyone determined enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;Four white metal miniatures (Jim Gordon and three SWAT Members - Alpha, Bravo, and Delta)&lt;br/&gt;Stat cards for the figures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
