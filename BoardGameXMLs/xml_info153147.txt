							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cinders</name>
									
			<description>Cinders is a mature take on a classic fairytale with a heavy emphasis on player choice, lavishly illustrated by Gracjana Zielinska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinders is a witty young woman living with an overbearing stepmother and her two daughters, as if she was reenacting a certain well-known fairytale. But unlike its protagonist, Cinders is not afraid of taking fate into her own hands. Even if it means breaking the rules&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes a look at four women and what made them who they are. It&amp;rsquo;s a story about balancing freedom and dreams with circumstance and harsh reality. About growing up and finding out the true meaning of independence. Distancing itself from the judgmental simplicity of the original, Cinders tries to explore the more complex nature of oppression, responsibility and innocence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game focuses on characters and their motivations, with heavy emphasis on player choices and role-playing. With 120 decision points and over 300 options to choose from, Cinders allows you to shape the main character&amp;rsquo;s personality and the course of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why it&amp;rsquo;s cool:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-  A serious take on a classic fairytale story.&lt;br/&gt;  -  Gorgeous art and soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;  -  Your choices actually matter.&lt;br/&gt;  -  Active and witty female protagonist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
