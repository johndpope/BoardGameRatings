							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cubical Maze</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map can be played two different ways. It can be used as a standard layout of a floor of the Synergon building. The Boss determines how many departments are located within the maze and also predetermines certain cubicles where useful items can be found. If the frenemy occupying a cubicle is Demoralized, the attacking employee inherits any items inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second option is to use this map in a sort of turf war. Either The Boss controls an opposing department to compete with the Team of players, or the Team itself can compete in a PvP match to see who can control the most territory. To control a cubicle, an employee must be the only person in the cubicle and use the Triumphant Fist Pump ability (1AP). Triumphant Fist Pump counts as one of the three abilities usable in a single hour. The cubicle is then in that employee&amp;rsquo;s control unless an opposing employee successfully uses Triumphant Fist Pump inside it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The employee or Team who gains and retains control of a predetermined (by The Boss) number of cubicles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes on using this map: Each square represents (roughly) a 3ft. x 3ft. area. More importantly, they represent the number of moves that can be taken each round if playing with movement restrictions. One square equals one move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cubicle walls are short enough that they can be jumped, instead of walking through the hallways. Hopping a cubicle wall does not have any movement penalties, however, jumping a cubicle wall incurs a penalty of 1d4 hours of Look Stupid. If the jump involves crossing a desk (the brown areas) on either side of the wall, the employee also receives 1d4 hours of Scrutinized. We can&amp;rsquo;t have employees scrambling over company property all willy-nilly, after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also note that computers are located in the corner of each cubicle for using computer-related abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
