							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">There are no Such Things as Skaven...</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no Such Things as Skaven... is a short adventure best suited for characters in their first or second careers, but it can be easily modified to suit any group. The structure of the scenario is loose, directed more by character actions than by events. The adventure is set in a small town near Nuln, but with minor modifications any Imperial town could be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure best lends itself as the PCs&amp;rsquo; first real encounter with the mythical Ratmen known as Skaven. But it works just as well with a party that already knows the Skaven are more than just a subspecies of Beastmen or bedtime stories told to children. The mood of this adventure is one of hidden threat and mounting tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
