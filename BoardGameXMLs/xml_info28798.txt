			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Press your luck, but don't Farkel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What, you haven't heard of Farkel, the fast-paced, fun dice game? Each player takes a turn rolling ten dice until they either Pass or Farkel, depending on what you roll. You can press your luck by rolling the remaining dice, or score your points earned. Then the next player rolls to add to your score or start new. We know you will also enjoy having MORE fun with the complete rules for ten MORE dice games like Bumble Bee, Sequences, Centennial, Best Ball and MORE. Great for the entire family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     10 SimplyFun dice&lt;br/&gt;     1 Wipe board for score keeping&lt;br/&gt;     1 Dry-erase marker&lt;br/&gt;     1 Ring of rules&lt;br/&gt;     1 Cowbell&lt;br/&gt;     1 Carrying bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
