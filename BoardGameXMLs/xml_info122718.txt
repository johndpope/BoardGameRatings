							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Massive Multiplayer Captain&#039;s Mistress</name>
									
			<description>This games takes a regular game of Captain's Mistress (this is sold under the brand name Connect Four) and turns it into a party game using a framework suitable for most other abstract strategy games.  In the game, a player's team selects where they go during that team's turn.  When it is not the team's turn, the player has an opportunity to leave their team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was discussed as a variant in this thread on BGG, but has been spun off as its own entry due to additional development and changes on how the game is run.  The discussion can be found here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
