			<description>D.W.A.R.F.S. is an abbreviation for Dapper Wacky Although Rather Fierce Squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Magic Forest! Whenever there is trouble, every single animal, big or small, can count on the dwarves&amp;rsquo; help. Although it may seem like the squad prefers relaxation to work, the dwarves are the greatest rescue unit in the Magic Forest, and they are always ready for action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D.W.A.R.F.S. is a logic-adventure game embedded in a fairytale world of magic creatures and animals. In the game you control 6 dwarves (Macro, Hoplo, Bingo, Reperto, Retro, and Klepto), each with their own unique abilities. After being wrongly accused of freeing Al Camole from prison, the D.W.A.R.F.S. must clear their good names and recapture the evil mole so that peace is restored in the Magical Forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you may come across several types of NPCs (squirrels, frogs, hedgehogs, gnomes etc.) and control 7 dwarfs, of which every single one has specific abilities. Each of the 5 game locations is designed for approximately 2 hours of gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
