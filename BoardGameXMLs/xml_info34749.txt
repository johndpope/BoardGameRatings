			<description>A simple board game, similar to Sorry! or Parchisi.  Movement takes place with a roll of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in two phases.  First, players progress through &amp;quot;Desert Shield&amp;quot;, in which they collect cards that can later be used to defeat threats.  Second, they move to &amp;quot;Desert Storm&amp;quot;, in which they use their cards to overcome obstacles on the board.  When a player reaches the middle of the board, they have won the game and liberated Kuwait.  &lt;br/&gt;If you encounter an obstacle that there is no card for, then you must restart Desert Storm.  If this happens three times in a row, then Desert Shield must be repeated as well.  There are also locations on the board that will send you back to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
