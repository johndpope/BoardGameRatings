			<description>A game of late-night deduction and coffee for two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To figure out the secret rules that govern how the other players move pieces on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* An area with diverse items that you can group in general categories. A table with four place settings at your local late-night diner should do nicely.&lt;br/&gt;    * Paper and pencil for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player makes up a rule and writes it down. The player's rules dictates how he moves pieces when it's his turn. On each player's turn, the player moves a piece in accordance with his secret rule and then asks a yes/no question to another player. Players can also guess other players' rules for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all rules but one have been guessed. If your rule remains unguessed, then you lose 1 point. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
