							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raid: The Caribbean Word Game</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the period of 1600 to 1800 infamous pirates including Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, Anne Booney and Henry Morgan RAIDed ships and coastal towns in the Caribbean. Speed, cunning, surprise, determination, stalking one's prey, ambush, counter attack, fearlessness and ruthlessness characterized the RAIDs of these buccaneers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Caribbean word game - RAID - recaptures the excitement, thrills, and anticaption of those bygone days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAID is a game for 2 - 6 players or teams. Play consists of forming words from the exposured blocks. Triple bonus points are earned by forming the name of any Caribbean country (a list is provided).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, Player one forms the word &amp;quot;cub&amp;quot; from the exposed blocks. Player two adds an A to form a new word &amp;quot;cuba&amp;quot;. This is a RAID. Player two has formed the name of a Caribbean country Cuba, and so is awarded triple bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
