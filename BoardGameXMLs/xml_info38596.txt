							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Barons</name>
									
			<description>A classroom game for six groups of history students, grades 6 to 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This simulation is about feudal Europe from 700 AD - 1200 AD, the late Middle Ages. The simulation is not set in any specific part of Europe, and the term &amp;lsquo;baron&amp;rsquo; is used to refer to nobles. It is intended to familiarize the students with some of the basic characteristics of life in the Middle Ages: the feudal system, the church, the crusades, castles, political marriages, etc. With modifications it could be used for similar civilizations in other places and times, such as feudal Japan. This simulation is intended to be played one or two turns per week, with each turn taking 10 - 15 minutes, while the students are studying a unit on this topic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hex-shaped hex map, five hexes on a side. The game also requires a standard deck of playing cards (used to resolve battles and determine the death of barons) and a set of event cards that must be created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The students should be divided into 6 groups. You can play with more groups, but in that case you should use a larger map. Each group represents a noble family. You can assign the students roles if you wish: Baron, Baroness, Seneschal, and Bailiff. Each team will be given control of a fiefdom. This consists of their home hex and the six surrounding hexes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Objective: The goal of each team is to become the most powerful baron. This is measured by their fame. Fame represents the reputation and status of the baron. Another important measure of a baron's power is how many hexes he controls. This will determine how large an army he can call up for battles, and how much gold he will collect in taxes from his territory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
