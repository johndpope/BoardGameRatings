							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forza Horizon</name>
									
			<description>Forza Horizon is an open-world game based around a fictitious festival called the Horizon Festival, set in Colorado, USA. The game incorporates many different gameplay aspects from previous Forza Motorsport titles, like the large variety of cars, realistic physics and high definition graphics. The aim is to progress through the game by means of obtaining &amp;quot;Wristbands&amp;quot; by driving fast, destroying property, winning races and other driving antics. Horizon is set to feature the physics of Forza Motorsport 4, which have been optimised to work on the 65 variants of terrain said to be present in the game. Players will be able to drive anywhere their cars can reach, such as fields and plains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple race types are included, from drift to rally and point-to-point races. AI traffic will be present on the roads, which provides a new dynamic to the Forza racing system. Players may also challenge other Horizon festival drivers they encounter in a one-on-one race to a given location. The location is random each time, and the AI have the ability to use shortcuts to their advantage. Races will take place at different times throughout the day/night cycle included in the game, including night races. A skill system is implemented in the game; players earn street cred during races by driving aggressively. Acts such as as drifting, jumping over obstacles and getting a car on two wheels all contribute to the cred. These can be chained together in a combo, which in turn affects the money players are paid at the end of a given race. Cred also affects a player's popularity level in the game. As a player's popularity increases new special events are unlocked, such as races against helicopters and planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed traps are present in the game, and players can challenge each other for the top speed in a given area. Cameras record player times, which can then be shared among rivals. Those rivals can then attempt to beat the shared time. A photography mode is also included. In addition to races, players can search for barn find cars&amp;mdash;cars that have been stored away for long periods of time&amp;mdash;have them restored, and add them to their car collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Forza Horizon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
