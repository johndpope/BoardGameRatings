							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lion Country</name>
									
			<description>Lion Country is a Monopoly-esque game produced as a fundraiser for the Centre County Medical Society Auxiliary in 1983 by CPM Associates.  In this game, you acquire and expand franchises.  It uses the typical roll &amp;amp; move mechanic of Monopoly, but rather than buying groups of properties, you can expand almost any property by purchasing franchise discs thus expanding it.  It has a single chance-like card deck.  It is called Lion Country after Penn State's mascot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
