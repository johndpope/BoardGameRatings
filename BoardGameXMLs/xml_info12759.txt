							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for McKensie II</name>
									
			<description>The Battle for McKensie II is a science fiction game scenario nominally set within The Empire of Star Wars. Explicit references to Darth Vader, Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia Organa (among others) may be found in the background material for the game. It is unlikely that the use of these names was authorized; however, the scenario book seems sufficiently obscure that it is also unlikely George Lucas ever noticed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The booklet contains a list of forces, a map, a seven page scenario description, and a five page set of rule modifications to &amp;quot;Small Game Tables&amp;quot;. It is apparent that the scenario was designed to be used in concert with an existing rules system. However, aside from references to &amp;quot;'Brew up' rules - page 25 and 26&amp;quot;, no clue is given as to which rules system this scenario was intended to be run under.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
