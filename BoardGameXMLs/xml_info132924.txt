							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wisdom of Ravens</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a story game in which you and some friends will create a short story in about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the players are together, pick one person to be the human player, who will make up and control a person with a serious problem. Everyone else will take the roles of magically intelligent ravens who like to fix problems. The other players will also play incidental characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story will be created improvisationally, with a scene being set, and everyone subsequently describing what their character says and does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
