							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keys to the Castle</name>
									
			<description>Keys to the Castle is a tile-based game of strategy and luck.  Players must open and close doors (the tiles) to move along a path and be the first to cross to the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special cards are played to hacksaw through barred doors, use a skeleton key to unlock padlocked doors, throw a net on a player to stop them in their tracks or use secret passageways to maneuver your way to the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is easy to learn and quick to play. With the tiles acting as the &amp;quot;board&amp;quot;, there is a new outcome to each game every time the tiles and cards are shuffled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
