							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Run For President</name>
									
			<description>A contest between two players or teams to win the most electoral votes by answering questions about the states, the Presidents, and Washington, DC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players roll dice and move around the board, answering questions based on which space they land on. A question is asked about the state landed on, if it is a state or Washington, DC square. If the answer is correct, the player gets the electoral votes for that state. If a bonus square is landed on, a bonus question about Presidents is asked and if the answer is correct, the player gets the electoral votes from an unclaimed state. There are also swap spaces, which allow a player to attempt to steal a state from the opponent by answering a more difficult question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
