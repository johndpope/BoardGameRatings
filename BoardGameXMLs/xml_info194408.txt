							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Parallax: The descendants War</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Despite all our hopes, Earth got depleted before FTL jumps were possible. However, mankind made one last and desperate effort: four colony fleets were sent in a intergenerational journey to four distant systems potentially capable of supporting human life...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...colonists reaching Arcturus found a barren planet. In order to preserve their very existence they established a symbiotic relationship with an alien artifact they found there...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...colonists reaching Draco had to introduce lizard genes into their genome so they could adapt to the new planetary conditions they found...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...colonists reaching Hydra found resources were scarce and chose to genetically become &amp;quot;more efficient&amp;quot; so no one had to be left behind...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and for the last colony fleet... well, you all know what happened... let's just say we were the lucky ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One would think the later invention of the FTL drive presented an opportunity to reunite with our long lost brothers after many centuries... unfortunately, regardless of our many differences, we all were descendants of mankind and thus we all were afflicted by an ancient common curse: war&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-extracted from Lyta Roslin's speech: &amp;quot;The Descendants War&amp;quot;-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parallax is a 4X game with a heavy focus on the thematic and narrative aspects. In this manner, payers not only maneuver ther fleets to eXplore and eXploit the galaxy, eXterminate other fleets and eXpand their empires, but also decide the fate of the many heroes which take part on it by fallling in love, challenging rival heroes to a duel, fulfilling secret personal agendas or making political speeches among many other things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, players will compete for the hegemony of the universe over nine turns with the following structure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)PRE-TURN PHASE: Exhausted admirals and commodores are refreshed. Event cards are resolved, thus weaving an immersive story over the nine turns. Additionally, every officer controlled by a player receives a secret agenda which can enhance the stats of that particular officer or even score some VPs when fulfilled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2)MOVEMENT PHASE: Admirals and commodores spend fuel to strategically move fleets under their command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3)ECONOMIC PHASE: Planets are colonized (by force or by political means) and excavated in search of ancient alien technologies. New technologies and ships can be purchased afterwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(At any time during phases 2 and 3 players can perform additional actions in their turns, such as &amp;ldquo;war declaration&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;secret deal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;auction&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;challenge enemy officer to a duel&amp;rdquo; by exhausting their officers in order to use their political influence).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4)END-TURN PHASE: Colonized planets produce resources. Turn order is determined for the next turn. In turns 3, 6 and 9 players score VPs according to the planets they control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the main goal is to capture the feel of space operas by creating both a narrative and a strategic experience, playable under three hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
