							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knock-Off!</name>
									
			<description>Knock-off uses the frenzied flipping of two electrical panic buttons by each of two contestants as competition. Object of button play is to direct Big Bopper, a grinning 6 armed ball-shaped robot, as he moves to knock off your opponent's fall guy before he can knock off yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Bopper runs across what looks like a raised bridge and the two fall guys are at either end. Wires from switches for control run along outside bottom edge of the bridge walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The toy is battery operated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
