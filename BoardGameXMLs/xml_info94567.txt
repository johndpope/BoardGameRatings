			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters 2 Expand edition is a sequel to Card Fighter&amp;rsquo;s Clash released only in Japan. Players built decks of cards and battled against other players and the computer to win rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game included the 300 cards from the original game, as well as 124 new cards. A new class of card was also introduced &amp;ndash; Reaction cards could be played during an opponent&amp;rsquo;s attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the first game, Card Fighters 2 had a single release, but players could choose to start with either an SNK or Capcom deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
