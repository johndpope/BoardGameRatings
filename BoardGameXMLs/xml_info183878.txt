							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Magic Items: Truenaming</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strange Magic Items series splits a full codex of magic items into the three subsystems laid out in Strange Magic: ethermagic, truename magic, and musical composition. Each of these thirds has its own unique flavor, both in fluff and in terms of mechanics, and such compartmentalization allows those who only bought some of the constituent thirds of Strange Magic to pick up whatever new content interests them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truename magic is all about deliberation, poise, and explicit intent. For a truenamer to attempt to recite something before its exact phrasing is known is little better than suicide. Necessarily, a truenamer's experimentation takes no chances. The ultimate end goal of First Language experimentation is not new recitations, but rather to get the universe to heed those recitations permanently. Since a recitation must be known to the most exacting degree to have any hope of influencing the universe permanently, truename magic items are among the most deliberately-made objects in the known cosmos. Chaos and uncertainty simply do not exist in the realm of the truenamer, and the seemingly-chaotic creations of a scion of discordia are, in actuality, the painstakingly-researched masterpieces of a rhetorician who knows exactly how to make her audience react however she wants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, it's not fair to assume that truename magic items are dull, wooden, and utilitarian simply because the research to make one that doesn't spontaneously explode is meticulous. There's just something about building something ridiculous out of universal constants that draws a very specific sort of personality, and truenamers have been one-upping each others' whimsy pieces for centuries. Whenever a tower shield transforms into a tower with a periscope, that's a truenamer's work. Whenever a club insults its target constantly, that's a truenamer's work. Whenever something that couldn't possibly come stocked with a minibar has a minibar anyway, that's a truenamer's work. Whenever a random ring, amulet, or tiara finds a way to make its creator's intellectual superiority known mere moments before atomizing its target, that's DEFINITELY a truenamer's work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    9 armor/weapon/shield special abilities&lt;br/&gt;    3 specific magic weapons, including songbird - a dagger that turns enhancement bonus into a spellcasting minigame&lt;br/&gt;    3 specific tower shields, including the portable watchtower - a shield that takes the hits and dishes them out so you don't have to!&lt;br/&gt;    a new kind of wand&lt;br/&gt;    12 magic items with 11 additional variants, including the overlord's dogtag - a necklace that can turn just about any outsider into a bonded servant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get full use out of this product, Strange Magic or Ultimate Truenaming is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
