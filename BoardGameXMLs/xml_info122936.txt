			<description>Blitz: The League II is an American football video game in Midway's Blitz series. Five new teams and 4 relocated clubs are included in the new installment. The new teams are the Los Angeles Riot, the Houston Riders, Vancouver Beavers, Milwaukee Hounds, and Atlanta 404. The relocated teams are the Miami Hammerheads (former Orlando Hammerheads), Cleveland Steamers (former San Diego Cyclones), Philadelphia Brawlers (formerly the players custom team from Blitz: The League), and the Mexico City Aztecs (former Dallas Aztecs). Lawrence Taylor (L.T.) will also be involved in this edition of Blitz playing as Quentin Sands with the user-created team (Franchise's Team).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also continues to allude to real-life scandals involving NFL players, as former Washington Redhawks quarterback Mike Mexico is now serving time in prison. This situation is similar to the Michael Vick, who used the pseudonym &amp;quot;Ron Mexico&amp;quot; when seeking treatment for herpes, as well as Vick's conviction for running an illegal dogfighting ring. There are also allegations of the New England Regulars cheating in a championship game, a reference to the New England Patriots' &amp;quot;Spygate&amp;quot; scandal. The game also features an incident with the Minnesota Reapers, reminiscent of the Minnesota Vikings boat scandal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;    Realistic Injuries/Down-To-Detail Injuries.&lt;br/&gt;    Minigames to heal or juice.&lt;br/&gt;    Create Touchdown Celebrations.&lt;br/&gt;    Create your own player as well as new team.
