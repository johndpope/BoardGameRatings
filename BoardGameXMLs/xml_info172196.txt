			<description>Can you tame our tame racing driver in our FREE new game for mobile?  You can now pit your wits against The Stig on your favoured mobile device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is a high-speed journey through some of the most iconic Top Gear locations, where you'll use your skills to collect as many Golden Nuts as possible whilst jumping, ducking and dodging around obstacles and other vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wouldn't be Top Gear without the cars, of course. Race The Stig allows players to drive some of the series' most recognisable challenge vehicles including Richard Hammond's beloved Oliver, Jeremy's Italian police car complete with Ben Hur wheels, and James' Amphibious Triumph Herald.  And the infamous Indestructible Pickup-truck features as the ultimate shield against destruction . All the while, players will be chased and blocked by His Stigness...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
