							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creature Weekly Volume 4</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Octavirate Games presents Creature Weekly, a pack of new monsters available for download each Wednesday. Need new challenges, adversaries and allies? We have you covered. Each entry is illustrated and features variant rules support and genre adjustment information so you can easily fit the creatures into your campaign, whether it is set in the wilds of a medieval empire, the streets of a modern metropolis or the depths of far-flung space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume Four features seven creatures and (thanks to the Bosch fiend) hundreds of possible variants. Included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The idos a proud race of humanoid desert-dwelling lungfish. Includes information for the use of idos as player characters and the write-up for their deity.&lt;br/&gt;     The Bosch fiend, a menu-based monster construction system inspired by the paintings of the 15th century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, particularly his triptychs the Temptation of Saint Anthony and Paradise and Hell. This menu-system allows game masters to construct hundreds of fiends of various configurations based on nine statistics blocks and a framework of fiendish abilities.&lt;br/&gt;     The Cacophony Beetle, a deadly predator that focuses raw sonic energy to strike its prey. Includes information for cacophony beetles as steeds.&lt;br/&gt;     The Archdaemon Guulloth, Lord of Vice and his minions, the guuldaemons. Guulloth is the master of excess and his servants help him spread it across the planes when he is not entertaining fiends of all sorts in his vast palace in Hades.&lt;br/&gt;     The Higgus, a race of small, intelligent cactus-men with a penchant for philosophy. Unlike their treant cousins the higgus are fast and nimble. As cactus-beings, they are covered in vicious needles, though their intelligence is what makes them truly dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;     The Sobekor, a ravenous reptilian hunter of the living and the dead alike. It takes basking in the sun for warmth to a new level, as the sobekor can release its stored energy in the form of a brilliant beam of sunlight. This makes them the bane of the undead while their rending jaws and six clawtipped arms make them the bane of the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
