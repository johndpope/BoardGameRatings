							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lighthouse and Dock Map Pack</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the lighthouse a beachhead for the invading band of pirates? Did a roving group of kobolds take shelter in the tower during a storm and now refuse to leave? Has a master marksman barricaded the door, attempting to pick off the party from the upper level without ever letting them get close? Ready for a swashbuckling battle up the spiral staircase in dramatic fashion? With D20 Cartographer, the story is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Maps are full-featured encounter maps designed to fit any traditional fantasy world. This release, Lighthouse and Dock features a five-story lighthouse, mapped both inside and out, near a small dock on the beach. With cozy furnishings for a resident lighthouse keeper, this can be the site of a information-gathering mission or a tricky, multi-level combat encounter in close quarters. All maps are in typical 1 inch = 5 feet scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included for your convenience are several different formats including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Full-color maps in .jpg format&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; High-contrast black and white maps in .jpg format&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; PDF files with images sliced up over multiple pages for easy home-printing (compatible with both US Letter and A4 International paper)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D20 Cartographer also supports virtual table top (VTT) systems and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 100 DPI gridless map with objects removed&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A folder with all &amp;lsquo;objects' in .png format for use on this map or reuse on your private maps&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; An RPTools MapTool VTT file (.cmpgn) with vision blocking and object layer set up for you&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
