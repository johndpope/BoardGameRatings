			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;An Adventure Game For All Those Who Dare To Enter The Taetsequama Jungle&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jungle Craze is a roll the dice and move along the path board game.  Instead of a simple path, however, the path crosses and intersects, often giving the adventurer choices, but sometimes forcing the adventurer into an undesirable path.  Adventurers collect survival gear, hire guides, deal with natives, and of course, challenge Taetsequama.  To win, they must steal the treasure from the native temple and then return to the start area.  However, once the treasure has been stolen from the temple, other players can steal the treasure by landing on the adventurer carrying it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions list three levels of play which add complexity for higher levels.  Some of the challenges involve rolling specific numbers on the dice -- &amp;quot;Snake Eyes must be rolled within 10 tries.&amp;quot;  Some  issues are decided based on the player's life experiences -- &amp;quot;If you've seen 'Dumbo', go to the south elephant walk.  If not, go to the north elephant walk.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
