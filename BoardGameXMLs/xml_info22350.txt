			<description>Due Conga is an abstract two-player game using a board with four hollows and three varieties of eight stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player places 1, 2 or 3 stones in one of four hollows. It is forbidden to have the same amount of stones in any of the hollows. The player who gets caught out or places the last stone is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publishing history: Essen isn't only a place for publishers to find their gaming audience, sometimes it is also the place where designers find their dream publisher. Intrigued by a beautiful wooden version of Wittig's &amp;quot;Moguli&amp;quot;, Frank Stark, with mainly card games and only one board game under his belt, got talking with the publisher and not much later Clemens Gerhards released two of his designs in the same high quality make-up. &amp;quot;Trio Trio&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Samas&amp;quot; were followed a year later, in 2005, by &amp;quot;Kick-It&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Due conGa&amp;quot;, again in the deluxe wooden versions that are Clemens Gerhards' specialty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
