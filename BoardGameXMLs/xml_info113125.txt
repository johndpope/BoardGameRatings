							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Template: Biological Intruder</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutated viruses capable of transforming any unfortunate enough to be infected into utterly inhuman-and often monstrous-entities; clouds of alien spores, possessing a weird form of collective intelligence, that seek out suitable hosts as means of reproduction; nanites-self-replicating robots on the molecular scale-programmed to commandeer the DNA of organic life forms; all of these are examples of biological intruders. Biological intruders are malignant microorganisms that infect and seize control of another creature, multiplying inside the host body until the infected being&amp;rsquo;s biological processes are completely replaced by that of the biological intruder. Unlike most other templates, a character who becomes host to a biological intruder is less changed than infected; unlike symbiotic organisms, which adapt to functioning with the host&amp;rsquo;s body, biological intruders are deadly opportunistic organisms, using other living beings only as means of maturing or reproducing, and effectively slaying them in the process. A biological intruder that is allowed to progress to its&amp;rsquo; final stages ravages the character&amp;rsquo;s physical and mental faculties, eventually destroying the host&amp;rsquo;s mind and vital functions and replacing them with its&amp;rsquo; own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
