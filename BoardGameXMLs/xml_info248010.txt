							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warlocks of Talomire</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The moon shone red over the tops of the trees, casting terrible shadows across the dirt path. Not a sound could be heard from the woods, the birds hiding in their nests. The young girl walked ahead, cradling the bundle of rags in her arms. As she neared the crossroads she slowed, and waited. Moments passed into eons. Finally, a lithe figure stepped out of the shadows not twenty feet away. The young girl walked gingerly towards the beckoning creature, dwarfed by it's sheer size. The bundle of rags in her arms quivered, and let out a tired yawn. The girl set the bundle down in the middle of the crossroads, a few feet away from the tall figure. Looking down from the creature's eyes the young girl drew the sickle from her side, and forever changed the course of her fate...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many in Talomire who seek great power, and few care much where it comes from. For those most desperate, a pact with a demon or a forest spirit is their way out of their pathetic, mundane lives. Whether because of poverty, fear of the church, or as part of a ritual for the Church of Baphomet, each has their reason and their goal. Little do they reaslise, however, the capriciousness of the patron they find, their lives a constant power battle with spirits and demons they can barely understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short document contains details on how each official Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5e Otherworldly Patron fits into the world of Talomire. It also contains two brand new Patrons; The Woman In Scarlet, and The Shadowking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
