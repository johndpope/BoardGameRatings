							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Siege</name>
									
			<description>The board for The Siege  features a 3D castle. The castle is easy to assemble and fits snugly back into the box without the need to dismantle it. The game is asymmetric &amp;ndash; one player (or a team of up to three) attacks the castle, and the other player (or team) is defending it. Knight models come in six colours. All knights are armed with either swords or maces. The blue ones always attack the castle, and are the only team to have two catapults. The red ones always defend. Four of the red knights have bows and arrows instead of melee weapons. The remaining four teams are black, orange, yellow and green. The number of knights in different teams is not always the same. There are always more defenders than attackers. Combat is conducted in duels. Mace wielding combatants have the upper hand, but the outcome is decided by rolling the dice. Each player is trying to overpower their opponents by outnumbering them in isolated combats. Apart from the knights, the box also includes a king, a queen, a princess, a wizard, a dragon and a squire. These models are used in special scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
