			<description>Rise of the Coalition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine years since the death of the Second Star League, the Word of Blake&amp;rsquo;s holy war against all of humanity rages on. But new heroes, and new alliances have been forged between interstellar nations of the Inner Sphere and the Clans, setting aside centuries of distrust and hatred to unite as never before against the common enemy. Emerging from shattered realms, the allied coalition has finally found the strength to turn the tide, and now the Word and its allies are on the defensive. But even as the allies prepare for the inevitable finale, the Word&amp;rsquo;s unseen Master and his fanatical minions won&amp;rsquo;t fall without a fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jihad Hot Spots: 3076 continues the Jihad plot book series started with Blake Ascending, bringing readers into the raging conflict of the war between the Word of Blake and the Inner Sphere. Seen from the eyes of those who fight and die in this epic struggle, this book includes articles and intelligence excerpts from across the Inner Sphere, along with additional rules and campaign tracks for both Classic BattleTech and Classic BattleTech RPG games, from the unwilling allies of the Blakist war machine, to the experimental technologies that gave the Word its incredible - if costly - edge for years, to several new BattleMechs, vehicles, and combat spacecraft that debuted in the midst of this turning point in the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
