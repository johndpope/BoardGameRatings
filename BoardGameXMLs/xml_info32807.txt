			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;A novel game with Goblins.  The figures are made to jump into the perforated board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pictured in the book Games We Play, from the illustration, one can't figure out if the point is to get the correct hole in the board or avoid the holes in the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
