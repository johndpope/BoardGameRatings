			<description>This children's card game contains 36 cards (9 different sets of 4 cards) depicting Paddington Bear from the BBC's 1970's children's TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are shuffled and dealt 5 to a player. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is turned over to start the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, he may take the top card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. He then discards a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player aims to collect two sets - one of 3 cards and a pair. When a player completes a set during his turn, he places it face up on the table in front of him. The first player to lay both sets on the table is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
