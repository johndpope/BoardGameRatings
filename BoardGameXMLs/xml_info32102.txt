			<description>This is a game for two players or two teams. Each party has a grid of 8 by 10 in which they have to construct a crossing word. Both players get the same letters. They place these letters on their own grid in trying to make the most points as possible. Once a letter has been placed it shouldn't be moved anymore.&lt;br/&gt;The player (or team) who gains the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
