							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fast Bucks</name>
									
			<description>The game has 2 decks of cards: Fast Buck Cards (FB) and Market Value Cards (MV). Each player is dealt 7 FB cards, and a FB card is dealt face down in the middle of the table. This is the bonus card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may draw 1 FB card per turn from the deck or the discard pile. They then check their FB cards for 3 of a kind and place them face down on the table. The player then draws a MV card, and follows what it says. It can either affect your hand's value or have you draw another FB or MV card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has no more FB cards in hand, that player gets a $150,000 bonus and the bonus card is revealed. If a player has a card that matches the bonus in hand, that player receives a $250,000 bonus. The other cards on the table are then scored. Play continues until someone reaches $1,000,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
