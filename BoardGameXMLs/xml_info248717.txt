			<description>Kaukopartio is a competitive 2-4 player game based on the war between the Finns and the Soviets in World War 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the players control their Finnish squad in the Soviet territory. The game objective is to complete five missions (sabotage, capture a prisoner etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have to gather squad members and look for equipment. Each soldier has their individual skills. The skills and the equipment help to accomplish the specific missions. Missions are accomplished with dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the search of the resources the players may confront random Soviet units. The enemy units force the players to do a diversion before they can continue their objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players completes five missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
