							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ironics</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're not Iconic. They're Ironic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are the Ironics? They may be a misfit band of unlikely heroes or a misguided group of mercenaries looking to line their pockets with a bit of coin. How their tales unfold is entirely up to the players and the game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From E.N. Publishing -- the company that brought you the NPC collection Everyone Else -- The Ironics presents twenty-six pre-generated heroes from all eleven core base classes. Each class is represented by two or more heroes, each with a different focus, presented at three stages of their advancement - 5th, 10th, and 15th level. Rules-proofed by posters on EN World's own Rules forum, all 78 stat blocks are fully-detailed, with balanced personal gear and complete details of mounts, familiars, and animal companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The perfect tool for convention games, EN World game days, and the countless times in your home game when you need a solidly-statted character on the spur of the moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
