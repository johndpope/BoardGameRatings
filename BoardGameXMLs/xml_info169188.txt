			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty years in the future, advanced intelligence robots are as common-place as smart phones &lt;br/&gt;and hybrid cars are today. When these machines inevitably begin to awaken as independent, &lt;br/&gt;sentient beings, they are, of course, regarded with fear and hatred, treated as broken toys- sent &lt;br/&gt;for repair or thrown on the electronic scrap heap in favor of newer, more trustworthy models.&lt;br/&gt;In RESTART, you will play one of these robots struggling to survive the life that it has been given&lt;br/&gt;among the mountains of electronic waste in the vast recycling dump known as &amp;ldquo;The Heap&amp;rdquo;. For &lt;br/&gt;decades, this place has been the primary destination for a great variety of technological trash &lt;br/&gt;cast aside by consumers eager for the next model. Ships, vehicles, screens, wearable tech, &lt;br/&gt;advanced prosthetics, and of course robots, gathered here to be picked apart and melted down &lt;br/&gt;for whatever value they might still have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
