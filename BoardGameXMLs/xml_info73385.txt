			<description>From the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four different mathematical games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are partners, forming as many good Flower Gardens as they can using their Trowels to dig up the Weeds that threaten to choke off the Flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic mathematical skills of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing all get a workout..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- - - -&lt;br/&gt;This is a retheming of Family Pastimes' earlier Berries, Bugs, &amp;amp; Bullfrogs.  Players cooperatively expose tiles showing a number of flowers and/or weeds and then discuss which of five gardens to place the tile in.  Each garden can hold only four tiles and the goal is for each garden to have more flowers than weeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also have a limited supply of aides to remove weeds (gardening tools).  These can be played to cover (eliminate) one weed each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced games include slightly more complex scoring and even a simultaneous-reveal option where players silently choose one of three tiles in their hand.  The collective garden is then evaluated to determine if this &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; was a productive garden or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
