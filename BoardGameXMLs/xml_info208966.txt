			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Legendary Adventures - Lost Ruins, we introduce the academic and scholarly Selbrickshire Initiative. This world-renowned historical society seeks to preserve the legacy of the past through the exploration of ancient, forgotten sites, the reclamation and cataloguing of lost treasures, and answering questions about the societies, civilisations, and events of yesteryear that have long plagued modern thinkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organisation has recently uncovered the location of a religious site of tremendous historical significance that was once a centre of worship for a powerful, occult sect of the ancient Quotekhi people. An expedition to the ruins was quickly mounted, however when the adventurers aiding the Selbrickshire team of scholars and historians vanish without warning, the archaeologists have a difficult choice to make; to abandon their efforts altogether or to recruit fresh meat to discover what terrible secrets the sleeping ruins harbour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary Adventures: Lost Ruins features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Lore. Introductions to the Vind'l Svar region, Mexacotzin Ruins, and Selbrickshire faction; as well as an expos&amp;eacute; on two prominent Quotekhi deities, the goddess Elochtaca &amp;amp; her slippery brother Ixcazoh.&lt;br/&gt;    Alphabet. A section on the alphabet/script of the ancient Quotekhi people which could easily be lifted and used elsewhere or in homebrew campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;    Appendices. Statistical information for several new adversaries, including the howler monkey and howler weremonkey. New player option for the &amp;quot;Academic Graduate&amp;quot;, an expansive, versatile new character background that could match most character concepts. And another new player option, the  &amp;quot;Howler Weremonkey&amp;quot;, a lycanthropic affliction that causes its sufferer unusual symptoms; a misfit amongst even other lycanthropes.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventuring Materials. Many exciting new quests aiding the Selbrickshire Initiative, including an arrival quest that tasks the players with rafting to the ruin by traversing an unpredictable waterway, using cryptology to help decipher the Quotekhi language, exploring two giant sleeping ziggurats long undisturbed, competing with kenku treasure hunters for the best loot, and a lot more besides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
