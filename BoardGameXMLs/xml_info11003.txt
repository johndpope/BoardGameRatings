			<description>Alphabet SQUIGGLE&amp;trade; introduces letters to kids in a fun and clever new way. Kids will learn and improve letter recognition, stimulate their creativity and even strengthen their vocabulary. Children who are just learning letters and those who already know them well will enjoy playing. Watch how surprised they get when they see how much they can do with letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move along a path of letters. For every letter they land on, the players must find that letter on the outside edge of the board and either trace it or write it from memory on the sketch paper provided. If they're feeling creative, they can turn their letter tracing into a picture, write a word that begins with that letter, or create a drawing that begins with and reinforces that letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
