			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You awaken to an alien world. Everything is strange and unfamiliar, but there&amp;rsquo;s something about this place... Remember your training, your purpose. What is your purpose? No matter, there is work to be done. You are ready. You can do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hibernation Agents is a game for 3 to 6 players about highly capable agents awakening after hundreds or thousands of years into a strange and unknown world. They will have to form relationships with alien creatures and other agents to complete their mission, and use the powerful and specialized tools given to them to survive. But in this strange and complex, often political world, betrayal is common. You may have to decide what is more important, your mission, or your friends. After spending so long in hibernation, how can you be sure what to believe in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
