			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released with the title Samba De Amigo, the Dreamcast Maracas are one of the more involved accessories in videogame history.  Featuring two plastic maracas with acoustic sensors in their cables (different from the magnetic ones used in the arcade), a base station that has another set of sensors to triangulate where the maracas are, and a foot mat, the entire setup is quite large.  Sadly due to the use of ultrasonic sound the controllers are not as accurate as the arcade versions, but that sacrifice had to be made for the controllers to be cost efficient.  They are far more accurate than previous game controllers that utilized ultrasonic sound (ie: The Powerglove) and are fairly expensive because of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Officially they were only supported by the Samba De Amigo titles, however fans have discovered that they work with Mr. Driller as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
