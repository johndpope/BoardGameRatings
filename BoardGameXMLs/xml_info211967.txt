			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Ouija Board of Roleplaying Games&amp;quot; - Occult Victorian parlor games for those who love paranormal investigation and ghost stories. This is the first of the ten...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is nothing quite like them. The Papers combine elements of live action roleplaying games, mass hypnosis as performed by stage magicians, the guided meditations of Tibetan monks, and s&amp;eacute;ances of turn of the century spiritual mediums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game promises an immersive night of supernatural exploration for you and group of friends, placing you at the center of a real life ghost story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games are each unique, guiding you through a series of s&amp;eacute;ance-like paranormal investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the ten games is connected to the next, following the story of the mysterious Mr. Frost and his own experiments over a hundred years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They let you follow his footsteps as carefully as you can to unveil clues about the strange realm called the Grey beyond the Fog and the Shadowman that stalks it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no scripts, no actors, and no props. These games provide you the framework to have genuine frightening experiences heavy with occult and supernatural theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the closest thing to being in a supernatural horror movie you&amp;rsquo;ll ever experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(user note)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collects a mixture of previously published and new narrative games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
