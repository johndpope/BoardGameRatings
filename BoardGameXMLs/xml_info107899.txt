			<description>Stop the monsters invasion in this high definition, 3D, multi-touch implementation of the &amp;quot;Game of the Week&amp;quot; created by the company that reinvented the TD genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world populated by Goblins and Ogres, the country dwellers gather to defend their houses from a Horde of monsters that, wave after wave filter out of various caves. You must survive the onslaught to get a chance and move on to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes to gameplay Monster Trouble isn't all conventional, you can't sit down and watch! You must build your defenses using a variety of wooden and brick structures then populate them with a cast of characters ranging from farmers to hunters. When monsters die you have to quickly snatch up the loot they drop before it disappears, and sometime you must take action by dropping some sort of grenade and blow the little guy up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think you know everything about strategy, action and defense games then you must try Monster Trouble, and even though it may feel familiar you will discover enough small tweaks in the gameplay to make it a worthwhile experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
