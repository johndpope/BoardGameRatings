							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pizza Service</name>
									
			<description>Pizza service is a famous place where the best and fastest pizzas in town are made. That's the way it was done from the beginning, but today... Guests have arrived, orders have been placed, but chef is anxious because he had taken new pizza makers in training, and they don't know where things are in this kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this memory-style game from the 90's, pizza ingredients are spread face-down across the board. All players need the same ingredients to make their pizza and a die determines which one they should be looking for on their turn. The first player to get all the ingredients for the pizza wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
