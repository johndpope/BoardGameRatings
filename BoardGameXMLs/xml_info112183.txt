							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mosaic Mage</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional wizards find magic in books, sorcerers in blood, and bards in music. The most powerful magical creatures of the Material Plane&amp;mdash;dragons&amp;mdash;find magic in color. Ignoring the traditional schools of magic, mosaic mages define spells by associated color. Red magic is violent and aggressive, but it also heals and loves. Both black magic and white magic are death, but one is also evil while the other good. Blue is mysticism, utility, and knowledge. Yellow is energy, enigmas, and light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mosaic mages prefer to identify themselves by the color in which they specialize. A mosaic mage who specializes in yellow magic, for example, prefers to be known as a yellow mage. So attuned to the color of magic in which they specialize, mosaic mages emanate a translucent aura that tints their skin and clothes. Although this tinted aura is not perceived any more powerfully by detect magic, it is obvious to the naked eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ridiculed by the ignorant and magically sterile, mosaic mages of every color possess unique access to spells that are the envy of their bookish brethren. Red mages, for example, are among the few arcane casters with healing powers but who can also throw fire around better than divine healers. A minority among the already rare ranks of the mosaic mages are those who blend colors together to expand their access to magic, such as green mages, who can benefit from all magic associated with the mystical blue and enigmatic yellow spell spectrums. By studying the lessons of great wizards and historic artists, mosaic mages see magic in a different light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
