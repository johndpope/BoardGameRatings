			<description>From the Manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the land of the Chibi, not all was well. &lt;br/&gt;For a fortress of solitude is where they did dwell.&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the strong gates and through the haze,&lt;br/&gt;along the dirt road, was a dense maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the feared maze, the treasure sat-&lt;br/&gt;for hundreds of years without disturbance, not even a rat.&lt;br/&gt;So the warriors of Chibi set forth to find where the treasure lay,&lt;br/&gt;for they were setting forth to earn their rich pay day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is set in a Castle's Garden Maze. 5 warriors set out to seek their fortune in the garden maze. Every player draws a card to determine their character and see their special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leader always gets to go first. &lt;br/&gt;The builder gets to play 2 garden cards in a row once per round, &lt;br/&gt;The Thinker gets to choose a different player's ability for the round. &lt;br/&gt;Lucky obtains an extra free award when she obtains 2 from gameplay. &lt;br/&gt;The Holyman can have a player discard their card rather than play it, once per round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, a player is selected to be the treasure hunter. Their object is to obtain as much treasure as possible, by guiding the garden maze to the treasure points. The object of everyone else is to stop him/her from reaching the treasure by playing garden cards to dead-end them or throw them off course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, treasure points are totalled up and the winner is the player with the most loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
