			<description>Bang, pow! Someone didn't think ahead clearly when the animals' balloon party was planned and Sabrina the porcupine was invited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sabrina Stachelschwein, each player has a number of balloon cards on the table in front of them, with the balloons having different values and all of the balloons being placed in a circle. Sabrina wants to say &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; to all of her friends, so she keeps running around the circle, with her movement determined by a die roll. Wherever she stops, the balloon pops, with that card being placed on a discard pile. Sabrina can circle in either direction, and players can add new balloons to the table as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once one player runs out of balloons, the game ends, and whoever owns the most valuable balloons wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
