			<description>Obscure self-produced French cycling sports game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was made by two guys called G&amp;eacute;rard and Patrick (that's where the G&amp;Eacute;PAT brand comes from), and it was an ambitious project since it comes with 4 different boards. A Time trial board, a flat coarse and 2 mountain stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 11 plastic cyclists (including one in the yellow &amp;amp; mountain jersey) and is playable up to 8 (with each players one cyclist) or less (for example with 2 players each one has a team of 4 riders).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement in this racing game is decided by playing out cards (so no dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play a 1 day race or a stage tour with a general classification using all 4 boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
