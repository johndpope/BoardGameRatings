			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command. We are off course. We don&amp;rsquo;t know where we are. Can you hear us?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is Tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interplanetary transit has been achieved through a unique form of transportation.  Professor Yoshi has designed a machine that transmutes people sitting in a personal vessel into pulses of light, which are then transmitted across huge distances by riding on the rays of sunlight.  Many say it is the safest method of travel, so long as one pays attention to the dance of the celestial bodies in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it is not without its flaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Command.  Alarms flash informing you that a transit has gone awry. It is up to you to help the lost find their way back to their destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play occurs online, with webcams, in real-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
