							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goofy&#039;s Musical Match Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a card game for kids in which they learn to match musical elements and Disney characters.  It's a super-simplified version of Mah-Jong.  One at a time each player passes a single card to his or her right.  The player receiving the card immediately checks to determine if the new card creates a pair with any cards currently held in their hand.  If a pair has made, the pair is laid out on the playing surface, face up, for all the other players to see.  The player who received the card, whether or not they successfully made and laid a pair, chooses a card from his or her hand and passes it to the player to the right. The receiving player, e.g., the player to the right, follows the same procedure for either making or failing to make a pair, and then play continues, again to the right.  The first player to have reduced their hand to zero cards, e.g., a nil hand, by playing out their final two cards in a successful pair is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
