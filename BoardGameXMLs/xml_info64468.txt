			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scum. It used to hide in the worst places, in the cesspools of civilization, and since the Rising, it's goddamn everywhere. Not your normal type of Pre-Rising scum either, that tried to keep its actions below the public radar, but the unrepentant, cruel, petty, greedy, and selfish, bragging over their crimes and pretending they are better than everyone else because they can victimize the weak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slavers are the worst. Preying on small convoys, wanderers and lightly defended communities, they grab what they want and often kill the rest. Sexual abuse, physical abuse, torment, cruelty, all of these are the hallmarks of a flesh peddler, of someone who uses the suffering of his fellow human beings to advance his own power and wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year of the Zombie: Fleshmongers brings the worst of the worst to your Post Apocalyse game, in the form of comprehensive rules and information on how to run slavers in a broken down world. Whether you are running Year of the Zombie, Nuclear Aftermath or some other Post Apocalypse scenerio, Fleshmongers has something for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 49 page pdf includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background information on slavery, tactics and appearance of slaver gangs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample slaver groups and NPC's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample slaver communities and NPC's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modified civilian vehicles, armoured and primed for action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Printer friendly version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get freebies, advice and answers to Q&amp;amp;A; here at the UKG Year of the Zombie forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING! FLESHMONGERS IS RATED M FOR:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VIOLENCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LANGUAGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GORE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADULT CONTENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
