			<description>This game features a circular metal lithographed playing board, which is very similar to a metal tray.  The board has a &amp;quot;gun&amp;quot; at the bottom which shoots metal balls at metal airplanes which are placed at the 4 predetermined positions near the top half of the board.  A pullstring is wrapped around the spinner and then it is pulled like a top.  The metal balls are then loaded into the left side of the &amp;quot;gun&amp;quot; and the spinning mechanism &amp;quot;fires&amp;quot; the balls out the other side of the gun in rapid fire.  The metal airplanes have a ball-bearing on the underside of the planes that allows them to rest in the holes near the top of the board.  When a fired shot hits the airplane it is dislodged from its position and it falls toward the bottom of the playing area, thus crashing into the ground.   The player then scores points based on which airplanes are shot down.  Each player gets a set number of &amp;quot;shots&amp;quot; and the player with the most points after all players have taken their shots wins the game.  &lt;br/&gt;This game is made by McDowell Mfg. and was manufactured around the 1930's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
