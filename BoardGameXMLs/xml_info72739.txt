			<description>(((Work on this title will start again in 2016)))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loosely based on stock trading, company ownership and economic stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will start the game with a small fund and during the first round will vie for low priced stock to gain control of one or more of the companies in the game. The players will then get turns to make decision of how to grow the companies they control while adding to their personal account, company account and making sure the global economy does not go bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can buy upgrades in a number of different fields to grow the company profits each round. This in turn will move the stock price higher for that company. If you are invested into a company you don't own and you feel the current owner is not doing enough for the company you can try and make the deals needed to buy out controlling stock in the company or you can dump your stock and send the price falling down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will comprise of only about 20% random mechanic. Just as in real life, the best laid plans can cur-come to unexpected events. On the players turn they must roll to see how many actions are allowed for their current turn...however if you need more actions, you may buy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most money in the personal account at games end. While you will most likely be a company owner during the course of play, you do not need to be an owner of a company at any point to win...just make the right investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buy Low / Sell High&lt;br/&gt;Invest and Win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will incorporate player to player interaction and company to company interaction...a company can also own stock in other companies. It would not be unheard of for one company by game end to have controlling stock holdings over ALL the other companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique game-board will allow players to write onto it with vis-vis type markers, to track market progress&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
