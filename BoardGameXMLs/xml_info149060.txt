							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wyvern&#039;s Way</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first known attempt at a solo adventure for the Legendary Lives game. This is for those times when you not only have no other players around, but when you don't even have a game master. Simply read the paragraphs, choose from the options at the end of each paragraph, and the adventure will act as the&lt;br/&gt;game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wyvern's Way is designed for an adventurer early in her career. Although it is probably better for a character who is not a spellcaster, if you can accept that some of your spells simply aren't going to function because the planets are lined up awkwardly today, limiting Divination and other spells that a &amp;quot;programmed&amp;quot; adventure can anticipate, then a Wizard or Witch has a fine chance of completing the story. You can burn, freeze, or electrify any Foe you like, but you'll have to be a strict game master for spells like Bewitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat actually works well without a regular game master, since Legendary Lives allows most of the die rolling to fall on the player's shoulders anyway, whether you have a game master or not. Of course you could fudge your die rolls or skip around to paragraphs to which you were not directed, but that defeats the point and most of the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
