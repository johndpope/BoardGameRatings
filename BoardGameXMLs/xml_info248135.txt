			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The face looks normal; the hair as full as ever; perhaps the eyes are somewhat dull.  &amp;quot;Not so strange,&amp;quot; you think as you step away from the mirror.  &amp;quot;After twelve years of sleep you should be allowed a slow morning.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's still not the right day, but you decided to call this one the morning anyway.  The sun is strange, too.  Not the beautiful white-yellow one you're used to, but another one - a little yellow star, ten light years from home.  You study the sky for a minute, before turning to the sensors that probe the little blue-green planet that's your destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You reflect on how strange it is that the inhabitants down there are physiologically so similar to you - but even so, they've barely been off-planet, having briefly visited only their own moon a handful of times.  Why are they so under-developed?  So backward?  And they side so young... so needlessly young...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
