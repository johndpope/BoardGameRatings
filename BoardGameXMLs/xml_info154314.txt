							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mythic Succubus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let Yourself Be Tempted&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many ways the most insidious of demons, succubi (and their male counterparts, incubi) can almost pass for mortals in their natural form, and often lurk among them in disguise in order to sow temptation and evil everywhere that they go. But among these insidious creatures, there are some that are more accomplished, more powerful, and more mythic than their lesser kin. Mythic succubi and incubi wield powers that their more common cousins can only dream of, and can be the ruin of entire kingdoms&amp;mdash;or worlds&amp;mdash;if left unchecked. This book examines both of these terrible fiends&amp;mdash;mythic succubi and incubi alike&amp;mdash;and provides everything you need to include them in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to game statistics for both a mythic succubus and a mythic incubus (based on the incubus from the Bestiary 3), each with brand new, never-before-seen mythic powers and abilities, this book also provides ecologies for these abyssal paragons of corruption. Finally, the book includes detailed rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by players of any class in order to summon a mythic succubus or incubus, which come with both specific game rules for doing so, and detailed, flavorful descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
