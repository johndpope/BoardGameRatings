			<description>A free Print and Play card game for two players, loosely based on H. P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s stories that take place in the world of the Dreamlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Players share this world in their sleep, they probably even know each other here (though they might very well be strangers in the waking world), but they are not enemies. Both of them know many famous people who live in this fantastic land: if only they could convince them to come along to face extraordinary adventures, it would mean a lot of fame to the players themselves.&lt;br/&gt;And fame can go a long way here: the King of Celephais is looking for his successor, and all you need is to prove your worth to follow him on the throne. The player who solves the more Adventures with the most success will win this extraordinary honor, and with that, the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the players will bid on available Friends that can join their company, and they go on randomly assembled Adventures that are made up from 4 different card types. To solve an adventure, a player will need help from his Friends to succeed at various Trials. Despite the randomness, the players have a significant amount of control, and a key to success is to know your limits and to minimize the risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the 200 cards (plus Player Aid and Nightmare track as additional cards), the players are going to need a standard 6 sided die, and about 30 tokens (the game uses only one type of tokens, but possibly you may need quite a lot of that).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
