			<description>This collectible miniatures game from Bandai is basically a cross between Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game and Pass the Pigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The minis are rolled like dice, and have different results based on if they land on their feet, lying on their side, upside-down, etc. The &amp;quot;eye&amp;quot; is a symbol with a clear plastic dome over it, and each mini has a different symbol on its front and back, which gives them additional powers if they land with that side face-up. The minis are split into fighters and wizards; the fighters attack each other, and once all your fighters are dead you lose, and the wizards act as support troops (similar in function and diversity to traps in Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
