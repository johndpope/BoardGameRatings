			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've ever watched a public television auction, you know how crazy bidding can get. Sometimes, you just gotta have that item. Sometimes, you can't stand the thought of somebody else getting it, or sometimes you get caught up in it, and don't know exactly why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going... Going... GONE gives you all the excitement of a real auction... plus the satisfaction of a real auction... plus the satisfaction that comes from supporting a worthwhile cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as in a real auction, you get to select items of particular interest to you, which makes them worth more... and maybe, just maybe, you can get an extraordinary value. Or maybe you're more interested in getting the competition to pay more... as long as you don't get stuck. It's all part of the fun and the strategy... and since a portion of the proceeds from Going... Going... GONE go to public television, you'll also be supporting the best television you can watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
