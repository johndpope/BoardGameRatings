			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Valley Without Wind, or AVWW for short, is an action-adventure game focusing on exploration in a post-ice-age world.  It's actually set in the far future -- far enough that all recognizable landmarks and land masses have been wiped from the earth.  Magic has surfaced in this ruined world, and is the sole reason that most of the scattered survivors have managed to keep themselves alive.  Not only have they had to face the bitter cold and worldwide glaciers for centuries, but new terrors fill the now-wild world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great fissures have been rent in the earth, and quite a few unpleasant things have crept forth.  Unusually hardy mutations of plants thrive despite the lingering snow at the tail end of the ice age, and many of these plants have deadly adaptations that threaten the surviving humans.  As a direct result of all the monsters, most survivors are alone or in very small groups, living off their wits and their magic to survive.  It is a bleak existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin the game with a character in such a situation.  But your character isn't content to cower in caves and ruins.  Setting out on an adventure that will span regions and even -- if you desire -- continents -- the character can bring together other survivors into settlements that have a better chance of surviving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But as your character starts to explore a bit further from home, some startling discoveries come to light.  Homes and buildings from the past, which should have been destroyed long ago, are discovered in pristine condition -- but empty.  The real disaster might not have been an ice age after all -- and may have been much more recent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
