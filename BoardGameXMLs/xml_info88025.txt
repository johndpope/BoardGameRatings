			<description>Three Wonders, known in Japan as Wonder 3 (ワンダー3) is an arcade game made by Capcom in 1991 using the Capcom Play System (CPS1) engine. It contained three games from which a player may choose:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Midnight Wanderers: Quest for the Chariot (known in Japan simply as Roosters (ルースターズ)) - A platformer, like other Capcom titles such as Mega Man and Strider. The player controls a hobbit named Lou and his travelling companion, Siva, to basically run, climb, and shoot at enemies.&lt;br/&gt;   2. Chariot: Adventure through the Sky (known in Japan simply as Chariot (チャリオット)) - A basic shoot-'em up game featuring the characters from Midnight Wanderers, but in a Gradius-esque game.&lt;br/&gt;   3. Don't Pull (ドンプル) - A puzzle game similar to games like the Eggerland series and Pengo that involves pushing blocks to crush monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Wonders was ported in 1998 to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capcom rereleased this collection of games in 2006 onto Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and Capcom Classics Collection Remixed on the PSP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main character of the Chariot and Midnight Wanderers games Lou, was used as an assist only character for Marvel vs Capcom he also had the option character from Midnight Wanderers known as Firestorm with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lou's Companion Siva, has a character based on him as a tribute, featuring on Capcom's Cannon Spike game. The character is called Shiba Shintaro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Three Wonders&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
