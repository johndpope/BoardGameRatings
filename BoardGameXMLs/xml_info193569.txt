			<description>Eldritch is a game set in H.P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s gothic world of unfathomable creatures and ancient powers. From 3 to 5 players, you play cultists vying for the favour of the Great Old Ones who slumber away the ages in their mythical prisons across the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel to strange locations in search of fragments of spells and glyphs of power; uncover ancient mysteries, defeat challenges, and risk your very sanity to be the first player to conjure the manifestation of your favoured deity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast spells, send twisted beasts to assault your foes, and build your own power base &amp;ndash; using your own sanity to fuel your efforts. Risk too much and you will go irrevocably insane&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With art by the amazing Will Liu, Eldritch features a slew of cards, dice, madness counters, and&amp;hellip; four giant and gorgeous models of the Great Old Ones: Hastur, Nodens, Cthulhu, and Ithaqua which are your ultimate goal and the means by which you will crush your enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming in 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
