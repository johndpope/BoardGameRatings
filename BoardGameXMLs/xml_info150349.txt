			<description>Deductio is a French card game for 2-8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose the number of cards you want to play with. To start, 3 cards per player are dealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example : you have 3 players and you decide to play with 3 cards. Take the numbered cards from 1 to 10. Mix them up, and distribute them face down. The last card is placed onto the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oldest player begins. He multiplies a couple of his cards and then announces the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example : the first player has cards 2, 5 and 8. Consequently he can associate 3 couples of cards : 2 and 5, 2 and 8, 5 and 8. He chose the first and declares : &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His opponents have to deduce which couple it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example : to obtain 10, you can either have the 2 and the 5, or the 1 and the 10. In that case, the second player has the 1 : thus he validates the first hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns in a clockwise direction declaring a multiple, until one player has identified which card is on the table. He says &amp;quot;Deductio&amp;quot; and declares the number of the hidden card without showing the card to the others. If he is right, he scores a point. If he can identify the cards in each player's hand without any mistake, he scores a bonus point, and the hand is over. If he is wrong, he loses 1 point and the hand goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 10 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experienced&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play with 4 cards or more following the same rules. The number of possible couples (for example, 6 couples for 4 cards) and the multiples related to each value increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turns, each player can play the joker card. He puts it in front of him and turns it face down once used. It will allow him to pass his turn once without declaring any number. It can be played at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
