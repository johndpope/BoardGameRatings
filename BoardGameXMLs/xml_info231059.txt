			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monstrous Pages for Shadow of the Demon Lord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unthinking and uncaring, giants are more forces of nature than villains. Birthed long ago in the time of the Troll King, the consensus among the learned is that giants were enslaved, bred, created, or otherwise spawned to serve as war machines during the Troll Wars. Untouched by the degradations of their former masters, they trudge on, indulging in their base desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment of Monstrous Pages, Forces of Nature, examines giants in all their menace. From their uncertain origins to an overview of their strange beliefs and behaviors, in these pages you will find everything you need to let loose these brutes to stomp across your campaign. This entry also expands on giants by providing customization options and abhorrent new breeds. Read on and create nasty, brutish, and gigantic encounters your players will soon not forget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
