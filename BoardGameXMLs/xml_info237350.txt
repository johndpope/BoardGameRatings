							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Lychen Cemetery</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Lychen Cemetery was once the crowning glory of the noble families that lived in the region. Hundreds of hours and thousands of coins went into producing fine mausoleums and crypts for the dead, in a futile attempt to retain glory in death. Now, the cemetery lies abandoned and overgrown, and the cemetery is now home to far less noble denizens..&lt;br/&gt; Old Lychen Cemetery is a printable RPG floorplan compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt; Contents: A 30x30 battlemap depicting the surface. The misty graveyard is littered with overgrown tombs, gravestones and mausolea. Each one has a set of stairs descending into the darkness. GMs can pick any of the 15 Crypt maps that are included in this set when the party venture below ground, making each encounter and crypt unpredictable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crypt maps include vampire coffins, flooded crypts, large family vaults, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discover Range features large surface battlemaps and smaller underground rooms and chambers. When your party discover an entrance to the underground, simply use the underground map of your choice. It can be different every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are 300dpi full size jpgs, for poster printing or VTT. (n.b. gridless version only available as jpeg)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
