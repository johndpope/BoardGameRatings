			<description>The Sabre Role-Playing Game Introductory Module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the manual contains all the information you need to play Sabre, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot to take in. Seeing the system in action is the best way to experience how it all comes together, so in the following pages you&amp;rsquo;ll find a fully-prepared introductory adventure to play through, complete with tips to guide you through the game mechanics. I&amp;rsquo;ll assume the person reading this is planning to run the game as the Game Master &amp;ndash; either that, or you&amp;rsquo;re one of the players looking for an inside scoop on the story. That&amp;rsquo;s okay, it&amp;rsquo;ll be our little secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module is designed for 3-5 players. You can probably strip the encounters to the bare minimum and substitute monsters if you want to run with a single player, just bear in mind what&amp;rsquo;s been prepared over the following pages requires a wide spread of skills. Four players is a good number, but include as many as you are willing or able to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battles within the story are easier to run with the accompanying maps, but they&amp;rsquo;re not essential. The combat areas aren&amp;rsquo;t complex and can simply be described with words, or drawn on a scrap of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes pre-generated characters ready for print-and-play use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
