							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribes Most Foul: Hobgoblins</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bored of pitting your PCs against boring, one-dimensional kobolds, orcs and goblins? Want to provide your monstrous minions with style and flair in appearance, mannerisms and battlefield tactic? Then, Tribes Most Foul is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each supplement presents three tribes in rich, flavoursome detail and includes notes on the tribe&amp;rsquo;s society, practises, ecology, lair, battle tactics and notable tribal personalities as well as sample stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes Most Foul: Hobgoblins presents three hobgoblin tribes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Tainted Stain: Forging a harrowed path across the civilised lands is the entrada of the Tainted Strain, a tribe of exiled hobgoblin whelps blighted with dangerous, forbidden arcane powers at birth. Led by the child-savant Pelagar, they march on the great forested valleys of the elves to fulfil their prophesies of fire and ash.&lt;br/&gt;    Silent Eclipse: Lurking within the dark chasms of the Gloaming Forest, the Hobgoblins of the Silent Eclipse infiltrate the lands of men at night in search of prey. The hobgoblins venerate Silhouette-Over-Moon, a great owl born of the Shadow Plane, who directs the tribe from the wood&amp;rsquo;s lightless heart.&lt;br/&gt;    Union of Seven: Veiled in green and gold, the howling sisters of the Union of Seven raze towns to ash and sift through the remains for survivors to enslave and treasure to plunder. The lesser men of the tribe and the mongrelfolk bastards of the Union&amp;rsquo;s interbred culture serve as little more than slaves to their matriarchal overseers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
