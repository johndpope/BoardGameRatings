							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pearl Harbor Attack  Balls: DARTS â€“ Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is a real naval war game with a unique twist - it  uses DARTs and BALLs to play.   Players will attack nicely illustrated battleship profiles by tossing and  dropping  darts along with rolling balls.  While tradition pointed darts can be used,   the more graphic play uses dart(s) or ball(s)  dipped in washable collorinfg for graphic splatters that mimic highly visual and realistic explosions.  The game can be very simple dart toss game or be more complex by using the written game guide rules.   Game play utilizes an eraser head dart but players can choose their own metal/plastic point type darts.   The duration of play is between 20 minutes to more than an 60 minutes, depending if you play one, two, or all three parts.  You can play the game in teams, family play or solo.   A great game for adults and kids above the age of  seven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Parts Include:  Target Illustration are legal size (8.5&amp;quot; X 14&amp;quot;) black-gray-white (gray scale) colored prints - they are reproducable for non-commercial home/classroom use by the game purchaser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Top View - Battleship target illustrations include the USS Arizona, USS Neveda, USS California, USS Tennessee, USS Maryland, USS West Virgnia, USS Oklahoma, &amp;amp; USS Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Side View - Battleship target illustrations include the USS Nevada, USS Arizona, USS West Virginia, USS Oklahoma, and the USS California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;One mini ball  and one eraser head dart included&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Game guide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game shipped regular USPS  mail in  a   sealed 2&amp;quot;w X 16&amp;quot;L tube&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Upgrade to the larger 11&amp;quot;  X 17&amp;quot; colorized version of the paper battleship target illustrations for an additional $20  - email me for this upgrade option&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
