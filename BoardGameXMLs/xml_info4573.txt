			<description>This game is designed to be similar to real life, yet remain fun as a game. The idea is that you have just completed high school and you now face decisions as what to do with the rest of your life. The game consists of 60 years (revolutions around the board) and the player with the highest net worth at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
