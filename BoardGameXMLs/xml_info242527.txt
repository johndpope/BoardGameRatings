			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-player arcade dogfighting for your table! Every turn your bullets move in the direction they're fired. Zip around the map, fire your bullets and be the last animal standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a large grid play surface with boundary edges.  Players alternate turns.  During a player's turn they move their token and may fire a projectile (each projectile is fired in one of eight directions).  After each player moves and fires, all projectiles move one square in the direction of their invariable travel.  Projectiles that move into an occupied square &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; the object in the square and become expended.  Player tokens that are thus hit incur damage.  Note that projectiles do not &amp;quot;belong&amp;quot; to one player or another, and it is possible for players to &amp;quot;shoot themselves&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to remain alive longer than your opponent.  The first player destroyed loses; the other player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything that &amp;quot;moves off&amp;quot; the right side of the play surface reappears on the left side of the play surface; anything that &amp;quot;moves off&amp;quot; the top of the play surface reappears on the bottom of the play surface, etc., in a mode common to many old video arcade games.  Thus, as turns progress the grid becomes increasingly encumbered with projectiles (insuring that impacts occur increasingly frequently).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
