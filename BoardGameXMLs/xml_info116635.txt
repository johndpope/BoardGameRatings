			<description>Promotional game from the Gulf petrol company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a 'pad' on which to write their answers. This pad is called in Britain, a Magic Slate. You write on it, then peel the cover and, hey presto, the writing disappears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone plays at the same time. A word is read out and each player spells it as best they can. The first player to get an agreed number right, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suspect this was intended as an in-car game, to pass the time on a long drive. That connection would explain the fact that it was made by a petrol supplier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
