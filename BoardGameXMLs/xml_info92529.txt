							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AAARRR!!!: The Treasure of Scurvy Jenkins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trim the sails and hoist the jib!  Written by author Mike Lafferty (The 6th Seal, Wizards &amp; Wiseguys), this ready-to-run Quick Play Adventures pirates scenario takes you out onto the high seas during the Golden Age of Piracy. AAARRR!!!: The Treasure of Scurvy Jenkins comes complete with historical write-ups, plot hooks, original maps, a detailed scenario, adventure seeds, and a number of interesting pre-generated characters that let you jump right into the action. Break out of a Spanish jail, steal a ship from a fearsome piratess, rub elbows with other undesirables at a raucous pirate port, swash your buckle against master swordsmen, capture a merchant vessel, battle a sea monster, survive a storm at sea, and try not to awaken an ancient Aztec evil as you search for the lost treasure of Scurvy Jenkins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AAARRR!!!: The Treasure of Scurvy Jenkins is perfect for use as a one-shot or for tournament play. It is designed specifically for those who get the urge to run a pirates scenario after watching Pirates of the Caribbean, Yellowbeard, or Cutthroat Island, but have no time to do research, design adventures, draw maps, and sit through lengthy character generation processes for a game that will only be played once or twice. AAARRR!!!: The Treasure of Scurvy Jenkins does all the prep work for you. All you need is the d20 Modern Roleplaying Game to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
