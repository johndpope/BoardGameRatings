			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don't show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Enter the bustling hearth of the Great City business, enter the ever-crowded bazaar the Great City is renowned for, enter the Marketplace!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This great business area is situated in the very center of the Great City and, day by day, hundreds of street vendors, peddlers, foreign merchants, barters and food vendors gather in this place to make business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small fence surrounds the marketplace for the sole purpose of delimiting the area; often, in fact, many vendors set their booths outside the fence due to the lack of space. During the night the city watch patrols the area in order to prevent theft and robbery. Merchants of the Great City also have representative's booths in the Marketplace and they think having a shop facing the marketplace is a great deal; for this reason the shops in the square are highly prized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Blueprint you'll find an overview map of the whole Marketplace complete with booths and tents, plus maps detailing various tents and booths.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
