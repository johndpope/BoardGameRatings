			<description>&amp;quot;Annet Futatabi (アネット・再び), is a 1993 side scrolling, beat-em-up video game released by Wolf Team, only in Japan for the Sega Mega-CD game console. It is the final in a trilogy of games, which include Earnest Evans, and El Viento. The menus and game screens are all in English, while the dialogue and ending credits are in Japanese.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Set in the same fictional universe as Earnest Evans and El Viento, the story takes place two years after El Viento, and concludes the story of Annet and Earnest. Zigfried's true motives are finally revealed as well. Being rescued from certain sacrifice by father figure Ernest Evans, Annet travels across Europe and encounters a local sect that wants her special pendant. After an attempted ambush in the sect's castle, she barely escapes, and begins another quest to protect the world from destruction.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unlike the first and second entries, which are 2D platform video games, Annet Futatabi is a side scrolling beat-em-up that deeply resembles Sega's Golden Axe and Bare Knuckle franchises. However, like the previous installments, the story is told through cutscenes between each brief multi-scrolling level, which includes a boss character, who appears out of thin air, usually wielding a weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annet's magic has 5 levels and is regulated by a power meter, and regenerates automatically. As her power meter increases, the higher her magical attacks become. The levels range from wind, earth, water, fire, and death. Wind is the lower level, while death is the highest level. However, magic cannot be used against the bosses. In addition to magic, Annet wields a sword, rather than bladed boomerangs. There are not any other weapons or power-ups included in the game, other than health restoration items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annet's journey ranges from escaping an enemy castle, being captured and forced to fight in a colosseum, spelunking in a tomb,&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Anetto Futatabi&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
