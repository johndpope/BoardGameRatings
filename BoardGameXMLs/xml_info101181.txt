			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Starship 1&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Starship 1 is to destroy alien spacecraft while maneuvering through star and asteroid fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a first person perspective on a black-and-white monitor. The player's ship is controlled with a control yoke that is connected to two potentiometers. There is also a lever that controls whether the ship is moving &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;slow&amp;quot;. Compared to common arcade games of the time, Starship 1 was comparatively advanced, but used quite a bit of analog technology that would become less common in arcade games in following years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As enemies appear onscreen, the player tries to center the enemy in the crosshairs and shoot it with his &amp;quot;phasors&amp;quot; by pulling a trigger on the control yoke. Alternatively, the player has 5 &amp;quot;proton torpedoes&amp;quot; per game that can be fired by pressing a large white button on the dashboard. This will destroy any enemy ship on screen, regardless of whether it is in the crosshairs (which are painted directly on the screen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemy ships are roughly patterned after ships from the Star Trek: The Original Series and the title device from the 1967 episode &amp;quot;The Doomsday Machine&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player does not view the game monitor directly; the monitor is recessed in the cabinet, and the player views a reflected image of the monitor in a half-silvered mirror with a space background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
