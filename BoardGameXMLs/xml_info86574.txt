							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thief</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've played a generic adventuring rogue, but come on: Don't you really want to play a thief?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thief is a canny warrior of the streets. He combines stealth and action to steal what he wants or needs. Many thieves are selfish footpads and bandits, but others are heroic outlaws who fight and steal for the good of the common people. Thieves may be good or evil, but above all, they follow their own law. They value freedom and the power to take their own risks and run their own lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thieves are stealthy warriors cut from the mould of heroic (or &amp;quot;pulp&amp;quot;) fantasy. They're sneaky but able swordsmen who gain special benefits from fighting in the shadows. They don't just lauch &amp;quot;sneak attacks&amp;quot; -- they backstab!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
