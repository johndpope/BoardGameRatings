			<description>Classic Coins of the 20th Century is a card game for two or four players.  Four players may play as individuals or in teams of two.  The deck consists of 36 cards; there are four suits, or coin denominations.  Each suit consists of ranks one through nine, representing the years the coins were minted: 1911 through 1919.   During this period the designs of US coins changed.  The nickel was redesigned in 1913.  The dime, quarter and half dollars were all redesigned in 1916.  These coins are considered great examples of the coining art. On a turn, a player must play one card to the table to try to capture one or more cards that sum to that card's value; if a player can't or doesn't want to do this, he or she must lay one card on the table.  Your goal is to capture as many cards, especially those valuable first year designs, as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar game play as seen in Casino and Scopa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
