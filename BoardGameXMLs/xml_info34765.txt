			<description>Simple roll-and-move game of traveling in Africa. The game consists of a cardboard folder w/an 8-fold game board paper map attached. No tokens or dice are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a series of events, triggered by landing on their respective space. The event legends are described in simple rhymes, and tie in with the board illustrations. They can be beneficial as well as bad. Players race to be first to #100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is probably from the late 1920ies or early 30ies, due to spelling and art style. No copyright date is attached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art was provided by painter &amp;amp; illustrator Einar Torsslow, and may be considered mildly racist today (the Negroes are depicted with black-face), and there is a reference to cannibals in event #62. The tone is more that of a childrens adventure tale than anything else, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following information is provided on the back of the folder: Akt. bol. Ernst Frick &amp;amp; Co. / Stockholm / Pris 2:75 / Haeggstr&amp;ouml;ms lito. 200302&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
