							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wargamer&#039;s Guide to Third Reich</name>
									
			<description>The Wargamer's Guide to Third Reich followed the guides to Panzerblitz and Midway. In many ways this guide became a showcase for Marcus Watney. The guide does the best when it deviate to other writers, mostly when the dogma of rehistorizing is abandoned. There were fewer variants and tools in this publication than its predecessors, but there were a couple redeeming points. There is also a small reference map on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is entered into the database not as a strategy guide, but as an expansion/variant of Rise and Decline of the Third Reich based on the alternate play content contained in the guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the guide are:&lt;br/&gt;Record Keeping in Third&amp;nbsp;Reich. This is a BPR record keeping sheet for covering 1 year of play. While superseded by spreadsheets and laptops, it is a useful tool for those players who prefer a more &amp;ldquo;retro&amp;ldquo; style.&lt;br/&gt;Grand&amp;nbsp;Strategy&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Third&amp;nbsp;Reich: An Introduction to The Avalon Hill Game Company's Most Popular Strategic Game. An unabashedly biased introduction to the mechanisms and interactions of the game. Probably based on the second edition.&lt;br/&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Fuehrer's&amp;nbsp;War: German Play in the Third Edition. Game play considerations and notes for the main actor on the stage (after all, no Nazis-no game right?). Largely assumes German strategy follows the historical narrative.&lt;br/&gt;A&amp;nbsp;Green&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Pleasant&amp;nbsp;Land: Sealion versus Cromwell. When Hitler's armies reached the coast of France, his war was won. Churchill, history and Third&amp;nbsp;Reich don't see it that way. This article examines crossing the channel and removing the West Front problem.&lt;br/&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Unsolved&amp;nbsp;Problem: In Defense of France. Experienced players know that the longer France survives, the shorter Germany's life is going to be. Defensive options and workable counter attack strategies are the topic here.&lt;br/&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Long&amp;nbsp;Road&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;Rome: An Italian Strategy. Kesselring said, the Italian is not a soldier at heart. This article examines Italy as more of a threat than a power. Some Italian adventuring in the Mediterranean are discussed&lt;br/&gt;Soviet&amp;nbsp;Options: Russian Play in Third&amp;nbsp;Reich. Mostly a Russian survival guide, sometimes a German guide.&lt;br/&gt;BRP&amp;nbsp;Warfare:&amp;nbsp;The Clash of Economies. An odd article for those players with the leaning a mafioso investment banker. Some good nuggets, mostly because it deviates from the replay history theme.&lt;br/&gt;Diplomacy&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Third&amp;nbsp;Reich: Another Facet of the Strategic Game. More than anything else, this makes the guide worth reading. This a variant is based on minor country interaction from Origins of WWII. It removes the rather rigid minor country rules from the game and installs a competitive foreign aid-diplomacy system, with situational and event driven modifiers. One might think of it like the Vichy activation rule applied to everyone.&lt;br/&gt;Advanced&amp;nbsp;Tactics: The Tricks of the Trade. Nuance is the word here. Since Third&amp;nbsp;Reich is a game, Marcus Watney talks about the gamey side of the game. Somethings were built in, others were accidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
