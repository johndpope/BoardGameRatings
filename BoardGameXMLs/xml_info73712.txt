			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;Mystic Realm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time there was a great realm, ruled by a wise and powerful sorcerer-king. The land was rich and the people prosperous. Out of their wealth a great temple was constructed, puissant magical items created and many fantastic beasts imported from faraway lands. But as is the way of all things, eventually the king grew old and passed on from this mortal plane.  &lt;br/&gt;His son inherited his realm and magical talent but not his wisdom. Greedy and grasping, searching for greater treasures and power than even his father had amassed, he reached past the limits set by the gods and opened a rift into a dimension of primal chaos. The once prosperous realm was sucked in and lost for millennia.  &lt;br/&gt;But now a new magic portal has opened leading to that mystic realm, or at least to what that realm has become. Overrun by monsters, the few remaining inhabitants are oppressed. The once-great temple is overgrown, the capital city lost in a jungle teeming with cannibals and wild beasts. But golden treasures and powerful magic items still remain, waiting for brave adventurers to discover. &lt;br/&gt;And the greedy prince? He too, remains. Preserved by his wicked magic, he is now an undead master, the Liche Lord. Still ruling the ruined kingdom from his father&amp;rsquo;s throne, his only remaining desire to suck the life force from the bones of anyone foolish enough to enter his kingdom. Are you brave enough to dare his challenge? And are you clever enough to return with the fame, fortune and treasures of a lifetime? &lt;br/&gt;Mystic Realm is a one to ten player game of adventure set in a fantasyland. Players take the role of a heroic character and travel through the realm searching for treasures and encountering dangerous monsters (and sometimes something even more dangerous: the other players.) The player who survives and returns to the portal with the most treasure and fame is declared the winner. There are twenty different character types to choose from, everything from an Amazon to a Ninja to a Witch.  &lt;br/&gt;Easy to play, the game includes: complete rules, five player aid cards, six encounter cards, six sheets of terrain tiles, and one sheet of DIE-CUT playing pieces (including treasures and magic items.) Paper, pencil and some six-sided dice (not included) are required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
