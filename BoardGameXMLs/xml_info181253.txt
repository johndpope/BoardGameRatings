							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rodeo Judge</name>
									
			<description>Rodeo Judge, was invented by Scott Mendes, the 1997 PRCA World Champion Bull Rider. Two to four players compete head-to-head in turn based competition to win titles and awards. Challenge your Google Plus friends, or go solo against Scott directly. Compete against the worlds best players to become world champion in an exciting and fast pace card game. This free to play card game is a turn based multiplayer video game loosely based on the game of 21, except that it incorporates rodeo scoring rules totaling 25. Other custom rodeo rules are added for buck-offs, rerides, dismounts, stock and ride hands, cowboy ups, and yes, even rodeo clowns are included in the game rules too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
