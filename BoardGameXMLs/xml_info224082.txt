			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cu&amp;aacute;l? Is an intriguing boardgame of observation and deceiving.&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to reach victory with your secret piece before your opponent finds it? Which one would be the secret piece of your opponent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Cu&amp;aacute;l? (translated as &amp;ldquo;Which one?&amp;rdquo;) is an abstract strategy game for 2 players in which each one controls 8 pieces in 4 different shapes each shape having unique movement patterns. At the beginning of the match each player choses 1 of their 8 pieces as the secret piece using a deck of 8 cards. Winning may be achieved by reaching the adversary end of the board or by discovering which one is the opponent secret piece.  &lt;br/&gt;During the game pieces may be captured but they don&amp;rsquo;t leave the game, instead they are positioned by whom captured it. By revealing one of the remaining 7 cards, any player may move 2 pieces or 1 piece 2 times in their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
