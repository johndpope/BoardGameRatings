			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your world once was a place of freedom. Free thought however lead to conflict between the powerful states of the world, this of course lead to war. As world wars waged the wealthy became poorer as governments drained their income to fund their machines of war. Unhappy with their loss the one hundred wealthiest individuals in the world gathered together and formed the Governmental Planetary Contingent (GPC). Their goal: to maintain wealth and luxury through times of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Great War waged the GPC had no trouble increasing their wealth by offering support to opposing nations. Slowly the GPC drained the whole world of its riches. War soon ended separating the nation into two distinct classes the GPC and the ruined states that remained after the war. The GPC settled on the one piece of land in the world untouched by war - The Phrodite Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here the GPC set to work creating holiday resorts called institutes. Here members of the GPC could find an escape from the economy and boredom of business. However ten years after the opening of Aphrodite (the first institute) the employees of the GPC rebelled taking over the institute and converting it to a military base. It was with this event that the first ever Warlord declared war on the GPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unequipped for war the GPC saw one solution, to recreate the reasons for fighting. Supplies and weapons were sent out to key individuals in the ruined states who immediately started to gather forces and fight for the resources and rewards offered by the GPC. As Aphrodite lay in the hands of terrorists the GPC, safely at home in their capital at the far north of the Phrodite coast, funded the ruined states warlords more and more. Eventually Aphrodite was attacked and a ruined state warlord took control. By this time the GPC had researched methods of mind control and were able to come up with an addictive pill entitled &amp;quot;The Bless&amp;quot; this would help them retake their prize institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bless not only allowed the easy control of a large mass of people but it also took away their freedom and control making them slaves of the GPC. Slowly the Bless was introduced to Aphrodite and order was eventually restored. The Phrodite Coast was reopened as the luxury resort it was meant to be some thirty years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things were working out as planned, the world was at war and the GPC was profiting from selling weapons and goods. One problem arose however; the Bless took incredible amounts of raw resources to be created. These resources were found almost everywhere but the Phrodite coast. As a solution The Bless was introduced to the ruined states, its addictiveness drove the warlords to mine the raw resources needed and exchange them to the GPC for fresh doses of the pill. The GPC was on top again watching the warlords fight among themselves while they sat in luxury in their institutes, gods to their Blessed slaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon warlords started to become upset by the zombie like effect of the Bless on their troops and a treaty was made among fifty percent of the warlords to ban the pill. This treaty was the start of the Free worlds Government, a group of warlords apposed to and obsessed with the destruction of the GPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the GPC owns eight institutes along the Phrodite coast. Each under the control of the Blessers: GPC head officers. The Blessers are in competition with one another as the GPC tends to offer more funds and support to those institutes they deem best. Of course the Blessers themselves never take the Bless but are in control of its distribution. Apart from Blesser competition, the Free worlds constantly raid institutes destroying as much of the Bless as they can. The Free worlds have two major goals at the current time, to destroy the GPC and find a cure to the addictive Bless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an employee of the GPC but your life is about to change! Over the last few weeks you have been questioning yourself, questioning the Bless and doubting your wealthy masters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
