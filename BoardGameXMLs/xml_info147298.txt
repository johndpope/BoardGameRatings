			<description>Odysseo is a chance and strategy game. The goal is to move your checkers from a starting point to one of the available exits (the opponents' starting points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn, rolls the dice, then moves one of your checker by the corresponding number of cases. Whenever possible introduce a new checker on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Checkers movement is limited by simple rules: 1) moving back and forth during the same turn is also prohibited; 2) moving through other checkers is not permitted; 3) finishing the movement on an opponent's checkers removes it from the game; 4) finishing the movement on a blue case removes your checker from the game.&lt;br/&gt;Also, having one of your checkers being removed while standing on one of the white cases surrounding your starting point allows you to recover the removed checker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is only one player with checkers left on the board and scoring is done as such: 1) saved checkers: 2pts each; 2) checkers on the board: 1 pt each; 3) removed checkers: 0 pt each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The length of the game can be shortened by starting with fewer checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
