			<description>Designed to be played by up to four people on a road trip, Players search for combinations of letters and numbers on license plates to make a winning hand. The driver may have to referee, but should not try to play &amp;ndash; be safe and keep your eyes on the road!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player needs a game book and a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;A license plate is dealt when your vehicle either passes - or is passed - by a vehicle in the next lane. &lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has finished collecting their license&lt;br/&gt;plates, it&amp;rsquo;s time for each player to figure out their best hand to check their boxes on their book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player who has the most boxes checked get the sticker on his book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player with the most stickers at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
