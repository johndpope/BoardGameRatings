			<description>I have released a series of games oriented towards improving cognitive skills in a number of important areas.  These games have been integrated into a single app called Mind Games.  The games are based, in part, on concepts from cognitive psychology.  The Mind Games app will allow you to track your scores on each of the games.  The scoring system utilizes some concepts from standardized testing so that you can compare your scores with the scores of others and across games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipation &amp;ndash; This game allows you to practice your ability to think ahead and respond rapidly.  A series of images appear, and you must choose whether the two on the left match as quickly as possible.  In order to get the best score, you have to also pay attention to the images that are coming next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attention Training Game - This game is based on the flanker attention task.  A series of arrows will appear, and you must choose the direction that the middle arrow points, while ignoring the other arrows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divided Attention I - This game allows you to practice your divided attention skills and processing speed.  Two categories appear at the top of the screen and a group of images below.  Tap all the images that fall into the two categories as quickly as possible.  To get the best score, keep both categories in mind at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Face Memory Game &amp;ndash; This game allows you to develop your ability to quickly learn and recognize faces.  Two lists of nine faces are briefly shown, and you must recognize the faces that were shown from faces that were not in the original list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math Star - This game will help you practice basic arithmetic skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); however, the main point of this game is not arithmetic skills.  The problems are easy, but you must focus and be quick to improve your score. Your score is based on the speed and accuracy of your performance.  Be careful because your attention to detail is important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mental Categories - This game will help you practice your mental processing speed and rapid categorization of pictures.  Four types of pictures will display, and your job is to as rapidly and accurately as possible choose the category to which the image belongs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mental Flex - This game allows you to practice your cognitive flexibility.  You must rapidly switch mental sets, which is an &amp;ldquo;executive function.&amp;rdquo;  A directive will appear (either Word or Color), and you must choose the shape that matches the directive.  If the directive is Color, you choose the shape that is the color of the word.  If the directive is Word, you choose the shape designated by the word, but ignore the color of the directive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory Racer - This game allows you to practice your working memory, concentration, and processing speed.  You must rapidly decide if each image is the same or different from the image that was previously displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory Span - The game allows you to practice your attention, concentration, and working memory.  A series of stimuli are displayed on each trial and highlighted in a specific order.  Your job is to pay close attention and touch the images in the same order after they are displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serial Memory Game &amp;ndash; This game allows you to improve your sequential memory.  You will be presented with a sequence of 10 numbers and 10 faces on the second trial.  You attempt to learn this 10 item sequence in as few trials as possible.  This seems very difficult at first, but keep trying and you will learn the sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial Memory Game &amp;ndash; This game allows you to improve your memory for spatial locations.  A grid of tiles is presented, and tiles will flip over on each trial.  Remember as many tiles as you can, and then flip the tiles to match the initial presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visual Memory Game &amp;ndash; This game allows you to improve your visual memory.  You will be presented with a mix of visual stiumuli and then be asked to identify the stimuli you saw versus new stimuli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vocabulary Star - This game allows you to improve your vocabulary and spelling skills.  It contains a large database of words and their definitions.  The words are at a high school through college level.  You will need to practice this game for several months.  It is a fun way to increase your word knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
