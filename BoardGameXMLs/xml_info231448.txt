			<description>This game is about the race between the hare, the hedgehog and the hedgehogs wife. Movement ist determined by two spinners, one for the hare and one for the hedgehogs. The hedgehogs have to complete the track once from and start in opposite directions. The hare has to run the track twice (back and forth), so he ends at his starting space.&lt;br/&gt;There are obstacles on the track (trenchs, fences, hedges, furrows, crossroads) which hinder hare and hedgehogs differently. Every time the hare passes a hedgehog the player has to shout:&amp;quot; Hoppla Swinegel (oops hedgehog)&amp;quot;. If a hedgehog passes the hare the player shouts: &amp;quot;Ick b&amp;uuml;n allhier (I'm already here)&amp;quot;.The first player to reach his destination space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
