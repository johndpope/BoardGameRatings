			<description>Triple Threat is a two-player micro strategy game set that includes three micro games: Better Gnomes and Gardens, Conquest of the Cosmos and Dragon's Dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better Gnomes and Gardens:&lt;br/&gt;The greatest magazine known to gnome-kind, Better Gnomes and Gardens (BG&amp;amp;G), is about to announce the Gardener of the Year Award.  That winner will be elevated to gnome celebrity status overnight if selected.  And it just so happens that this year, the magazine will be judging gardens in your area of the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any gnome worth their garden hoe knows that only fairy dust will grow the best flowers.  For years, you and your partner have found the perfect spot where the little winged dandruff-sufferers fly.  However, with the contest looming, the magical gloves are off between you two.  You&amp;rsquo;ll use your spells to rearrange the garden a bit.  Hey, you can&amp;rsquo;t help it if your flowers happen to be the only ones under the oncoming flying fertilizers.  As they say, &amp;quot;That&amp;rsquo;s just how the seedling sprouts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Better Gnomes and Gardens is to maneuver your Flower cards into the path of oncoming fairies and earn the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest of the Cosmos:&lt;br/&gt;Space, a word that means lots of nothing.  Your mission is to seek out five points of planetary goodness.  To destroy civilizations and others that get in your way.  To boldly go and say, &amp;quot;This is mine!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Conquest of the Cosmos is to be the first to earn 5 points by outmaneuvering your opponent and conquering planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon's Dinner:&lt;br/&gt;For centuries the Elder Dragons have been telling younger generations not to play with their food, but you and your friend want to challenge that.  To your surprise, there is so much your food can do.  You can keep decorative trophies or intimidate your food in to doing things for you.  Sure you could just chomp them down to restore your strength, but it&amp;rsquo;s so much better to be entertained.  Now fun is what&amp;rsquo;s for dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Dragon's Dinner is to To collect the most Trophy points from your meal(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
