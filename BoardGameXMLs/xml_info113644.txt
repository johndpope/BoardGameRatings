							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Race For The Cheese</name>
									
			<description>The object of this game is for the Mice to collect as much cheese as they can!... But beware of the Cat. Each player takes three mice of the colour of their choice. These are placed in the Mouse-holes at each corner of the playing board. The first player throws the dice and moves his mouse in an anti-clockwise direction and up the track of his colour to the table where he collects a piece of cheese and tries to return with this to his own Mouse-hole without being caught by the Cat who stalks the outside track. If your Mouse is trapped by the Cat he must go to the Cat's basket and he is out of the game. It's fast and furious fun especially when all your Mice have been caught ... and you take control of the Cat. The winner is the player who collected the most pieces of cheese during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
