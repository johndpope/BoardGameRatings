			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Official Living Jungle Campaign Adventure For Heroes Of All Levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Visions. Dreams. Vague yearnings. Distant drums. A call to adventure has come at last. Think you know all there is to know of Malatra? Foolish children. The dark jungle holds many secrets. Some beautiful. Some terrible. All wondrous. If you would know more, now is the time to answer the call.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins with the heroes being drawn to the Jungle Giants village of Hafoka. This village is located in the south west, north of Kumbo Swamp and west of the Dreaming River. It is largely an unexplored territory, though Pathfinders and Scouts have reported animals, plants and insects of gigantic proportion. It is whispered that the Allmuseri, the evil society of necromantic shamans live here, as well as the last of the cannibalistic tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
