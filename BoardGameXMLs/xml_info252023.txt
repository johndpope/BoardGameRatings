			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psykozone is a vertical scrolling shoot'em-up for the Commodore 64, in the typical &amp;quot;Spy hunter&amp;quot; style; the player controls a motorcycle and must avoid the enemy bikes and shoot them down, all the while staying on the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;In the twenty first century the United States have collapsed into a myriad of independent regions. Some trade is being made between the regions by using a badly kept net of expressways known as the PSYKOZONE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These stretches of road are practically lawless, ruled by gangs of road warriors and genetically-enhanced psycho-bikers. The object of the game is to reach the Pacific ocean by travelling through the most dangerous part of the Psykozone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So load up with ammo, oil your engine, fill up your tank, secure the plutonium rods and brake for no-one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Alf Yngve: Concept, Story, Graphics, Game Design &amp;amp; Artwork&lt;br/&gt;Richard Bayliss: Additional Coding &amp;amp; Enhancements&lt;br/&gt;Jason Kelk: Loading Screen &amp;amp; Title Screen Graphics&lt;br/&gt;Matt Simmonds, Paul Hannay: Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
