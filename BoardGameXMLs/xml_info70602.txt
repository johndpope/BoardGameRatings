			<description>Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 takes place during World War II and focuses on realistic team strategy and tactics rather than the faster paced run and gun gameplay of other WW2 series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most levels, the player is in command of one or two separate 1-3 man teams, with the exception of several sections in which the player is not in command of any unit. There are two types of teams, which are automatically provided before each mission:&lt;br/&gt;    * Fire team: Made up of soldiers with the M1 Garand and the Browning Automatic Rifle and are used for fixing the enemy with suppressive fire.&lt;br/&gt;    * Assault team: Made up of soldiers usually with the M1A1 Carbine and the Thompson submachine gun and is good for flanking the enemy while they are pinned down by the fire team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, some levels provide the player with a tank in lieu of a team, providing players with heavy firepower and mobile cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brothers in Arms is notable for its intuitive command system. Teams and tanks can be ordered to move, lay suppressive fire, rally, find cover, and charge the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus on team command is emphasized by providing the player with a highly unstable firing capability. Brothers in Arms models weapons with erratic accuracy, and enemy fire can heavily interfere with a player's aim to simulate the effects of suppressive fire.&lt;br/&gt;The relative lack of accuracy is designed to simulate the difficulty in hitting targets in a combat situation as well as forcing the player to use team members to engage enemy units and provide better tactical opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_in_Arms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_in_Arms&lt;/a&gt;:_Road_to_Hill_30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
