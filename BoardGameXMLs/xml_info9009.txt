			<description>The object of Thin Ice is to be the first player to collect three Winning Advice cards. Players receive a Winning Advice card when they give the best answer for getting out of an &amp;quot;unusual predicament&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with a collection of unbelievable predicaments that have really happened to people. Players are asked what they would do to get out of the same situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;right answers&amp;quot; are included in the game on Response Cards. Unfortunately the cards are all mixed-up... and players must use whatever advice is written on the card they select... no matter what it says!  Here is where the &amp;quot;gift of gag&amp;quot; will come in handy as you compete against a choice of unusual answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
