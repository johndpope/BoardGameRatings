							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hardy Boys Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the animated TV adventure series. Players try to solve the mystery of the Golden Idol by aiding the Hardy Boy's father-detective. On your turn, you roll the dice and move along the blue-circle path the number thrown. If you land on one of the 4 large blue circles you draw a card, and if it matches the color of your pawn, you keep it. Placing all 4 of your color cards together forms a picture of the Golden Idol. The first player to &amp;quot;restore&amp;quot; the idol wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
