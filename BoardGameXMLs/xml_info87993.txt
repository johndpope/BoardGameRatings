			<description>From PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Web Enhancement for Three-Dragon Ante&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-Dragon Ante is the exciting new card game that both you and your characters can play (though playing against your character would take a lot of good roleplaying). You can play it with your friends when you need something fun to do between slots at a game convention or while getting food at the local fast-food place, or you can play it as a tournament for prizes.&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, your D&amp;amp;D (or d20 MODERN) characters can play it within the context of a game session. Some guidelines are provided in the game&amp;rsquo;s rulebook for using the Three-Dragon Ante in a D&amp;amp;D adventure, but the possibilities are nearly endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck of the Draw provides additional rules for using the game within the confines of a D&amp;amp;D session, plus new feats that relate to games of chance and a short adventure to demonstrate how to incorporate all these elements into a game session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, feel free to adapt the material presented here as you see fit to make it work with your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
