			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never too young to die...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every race has them, everyone was at one point one of them. We all have fond memories of some and bad memories of others. Children are plot movers and not much else in most games of Dungeons and Dragons. They don&amp;rsquo;t often make good adventurers in the normal sense of the word but they DO make for fun roleplaying experiences when used in the right way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides your players with a template for playing young and adolescent characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Child creation template&lt;br/&gt;    Height &amp;amp; Weight adjustments&lt;br/&gt;    Ability score adjustments&lt;br/&gt;    Level and aging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These materials were designed for use with 5th edition rules and can be played directly in your 5th edition campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
