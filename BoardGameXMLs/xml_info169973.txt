			<description>This abstract game uses pieces shaped like macaron cookies in five different colors (pink, blue, brown, green, and yellow) with four different colors of filling (pink, brown, green, and white). The pieces are played on a cloth board with a checkered grid playing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with two sets of rules. For rule set #1 (2 players only), players begin with 7 pink, 5 brown, and 5 green pieces each and take turns placing them on the board. The winner is the first person to line up at least three pieces of the same color in a row. If both players place all of their pieces without getting three in a row, the second player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For rule set #2 (2-4 players), players take turns drawing random pieces from a bag and placing them on the board. If a player manages to surround any number of pieces in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with two cookies of the same color (one on either end), the player captures all of the surrounded pieces. The captured pieces are worth points at the end of the game. Bonus points are obtained by capturing sets of certain color combinations. When all pieces have been played, the person with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
