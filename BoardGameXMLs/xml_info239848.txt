							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pipers&#039; Quay</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Pipers&amp;rsquo; Quay sits along a rugged stretch of rocky coastline. There are no roads leading in or out of the small community and its only real link to the outside world is by sea. It is a world of its own - its own people, politics, intrigue, and adventure. It is also the home of the Windbreak - a sturdy seaside inn and tavern that is an ideal starting point for any excursion into this area of the Bay of Spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maps and illustrations help guide you through this setting, allowing you to transform it into a place your players can call home, if only for a while. Whether they are accomplished heroes, outlaws, renegades, or travelers simply blown off course, the quaint fishing village is sure to challenge their notion of what a quaint fishing village can be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
