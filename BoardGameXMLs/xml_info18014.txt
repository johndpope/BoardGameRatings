			<description>IAN BOTHAM'S SPORTING CHALLENGE is a sports trivia game carrying the name of a former England Cricketer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is conducted on a hexagonal board with each side representing the home venue of each of the players.  The venues represent six different UK sporting venues (Wembley, Lord's, Wimbeldon, Silverstone, St. Andrews and Newmarket) though the venues themselves have no direct significance to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting at their home venue players roll the dice and move the appropriate number of spaces in the clockwise direction marked on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each colored space landed on a question is answered corresponding to the color of that space:&lt;br/&gt;Purple = Grounds and Venues (GV)&lt;br/&gt;Red = Clubs, Competitions and trophies (CCT)&lt;br/&gt;Yellow = Personalities (P)&lt;br/&gt;Blue = Records, Facts and Feats (RFF)&lt;br/&gt;Mauve = Mixed Bag (MB)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A correctly answered question allows the player to throw and move again - if not, the turn ends and play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coloured space also depicts a trophy then a correctly answered question will earn part of a two part trophy (first time round the trophy itself and then the lid).  The various bits of the trophy are placed in that player's home venue on the appropriately coloured square.  The aim is to amass one trophy and lid for each of the five categories of questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively a playing piece may land on a space marked with a C meaning it is a Challenge position - there are two types of these:&lt;br/&gt;On a white &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; a player may challenge for one of the &amp;quot;unlidded&amp;quot; trophies in that particular home venue (i.e. a trophy already won by another player).  If choosing to challenge for a trophy a player may elect to answer a question himself (in order to &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; the trophy) or challenge his opponent to do so (in order to retain the trophy).&lt;br/&gt;On a striped &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; a player may challenge for a trophy base on either of the adjacent venues, or elect to answer a question in any category for which a trophy base or lid is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player who collects in his/her home venue, five complete trophies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
