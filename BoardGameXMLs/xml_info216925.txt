							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Waves of Fate</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waves of Fate is a collection of three short encounters, all taking place on a boat, designed for five characters between the&lt;br/&gt;levels of 5 and 7. The open sea is a dangerous place ruled by giant beasts, unpredictable weather, and fickle tempers, but those adventurous few traversing its many passages and hazards wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have it any other way; chaos is a small price to pay for the thrills, freedom, and fortune one can find between the waves.&lt;br/&gt;Pirates, merchants, and couriers navigate the water with their own inclinations, but all carry the same understanding: each ship in the blue is at the mercy of Melora and her servitors, and carried by the raging waves and currents into a future that, if nothing else, is often unexpected. So gather your belongings, prepare the rigging, and keep your eyes on the horizon&amp;mdash;for there&amp;rsquo;s no telling where the waves of fate might take you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
