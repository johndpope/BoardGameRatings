							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village Tale</name>
									
			<description>You and your fellows find yourselves owning plots of land in an isolated part of the countryside, halfway between two distant cities.  The land is rich, travelers abound, and there is money to be had in founding a village!  Will you create an economic hub, or a haven for the underprivileged?  Will you foster the arts, or train mighty soldiers?  When people gather and speak of your village, what tales will they tell?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Tale is a Print and Play Card Drafting game inspired by Satoshi Nakamura's Fairy Tale.  The game takes place over four rounds of play.  In each round, players are dealt six or seven cards.  Each player chooses one card and passes the rest of the cards to his or her neighbor (alternating left and right each round).  From the remaining cards, players choose one and pass the rest, and so on, until no cards are left to pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From those cards, players simultaneously play one card into one of the four districts of their village (north, south, east, and west).  Any card effects are resolved.  Then players play three more cards, one at a time in this fashion.  Players discard their remaining cards, and go on to the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After four rounds, players find out how many points their buildings are worth.  Each building has a fixed value or a variable value based on the other types and locations of buildings a player has played.  Whichever player has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
