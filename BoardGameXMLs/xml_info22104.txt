							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Miscellaneous Game Merchandise</name>
									
			<description>This entry should be used to list, sell and trade miscellaneous boardgame related merchandise at BGG. Items can be anything a BoardGameGeek would collect which relates to the hobby. For instance: game catalogues, convention programs, flyers and tickets, game posters, stickers, etc. Basically any items produced by boardgame companies and related businesses used in advertizing or merchandizing. In other words, anything collectible goes here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that boardgame magazines go under Miscellaneous Game Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items used in boardgames themselves can either be submitted as expansions or included in Miscellaneous Game Accessory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For items of role-playing merchandice see Memorabilia, Programs, Catalogs and Other Sundry RPG Related Material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
