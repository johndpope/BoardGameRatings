			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For BX-BECMI Characters Levels 12-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No frills, here. No fancy charts and tables. No art to dazzle your eyes. Just a crawl; that happens to have a bit of a background, and a (group)death-dealing Bad Ass! waiting for the characters. How you run it is your business. What you delete, exchange out/in or modify is up to you. You can be as kind and patient with the players as you like, or let the chips fall (dice roll) where they may. You can allow pre-rolled characters, provide pre-gens yourself, or let the players bring their own, favorite character they have worked hard to get to the levels indicated; reminding them, if the latter, that character-death is part of the game! I issue only the following comment: if run as it is laid out, it is nearly certain that at least one character, and as many as all of them, might die during the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
