							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wine Collector</name>
									
			<description>Wine Collector is a visually dynamic tile-laying game in which you must try and satisfy the whims and wants of a selection of fussy Wine Collectors by finding the relevant wine in your cellar (represented by bottle/label parts), and putting together the relevant wine bottle from your collection of tiles...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limits on available Grape varieties, Flavours, and Nuances will ensure it's not an easy task. Do you push-your-luck and hold out for 'the whole caboodle', or cut your losses and deliver a sub-standard product...?  It's your call, but when the last Wine Collector has left the building, it's game over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take it in turns to either draw a card from one of three decks (either a new one from the top, or the last previously discarded tile) or can choose to satisfy a Wine Collector's demands and 'claim' the relevant Income from that Collector. Collectors will pay well if all their demands are satisfied, or not-so-much if you can only meet some of their expectations...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three tile decks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grapes are double-sided tiles with a particular grape or wine variety on each side. These are placed in front of players when they're drawn, but each player may only have a maximum of four  grapes/varieties in front of them at any one time, but may choose to draw additional Grape tiles and discard down if necessary to ensure they do not exceed this limit. Grape cards will need to be given up for each Wine Collector claimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flavours are tiles that have two representative flavours on them, and they can be utilised one way or the other by rotating the tile through 180 degrees. These are kept in a player's hand until used to claim a Wine Collector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Nuances are tiles that have three descriptors on them, and can be used to satisfy Collector demands either in part or whole, depending on how they are used and which descriptors are covered by other tiles when making a claim. These tiles are also kept in a player's hand until used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's hand size is limited to just six tiles/cards in total (excl. Grapes/Varieties which are kept on the table in front of them), and you must juggle these as best you can to make a call on what tiles are worth holding onto, and which ones can be safely discarded...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
