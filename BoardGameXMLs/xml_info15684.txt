			<description>SGB-1 Mist of the Ardennes (1983) (JPY 1500) &lt;br/&gt;Mist of the Ardennes covers the Battle of the Bulge. The first 26 pgs are devoted to the battle, while the next eleven pgs are actual rules and the final ten pgs cover the charts, table, set-ups, etc. that come with a game. &lt;br/&gt;The map is in two pieces, each 11x17&amp;rdquo; and looks amazingly like SPI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Wacht Am Rhein&amp;rdquo; that I can see (my copy is MINT and I refuse to open it all up), including coloring and style. Judging by the fact that the game lasts five days of the campaign (the 16th to 20th of Dec) and the units included (no SS, but the 2nd PZ and Lehr Pz Divisions), I would guess that the game covers the opening assault by the 5th Panzer Army against Clervaux and the 28th US infantry division. &lt;br/&gt;The game has battalion-sized units almost exclusively. Units have only one combat number and some sort of morale or training rating as there are several units with one or two stars between the combat and movement numbers. The main thing is that the game uses strength points reduction-there are roster sheets for record-keeping of unit losses. The CRT is by strength point loss and there is a detailed chart for CRT modifiers, presumably for combined arms. Also, next to the strength point boxes are a number of boxes for each unit for each day. I would gather that the game tracks unit fatigue as well. There are barrage and range values on artillery and support and range numbers on the regimental HQ units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
