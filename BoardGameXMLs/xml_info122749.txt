			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution is your resource to field forces of either Forsaken: Saint John or The Brood in you Dark Age games.  This is Evolution.  This is not a book about biology or Charles Darwin.  What you will find hereis something else, something darker. We introduceyou now to the bitter reality of the Southern Crusade. Its proud general is John, a giant among theSaints. While in the Forsaken homeland, ruthless politicians manoeuvre for spiritual and worldly power. They struggle against each other with intrigue, deceipt, and any means available. In this twisted version of a classic battle of man against beast, Saint John leads his forces against the deviantcreations of The Mere, The Brood.  Their creators thought they could control them. They were wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
