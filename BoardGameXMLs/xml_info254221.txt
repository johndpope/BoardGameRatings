							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nerd Battles</name>
									
			<description>Nerd Battles is a card game for 2-4 players where nerds of all kinds fight for victory. Each nerd card has a base attack, defense, and IQ.  Extra attack and defense cards can be added to a nerd in battle, where their IQ value is the amount of extra cards they can add.  A nerd's attack and defense values can also be boosted by adding a confidence token.  Defeat 4 nerds and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone starts the game with 2 nerd cards, 4 battle cards, and 4 random confidence tokens.  At the start of a turn, draw 1 nerd card, or 2 battle cards. Then choose to pit your nerd against an opponents' to start a battle, or simply play an action card.  If you start a nerd battle, choose the player you want to attack, and put your nerd into play.  Add battle cards to your nerd to increase their attack defense, keeping the number of cards at or under their IQ value.  At this time, a confidence token can also be added to the nerd.  If the token matches the nerd, they get a permanent +2 to attack and defense.  If it's unmatching, it's only a +1 to those values, and is discarded at the end of the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, the opponent needs to put a nerd into play to defend the attack.  If they can successfully block the attack by getting enough defense to equal or be greater than the attack, they not only don't lose, but they may be able to add enough attack cards to counter attack and defeat the attacking nerd.  They are still limited by the nerds IQ, but can also add a confidence token.  Either way, the losing nerd hides in the winners basement (an area under the play area) and gets turned sideways.  After the battle, all battle cards are discarded, but any nerds that didn't lose stay in play, face up.  Discard down to 7 battle cards, and it's the next player's turn. First player to get 4 nerds in their basement wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
