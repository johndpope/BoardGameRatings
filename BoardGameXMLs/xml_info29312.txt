							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zeppelin: Peter Strasser&#039;s Blitz</name>
									
			<description>Zeppelin covers the battle between Peter Strasser's German Naval Airship Division and British aerial defenses during World War I.  This game was published in the first issue of battle-market magazine dated Spring 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains 1 A4-sized maps, 2 A4-sized tracking aids, 50 1/2&amp;quot; counters, and four pages of rules.  An accompanying article is included in the same magazine.  All A4-sized components are back printed on the maps for other games in the same magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German side includes three types of zeppelins.  Accidents may occur.  The German player secretly plans his raids and the British player assigns defenses.  The planned raids are revealed and any not negated by weather are resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn represents one month, and the game does have a variable endpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Length of gameplay is an estimate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
