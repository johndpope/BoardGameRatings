			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is approximately 6:00 a.m. on March 26th, during the most horrific year of your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A red comet nearly struck the earth, entering orbit, and breaking the known laws of physics in the process. Thousands of fragments of various sizes struck all over the earth, causing tremendous damage. The extent of the damage is unknown, but is presumed to be apocalyptic in scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brown rain stopped about 4 or 5 days ago. The red eye of the comet appears through occasional rents in the near-perpetual cloud cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your hodge-podge band of survivors struggle to survive under apocalyptic conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This is the second in a series of b-movie style post-apocalyptic scenarios for Call of Cthulhu set in the very near future, for 4-6 players. Play in the prior scenario is not required. This game can be played in a single 5-7 hour session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
