			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior, Rogue &amp;amp; Mage is a simple, lightweight roleplaying game that allows a group of players and a game master to experience epic adventures in a fantasy world filled with wondrous magic. This book contains the complete game rules, including character creation, combat, magic, equipment and monsters, as well as a complete fantasy setting, the Fallen Imperium of Vaneria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although WR&amp;amp;M uses three basic fantasy RPG classes in its name, it doesn't make use of classes. Players are encouraged to create their characters freely without having to fit them into archetypal roles. Warrior, Rogue and Mage are actually the character's basic attributes, which measure their capabilities in combat, stealth and academics respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
