			<description>Grand-Prix Elite  is a game about Formula 1 races (11 pages of rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first car to pass through the finish line after 2 or 3 laps is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand-Prix Elite is played on tracks (size of gameboard = 40 cm by 60 cm, roughly). Tracks contains two types of spaces : straight section, or curve. The average length of a lap is between 40 spaces (fast tracks) and 60 spaces (long tracks). For the moment, there are 9 tracks : Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Catalunya, Singapore, China, Le mans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand-prix Elite uses plastic racing cars (dimension = 27 mm long).&lt;br/&gt;Six-sided dice are used for Wear tests, Skid tests, etc...&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules include weather variation and Event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY : each player has a certain number of Speed cards. In order to move his car he plays 1 Speed card. &lt;br/&gt;Then the Speed card goes to his dashboard : this is now the current speed of the car. &lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the player can increase or decrease this speed by 1 level. &lt;br/&gt;Also, extra movements are given by a Tyre-Setup card located in the dashboard. The Tyre-Setup card represents the strategy chosen for the car (soft, hard or rain tyres, aero grip, suspension, etc..)&lt;br/&gt;Once moved, a car can engage another car in order to gain its position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player faces 3 challenges in this game :&lt;br/&gt;a) Damages. The number of Speed cards owned by the player is also the number of damages his car can absorb without consequences. Powerful Speed cards often leads to damages (due to engine wear or dangerous curve)...Some cars are fast but fragiles, so pit stops will be necessary in this case.&lt;br/&gt;b) Curves. Each curve has an optimal speed. If a car's speed exceeds the optimal speed while taking the curve, the car can goes off track (and possibly taking damages). &lt;br/&gt;However, a driver has 3 choices when his car is about to take a curve : short, medium, or long trajectory. With a short trajectory, you go faster, but it's risky. With a long trajectory, you take the curve more easily, but you become an easy prey if engaged by opponents...&lt;br/&gt;Here, tyre and set-up strategies are very important things for purpose of taking a curve.&lt;br/&gt;c) Ghost cars. In addition to his normal car, each player controls one or several Ghost cars. Ghost cars follow their own rules, and symbolize the bulk of lapped cars driven by anonymous drivers. Their purpose is to annoy other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
