			<description>ブゾク &amp;quot;Tribe&amp;quot; is a rather abstract cardgame rendering the conflict between two Mesoamerican tribes.  The game plays over four alternatingly good and bad seasons: trying to increase the size of the tribe in each good season, and attempting to avoid the perils of the bad seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's explicitly a team game.  Teams alternate play: but unlike most such card games, each team-mate plays a card secretly together, then discusses (without revealing anything about the played cards) which should take effect first.  Each card played adjusts the ownership of important resources, might grant a hunting token, or might increase (in a good season) or decrease (in a bad) the size of the tribe.  Largest tribe at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
