			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stars Were Never Meant For Us&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2159 AD. Something approaches, a thing on an orbit from far away. Seemingly a mysterious shard of dark matter, this object is known in obscure prophecy as the Chthonian Star. It is awakening things long thought lost or dead, things that have slumbered awaiting its return. The Unified World Council sends out special teams of sanctioned Wardens, whose job it is to ascertain the new threats to human life, to learn everything they can about them, and fight them wherever they are found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ganymede, the Las Vegas of the Outer Planets. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a little rest and relaxation. Right. All hell breaks loose when someone airs confidential Warden information to an entire entertainment dome. Who would do such a thing? And what do they really want? Find out for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Void is an original Lovecraftian hard sci-fi horror setting, and this is an adventure to take you there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stygian Cycle III &amp;ndash; The House Always Wins:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Is a turn-key adventure, ready-to-run, with most everything you need.&lt;br/&gt;     Takes Characters to the exciting colony of Troy, on Ganymede.&lt;br/&gt;     Is the third adventure in the epic Stygian Cycle campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     Is usable in The Void Organized Play framework &amp;ndash; take your Character from game to game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
