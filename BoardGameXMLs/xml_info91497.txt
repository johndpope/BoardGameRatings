			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pop-Up Dinosaur 1,2,3 consists of two games in one box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a snakes and ladders-style game where players roll a custom d12 that has both movements and hazards to overcome on it. The first to reach the end of the track is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second is a quiz game where players move around the board using a d6, answering Dinosaur trivia questions (which also have visual clues for smaller children) whenever they land on a footprint. Again, the winner is the first to reach the last space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'Pop-up' in the game's title refers to some cut-out dinosaurs which 'pop up' when the board is unfolded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
