			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Out of the north swept the hordes of Lerotra'hh, the Death Goddess of Khazan.  Led by veterans of the Khazan-Ranger wars, the Kazani troops over-whelmed the token resistance in the south until they came to the keep of Marionarsis, near the southern end of the mountain pass known as the Gap in the Teeth of the Gods.  The vetrans call Marionarsis a wizard-butcher and necromancer - and they call his castle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERKILL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your character is one of the Khazani Death Host, and is asked to perform a secret mission of destruction inside the castle called Overkill.  This dungeon is Number 7 in the series of Solitaire Adventures designed for play with Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls.  You will need the rules to T&amp;amp;T, a few six-sided dice, paper, pencil, and this booklet, to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of Overkill has been completely re-written and revised by Michael Stackpole from the preciously published dungeon of the same name by Mike Brines.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
