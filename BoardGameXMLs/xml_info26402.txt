							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Your Surprise Package</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to guess what prize you are about to win. A player begins the round with the cash value of the secret prize. Cash is taken away for each clue given about the prize and the time used by the player in asking yes-or-no questions about the prize. The player with highest value in cash and prizes after a predetermined number of rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a faithful reproduction of the short-lived game show hosted by George Fenneman, although it is sometimes referred to as Surprise Package due to the &amp;quot;Your&amp;quot; on the cover being very small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
