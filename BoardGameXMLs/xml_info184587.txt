			<description>A-B-C Gallery is a spin-and-move game designed to teach young children the alphabet.  It is included in the Get Ready for Kindergarten! book and game set by Sharon Hinchey.  Each player takes a playing piece and 13 of the 26 letter tiles, with the letter on one side and a picture of something starting with the letter on the other side.  The game board is laid out as a grid of square spaces, each with a letter and a picture.  Players start on the first letter of their first name.  Each player spins the spinner in turn and moves the number (1, 2 or 3) spaces spun.  If they land on a space that matches one of their tiles, they choose the tile, flip it over to make sure the picture matches, then place it on the square.  A player who matches on his or her first spin may then spin again, and continue to do so until a match is not made.  Squares marked &amp;quot;Trade a Piece&amp;quot; allow the player to choose one of the opponent's pieces and the opponent to chose one of his or her pieces.  The first player to match all his or her tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may also be played with lower-case letter tiles, adding the challenge of matching the lower-case and upper-case letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
