							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cretaceous Zoo</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the roles of Karma Inc employees thrown into the midst of an eco-terrorist plot to bring down The Cretaceous Zoo, the world&amp;rsquo;s only dinosaur preserve and resort, and &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; the dinosaurs from human intervention, even if that means destroying the entire island these creatures call home in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience this sandbox adventure, the first in the Barebones Line in which Gamemasters and Players alike are encouraged to fill-in the background and details of the shadowy Karma Inc&amp;rsquo;s resort, in which Creepy Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Greg Schulze and Stone Lovecharm take on the classic &amp;ldquo;trapped on an island&amp;rdquo; RPG trope in true StoryCube fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout ten to twelve Scenes, many optional and easily expandable, the nature of the People for the Liberation of Prehistoric Creatures&amp;rsquo; (PLPC) plot to overthrow the Zoo and the instability of the Zoo itself will be revealed to a group of underprepared employees as they overcome militant eco-terrorists, dangerous dinosaurs, and even the potential destruction of the entire island, before ultimately earning a promotion to Karma Inc&amp;rsquo;s Special Security Department in recognition of their obvious survival skills and willingness to act when necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure includes several exciting new rules including two types of special Hybrid Conflict/Non-Conflict Scenes, one that emphasizes Conflict and the other that emphasizes Non-Conflict, Scene-specific scenarios for dealing with total-party-kills (TPKs), and new Adventure-spanning rule modifications including how to deal with Character death and the mid-adventure introduction of replacement Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
