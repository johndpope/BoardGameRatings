							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">T-Bird</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were test driving your new Foourd T-Bird hovercar and everything was fine, until you took a wrong turn and found yourself face to face with an armada of aliens, who don't take kindly to your presence. Now you must face wave after wave of attackers in order to return home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T-Bird is a shoot'em up in the vein of Space Harrier: the player must defeat enemy waves. Each defeated group of enemy leave behind a power-up, which gives access to better weapons. Each level ends with a boss fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
