			<description>From publisher's homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Empire's most obvious threat is the Maemeck Matriarchy, described here in detail, including the despised Quellers. Though the nation's security depends on them, these anti-mages are held in low regard within their homeland as without. In contrast, the notorious Crimson Guard are showered with rewards, and all that's asked in exchange is their faces, their lives, and their absolute loyalty. Other bagatelles, such as maps that conform to 'traditional' physics and an insight into Upunzi math, are also to be found in Supplement 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
