			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t remember how long you have been running. A large pack of wolves has been chasing you through wooded hills since the early afternoon. You were ambushed by a group of thugs just before dawn. You tried to put up a good fight, but a club to the back of your head knocked you unconscious before the battle even began. They took your weapons, armor, and equipment, and left you for dead. You awoke to the sound of howling wolves. Suddenly, on the hilltop just ahead, you can make out the silhouette of a small building illuminated by the moonlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability: A warrior of 1st to 2nd level with 10 to 20 adds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
