			<description>Mass Destruction is a 1997 third-person action game developed by NMS Software Ltd. and published by ASC Games and BMG Interactive Entertainment. Released for MS-DOS, the Sega Saturn, and the PlayStation, the game puts players in control of a tank, and tasks them with destroying enemy forces. While some reviewers described the game as &amp;quot;simplistic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;mindless&amp;quot;, others found its stripped-down action enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mass Destruction (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass Destruction is a mission-based tank shooting game. Jump into one of three tanks each with its own strengths and weaknesses and take on 24 different missions, each with its own set of objectives. You must complete all the primary and secondary objectives and make your way to the extraction area for a mission to end successfully. During the course of the game, you can pick up tons of different weapons and destroy anything in your path. You'll encounter a seemingly endless array of tanks, helicopters, infantry, flamethrowers, buildings, bunkers, and gun turrets. Gamers can also expect big bosses and frantic, arcade-based shooting fun. Nearly every object on the screen can be blown up, so shooter fans will be in destruction heaven.Source: Re-release publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of cover (European DOS/Windows CD-ROM release)&lt;br/&gt;Mass Destruction is the perfect excuse for mindless demolition and mayhem!!! Use you battletank's considerable array of high-impact weapons to surgically pick out strategic targets... and then annihilate everything that moves and reduce the horizon to a blazing heap of ruins! 25 missions await your assault in this high-scoring, hightly explosive clash of powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
