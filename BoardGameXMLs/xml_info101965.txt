							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Two-Story Warehouse</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness hangs heavy over the city, dulling the neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s bleak signs of decay. It has been two days since that first, frantic phone call, and all the clues lead to the warehouse on Bleaker Street. &amp;quot;Innout Import/Export,&amp;quot; Jacob reads softly to himself as he draws his Berretta. After taking a deep breath, he kicks the front door and is rewarded with a splintering crash. Stepping into the darkness, he announces, &amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;m delivering Hell!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go from here? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments and 12 to Midnight offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5&amp;times;11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24&amp;times;36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-Story Warehouse&lt;br/&gt;Innout Import/Export, Inc. This is a small warehouse easily applicable for any type of business needing a large storage area, such as a moving company or a distribution center. Its two levels contain a ground floor with ample storage space and a second level with offices overlooking the ground floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ground Level. This 3700+ square foot ground floor serves as the main storage area and has three loading docks at the front of the building. Two staircases provide access to the building&amp;rsquo;s top floor.&lt;br/&gt;     Second Floor. This floor holds the building&amp;rsquo;s administrative offices. Although there are two executive offices on this floor, the smaller room could serve as an office for the manager&amp;rsquo;s secretary. This floor also includes a conference room, break room, and file room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps in this title can also be found in Modern Floorplans Volume 1: Office Spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
