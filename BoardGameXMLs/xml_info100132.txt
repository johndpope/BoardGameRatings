			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As WWII swept across Europe, the Nazis unveiled and even more terrifying arm of their war machine: the &amp;quot;Kampfgruppe Eugenik&amp;quot;, the Eugenics Brigade. These super-soldiers were unopposed for years, while the Allies tried desperately to come up with a super-soldier program of their own to combat them. Nationwide searches were undertaken for mutants (long known to exist) but only two: Old Glory and Captain Amazing were discovered. These two heroes would have to carry the burden alone for years, serving mostly in Britain at the side of Winston Churchill, before America and Britain were able to field more heroes and carry the fight to Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modern d20 supplement for Blood and Vigilance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6 Super Villains: Charismatic, Feurstrahl, Krieghund, Kugelsicher, Traumfrau, and Uberkrieger.&lt;br/&gt;     The Stagg Field Heroes WWII Supers Campaign Set-up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
