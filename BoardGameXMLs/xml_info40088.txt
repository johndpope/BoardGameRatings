			<description>WW1 had barely ended when the Allies began to interfere with the Russian Civil War in 1918. France, eager to continue flexing its military muscle, sent troops to colonize and control the Ukraine region while disarming the German troops there. The local population welcomed them to some degree thinking the French and Greek troops were sent to liberate them from the Red menace. Armed with tanks, aircraft and armor cars, the French sent the Greeks out to remote areas to secure it. However, the Red followers had secured vast amounts of weapons from the Germans, much to the dislike of the French, and were more than eager to fight. By March 1919, the Ukraine was on fire. The French and Greek troops were greatly disliked by all Russians after their true intentions had been revealed to the general public. This further emboldened the Red forces who were outnumbering the Allies. In the coming weeks, numerous battles were fought until the last bastion at Odessa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game using the 'Russian Civil War Series' system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;One 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; map sheet depicting the terrain the battle was fought over.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One sheet of 260 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;One Players&amp;rsquo; Aid Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;The series core rulebook that include the game rules used.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;A rulebook specific to The Ukraine on Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
