			<description>&amp;quot;WHEN CASPER LIGHTS UP, YOU WIN A CHIP&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of chance based on the popular, lovable Casper character.  Players compete to win chips by making Casper light up.  All parts glow in the dark.  Requires one AA-type battery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a 'spooky stone' (a piece of molded plastic with four symmetrically positioned holes); Casper and the chips are placed in the center of the playing area.  A turn simply comprises placing Casper on any other player's spooky stone.  If he lights up, the player wins a chip.  The player may elect to stop and keep the chip won, or risk it and try Casper on a different player's spooky stone.  This may be repeated a third and final time, but if Casper fails to light up at any stage the player's turn is over and all chips won that turn are returned to the center pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to win four chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
