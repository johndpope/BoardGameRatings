			<description>Philip is the best acrobat from far and wide. He is very ﬂexible in order to be able to perform the most unbelievable movements. Little monkey Bo, his friend, is simply amazed at his feats. Are you as ﬂexible as Philip?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn two mobility cards are turned face up. Each mobility card shows Philip with a marked body part. They show which acrobatics you should perform. Example: When Philip's shoulder and knee are marked on the two face up cards, all players are supposed to touch their shoulder with their knee (the players can freely pick between left or right). If none of the players can correctly execute the acrobatics, monkey Bo will move closer to the banana. The players win the game ends when all mobility cards are used before Bo reaches the banana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
