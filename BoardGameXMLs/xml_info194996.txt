			<description>Mishmash Galaxy is a light strategy game of long-term planning, memorization and card management in which you combine made-believe substances to complete and construct the staples of SF technologies! Make clich&amp;eacute;s and tropes come to life as you struggle to create FTL drives, time machines, portals and laser weaponry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the player with the most victory points! Players can earn victory points mostly by completing technologies; whenever a technology is completed, all contributors get the minor score of that technology, and if there is a major contributor, that player earns the major score. On a turn, a player can execute two actions, none of which are obligatory. The actions are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play a Research Card: A player can put one of their Substance Card face down in front of them. At the beginning of their next turn, this card is revealed and its research ability is activated. Then the card should be discarded. You can never have more than one active Research Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Contribute to a Technology: Each player can contribute a card from their hand to two different Technologies. Any card can be contributed (Ingredient or Substance) as long as the resource of the card are correct with the resources needed in that Technology stage. Each Technology is being filled in order of their blueprint, from left to right. You play the cards face down and place your ownership token on the card. Resolving the Technology works as below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All cards on the Technology are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;     Cards are then activated from right to left. Owner of the card is the one who resolves the card Technology ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all Technologies prepared for the game are completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
