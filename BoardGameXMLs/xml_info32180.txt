			<description>A greyhound racing and betting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 46 cards: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6 cards showing traps&lt;br/&gt;     8x greyhound No.1&lt;br/&gt;     8x No.2&lt;br/&gt;     7x No.3&lt;br/&gt;     6x No.4&lt;br/&gt;     5x No.5&lt;br/&gt;     5x No.6&lt;br/&gt;     1x disqualified&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game itself is fairly simple: The traps are laid out one above the other, bets are placed on them.&lt;br/&gt;The stack is shuffled well, and one card after another is turned up slowly and laid out along its trap card. Winner is the dog which has 5 turned up cards along its trap.&lt;br/&gt;As there are different number of cards for each dog the odds are fixed accordingly, so that you can make the most money with dogs no.5 and 6.&lt;br/&gt;If the &amp;quot;Disqualified&amp;quot; card turns up it is laid above the trap cards: If a dog has 5 cards counting for it this one is disqualified; winner is the next in line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
