			<description>&amp;quot;Juiced is a video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and mobile phone. The game was delayed for release in 2004 because of its original publisher Acclaim going bankrupt. The game was then picked up by THQ, and further delayed as changes were made to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In early 2006, UK software publisher Focus Multimedia re-released the PC version of Juiced at a new budget price point as part of its &amp;quot;Essential&amp;quot; games range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers many different modes including a career mode and arcade mode that present the player with challenges which gradually gets harder. A player can customize the car to suit their style and unlock new ones (by unlocking in arcade mode). A special feature added was the use of nitrous as expected since it is similar to other racing games which have the feature. This can be particularly useful for when the player is behind an opponent or is behind time, but the AI can also use the nitrous oxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system itself is highly inspired by Need for Speed: Underground, but the racing styles are realistic, similar to PlayStation's Gran Turismo. Damage is also distinctively visible in Juiced, and must be repaired before the player can tune up the car.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Juiced_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
