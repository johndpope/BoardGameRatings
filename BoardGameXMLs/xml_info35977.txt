							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arab Israeli Wars</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Solo Card Game System simulating the Arab Israeli Wars 1948+. Currently only cards set for the Israeli War of Independence is available.  The player takes the role of the Israelis. Arab deployments are automatic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on three Fronts: the Northern Frontier (Galilee), Central Frontier (Jerusalem), and Southern front (Negev). Each Front is represented by six Territory Tokens, all of which are under the control of the Israelis (the solo player) at the start of the game. If the Arabs are able to acquire control all six tokens on any one Front, you suffer a Complete Loss. If you win all battles on all three Fronts for two turns in a row, you achieve a Decisive Victory. If the Arabs run out of unit cards, you achieve an Attrition Victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unit cards are intended to represent Arab and Israeli forces involved in the 1948 hostilities. Units are drawn and played to the Fronts - Arab units to designated Fronts and Israeli cards as desired by the player. Each turn one card is drawn from the Event deck. The Event card confers benefits to one side or the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
