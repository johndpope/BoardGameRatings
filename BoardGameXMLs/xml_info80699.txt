							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phantasie</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Isle of Gelnor, Phantasie allowed a group of six characters to adventure the countryside and try to defeat the evil Black Knights and their sorcerer leader, Nikademus. Players could choose to be one of six character classes (Thief, Fighter, Ranger, Monk, Priest and Wizard) and could also choose between the races of Human, Dwarf, Halfling, Elf or Gnome. By selecting &amp;quot;Random&amp;quot; one could also choose from ogre, troll, pixie, gnoll, orc, lizard man, minotaur, and other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was notable for taking advantage of a broad mix of styles for the game: a town window which allowed purchasing in various shops, a top-down style dungeon crawl view, a top-down world map, and a separate combat window. Each character class had unique fighting styles and options and all characters could choose their strategy for a particular round in the turn-based combat segments. After a combat, experience was awarded, but the players would have to return to town to purchase their levels if they qualified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Phantasie&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
