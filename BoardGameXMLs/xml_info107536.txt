							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Order &amp; Chaos Online</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3D MMORPG for iOS and Android devices, best described as World of Warcraft lite. Order and Chaos features a standard class and quest based system frequently found in standard MMOs. Players get to pick their race, class and character appearance. As with most MMOs, stats are set by class and equipment. However, players are able to customize their class skills via allotting points in their class' skill tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is subscription based though players receive 3 months of free play. Order and Chaos also has an in-game cash item shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
