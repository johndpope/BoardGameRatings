							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lair of the Peluda</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Peluda helped the gods spread life throughout the world. But all that changed and the Peluda became a monster producer instead. Now, the Third Age is dawning and what the world needs now are heroes to see it through the next big dust up. The Peluda is helping, making monsters  to inspire men to be heroes. You? You want to be a hero? The Peluda&amp;rsquo;s got some nifty treasure to reward those who make the cut. Tests are going on right now, so find Reginald, if you want to try your luck. He&amp;rsquo;s a wolf in appearance, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to seek him out. The secret? Just get a conversation with a wolf going. From there on it will all be part of the test, so polish your boots and mind you&amp;rsquo;re at your spiffiest. Take it away, hero. You&amp;rsquo;re the fulcrum - the future is teetering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
