			<description>In the super-fast competitive card game Bitcoin Empire, you are a plucky, pioneering entrepreneur trying to collect and keep as many bitcoins as possible in storage. Bitcoins are represented by face down cards. The game ends when the last card is drawn from the deck and whoever has the most face down cards at that point in storage is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player gets a character card. Characters have ranks on three different skills: law, coding and marketing. You also have a bitcoin storage rating which determines how many face down cards can be stored underneath the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main deck of cards is shuffled and each player is dealt two cards. There are several different types. Exchanges can be played down as places to store face down cards based on the bitcoin rating. Hack, Lawsuit and Smear Campaign are attack cards that can be played against an opponents Exchange or character is your ranks in law, coding and marketing respectively are greater than the targets. If successful all the cards in that storage are discarded without looking at them and the Exchange card is taken to the hand of the attacking player. Alternatively these attack cards can be played underneath the character as extra ranks of the applicable icon. Internet Meltdown cards can also be played on the characters to increase their ranks but the Satoshi card will wipe them all away if played. Also, Head Hunter cards can steal an opponents skill cards. Bribe cards can be played to cancel any attack or the Head Hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So keep your wits about you as you take on the fledgling crypto-market and build your empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
