			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I am happiest when using my powers to help others!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When little Carol Vance laughed in the face of the fearsome and destructive Lord of Fire, he made her one of his blessed chosen ones and gave her a range of powers that let her control flames. Now, an adult, she fights crime and injustice as Wildfire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildfire debuted in 1941, making her one of the fist superheroines to see print--beating even the mighty Wonder Woman to print. The character did not catch fire the way her creators had hoped, and after 12 episodes in Smash Comics, she faded into comics history. Her co-creator, Jim Mooney, went onto be one of the artists who helped shape Supergirl into the television powerhouse she is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildfire from NUELOW Games collects five Wildfire stories, presenting them with the colors from their original publications intact. The book is augmented with roleplaying game rules for the OGL d20 System (compatible with Pathfinder, many other games, and the NUELOW superpower material round in many of our releases), so you can create your own high-flying, blazing superheroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
