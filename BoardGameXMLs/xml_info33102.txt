			<description>Object: collect the most matching pairs of cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 1 playing board, 48 cards, 1 instruction booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: (from game box) A card game that's based on the Life and Legend of Lord Greystoke, Tarzan of the Apes. It's a matching game! You and your opponents try to collect the most matching pairs of cards by choosing cards from the board or from players' hands. Can you remember where Tantor the elephant is hiding on the board? Or Manu the monkey? Whose hand is Bara the antelope in? Find two of these-or any other colorful characters in the game-and you have a match! The player with the most pairs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy Hints:&lt;br/&gt;try not to show the players the cards in your hand or on your side of the board. you know what these cards are, but other players may not. Unless another player chooses one of your cards, don't show them, choose one of their cards instead. &lt;br/&gt;Mix up the cards in your hand as often as you'd like, but especially when other players have seen your cards. Don't make it easy for them to make a match with your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
