			<description>From the Box: A game of Romance and the Senses. Romantic Sensations is a card game that combines and reinforces our senses of touch, taste, scent, sound, and sight to create a wonderful romantic experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, players read the list of prizes--romantic, sensuous activities to be enjoyed together. The cards are shuffled and dealt. Players then take turns picking a card from the deck, reading it aloud, and responding. Some cards ask for verbal responses, positive and supportive. Others suggest gentle touching, some playful, some subtle and ambiguous. When like cards are matched, they are placed down. The first player to match the required number of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: the game box includes two small bottles of lotion (&amp;quot;sensuous massage lotion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bath gel&amp;quot;) in addition to the question card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
