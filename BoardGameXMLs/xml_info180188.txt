			<description>Central City: Heroes is a cooperative board game for 1-4 players. Each player takes on the role of a unique Superhero with their own unique powers. Players work together to battle minions, complete missions, recruit other heroes, and unlock their upgrade cards. This will all lead up to the final showdown with the Superhero's Nemesis. The Players must complete five missions and defeat the Nemesis in order to win the game. Heroes will accomplish these things by moving around and exploring Central City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of 16 interchangeable location hex tiles that make up Central City. Every time you play the city itself will change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will begin by creating their characters. To do so they will get a Superhero Player Board, a Super Power Card and a Secret Identity Card. Combining the Hero Board with the Super Power Card will create the Player's Hero Persona. With 6 Player Characters and 12 Super Power Cards, there are 72 different Hero Personas in the Central City: Heroes Core Set. The Players will also receive their own Secret Identity Card which the game will be trying to force players to reveal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to become a guardian of Central City?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
