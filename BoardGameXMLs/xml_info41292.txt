			<description>Mythology is a subject of never-ending fascination! Myths of creation, of floods, of heroes - these and many others crop up in the myths of numerous cultures throughout the world. Mythology has inspired painters, sculptors, writers and other artists over the centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, world mythology is encompassed, as is reasonably possible, within Mythomachy, the top educational, brain development and family-friendly entertaining brand designed to teach children about mythology as well as to help them discover new ways to foster their intelligence. Mythomachy intends to be represented across all major categories of youth products with focus on toys, publishing and other consumer product categories, including apparel, accessories, back-to-school and more as this exciting property has enormous branding and licensing potential for the boy and girl audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot of excitement behind Mythomachy Trading Card Game distributed first across retail venues nationwide in Greece. Unlike most trading card games, which are based on fantasy, Mythomachy is solidly anchored in the global universe of authentic myths and legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythomachy TCG first edition includes a 350-card set available in 6-card booster packs, providing a tremendous base of consumer-tested artwork and game play, taking into account the age-sensitive profile of its target, kids Ages 7 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an already male-saturated market, Mythomachy is enjoyed as much by female fans as male because of its directly educational quality profile and learning benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
