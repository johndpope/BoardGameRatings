							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblins Ride Out!</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblins are the unsung heroes of the fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well. Not heroes, exactly. They&amp;rsquo;re more the unsung villains of the fantasy&lt;br/&gt;world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblins are everywhere and fill a vital niche in fantasy stories, even if they&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br/&gt;in disguise as imps, kobolds, minions, or mooks. They&amp;rsquo;re weak and snivelling&lt;br/&gt;cannon fodder that only exist to give the heroes something to kill between boss&lt;br/&gt;fights, designed to die quickly and messily to make the heroes look good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re snivelling, cowardly, filthy little monsters with sharp teeth, terrible&lt;br/&gt;habits, and few redeeming qualities. And this is their book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, we&amp;rsquo;ll give you a set of rules for playing goblins in Fate Core and a fun,&lt;br/&gt;twisted little story where a pack of vicious goblins finally get to stick it to a party&lt;br/&gt;of do-gooding adventurers. There are rules for character creation, goblin skills,&lt;br/&gt;and goblin stunts, but if you&amp;rsquo;re short on time this book also comes with a full set&lt;br/&gt;of six pre-made goblin characters you can pick up and play straight away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With half an hour to prepare and the ready-to-use characters, you&amp;rsquo;ll have&lt;br/&gt;everything you need to run a whole evening of play for you and your friends&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;but you&amp;rsquo;ll need to already be familiar with the main rules of Fate Core to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
