			<description>Probably made during World War II since the cardboard is very flimsy, prints aren't centered and some cards have both straight angled and rounded corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This must be a Belgian version with text in both Flemish and&lt;br/&gt;French languages. The spelling is quite old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to collect and play cards to drop a certain amount of bombs on the enemy. As an opponent cards can be played to harass and slow down the other player (pilot dead, bad weather,...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
