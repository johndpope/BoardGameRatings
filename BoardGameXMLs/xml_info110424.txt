			<description>Who Let The Dogs Out (TM) is a new board game for all the family. The objective is to round up your four escaped dogs and get them back in your house with a bone for each. Remember - my doggie won't stay in if he don't have no bone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The square game board is divided diagonally into four backyards, with a small house located in the middle of each edge of the board. The game commences with one of each players dogs placed on a marked starting position in each players backyard. Players then use game cards to move one or more dogs directly or to pick up sausages and/or bones to move their own dogs strategically towards, and eventually into, their own home. The first player to get all of their dogs into their house with a bone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
