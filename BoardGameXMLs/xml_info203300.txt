							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extraordinary Extras: Sacred Service</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lone robed figure walks barefoot across jagged rocks, smiling at each new cut that opens on her feet. A circle of the devout wait hours for a divine image to appear in the bowl of sour milk and blood of the bovine. A small child is led away from their family to join a religious order based on signs observed in the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a sixth generation knight blessed with holy fire to a simple farmer begging for vengeance from uncaring gods, Sacred Service can add background and drama to your religious institutions. Use this document during play, while generating characters, or world building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following charts and information are intended to add life and depth to a flat or lackluster religion in you fantasy world. They can apply to warlocks, clerics, druids, paladins and any others who worship a deity. These features can be randomly generated or they can be used to provide some sparks of inspiration for players and DMs alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This material is compatible with 5th Edition D&amp;amp;D, but can be used with nearly any fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
