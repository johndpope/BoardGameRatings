			<description>A trump and guessing game about birds, the cards show a number range, the name of the race, the size and wing span of the bird, its life span in the wild and the hatching time. The cards are dealt, in his turn a player rolls the die and depending on the roll he chooses a very big or a very small number from the information on his cards, the next player answers with his biggest or smallest number in the same category. The player with the highest or lowest number respectively wins both cards. If one player has run out of cards, the player with the most cards wins. Packed in a belt bag, with a bird whistle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
