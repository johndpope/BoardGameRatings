							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Traveller Referee&#039;s Screen</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's the maximum to-hit number when calling in orbital artillery fire?&lt;br/&gt;While you're at it, what's the initiative of a Veteran NPC?&lt;br/&gt;And what's the trotting movement rate of a K'kree?&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah, and how many power level points do you need for a staqe 5 psionic success?*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A referee has to process a lot of information really fast in order to stay ahead of a group of players bent on conquering the universe. How fast is it? How far is that: How difficult is the other thing? And now that so many players have the Traveller Players' Forms, enabling them to keep even more hare-br--I mean devious schemes at their fingertips, a referee could get in over his head real fast...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, we've modified the air raft so it looks like a giant grasshopper, and my character is hanging upside down from a rope ladder beneath it with his laser rifle at the ready, he's wearing his IR goggles, and he has a bag full of concussion grenades. What he's going to do is...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Face it, it's tough to stay ahead of your player's, but we're here to help. The TNE Referee's Screen is six colorful panels including four packed with the data and tables you need, and all of the Traveller fire Charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Three of these panels are for the referee, while one faces the players and shows the most common combat tasks, with difficulty levels, damage, and fatigue penalties.&lt;br/&gt;    Also for the referee, a 16 page booklet collecting the most important tables from Traveller: The New Era into a handy, easy-to-use resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just think - if you can keep the important travel, combat, and task information before your eyes at all times, that's that much more time you have to keep your adventures fresh, challenging, and, well, player-proof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All right, we've got our rifles disguised as fumigators, and we're all in mouse suits. We knock on the office door and tell him we're fromt he extermination company, and then start yelling, &amp;quot;Mouse! Mouse! Mouse!&amp;quot; to confuse him. While he's on the phone trying to figure it out, we're into his file cabinets...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*The answers , by the way are:16, 4, 30, 37, people in Dispora aren't afraid of grasshoppers, and sorry, they don't sell mouse suits on this planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
