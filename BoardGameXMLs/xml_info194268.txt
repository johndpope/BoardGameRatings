							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slavers of Mareshdale</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farmers have been being disappearing from around Mareshdale, leaving behind obvious signs of a struggle. The Sheriff was investigating... but last night, he was taken! With the Baronet away at the wars, Lady Alyce has proclaimed a reward for any adventurers who can solve the mystery! Can your bold band do it... or will they too disappear?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An introductory adventure for 4-6 first level characters, The Slavers of Mareshdale provides a village and surrounding wilderness with many opportunities for adventure. In addition to the primary storyline, there are seeds for many other scenarios, and an area GMs can continue to use as a base for low-level player characters. Future modules from Ebon Gryphon Games will expand on the setting and plotline introduced here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
