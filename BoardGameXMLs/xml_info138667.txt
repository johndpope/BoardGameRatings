			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broadside Express is a  Real Time Strategy and a Shoot Em up Game that was created by Wolfire Games as part of the Humble Bundle Mojam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as a steam train in the desert trying to collect carriages and blow up enemy trains and anything else that gets in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created in 60 hours over the course of the weekend from the 17th to 19th February 2012 as part of the Mojam Humble Bundle. The creation of the game was live-streamed over the internet using twitch.tv&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time the 60 hours was up the game was playable, but unfinished and still buggy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
