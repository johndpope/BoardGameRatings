			<description>As in the fairy tale the animals must jump on each others&amp;rsquo; backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some donkey cards are on the table. Each player receives six cards, which he keeps hidden in his hand. The remaining cards form the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player play a card on the table. &lt;br/&gt;He may play dog sitting on donkey, cat sitting on dog and rooster sitting on cat. Additionally player may play card upon another card with same color&lt;br/&gt;If the player has no matching card, he draws one from the draw pile and his turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware! The rooster will mess up the entire game. If the player has placed a rooster, then he draws a card from the deck and looks out one of the two animals shown. Then the card is placed to the left player and asked if he has the animal in the selected color in his the hand. If no, he takes it to his hand. If Yes the both cards move to next player unitl someone has taken all this cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who discards the last card must make the sound of one of the animals depicted on the last card. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first who plays his last card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
