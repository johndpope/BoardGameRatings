							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Mages: Defenders of Elderwood</name>
									
			<description>In the humble forest village of Elderwood, trouble is stirring.  The Great Tree that has been a beacon of light and hope for the villagers, may now be the cause of the village&amp;rsquo;s demise.  Evil forces are at work, and their goal seems to be the destruction of the tree.  A horde of dangerous beasts and magical creatures have continuously been assailing the village.  Who or what is controlling them has yet to be discovered.  The villagers&amp;rsquo; resilience has so far kept the monsters at bay, but the attacks grow more difficult with each wave.  Yet while all may seem lost, fate has stepped in to give the villagers one last hope.  A mysterious stranger by the name of Balthazar has appeared from outside and has agreed to help the village.  He has identified four local youths who have started showing signs of talent to control the elements.  If they can learn to develop and harness this power in time, Elderwood can be saved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mythic Mages: Defenders of Elderwood, players take on the role of apprentice mages who must learn the ways of magic and use these new skills to save the village from certain destruction.  Mythic Mages is a deck-building game with a truly cooperative slant.  Players are not only building their own decks carefully, but must also be aware of what the other players are building in theirs.  To best complement each other, players will occasionally have the ability to pass or swap cards to optimize their team performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
