			<description>CryptidsTV, a new type of party game, challenges players to create new television shows, with them taking part in all aspects of a show's production meetings &amp;ndash; drawing, talking and being creative &amp;ndash; with the aim of getting their show on prime time. Part of the challenge comes from being presented with two separate concepts drawn from separate card decks &amp;ndash; for example, a liquid creature and a fad that appeals to kids &amp;ndash; and figuring out how to merge these concepts creatively into a single creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes one role card and reveals it to indicate his role for the game. The assistant director distributes pens and creation sheets to players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, the director randomly selects one Cryptids card, such as &amp;quot;vehicle creature&amp;quot;, then everybody must draw a creature representing this category within one minute. The assistant director redistributes the drawings among players (with players not being allowed to look at them), then the director randomly selects one Show card, such as &amp;quot;The creature is able to communicate and converse with humans! What is the secret behind it?&amp;quot; Each player then makes his presentation using the caption and drawing in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then vote on the winning presentation by simultaneously pointing to the show they thought best, with the director breaking ties. The winner is selected to air on prime time, with the player who drew the cryptid receiving the prime time tile, and its reporter receiving the prime time host tile. Everyone gives them a round of applause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play four rounds total with 3-6 players, and only three rounds with seven or more players. End the game by kibitzing over the suggestions that were botched and didn't merit air time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be combined with the material in the sequel CryptidsTV 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
