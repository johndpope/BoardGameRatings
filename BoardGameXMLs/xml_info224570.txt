							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chief Runs This Joint</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is what his name says he is. The chief that runs this joint! The only way you get to disagree with that is with the truth justice and sharpened steel that every hero hold dear. Though you will have to wade through endless hordes or angry turkeys to do so . . . if you don&amp;rsquo;t fall victim to the insanity of the ceaseless sound of &amp;ldquo;gobble, gobble, you may just fall prey to all those angry talons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this spotlight is Chief Runs This Joint (yes that&amp;rsquo;s his real name) &amp;amp; his turkey horde. I know I know, you think turkeys and you flashback to a time of gravy and sweet potatoes .  . . not a time of fear and dread. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;re one and the same, but that&amp;rsquo;s beside the point. The point is, you think that turkeys are an odd and weak creature to throw against you burgeoning heroes and you would normally be right. However, the horde and their Chief are built to work together, making the whole, much stronger than its individual parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chief and his turkeys are intended to be used against heroes&amp;rsquo; level 1-8, depending on how slow the Buildup to fighting the Chief is. The Jive turkeys are great fun when used in large groups &amp;amp; the Terror Turkey is just mean all by its lonesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
