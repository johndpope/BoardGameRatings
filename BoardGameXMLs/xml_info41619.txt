			<description>There are 52 cards, each with a letter and a value between 1 and 10, plus two wild cards with value 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal 9 cards per player, and turn up the top of the stock to start the discard pile.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from either pile, lays down any words from his hand and/or lays off cards on existing words to make new words, and discards 1 card.  The game ends when a player depletes their hand with their discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player scores the total of all cards in front of him or her, adds bonuses (10 points for going out, 5 for a 6+ letter word, 5 for laying off on another player's word), and subtracts the value of all cards left in hand.  Highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
