			<description>Was ist Was: Das gro&amp;szlig;e Quiz is a combination board game/app facilitator, with players trying to answer questions on topics ranging from nature, wildlife and art to geography, history and culture. On a turn, the active player rolls a die and moves on the game board to see which topic she'll be quizzed on. Some locations show a bonus space, in which all players compete in one of five different app games, with the winner being the one who first:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Recognizes the correct animal.&lt;br/&gt;    Identifies the right sound.&lt;br/&gt;    Determines which animal is heavier, which building is taller, or which vehicle is faster.&lt;br/&gt;    Knows where to find a particular country.&lt;br/&gt;    Excavates a dinosaur first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(If you're playing without the app, the active player chooses one of the topics for the bonus question presented to all players.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
