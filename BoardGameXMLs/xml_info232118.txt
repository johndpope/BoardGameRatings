			<description>Bring the Trailer Park home...to your kitchen table. This print and play tabletop war-game pits two or more players against each other in an attempt to raise the most cash before time runs out. &lt;br/&gt;Players each have a set of goals (scams) they are trying to accomplish, while trying to prevent the opposing team(s) from doing the same. Alternatively, players can choose to simply start a trailer park brawl, and try to be the only team with characters left at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Each character has unique abilities to choose from, and any character can work with any other - if you so choose. So make your team of characters, and get ready to rule the trailer park. &lt;br/&gt;Printable characters are provided as part of the game, but players are encouraged to use the miniatures from the Trailer Park Boys board game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
