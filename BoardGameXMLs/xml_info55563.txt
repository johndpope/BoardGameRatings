			<description>Book 2 of the core rules: Truely [sic] Endless Power Possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy to learn (with a minimum of jargon) and doesn't require any special dice (just regular 6 sided dice, like everyone already has).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy to play without a lot of math or tables. Just roll a number of dice equal to the stat you're using. A 5 or better is a success and an 11 or better is a critical success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a detailed tactical R.P.G. Instead it captures the feel of the comics, like no other game since Villains &amp;amp; Vigilantes. You might not get bonuses for your brilliant strategies but you don't have to be a master of strategy to play. Anyone can play as a great martial artist without getting killed. It's been my experience that detailed tactical games are not only slow and complicated but often end up with every fight becoming a contest between the player and G.M. Which is a bad situation. The player and G.M. Are supposed to have fun together not be against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses classes, to simplify character creation and give characters clear conceptions. But it uses a point system for selecting powers, so you can have an infinite variety of characters. And if you aren't sure just what you want it even includes a random character generation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
