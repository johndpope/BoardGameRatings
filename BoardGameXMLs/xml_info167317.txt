			<description>Esbirros Bizarros (Bizarre Minions) is a party game for up to 25 players, which can be played everywhere with anoyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with only one deck of 25 cards, those are divided in &amp;quot;Power Morfys&amp;quot; green cards, &amp;quot;Skulls&amp;quot; grey cards, and special cards such as &amp;quot;Intergalacticos&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Chuchos Infernales&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Croten One&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;El Cornado&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;El Crack&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card will add or substract points and have an special action that the player must do. Some times this actions are imposible like &amp;quot;wash your brain in oil&amp;quot;, but should do something to satisfy Goo Zman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes 2 cards (or 1 if there are more that 13 players), this cards must not be shown to other players. Only the player that gets the card named Goo Zman, reveals it so all players can see it.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this player is to find as many Power Morfys can, and adquire the highest points posible, avoiding &amp;quot;Skulls&amp;quot; and negative cards. To do so, he must pick one player at a time to show one of his cards (the picked player choose one of his cards). Gooz Man will loose if he gets -25 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must decide if they want to help Goo Zman, or not. Since &lt;br/&gt;they can persuade him to being pick with lies or helping him giving clues to who he should pick, but never reveal their cards until they are picked by Goo Zman. If the player choose to show a negative card, this player will win if Gooz Man loose. If the player choose a positive card, the player will win if Goo Zman wins. When a player already had a picked card and must show his other card, the new card will be his win chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an special card named &amp;quot;Diabolo&amp;quot;, this player will only win if he is not picked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a very fun and crazy game that can last from 1 minute to 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
