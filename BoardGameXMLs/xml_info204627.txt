			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Solitaire role-playing game. You play it by yourself. The actual play procedures don&amp;rsquo;t amount to much more than sitting back and daydreaming, without being bothered. The stricter rules are more about framing devices and how they get modified across several phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, playing this will be a project for you, not a dalliance. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hand you stuff to imagine, but requires some solid creativity, including an initial writing assignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earliest playtesting should be &amp;ldquo;for love,&amp;rdquo; meaning, we aren&amp;rsquo;t here to break the game. The plan is to discover whether the vision of the game and basics of play are actually as fun as we hope. I especially ask that this text be treated only as a design and playtesting draft, and not as a draft of the text to be published. Therefore it needs no writing critique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
