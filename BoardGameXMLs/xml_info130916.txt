			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm Warrior was a game originally released by Elite on it's budget Encore label in 1989 (though the copyright statement in-game states 1988).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The user plays a Prince charged with entering an evil Witch Queen's castle to destroy her and save the land. The player is armed only with a sword and the game is played against a backdrop of a forest, then the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a left-to-right scrolling hack'n'slash and as the player progresses he meets various enemies which need to be defeated, or obstacles to be avoided (such as rocks thrown by a tree, for some reason!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's life gauge is indicated in the C64 version by an animated figure of Death at the bottom of the screen who moves from right to left as the health depletes. In the Amstrad version, the player's health is indicated by a sword which gradually disintegrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Richard Joseph: Music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
