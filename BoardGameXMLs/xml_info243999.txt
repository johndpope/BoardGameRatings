			<description>The sheep are restless&amp;hellip; they want to go on an adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SheepDice: The Adventure is a dice rolling game where the sheep are the dice. The flock of 21 sheep travel from one tile to the next until they make it back home&amp;hellip; or not! Be a shepherd and help guide the sheep along, or be a wolf and catch them. The team with the most sheep wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shepherd picks a sheep to roll, and based on the result, all matching sheep will move forward. The wolf rolls a group of sheep and catches one, but only if the wolf guesses a sheep type that ends up being alone. The tiles are double-sided and can be rearranged so you can have a different adventure every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be played in teams, cooperatively, or solo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
