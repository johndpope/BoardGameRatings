			<description>From the back of the game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the galaxy hide the starbases of unfriendly G T planet.  Command your THUNDERHAWK to seek out the devilish peace-breakers, this is going to be a hard mission of firm courage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your efforts to find out the targets, waves of the starfighters would come out to hit you.  Your Radar Chart would help to point out the position of the starbases and the color shower reveals the attacking speed of the starfighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look out!  Be keen with both of your hands and brain.  Never take your eyes away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You drive a spaceship to explore and investigate the vast mysterious space.  Unfortunately, you meet a lot of unknown space creatures which will attack your spaceship by themselves.  Just when they appear, you should destroy them quickly by launching missiles during the limited time, or you will be destroyed by them.  You have 6 reserves to defend and attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
