							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Once Upon A Time In Arabia</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put yourself at the heart of the story&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your life is in danger from a powerful enemy. Jafar, advisor to the Caliph, is plotting a coup that will put him on the throne of Baghdad. You are the only one who knows his secret. Only you can warn the Caliph. But who will listen to a penniless adventurer? Even to venture out of hiding would be to risk death from the assassins who are scouring the city night and day to find you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one hope. Fame and fortune would give you the means to expose Jafar&amp;rsquo;s treachery. Striking out from the city, your travels take you to the furthest corners of the world. You will encounter ghoul-haunted oases, magical palaces, lost cities of gold, and uncharted isles full of mystery and danger. Threatened by bandits, fire wizards, thieves and fearsome creatures, you must risk all in your determined quest to save the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NB: Once Upon A Time In Arabia was originally published as TWIST OF FATE in the Virtual Reality series. This edition is revised and expanded with a completely new prologue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
