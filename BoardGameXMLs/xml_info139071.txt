			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You found a weapon. You can see what it is and what it is made from&amp;hellip;but what can it actually do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented here are a collection of abilities, both mundane and supernatural. Also you will find some disadvantages/curses to make things interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second part of the Fantasy/Medieval Weapons Kit. You do not need the first part of the kit to use this, but it is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also any abilities mentioned can apply equal to all weapons and ammo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Kit is system generic, costs and abilities are given in general terms, from 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the strongest/most expensive/difficult etc. Each point could be something like 1% or 5% or even 10%, it depends on the system or feature you are using. So an item with a 10 rating would be 100%, or doubled, or a rating of 5 would do 5 points of damage etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
