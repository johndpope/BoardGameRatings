			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the land of the samurai and ninja. Contained within this makimono (scroll) is all the ancient teachings and waza (techniques) of the legendary warriors of old, enabling you to perform like them. Follow the patch of Bushi (samurai), the Ronin the Oni (devils) or even the Kusa (ninja).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well OK not quite. But what you will find within the covers of this fast play set of skirmish rules is everything you need to play out the historical, theatrical and even the fantastical action of fact and fictional Japan. Build your Tomozei (retinue) from a wide range of characters, all with different abilities and weapon skills. Fight for your honour, Giri (duty), money or just for the pure &amp;lsquo;fun of it&amp;rsquo;. Sample scenarios lead onto the simple advancement and campaign ideas. You may see your Tomozei fighting for control of the neighboring fief or even seeking to become the next SHOGUN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional weapon detail, Ki Points and Karma Cards add even more fun to your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played using any figures from your collection in any scale. A standard game in 28mm uses a 3&amp;rsquo;-4&amp;rsquo; square table and is over in about 50 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
