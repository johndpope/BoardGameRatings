							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Roland C.II</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LFG Roland C.II, usually known as the Walfisch (Whale), was an advanced German reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. Because of its great speed, when it was first introduced, it could be intercepted only from above. It was also used in a fighter escort role and had a crew of two, pilot and observer/gunner. It was flown by a number of famous German aces, including The Red Baron, Manfred Von Richthofen. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
