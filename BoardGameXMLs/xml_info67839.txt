			<description>A shadow hangs over the Kingdom. Goblin armies are amassing on the horizon, and the King's Seer receives a vision that two of the his closest companions are plotting a betrayal. Will the Kingdom be able to withstand the invaders and expose the traitors, or will it fall into ruins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfidia is a card game for two players. One player will play as the Kingdom, and the other is known as Traitor. The game is centered around eight characters, two of which are chosen secretly by the Traitor player. Victory requires clever card management and use of characters, as well as deductive and bluffing skills to predict the traitors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-C. Wade McKenzie, Designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
