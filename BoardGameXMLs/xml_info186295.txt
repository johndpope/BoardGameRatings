			<description>Players take on the role of a thief attempting to obtain priceless treasures and outdo their fellow gentleman and lady burglars. Two to five players take turns picking locks to steal valuable items from the vault or each other. The thief with the most treasures at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each treasure obtained puts you closer to winning. However, each treasure has a special negative effect that makes your collection vulnerable. Steal wisely, certain combinations of treasures in your possession could make it easier for other thieves to steal from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mechanic of Pick the Lock has a small amount of wit and a lot of luck. Players attempt to steal treasures from each other or the vault by using one of their five number cards. These cards are numbered four through eight. When played they define the odds of success during your attempt to steal a treasure. The defending player sets the combination of the lock to his or her vault by placing a card face down that is from 1 to the number the attacking player has played. Using the right cards with the right treasure effects could ensure your victory. Pick the Lock combines a nice blend of strategy, wit, and luck. Are you clever enough to outwit your friends and Pick the Lock?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick the Lock is a Card game for 2-5 players ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
