							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power Displays (Expanded)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different default displays that accompany powers - auditory, material, visual, etc. There are even rules to change a category of display for a character. But what if you want more than just those options? What if you want your kineticist's visual displays on his fire powers to make him look like he's covered in a wreath of fire, while the visual displays on his cold powers make him look like his breath is frost? What if you want your seer's offensive powers with a mental display to remind those nearby of the feeling of being ill?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the rules presented in High Psionics: Power Displays. With new displays, display groups, character themes, and more, this supplement helps you truly customize your manifester's unique personality.  With 11 full pages of new power displays, every manifester type has new options for their powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
