			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narcos is a game that will allow you to play a part in the creation of the Medellin drug cartel. Travel with your associates along the road from Medellin to Miami, avoiding police controls to complete your job as smoothly as possible. For every failed delivery there&amp;rsquo;s someone who&amp;rsquo;ll pay and you&amp;rsquo;d better hope it&amp;rsquo;s not you. In NARCOS each player will have to play his role for everything to go as planned. But be warned, double crossers hide behind every corner an under cover cop could catch you red-handed, or worse, one of your associates might as well decide to cheat you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game preparation&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the character cards and distribute them face down ,one to each player. Each player will check the character he has been given and put the card in front of himself,careful to keep  it face down all the time. Shuffle the Delivery deck and give 5 cards to each player. Put the deck in the middle of the game table in order to allow every player to easily reach it. Leave some free space for the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;At no time during the match should anyone ever reveal his character identity by any mean, not should anyone give details of the cards he has in his hands or those who have been given or received during the match. However, it is possible for the players to talk during the INTERROGATION phase to try saving their own neck and to avoid being eliminated. &lt;br/&gt;Once every player has his own character and his own hand, you can continue to the next phase of the game.&lt;br/&gt;END OF THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of these conditions occurs:&lt;br/&gt;Drug traffickers victory:&lt;br/&gt;The DRUG TRAFFICKERS win if they manage to successfully complete the expected number of deliveries before the end of the turns (based on the numbers of players)&lt;br/&gt;Or&lt;br/&gt;The DRUG TRAFFICKERS win if they eliminate EVERY federal agent&lt;br/&gt;Or&lt;br/&gt;an individual DRUG TRAFFICKER can decide to starts his own business and win the match on his own(VICTORY BY MONOPOLY)&lt;br/&gt;Federal agents victory:&lt;br/&gt;FEDERAL AGENTS win if they manage to prevent the drug traffickers to successfully complete the expected number of deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;Pablo Escobar victory:&lt;br/&gt;PABLO ESCOBAR wins if during any delivery round he manages to obtain FOUR PARLAMENTARIAN cards AFTER haing passed the four cards of that turn to the player on his left side.
