			<description>This is the 7th in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011), Gameshop Workday (2012), Gameshop Gladiators (2013), Gameshop Adventurers (2014), Gameshop Expansions (2015), and Gameshop Collector (2016).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mirror Universe employees of Unlimited Games have come to our reality to battle gurus Kylie, Candra and Andrew for control over the Games Unlimited store. Only one game team will reign supreme!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win: Place all your active Guru markers (any remaining on the board) on any of the gray marked spaces in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s home row or remove all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Place the board between players and orient it so that one player is facing the 3 Games Unlimited Gurus and the other player their mirror duplicate Gurus from Unlimited Games. The row closest to the player is their home row. Each player receives &lt;br/&gt;3 Guru markers in a matching color. Place these markers, &lt;br/&gt;1 each, on the 3 gray spaces on your home row. Shuffle the &lt;br/&gt;4 Action cards and, without looking at them, flip half the cards over to their opposite side. Deal 1 card face up in front of each player and place 1 card to the side of the board. The 4th card is removed from the game. The first player will be the one who has most recently looked in a mirror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: Each player has an Action card that displays a possible move for any of their markers. There is a 3rd card to one side of the board that cannot be used by either player during their turn. On a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, they move 1 of their active Guru markers (Note: Active Guru markers are the ones remaining on the board) according to the Action card; they then replace the card they used with the 3rd card. The other player then moves accordingly, and exchanges their card with this new 3rd card - the card the first player just used.&lt;br/&gt;Moving a marker on top of one of an opponent player&amp;rsquo;s markers removes that opponent&amp;rsquo;s marker from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may stack a maximum of 2 of their pieces on any space except the center space. A stack prevents either stacked piece from being captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving your active Guru markers to the home row spaces of &lt;br/&gt;your opponent wins you the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As long as one of a player&amp;rsquo;s markers remains on the center space on the board, that player may, during their turn, flip their Action card over to its opposite face to introduce a new move into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards should be oriented with the name of the action at the bottom of the card. Each card shows the player&amp;rsquo;s marker in the middle of the card and indicates which spaces, either forward, backward or to the side, to which they may move their marker. Below this diagram, the action on the other face of the card is displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
