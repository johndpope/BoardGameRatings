							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crystal Pyramid</name>
									
			<description>In Crystal Pyramid, 2 - 5 players are competing in auctions for crystals, actions and characters with one goal:&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to complete building your pyramid of crystals.&lt;br/&gt;Harness the power of the Mummy, the Pharaoh, the Noble Brigand and other characters to outdo your fellow pyramid builders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does this make any sense at all? You decide. &lt;br/&gt;This game owes its existance mainly to an overabundance of acrylic crystals in the game designer's possession. &lt;br/&gt;But stranger things have happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystal Pyramid is a family level auction and set building game (unless you tell the seven year old how she has to play, which might end in tears).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available as a free print &amp;amp; play download in English and German right here on BGG.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
