							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dargon&#039;s Dungeon (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entrance stands high upon a sheer and forbidding cliff wall, accessible only by the narrowest of trails. After an afternoon of strenuous climbing, you arrive before the large, rune-covered door to the dungeon. Steeling your nerve, you lead your party through the ominous portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond is a small room, occupied by a glowing black sphere which floats before you, throbbing dully. With a chill, you realize that you are rooted to the ground - and the globe closes rapidly on you! You try to scream, but your throat is paralyzed. A voice echoes within your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the Four Gauntlets of chromatic Doom, oh foolish one...'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sphere engulfs you. For the first time, you wonder if this trip was such a good idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For one to three 1st - 3rd level characters (with no more than 90 [combined total] combat adds)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
