			<description>This is the original game that was developed into 1893 Cologne by Marflow games. It is set in the same Cologne region of Germany. There are several differences including a differences in the map, stock chart, minor differences in the major and minor company contents, and a more restrictive tile set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with other 18xx games, players start with a set amount of money that they then invest in various companies. As the game progresses, these companies grow and earn income for their owners. Technology increases in the form of better trains with progression through more complicated track tiles. When the game ends, the winner if the player with the greatest net worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
