							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Egypt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FROM THE ANCIENT TOMBS, IT RISES...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curse of Egypt features three classic horror shorts (one illustrated by the great Steve Ditko) that draw their inspiration from the legends and iconic cursed tombs and mummies of Egypt. Each relates a chilling tale of the ancient mystical forces of Egypt colliding with and crushing those of the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, In addition to the comics, The Curse of Egypt contains new rules to let roleplaying gamers create their own chilling tales of ancient evils awakened using the d20 System. With a series of feats, player characters and non-player characters alike can bring the touch of the ancient gods of Egypt to campaigns where the supernatural is uncommon. Designed by Steve Miller, known for his work on the Ravenloft gothic fantasy gameworld, these rules are fully compatible with other NUELOW Games d20 System supplements and easily incorporated into your favorite d20 System variant. (They were designed with the OGL d20 Modern game in mind.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
