							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Les 1000 Bornes des Mots</name>
									
			<description>A Mille Bornes variant in which players must form the sentences with the words on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to make sentences with these words. Since we Dujardin, add a few cards of attack and defense. The fire becomes red misspelling, and the green light a dictionary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw a card to your hand, play or discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has placed a series of six cards and he managed to shoot down six cards in his hand. The game also ends if no cards remaining in the deck is playable.&lt;br/&gt;Each series reported scores up to 40 points, 10 bonus points triggering endgame, foul play by 10 points.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first totaling 500 points after several parties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
