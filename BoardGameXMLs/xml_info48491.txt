			<description>The Viking Game can be played by both young and old. There are three levels of difficulty, you need a bit of luck, lots of skill, and a good memory!&lt;br/&gt;The Viking Game is designed for 2 to 4 players, from about 7 years old, though at least one adult should participate.&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you have to get the highest number of points. It has two parts, the sea voyage between two cities, and to become &amp;quot;The Best Tourist in Town&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;During the sea voyage part of the game, lots of different things happen on the coloured dots, and when visiting the cities you have to collect sightseeing cards. In the most difficult part, the rules say that you have to know what the card shows, and also have to remember something from the text on the reverse side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
