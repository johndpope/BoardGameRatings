							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Day Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 16 x 20 inch, floor plan of an Day Room, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pills! I want more pills!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product includes a single day room. A day room is a communal living room in an area such as a hospital or mental institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product can be used in any era after the late nineteenth century (the present radiators were initially invented in 1855-1857).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansion to The Asylum: The day room could be used as a secret room as part of the Asylum, perhaps as an extra room on the Fourth Floor that still has plenty of unused space on the periphery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with The Day Room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A New Prescription: A few select patients are led to the secret day room every day. Their normal prescriptions are discarded and replaced with new regimens by the main psychiatrist. He has nurses in the room to observe them for changes in behavior. Sometimes the patient&amp;rsquo;s condition improves or worsens on their new regimens. However, this time around the pharmacist has given the psychiatrist some experimental drugs. They greatly improve the mood of the patients who take them. The pills are highly addictive; however, and the withdrawal causes a plummeting of the patient&amp;rsquo;s mood. The patients demand more of the pills and become violent when denied pills as the supply runs low.&lt;br/&gt;A nurse is strangled to death by one of patients and the psychiatrist locks them in the day room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters can get directly involved as investigators of the nurse&amp;rsquo;s death or perhaps a trail of drug related deaths in town lead them to the pharmacist and the asylum. When they get to the asylum, they find the patients attacking the door with reckless abandon, trying to get into the main asylum. They appear in an almost frenzied, enraged state and eventually break down the door, screaming for pills and killing anyone who tells them they can&amp;rsquo;t have any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
