			<description>A combat flight simulator game in which the player flies the USAF's F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves modern air combat in several campaigns and missions. The campaigns are set around fictional wars in areas such as Angola, Jordan, Russia, Colombia, and Iran, with the player fighting for the USA. Enemies encountered in the game are usually jet fighters from former Eastern Bloc countries as well as helicopters and SAM sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has allies including the Harrier Jump Jet, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and HUMVEE(High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle). In addition, the player will usually be accompanied by a simulated wingman in a computer controlled F-22 Raptor. The real world weapons systems of the F-22 are simulated, including the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, as well as a 20mm cannon and the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with a highly detailed intro movie describing the F-22 and its innovations. The game was originally released for Windows 95 and Windows 98 and later patched for Windows 2000, Windows NT, and Windows XP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-22 Raptor (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
