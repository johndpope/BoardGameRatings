							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of the Raven</name>
									
			<description>Legends of the Raven is a dice game produced by Singapore company, Real Gamer Pte Ltd. &lt;br/&gt;The sets come with equipment for a single player and two sets are required to play this two-player game. Each set has a plastic container containing six special dice (each die shows a picture of a raven and two to six pips on the sides). Half of the container has a transparent wall to allow players to see their own dice. &lt;br/&gt;The game mechanism is similar to Liar's Dice, with players stating higher and higher numbers of specific faces of dice, until one or the other player is forced to call the other player's bluff (or truthful call). The raven side of the die is treated like a wild card, but once a number of ravens is called, may no longer be used as a wild card.&lt;br/&gt;Sets come as Classic or Gold editions - Gold editions have sturdier containers. The Classic edition has dice with either black or purple pips; the Gold edition has dice with blue pips. In all editions, the ravens are black.&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the game is linked to a fantasy story, which is also on sale at the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
