			<description>The object of the game is to be the first one to earn your wings so that you can fly beyond both tracks with &amp;quot;comfortable&amp;quot; freedom. To do this, you must be the first one to land on an Opportunity Space with 50 Comfort Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose one player to be the Comfort Chips banker. This player is in charge of all Comfort Chips paid to and from the bank. The banker separates the Comfort Chips into stacks by denomination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The banker gives each player a (5 Comfort Points) to start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Players place their playing piece (which looks like a person) on the spot that matches the color of the playing piece. This is each player's starting position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. All players roll the dice. The player with the highest number goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. After the first player completes a turn, the player to his or her left takes the next turn. Play continues clockwise. If two or more players land on the occupied space, share that space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to Do on a Turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Roll the dice. Move clockwise on the inside track. This track is called the Red Brick Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Always move clockwise unless you land on an Opportunity Space. (For more information, see the Opportunity Spaces section below.) Later, if you earn your way to the Yellow Brick Road (the outside track), you will also move clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Follow the directions on the space you land on. This ends your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. If you lose all your Comfort Chips, go back to &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;. Begin again with 5 Comfort Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember: The object of the game is to be the first one to earn your wings so that you can fly beyond both tracks with &amp;quot;comfortable&amp;quot; freedom. To do this, you must be the first one to land on an Opportunity Space with 50 Comfort Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
