			<description>The boardgame Seventhstone - Die Tr&amp;auml;nen der G&amp;ouml;tter (Seventhstone - Tears of the Gods) is a turn-based, strategic development/combat game which combines elements of classic genre elements with fresh ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in common fantasy games the players begin as rulers of different peoples (dwarves, humans, elves, orcs). Each player owns a capital city, which forms their source of power. The players have to conquer other areas and erect buildings to expand their realms, thus increasing their chances to win the game. Battles between the players will be common soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to collect seven powerful artifacts, called Tear Stones. There are several ways to get these stones into one's possession: either by conquering certain targets on the modular board or by winning the regularly recurring tournaments or by purchasing the artifacts on the market. Any combination of those ways is possible, making for versatile strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is tested and totally playable as it is, but the publisher and designer invites the players to creatively shape gameplay and background story and share their ideas with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present, the game is available in German language only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
