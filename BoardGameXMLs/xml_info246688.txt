							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UFO (1977)</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of the many trek games already done, and done well, I decided to invent my own space game, with my own rules.  The result was UFO.  It differs from the Star Trek games I have seen in its general format and weapon selection.  The same idea prevails, however: kill or be killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFO is a strategy game in which you play against the computer in a life-and-death struggle for superiority of space.  It takes place after a space war with another planet in which both earth and the attacker's planet are destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFO was written by Raymond J. Kernay and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol. 3, No. 4, July/August 1977.  The listing used vanilla BASIC and was intended for any BASIC system (with possible minor modifications required).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
