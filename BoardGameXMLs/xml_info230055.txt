							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Knight (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)</name>
									
			<description>A print and play scenario for T.I.M.E Stories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Knight satellite has been orbiting the Earth for years. Recent events and new information has convinced the government that it is time to bring it down for study. Safely tucked away at Edwards Air Force Base (more commonly known as Area 51), they try to unlock its secrets - but there are some problems ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEFORE YOU PRINT (a note from the designer):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a long scenario, 208 cards. I tried a smaller size to save ink and paper, but it didn't work with a couple different scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After several conversations with other players, I would like to emphasize this point: There are several extremely difficult codes and puzzles. The puzzles are not technically needed to win, but solving them will help immensely. You will also miss part of the story if they aren't solved. If you are intent on solving them then plan on spending just as much time on the codes/puzzles as actually playing the game. Also, I have not offered any hints or clues on the forums. This scenario was created to be hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a device with a QR reader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no time loop--it's do or die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no combat. Challenges, yes; combat, no.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is playable with 2, 3, or 4 players (it will even work solo, except for one card that is not totally necessary).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hard, but family-friendly in all other ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is long, and there is no good stopping point. Be prepared to use the save option in the box, finish in one long session, or have a table where it can be left out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some duplex printers work better than others. You may want to try hand feeding paper for better alignment. A tedious job, but it often helps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be sure your printer is set to 100% not &amp;quot;scale to fit.&amp;quot; If the cards appear too small this is likely the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
