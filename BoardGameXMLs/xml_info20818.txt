			<description>Nemesis is a (collectible) card game about gladiators, set in ancient Rome.&lt;br/&gt;Each deck represents a type of gladiator (Myrmillo, Dimachaera  and Retiarius decks were made) and the total of cards in a deck determine a gladiators total life points. Each turn a player takes cards from his life deck into his hand and attacks other players. Damage is taken by discarding cards from your hand or your life deck. The last player to have cards left in his/her life deck wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;There is a pile of &amp;quot;Arena&amp;quot; cards as well that determine random events that occur in the Arena - some good, some bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game was handmade, monochrome drawings on colored cardboard cards. Some 200 copies were made of the &amp;quot;basic set&amp;quot; (rules, Arena cards and two gladiator decks; Myrmillo and Dimachaera) and the &amp;quot;first expansion set&amp;quot; (Retiarius).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
