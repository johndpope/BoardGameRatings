							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Town of Fourwell</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourwell is a small town of a thousand inhabitants situated in an area of vast grassy plains. The land is rich and fertile, and the area&amp;rsquo;s wealth lies in agriculture. Though the area features no large lakes or major rivers, rainfall and underground water are abundant. The northern part of the territory rises to low hills, while the south turns to sparse forest.&lt;br/&gt;The town and its inhabitants are fully described in the adventure module &amp;ldquo;The House Under the Hill&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;This Blueprint presents five maps; a brief description of each one follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Town of Fourwell: an overview map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 - Magic Guild: The Magic Guild is situated in the southwest corner of Fourwell. The guild&amp;rsquo;s seat is a large longhouse whose trees were felled in the nearby woods a century ago. In the years since, the building has been reinforced with wall of stone and wall of iron spells from the scroll collection of guildmaster Nyrd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 - Twin&amp;rsquo;s Theatre: This building featuring a large open-space area, provides common citizens and merchants alike with excitement and entertainment. It is run by the gnome twins Flix and Trist Paddler (both CN male gnome bard 1). Flix is a jovial fellow always ready to play comedies or exciting but trivial plays. By contrast, Trist is often sad and worried, and prefers tragedies and plays of great intellectual value (but sometimes questionable entertainment). The Theatre offers one or two shows during the week, with tickets starting at 1 cp. Popular recent productions include Invorath&amp;rsquo;s Ten Lunches, The Death of Bor Greybottle, The Fat Dwarf in Love, and The Monster of the Woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9 - Militia Barracks: A local militia was founded twenty-five years ago to protect Fourwell from external threats (mostly wandering monsters and bandits) and respond to internal emergencies (thieves, fire, and so on). The militia currently has forty members who live in the barracks, a group of five buildings within a 10-foot-high stone wall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13 - The House Under the Hill: The House Under the Hill is a dungeon built by halflings. It is clear that the place was once a residence, but today it is claimed by giant ants and haunted by undead. The dungeon is composed of several rooms excavated beneath the hill. Though the entire structure is just one level, the giant ant tunnels could easily lead to new adventure sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
