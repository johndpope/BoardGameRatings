			<description>In 1583 the Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia, Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II moved the imperial court from Vienna to Prague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of an unlimited turns. Each turn has six phases, in this order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Auction &lt;br/&gt;2) Purchase of a hole card &lt;br/&gt;3) Purchase of a chosen card &lt;br/&gt;4) Action Rounds&lt;br/&gt;5) Politics &lt;br/&gt;6) End game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose turn to play the player is called &amp;quot;active.&amp;quot; After his turn, takes a turn the next player following the direction of clockwise, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many personalities in the court of Prague who live and enjoy a status under the auspices of Rudolf II, but few enjoy their confidence. The influence line represents exactly that: the degree of confidence that the Emperor has in his subject. Therefore, the player who makes the best use of the changing order of Influence action cards and Districts cards, and the special privileges granted Roles action cards will have the greatest success and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways to finish the game, but always when all players have played the eighth inning, there is a final tally of points. The winner is the player with the most victory points at the end of the game. Victory points are calculated by adding the costs of the districts he put into play more guilders of his treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
