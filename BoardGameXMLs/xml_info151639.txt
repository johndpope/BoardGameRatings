			<description>These French Fries Are Terrible Hot Dogs is a party card game where players must lie to tell the truth, and convince others that their card is something else, more specifically, cards drawn by other people. Players are encouraged to be clever and to speak with a silver tongue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round of the game, one person will act as the Judge and will take a card from the deck and place it face up. That card is the Target Card. Everyone else then takes a card from their hand and places that card face down. Next, each player must try and convince the Judge that their card is the Target Card by using true information about the card that they just placed down. The act of convincing the Judge is known as The Pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's say Bob is the Judge, and he flips over the Target Card &amp;quot;Hot Dogs.&amp;quot; Susan then decides to player her &amp;quot;French Fries&amp;quot; card and places it face down. During her pitch, she can say:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, mine's really good plain, but people usually put toppings on it, like ketchup. Others might add chili or cheese. Oh, and you really don't want to eat it cold, it's much better warm.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone is finished making their pitch, the Judge picks the person who they feel had the best pitch, and declares that person the winner of the round. Players then discard the cards used during that round. Everyone but the Judge and the round winner draws a new card to replace the one that they just played. A new Judge is chosen, and a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A winner is determined once a person discards all of their cards and says &amp;quot;These French Fries Are Terrible Hot Dogs!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
