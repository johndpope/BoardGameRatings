							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HX11: Forward Observation Bunker</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exilium Mission Seed: HX11, Forward Observation Bunker&lt;br/&gt;Location: Steel polar region&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built into the crater formed hundreds of years ago by the crash-landing of a Void Arc, HX11 was once a valuable forward observation post of Unity on Steel from which the local front lines of the formal conflicts could be monitored. Unity abandoned the post after a catastrophic attack by moon forces. Now the post appears to be a makeshift and effectively neutral hospital near the front lines, housing soldiers from all factions as well as a force of Puppets to enforce peace, but the truth is somewhat different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions Seeds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF presents a short mission seed for the Exilium roleplaying game of posthuman loss and redemption, and describes the origin and history of HX11, a Forward Observation Bunker at the front lines of the formal conflicts on Steel, including some of the notable locations and factions as well as possible Shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
