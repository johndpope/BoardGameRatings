			<description>SHAREMANIA is a simple stock market dice game comprising a board, marker pieces, score pads and a set of five special dice (2 Share Dice, 2 Company Dice, 1 Market die).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basic Game: &lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player rolls the two Company Dice and the two Share Dice to see which of the four Companies he may trade in and how many blocks of shares may be traded (each dice is marked 1, 2 or 3).  When shares are bought or sold the price goes up or down one unit for every block of shares traded - with the value of the shares being tracked on the board.  As the share price swings players attempt to buy low and sell high in order to generate the most profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Game:&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game players are also allowed to take out loans and put options.  Various random events, such as market trends are also introduced through the use of the Market Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For both versions of the game the values of the various trades are recorded on the score pads.  In the basic game the winner is the first to accumulate 1 Million starting from a 100K stake. In the advanced game the target is 2 Million, but free of loans and put options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
