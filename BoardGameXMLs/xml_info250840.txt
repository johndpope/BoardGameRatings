							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The High Road to Kaiin</name>
									
			<description>A Cugel-Level Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find yourselves this morning arrived in the remote town of Grellet, sandwiched in a narrow belt of fertile and inhabited land between the barren and dangerous Modavna Moor and the Great Da Forest. Behind you is an almost trackless expanse that you were lucky to pass through alive. Ahead lies the vast and gloomy distance of dense woodland, way beyond the far side of which is the magnificent city of Kaiin. Kaiin is a prosperous port on a wide estuary, and a civilised place swarming with visitors and happy-go-lucky residents. This sounds just the place for persons of your delicate sensibilities, and is sure to provide a good living for only minimal exertion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
