			<description>from the Paranoia-Live Jparanoia FAQ:&lt;br/&gt;JParanoia is an application (or more accurately a pair of applications) designed specifically for playing the Paranoia Role Playing Game on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JParanoia was built from the ground up FOR PLAYING PARANOIA ONLINE. JParanoia was coded by a Paranoia player with consultation from a GM. In short, JParanoia was written with both the GM and player in mind, and its feature set reflects this. JParanoia provides virtually all of the functionality found in IRC (and in many areas, much more), however using JParanoia is as easy as using popular instant messaging programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
