			<description>Dirt: Showdown (stylised as DiRT: Showdown) is a video game published and developed by Codemasters for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was released on 25 May 2012 in Europe and on 12 June in North America. It is part of the Colin McRae Rally game series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is entered in a series of &amp;quot;Tour&amp;quot; events, offering a range of races and tournaments to compete in. Winning these events gives the player prize money, which can be spent buying new cars or upgrading existing ones, and unlocks further races. Upon the successful completion of the series final, the next difficulty setting is unlocked, featuring faster opponents and longer races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirt: Showdown removes several of the gameplay modes featured in its predecessor Dirt 3, and introduces new ones. Gameplay modes can be classified as Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan or Party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;DiRT: Showdown&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
