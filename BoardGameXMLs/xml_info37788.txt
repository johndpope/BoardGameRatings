							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Avalanche Mountain</name>
									
			<description>This is an Adventure from The Book of Virtues.  From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can see the snowy summit from a distance.  Your goal: reach your friends Plato and Aurora at the top.  But this is no simple hike up any old hill.  This is a virtue quest to reach the peak of Avalanche Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way you'll try to acquire virtue chips while avoiding the fault chips.  Roll a color and advance, but watch out!  At any time someone could roll and AVALANCHE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an avalanche, you lift the release gate, sending the cascading marble on its downward journey.  It ricochets and rolls down the mountain side, along the vertical playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avoid being knocked over by an avalanche by having virtue chips.  Lose ground if you're knocked over while holding a fault chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you collect the virtues it takes to make it to the top of Avalanche Mountain?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
