							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horse Race Game</name>
									
			<description>Rare game. The board has different coloured lanes, one for each horse. In your turn, you throw the three dice. Move a horse that matches a number, e.g. you roll a 3, 4 and 5. Horse numbered 3, 4 and 5 move one space. If a number is rolled twice, that horse moves 2 spaces. If a number is rolled thrice, that horse moves 3 spaces. If a horse gets to the space before the finish line, it must roll a double to cross the line. That is it. Not the most skilful game I have ever seen!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow for three variants, the Regular Race (as described above), the Slow Race (the horse that is last to finish, wins the race, and a hurdle race which is played just like the Regular Game except that when you reach a fence, you have to roll a double to get over it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publishers suggest that you may use the contents and create your own variants. I suggest, for a start, have some betting before the race. At least that would make the game a little more exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
