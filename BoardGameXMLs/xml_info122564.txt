			<description>designer description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arena is a free rpg of pure combat for 2-4 players (plus the solo variant). Arena could be considered as the rpg of Tekken, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat or any other beat'em up videogame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a character who will have to fight a number of matches versus enemies stronger and stronger.&lt;br/&gt;After each won fight you will earn experience that can be spent to empower your character or to stack GLORY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, the winner is who has more glory.&lt;br/&gt; Fights are handled by a system that uses cards and dice, and that will prize luck, strategy and good narration.&lt;br/&gt; A single fight will be 20-30 minutes long, and the final result will be an interesting battle that looks like fights in manga like Naruto or Dragon Ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S. There are fatalities, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
