							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Expanding Universe: White Dwarf Classic Traveller Articles</name>
									
			<description>from the Author's Notes:&lt;br/&gt;Writing these four articles taught me two main lessons: First, the value of a good editor - who can take something you thought was perfect, cut 30% of it out, and produce something that is better than your original piece. And second, how the same ideas are taken more seriously as they move from hand-written notes to typescript to published article.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;Some time after the series was published, it was updated and reprinted in The Best of White Dwarf Articles. In hindsight, this was a mistake, and they should have been reprinted as originally written; so you will not see the updated versions on this website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;This document is an edited and annotated collection of Andy Slack's &amp;quot;Expanding Universe&amp;quot; article series originally published in White Dwarf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original article database entries may found here:&lt;br/&gt;White Dwarf (Issue 13 - Jun 1979): Expanding Universe Part 1: Additions to Traveller Rules (Skills, Poisons and Chemical Warfare&lt;br/&gt;White Dwarf (Issue 14 - Aug 1979): Expanding Universe Part 2: Suggested Additions to Traveller Rules (Ship Weaponry, Artillery and Explosives)&lt;br/&gt;White Dwarf (Issue 15 - Oct 1979): Expanding Universe Part 3: Suggested Additions to Traveller Rules (Campaign Locations, Alien Life and Robots)&lt;br/&gt;White Dwarf (Issue 16 - Dec 1979): Expanding Universe Part 4: Suggested Additions to Traveller Rules (Social Status and Psionics)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
