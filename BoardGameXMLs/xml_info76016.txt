			<description>[Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_F._Gates%27_Police_Quest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_F._Gates%27_Police_Quest&lt;/a&gt;:_SWAT]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daryl F. Gates' Police Quest: SWAT was originally the fifth game in the Police Quest series (but spawned the SWAT series). It is an interactive movie type game released in 1995 that suffered the same fate as most titles of the same genre released during the so-called Multimedia Explosion in the mid-nineties. With extensive use of FMV videos for its basic gameplay, the game took up four CDs. As the game flopped for a second time (Open Season being the first), it would take three years until a new game in the Police Quest series would be released (Police Quest: SWAT 2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
