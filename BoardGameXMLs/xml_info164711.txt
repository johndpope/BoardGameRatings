			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;In Darkest of Days, you'll get to experience some of the most varied gameplay ever released in one title. Things will never get stale as you travel to distant times and fight alongside people from that time period. Fighting in Antietam (the bloodiest day in the American Civil War) feels much different than fighting on the side of the Russians at Tannenberg (where the Russians withstood 140,000 casualties in WW1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight in FIVE different time periods. Wheter it's in Pompeii, Antietam, WW1, WW2 or Little Big Horn, you will fight with real weapons from the time period. You will battle against enemies that fight in different ways, all reflective of how fighting was done at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participate in EPIC battle scenes: &lt;br/&gt;- You will fight against the Confederates (and the Union at times), facing a staggering number of troops, all fighting in unison. Ready, aim... steady men... FIRE!!! &lt;br/&gt;- You will jump from the trenches in WW1 to lead an attack against the Huns. You will fire artillery to hit distant targets. You will defend to the last man!&lt;br/&gt;- You will fight in Pompeii, while Mt. Vesuvius is spewing ash and fire into the atmosphere. You will fight amongst a frightened population, fleeing for their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
