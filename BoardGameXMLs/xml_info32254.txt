			<description>A rather demanding card game from the pre-war area of the pepys company.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in the super-luxury padded box with silk finish box hull and thick cards with linen finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game depicts the progress of the pilgrims on the american continent, with John Bunyan the joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 52 cards in 4 suits and the joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to get rid of the cards in hand first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achive this the cards have to be laid out in a given pattern following complicated rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After one player has finished the cards in hand of the other players count points against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends after a beforehand agreed number of po&amp;iacute;nts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a Rummy-variant which can be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational factor is served by the fact that there is a booklet added which present a resum&amp;eacute; of the story of the pilgrims progress as illustrated in the card game (there are notes to each card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Known are two editions of the game: One came in dark purple and one in dark maroon. Excellent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
