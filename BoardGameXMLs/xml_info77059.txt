			<description>Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony is the second expansion to Grand Theft Auto IV. It was released in the autumn of 2009 for the Xbox 360. The episode was later released for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows in April 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead character in this game is Luis Fernando Lopez, a (former) Dominican drugs dealer and freefighter who is now assistent (and business partner) to nightclub owner Anthony Prince ('Gay Tony'). Prince is the owner of two large nightclubs in Liberty City, Maisonette 9 and Hercules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their press release Rockstar Games claim that this episode &amp;quot;injects Liberty City with an overdose of guns, glitz, and crime&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family and friends, and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in a world in which everyone has a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game introduces the ability to replay allready passed missions with scoring. Also new to the game are features like basejumping and skydiving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary, based on Source Wikipedia Grand Theft Auto IV, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
