							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The witch is dead. By a fluke of fate the party has managed to put an end to her and her evil, freeing the village of Welker from her sadistic rule. Unfortunately, in doing so they find themselves under the effects of a powerful curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the PCs gather the ingredients for a magical cure from the witch's lair before the curse becomes permanent or they fall foul of her brutal ogrekin son. The main difficulty comes not from the lethal traps and guardians that protect her cottage and garden, but from the effects of the curse itself, for they must overcome all these hazards while trapped in the bodies of tiny animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module includes pregenerated characters and a new minor artifact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witch's Revenge is compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and can be easily adaped to any campaign. It uses the Medium advancement track and is designed for four newly created characters of 1st level who should be half way to 2nd level at its completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
