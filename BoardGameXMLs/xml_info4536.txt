			<description>&amp;quot;Take the reins of your very own game company and prove you have what it takes to make it big in this easy to learn and fast to play card game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an ultra simple non-collectible card game where you play cards out of your hand that represent games you want to publish in several categories.  You pay money to publish the games, and then collect money as long as you can keep them on the market.  Random event cards and such are thrown in for added fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the cards are humorous parodies, such as &amp;quot;Galaxy Rules Battles (Who needs miniatures when we're just going to argue?)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Custer's Greatest Triumphs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Eighth Reich&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Goths: The Wandering&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
