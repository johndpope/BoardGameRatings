			<description>Introduction to program listing in SoftSide Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trolls never have done very well in public opinion polls, probably because of their penchant for eating any unsuspecting traveler who strays their way. The &amp;quot;miscreant muncher&amp;quot; in this particular game is no exception in that regard, but the fact that he's sitting on enough gold to underwrite the national debt could well make the trip worth your while. One word of caution: reaching the gold is only half the battle -- he'll be doing everything he can to prevent you from getting it back out again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chase game for children of all ages. The troll is deep within the caves. Your goal is to descend to his gold-filled lair and escape with the booty without him catching you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
