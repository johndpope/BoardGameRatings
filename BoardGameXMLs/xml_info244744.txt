			<description>Supervillain is a card &amp;amp; dice game where players, branded Villains by the corrupted Establishment, compete to expose the perverting influences on our institutions and governments; its up to YOU to expose the corruption!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Characters and Items to claim Capers, Villains put a spotlight on corruption - spreading information like modern-day Robin Hoods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Villain who Claims the most Caper points is crowned the Supervillain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete to solve Capers and interfere with other Villains' plans using Shenanigans cards. Combat can ensue, as the Villain to your left may block your attempted Caper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villains play Character &amp;amp; Item cards with values that represent the number of dice they roll to solve that portion of the Caper; the Villain to your left rolls the number of dice on the Caper to &amp;quot;set the point&amp;quot; to match or beat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game length is adjustable depending on how many Capers players agree to play for at the beginning of the game, usually from 30-60 minutes. Solo play time is typically 20-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game comes with 54 high-quality, non-toxic cards made in the USA (8 Chessex dice - from the UK - included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
