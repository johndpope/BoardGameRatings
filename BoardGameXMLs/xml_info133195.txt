							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquering the Wyrm</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faithful and obedient in life to Ma&amp;rsquo;at - the great Truth, the great Order, you were found worthy in death, and permitted to enter the paradise underworld of Amenta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Amenta, you live a peaceful life working the fields of plentiful wheat with ease or otherwise serving the Pharaohs and Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At night, your soul returns to your mummy in the land of the living to sleep, to rejuvenate your spirit. To return, you must pass through Duat, the land of the dead, the realm of demons, smoke, fire, torture, and pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are sleeping, the God, Ra, travels through Amenta rejuvenating the underworld. Before entering Amenta, Ra does battle with the God of Chaos, the Wyrm, Apep. Apep always loses, Ra always wins, and Order is maintained. So it has been, and so must it always be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who were not found worthy have their heart ate by a great monster and are consigned to Duat, the land of the dead, where demons torture the soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of these souls become demons themselves, inflicting pain, destruction, and eventual Oblivion on the evil and chaotic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The demons are jealous and envious of the worthy who dwell in Amenta, but are yet held in check by Order. Apep seeks to disrupt that Order. He is the God of Chaos, Darkness, and the antithesis of Ma&amp;rsquo;at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He must play out the battle against Ra every night as Order commands it, but as the personification of Chaos, Apep bites at his metephorical chains. His servants in Duat, and in the land of the living are looking, seeking...and finding...ways to throw down Order and plunge everything into Chaos, tip the scales, and defeat Ra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As loyal, faithful, obedient servants to the Pharaohs and your patron Gods, the time is coming where you will put down your domestic burden and take up arms against Apep and his minions, in Amenta, in Duat, and even in the land of living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquering the Wyrm is no easy task, and Apep is relentless. Still, you have an advantage. You are ageless, and so long as the funerary rites are maintained by the living, you cannot die again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Note: Conquering the Wyrm features a modified version of the adventure The Obelisk At Dawn, originally written for the Risus One Page Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
