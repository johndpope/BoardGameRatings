			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Open your subconscious and enter the Dreamscape - a world of nightmares and hope. Expand your options with this psionics supplement. Explore the Dreamscape, the plane of dreams and nightmares - battle the Tash qael, the crysmal swarms and the nevermind - utilize new powers, feats, and classes to survive and flourish in a realm where dreams are reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a morphean, who uses fears and nightmares as tools, or fight against a Tash Qael, the self-appointed rulers of the Dreamscape. Create a blade of mental energy by using the mind blade feats, or simply expand your repertoire of powers with the host of new powers for psions, society minds, marksmen, psychic warriors, and wilders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mind Unveiled contains material for virtually any psionic game, both for the player and for the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's in it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mind Unveiled offers two new base classes, the halo knight and the morphean, as well as variant rules for making the monk more psionic in the game. A variety of new prestige classes which deal with the subconscious mind, with the Dreamscape or the new base classes, are introduced and detailed. New feat types, Phrenic and Qaelic, are given for those who wish to explore backgrounds tied to psionics, as well as an entire alternative system for using mind blades. In addition, the myriad denizens of the Dreamscape are detailed in full, including the lords of the qael.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
