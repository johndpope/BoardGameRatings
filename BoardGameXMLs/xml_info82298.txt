			<description>Who fears to speak of Easter Week?&lt;br/&gt;Who dares its fate deplore?&lt;br/&gt;The red gold flame of Eire's name,&lt;br/&gt;Confronts the world once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easter Week is an area/impulse game depicting the Easter Rising in 1916 and the Battle of Dublin in 1922. The Irish Republican Army is controlled by the IRA Player and the British Army and Irish Free State Army by the Government Player. In both games the IRA Player seizes strategic buildings across Dublin and must hold them as long as possible despite being outnumbered 10-1. The Government Player must use his superior forces to retake the city block by block, helped by artillery, bombers, gunboats, tanks and armoured cars. But the IRA is barricaded in thick-walled buildings where a few men can hold up an entire battalion and the centre of Dublin was reduced to rubble before they surrendered. Each side earns victory points during the game and while the IRA Player is unlikely to win the battle he may earn enough VPs to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map (33 x 22 inches)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countersheet with 280 &amp;frac12; inch counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules Booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
