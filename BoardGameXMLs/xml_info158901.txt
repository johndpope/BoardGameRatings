			<description>The Woods is a board game set in a world of Celtic Folklore and Faerietale. Up to six players undertake a coming-of-age-rite and venture forth into the woods beyond their settlement to acquire character aspects which will take them from childhood to adulthood. Along the way they will encounter Folk from other realms, left in the world when the mysterious Fae departed through their gateways centuries ago. These encounters furnish the players with items to help in their quest, or the aspects they are seeking. 'Aspects' are counters collected during the game. First to 6 aspects wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
