			<description>Each player gets a certain amount of cardboard chips (depending on the number of players). The board has four segments in four colors, on each of them there are eleven overlapping colored rings. The first player places one of his/her chips in one of the rings on the game board. The next player has to place a chip into the board segment with the same color as the ring just covered, etc. A player who cannot play (because no ring in the segment that he or she has to play on is completely free) has to take up all the chips in that segment. The first player to run out of chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
