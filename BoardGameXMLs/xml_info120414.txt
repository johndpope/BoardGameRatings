							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">13 Ammunition Types</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I dove to the left, scrambling for cover as the feral opened fire with some sort of slugthrower I'd never before encountered. Unfortunately, as I came within a few steps of cover, a single round slammed into my right side, knocking me off balance. As I fell, I felt myself losing consciousness.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I came to I don't know how long later, lying on my face, my sidearm a few feet in front of me, my entire body aching. Struggling to rise it was then that I noticed my hands were covered in puss-leaking sores. Mutator rounds!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future: 13 Ammunition Types is Ronin Arts' latest support product for use with the official future SRD. Inside the pages of this 7-page PDF, written by Philip Reed, are two PL 6 ammunition types, five PL 7 ammunition types, five PL 8 ammunition types, and one PL 9 ammunition type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific ammunition types in this PDF are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Duralloy Flechettes&lt;br/&gt;     Photon Sheathed&lt;br/&gt;     Anti-Robot&lt;br/&gt;     Charged&lt;br/&gt;     Cyber Disruptor&lt;br/&gt;     Inertial Accelerator&lt;br/&gt;     Laser Prick&lt;br/&gt;     Brainlock&lt;br/&gt;     Cryonic&lt;br/&gt;     Crystal Carbon&lt;br/&gt;     Nova&lt;br/&gt;     Psionic&lt;br/&gt;     Mutator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this PDF includes a new robot accessory, a cybernetic gadget, and an armor gadget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
