			<description>Cooperative game in which the players try to close three zoo gates to prevent the tiger and her cub from escaping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die for movement and a color die to determine which way the tiger moves. Each player has 2 pawns and you can always move your pawn either direction, so a player has four choices of possible moves with each roll. It takes two pawns to close a gate, but players can collaborate to close a gate. The tiger is moved to a gate. Once a gate is closed, the tigers will never move toward it.&lt;br/&gt;The mother tiger is trying to find her child and she moves automaticly each turn towards an open gate.  When the mother tiger finds her cub, the players lose the game. When the players close the gates on time, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
