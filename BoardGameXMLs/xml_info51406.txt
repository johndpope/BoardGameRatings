			<description>Sourcebook of additional character and combat options for Exalted, first edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover: &lt;br/&gt;Until five short years ago, the Realm was the undisputed ruler of Creation. The only ones still willing to argue the point were hill-men savages and the glorified bandits that populate the Scavenger Lands. The Empress had it all, a never-ending reign. And then, she vanished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, it seems like the Realm&amp;rsquo;s dominion is nothing but a fading memory. The world tears itself apart. Great powers come out of hiding in the Empress&amp;rsquo; absence. The dead have destroyed a city in the East, and the Realm&amp;rsquo;s armies marched to defeat against the Bull of the North. Every kingdom is full of war profiteers and prophets of woe. An age of war approaches with the certainty of an onrushing storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a mortal in the Age of Sorrows, you must survive as best you can in a time of warring heroes. As the world trembles on the eve of the Time of Tumult, you must find your way without special might or wisdom. Will you rise to defend your ideals or merely seek to survive? What stories will they tell of you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Exalted Players Guide is intended to supplement the rules of the main Exalted book. It adds new options for character creation, enhances the original combat system, provides rules for mass combat, allows for new character types and generally expands upon the main Exalted rules to make them more complete. Each of the following chapters may have something to add to your game. Evaluate each of them, go over them with your players, and if you all agree, then integrate them into your game. In many cases, such as for Merits and Flaws, it may be best to wait until everyone makes new characters or someone else begins storytelling to integrate the changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter One: Merits and Flaws details Merits and Flaws, special Traits that some characters possess and others do not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Two: The God-Blooded contains comprehensive rules for portraying those individuals touched by the divine through their lineage or the use of certain powerful divine blessings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Three: Mortal Thaumaturgy covers the intricacies of mortal magic. Frail though it is, mortal magical workings are one of the few sources of might available to the unExalted, and thaumaturgy has a powerful impact on the day-to-day life of the average inhabitant of Creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Four: The Dragon Kings provides rules for playing the prehuman masters of Creation, the saurian Dragon Kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Five: The Exalted contains the Mail and Steel mass-combat rules and the Exalted Power Combat combat-system enhancements, and it details the learning and practice of the supernatural martial arts among all the Exalted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appendix: Writing in the Age of Sorrows includes guides to writing in two of the alphabets of Creation and a short essay on writing in the Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
