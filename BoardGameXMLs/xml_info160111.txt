			<description>&amp;quot;Story of Seasons, known in Japan as Bokujō Monogatari: Tsunagaru Shin Tenchi (牧場物語 つながる新天地) is a farming simulation video game developed by Marvelous Entertainment for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released in Japan on February 27, 2014 and it will be localized by Xseed Games for North American release in 2014. The game will not be under the Harvest Moon title in North America due to Natsume's ownership of the intellectual property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows along the same lines as the rest of the series, in which the player takes on the role of a farmer. This includes producing crops and raising livestock. Story of Seasons introduces new characters, including a tiny goddess and a tiny witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main feature of the game is connectivity according to Yasuhiro Wada, the producer of the Harvest Moon series. Players will be selling their crop and dairy products to other 'countries' in the game via a Trade Station. Some countries prefer one type of item over another, and may have to travel to the other countries to make deliveries. Personal farm data can be swapped with other players using Street Pass.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Story of Seasons&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
