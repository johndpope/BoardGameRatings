			<description>A Strategic Game of Aerial Dragon Combat&lt;br/&gt;Blood poured from a ragged wound in his neck and his wings were frozen and sluggish from Syrinaxx&amp;rsquo;s icy breath, but Ulmasaur drove himself onward.  The frost dragon&amp;rsquo;s wingbeats thrummed behind him, relentlessly matching each maneuver as they banked around a mountain. But Syrinaxx had grown overconfident and Ulmasaur climbed, twisted and flipped in an unexpected wing over to arrive directly behind the white dragon and a vicious bite delivers a final mortal wound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vile smirk splits his maw as the white dragon plummets into the mist below, but victory is short lived, as the full bulk of the gigantic Lavendros collides mid-air with the black scaled Ulmasaur as they lock claws and tumble earthward - wings, gore and fangs in a deadly embrace.  The wind screams as they bite and rend one another, but as the ground rushes at them there is no hope for Ulmasaur, who takes the full brunt of the crash beneath the bulk of Lavendros.  The big dragon sniffs the corpse below him once before bellowing a victorious roar and taking wing, he is battered and broken but the skies are his and his alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview of Play&lt;br/&gt;In SkyWar Dragon, Each player controls a mighty dragon embroiled in a battle for supremacy in the skies. Players will play Flight Cards to maneuver on the board and gain position over their opponents so that they may then play damaging Attack Cards.  Flight Cards modify your Evasion and Combat, so careful section of the right card at the right time is essential to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
