			<description>A card game based on the rise of ancient civilizations. The cards represent Advancements, Cities, Leaders, Wonders, and Events. The players build Cities and Wonders, establish trade (to gain Advancements held by opponents), and start wars. The possibility of catastrophic events always looms in the background. The object of the game is to have the most Victory Points after the deck has been gone through twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
