			<description>The DD35 Demonstrator pack, which requires the Union Pacific DD35 Add-On to use, enables you to drive the Gp35 and DD35 as they appeared in 1963 when being demonstrated on various railroads but only Union Pacific and Southern Pacific took on the units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DD35 was a cabless booster (B unit) locomotive that consisted of two GP35 prime movers and electrical systems, mounted on a common frame and covered with a single cowling, riding on a pair of 4-axle Flexicoil trucks. As such, each prime mover powered a single set of four axles instead of two sets of two axles, as in the GP35.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Number board lights&lt;br/&gt;    Class lights&lt;br/&gt;    Step lights&lt;br/&gt;    Cab and instrument lighting&lt;br/&gt;    Animated doors, windows and cab mirrors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
