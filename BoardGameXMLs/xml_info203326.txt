							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Co.: Expandable Card Game</name>
									
			<description>War Co. is an expandable card game with a simple objective: be the last person standing. A player must make his or her opponent(s) run out of cards. All players start with 50 cards in their deck. There are three broad ways to win: attack aggressively to make players discard faster, play defensively and wait for the opportune time to make moves, and trick opponents with dangerous traps and combos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can only play five cards at a time. They must discard a card from their hand every turn. All cards consume energy, and players must decide how to allocate energy use since stronger and more versatile cards use more energy. Cards can be played facedown and turned face-up at any time. When turned facedown to face-up, card effects immediately take place, giving the player the element of surprise. Facedown cards do not use energy, allowing players to save energy until needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Co. is a dystopian sci-fi game set in the year 2796. After three hundred years with no war, most weapon manufacturing corporations had been restructured or dissolved. Only one global weapon producer had survived the Era of Peace &amp;ndash; the War Machines Company. Isolated skirmishes evolved into the War of 2620, and the War Machines Company profited by selling dangerous machines and technologies to wounded societies. Both of the multinational governments, in an attempt to preserve their own residents, purchased weapons faster than they could afford to spend money. Eventually, both multinational governments ran out of money and started purchasing the weapons with food, water, land, and sources of energy. Several decades later, small and isolated groups of people must survive at any cost, using the remaining artifacts of a war from the distant past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
