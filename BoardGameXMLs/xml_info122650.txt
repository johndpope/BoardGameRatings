			<description>You're about to embark on the greatest adventure of your life.  You will have the chance to become one of six of the most unbelievable characters you will ever meet.  You become the owner of a highly technical fleet of trucks, with a dealer network worldwide.  Now you will find out if you have what it takes to be a real...&amp;quot;Gear Jammer&amp;quot;.  A gear jammer is a trucker/owner that is prepared to take the chance....challenge and risk to become the most successful on the board game of...Gear Jammers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:  To see who can run the most successful trucking business...based on a combination of companies owned, trucks on the road and cash on hand.  To do this, you will want to buy all the trucks you can buy, invest in companies that are going places, and hope you won't get stuck with too many accidents, losses or heavy costs.  &lt;br/&gt;What makes Gear Jammers really fun are all the chances you  take in hopes of collecting some profits.  You may run into a truck stop that means you miss a couple of turns!  We say &amp;quot;Go for the profits anyway!&amp;quot;.  If you own a fleet of trucks (and the value cards in your favour) you could be the ultimate winner of the game.  But don't count on a thing until the timer goes off.  Just when you think you've got the game in the bag, your old trucking buddy may land on a &amp;quot;Price and Profit!&amp;quot; card - and turn the whole game around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start your engines....roll out your trucks and begin driving on the highway to success....if you dare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
