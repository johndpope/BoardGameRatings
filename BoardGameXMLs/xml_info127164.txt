							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Prince&#039;s Quest</name>
									
			<description>A fairy-tale journey for up to six Princes. It is a familiar Game of Goose type game, where you make your way along the track, obeying special square instructions should you land on one. It does have some innovations. Princes all start on different tracks at first for instance. And it has special rules for negotiating certain paths and, unusually, a river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large lithographed board is very nicely illustrated. Sadly, no publisher wanted to identify himself with the game, nor is an artist credited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE NEW GAME&lt;br/&gt;PRINCE&amp;rsquo;S QUEST&lt;br/&gt;(PROTECTED).&lt;br/&gt;This Game depicts 6 Princes in search of a Princess.&lt;br/&gt;The various experiences of the Princes on their journeys embody the chief events culled from all the best known Fairy Tales.&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS.&lt;br/&gt;1.&amp;mdash;Any number up to the number of Princes can play. The choice of Roads to be determined by lots.&lt;br/&gt;2.&amp;mdash;Players start at the Milestone and proceed, in turn, along their respective roads, according to the throw of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;3.&amp;mdash; When a player falls on a division coloured a little heavier than the road, this is either an advantage or penalty, and directions will be found near the illustration bearing the number of the division.&lt;br/&gt;4.&amp;mdash; When the end of a Road is reached, the player goes on to the next as indicated on the board.&lt;br/&gt;5.&amp;mdash; The Road of Fortune must only be taken when the Fairy Godmother is met with, and must be again left if the division a piece falls on indicates it. The River of Darkness must be left as soon as a Landing Place is touched.&lt;br/&gt;6&amp;mdash; If a piece falls on a division already occupied, the pieces change places.&lt;br/&gt;7.&amp;mdash; The player who reaches No. 200 first is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;British Manufacture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
