			<description>A Runequest Adventure&lt;br/&gt;This adventure, although designed to be compatible with all Runequest items, is independent from and not set in the world of Glorontha(sic).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a set of Runequest scenarios and background information suitable for a wide range of characters.  Characters ranging in ability from newly rolled to nearing Rune Status can be included in the adventures without too much difficulty.  However it is recommended that neither Rune Lords nor Rune Priests be used as they would have a strong tendency to overwhelm the opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The booklet is set up to give the referee a choice in its use.  Three separate scenarios are included and with proper use of imagination by the referee more can easily be constructed.  Of course, the referee is free to ignore all the scenarios and just use this booklet as a source of pre-rolled monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several references to otherwise undescribed cults in this product.  A complete description of these cults can be found in Cults of Prax (published by The CHAOSium).  Note, however, that while Cults of Prax would be useful to the referee it is not necessary to play this product.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
