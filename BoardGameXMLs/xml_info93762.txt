But someone must banish the evil stalking the Haunted Tower. Can your people survive its terrors to win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new entry-level supplement to the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS game lets you and your friends take your characters face to face with danger and the undead in a huge, haunted castle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start an adventure today!&lt;br/&gt;For 2 or more players ages 11 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this box you'll find agiant-sized, three-part adventure, featuring three of the most powerful undead monsters. But before you and your friends can confront  fearsome mummy, a ghostly specter, or a gruesome vampire, your characters must first fight off the many skeletons, zombies, and ghouls that guard their haunted home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fright-filled adventure is separated into three parts, each with its own full-color map.
