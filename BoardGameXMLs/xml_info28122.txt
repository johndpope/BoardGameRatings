			<description>Counter-Ploy is composed of three different board games of skill, strategy and international power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1 is a military game in which each player owns certain countries with Army Divisions and Navy Fleets to defend these countries and conquer others. Military pieces are moved about the board(map of the world)to attack enemies and defend countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2 concentrates on diplomatic strategy. No military pieces are used, yet countries must be defended against capture. Players try to acquire necessities such as, agriculture, gold, industry and oil. Players must skillfully negotiate with each other in order to increase the assets of their countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game three puts it all together by combining the military strategy of game 1 with the diplomatic skills of game 2 to produce the ultimate game of dictators, kings, and presidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
