							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Stones River</name>
									
			<description>The Battle of Stones River is a simulation of the battle of Murfreesboro in the American Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a fairly standard system reminiscent of SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) quads of the period.  The rules do have a few points of distinction.  For example, units have a stacking limit of two, and cannot attack on the same turn that a stack is created, so building up a concentrated assault takes time.  The advanced rules add different movement rules for different unit types and introduce battles which can continue over more than one turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is most notable for its map, which is full-color and mounted - highly unusual for a small wargame company at the time.  The map is 21.5&amp;quot;x22.5&amp;quot;.  Besides the map, two rules booklets, and a die, the game contains 110 counters, of which 41 are blanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
