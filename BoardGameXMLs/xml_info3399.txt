							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SeaNochle</name>
									
			<description>SeaNochle is based on the classic American game of Pinochle. With this deck, the highly acclaimed strategy game has been redesigned with an ocean themed twist, and the rules provided are for 2 through 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SeaNochle consists of the traditional 48 card &amp;quot;pinochle&amp;quot; deck (with new suits - shells, seahorses, starfish, and fish) with mermaids and mermen serving as the royal cards. There are also BONUS Shark and Shrimp cards that act as ultimate trump and junk cards, respectively, which add a unique twist to the game. Also included is a game board and playing pieces to easily keep track of the score. &lt;br/&gt;The new look makes it a fun game for adults and the whole family alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
