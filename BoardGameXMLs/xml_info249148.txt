			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for something to spice up long stretches of travel? Want to give your players a break from your main plot between adventures? If so, then you'll love The Hangman's Due, first in the &amp;quot;On the Road&amp;quot; line of adventures designed to be seamlessly inserted into any campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A weary traveller hires your group to protect him on the road. Trouble is, it's not just the usual bandits and monsters he's worried about, and your heroes soon find themselves deciding the outcome of a dark tale of witchcraft and murder. Where will they draw the line between justice and vengeance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure provides roughly four hours of suspense for a party between 3rd and 5th level. It includes stats for all monsters used in the adventure and one battle map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
