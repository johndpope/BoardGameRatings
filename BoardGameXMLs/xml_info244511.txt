							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bard is a performer; a minstrel, jongleur, poet, and storyteller all rolled into one. Bards are able to cast spells through their songs, and have some skill at thievery as well. In addition, they are, or can become, repositories of lore and languages, picking up snippets of odd knowledge here and there in the form of rhymes, songs, legends, etc., which may become useful in the most unexpected of circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you need a stand-alone bard class for your Old School game? Are you playing a Bard and want a quick reference book for the table without having to flip through the entire Players Manual? Curious about Adventures Dark and Deep and want to take a look without diving in all the way? Here's your chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bard is a complete player class suitable for use with any old-school game. It's an extract from the Adventures Dark and Deep Players Manual, and contains the full class description plus all the spells available to the bard class (including a ton of new spells unique to the class).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you already own the Adventures Dark and Deep Players Manual, you don't technically need this pdf. But it can be pretty handy to have a quick reference guide that gives all the essentials in one place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
