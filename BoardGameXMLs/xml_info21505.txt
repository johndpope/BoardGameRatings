							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lawsuit!</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;Lawsuit! is an educational game for adults and children ages 6 and up. Players experience and learn about the law as they make their way through law school, past the bar exam and into their own law practice and the courtroom.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;The board is divided into 62 spaces. Players proceed through law school; the nitty gritty of running a law practice (hiring a secretary, paying office rent); and the ups and downs of bringing a case (preparing papers for court, going to trial). Players also land on spaces, where they are directed to pick cards describing all sorts of interesting and amusing (and family-friendly) case scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a card is chosen, a player must decide whether to accept the result or appeal it. On an appeal, a player may double or even triple his award -- or lose some or even all of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of advancing when it's their turn, players may also choose to settle a case by drawing a Settlement card. Like appealing, settling a case can result in gaining -- or losing -- part or all of one's winnings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also double the stakes by buying into a partnership. All awards and costs are doubled for partners. Whether or not to become a partner is therefore a key strategic decision, and adds to the suspense and intrigue, as everyone wonders whether it will pay to have become one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
