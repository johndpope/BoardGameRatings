							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Nieuport 11</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nieuport 11 &amp;ldquo;B&amp;eacute;b&amp;eacute;&amp;rdquo; was a French single seat fighter aircraft. Reaching the front in early 1916, it outclassed its German opponent, the Fokker Eindecker. It ended the dominance of German aviation, known as the &amp;ldquo;Fokker Scourge,&amp;rdquo; and gave air superiority to France during the battle of Verdun. The Nieuport 11 performed well in combat thanks to its excellent inherent speed, rate&amp;ndash;of&amp;ndash;climb, and agility. This successful airplane, however, had one limitation &amp;ndash; its lack of a synchronized machine gun, which hampered its offensive capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nieuport 11 (Chaput)&lt;br/&gt;A French ace credited with 16 victories, Jean Chaput was renowned for his audacity and &amp;lsquo;sang-froid&amp;rsquo; and was awarded with the L&amp;eacute;gion d&amp;rsquo;Honneur for his achievements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nieuport 11 (De Turenne)&lt;br/&gt;Armand de Turenne, a cavalryman before entering the French air force, proved himself a true &amp;ldquo;knight of the air,&amp;rdquo; sharing his victories with no less than 15 other pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nieuport 11 (Ancillotto)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Giannino&amp;rdquo; Ancillotto is part of Italian aviation history for his 11 victories, including three balloons shot down with his rocket&amp;ndash;armed aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each WW1 Wings of Glory&amp;reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
