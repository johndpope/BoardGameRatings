			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Constructs brings you a dozen and one manufactured monsters, from classical foes like the clerical clay golem to the statuesque stone golem and the invincible iron golem, as well as natural constructs like frigid ice golem and the lumbering wood golem. Constructs go far beyond golems, however, and this book brings you a pair of pitiless and tireless hunters in the tiny iron cobra and the titanic retriever, each relentless and deadly in its own way, though these mechanical marvels are dwarfed by the colossal clockwork goliath. The beautiful caryatid column is perfect in its form and in its fighting, while the scarecrow is barely held together yet possessed of a malign and fearsome will that brings a transfixing terror to those who must face it. A construct need not be entirely lifeless, as a homunculus is brought into being from a spellcaster's own blood and spirit. Some constructs, however, take on more of a life of their own, being worshiped at times as idols or becoming fonts of sacrifice, like the towering and terrible wickerman. To this collection of constructs CR 2 to 23, we present the weirdling wheeled phantasmagoria wagon, a living construct borne of the fey realms and carrying a universe of psychedelic horror and reality-warping strangeness wherever it roams. As if this were not enough, we also bring you mythic spells and rules for making and mastering mythic constructs of your very own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
