							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lunar Flight</name>
									
			<description>A modern take on the classic arcade game, Lunar Lander, Lunar Flight extends the experience to a fully, fictionalised Lunar Module Simulator providing a variety of mission types involving Transporting Cargo, Acquiring Data at Survey locations and locating Lost Cargo. Completing missions earns experience points and money to be used to Refuel, Repair and Upgrade the Lunar Module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to missions there are Time Trial challenges complete with Online Leader boards and a globally ranked &amp;lsquo;Pilots&amp;rsquo; Leaderboard, ranked by experience.To round out the game there are a variety of Achievements to provide additional challenges and objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A truly unique and challenging flight simulation experience, Lunar Flight will give you many hours of immersive, addictive &amp;amp; rewarding gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lunar Flight features very atmospheric sound and visuals, creating a very immersive experience and is designed to engage the player&amp;rsquo;s senses as well as their appreciation for realistic physics. Fans of space flight will be pleased to know that it futures proper Newtonian physics behaviour and will provide one of the most authentic and dynamic space based, low gravity flight experiences they can have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While being simulation oriented it is also designed to be accessible and fun and supports the XBox 360 controller by default but can be configured with almost any controller setup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
