			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masks is a mash-up game that takes a well known out-of-print super-hero game and a more modern super-hero game and blends them together the rules for the two games together, using the best elements of each system. For legal reasons, neither of the games can be named anywhere within this site or within Masks itself. However, this doesn't matter. If you know the games then you will pretty much instantly recognise them, and if you don't know the games then it doesn't matter - you can play Masks on its own merits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masks covers all types of hero from the lowest powered street-hero to the most powerful cosmic entity, and its mechanics (the &amp;quot;CHASING&amp;quot; system) can also be used for playing in other RPG genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character sheets for Masks are included in the book itself, and can be easily printed from the PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
