							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Waterloo Squares</name>
									
			<description>Waterloo Squares is 2-player entry-level wargame of the battle of Waterloo 1815 played on a map which represents the historical battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player assumes the role of Napoleon and takes command of the French, the other player represents the Wellington/Bl&amp;uuml;cher combination and will command the Allies (British, Dutch/Belgian, minor German states and Prussian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Light Blue and Dark Blue counters represent the French forces, the Grey counters the Prussians and the Red counters all the other Allied forces. All counters contain information denoting their type (infantry or cavalry), combat strength and historical designation - which is only used during setup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is divided into 100 squares, each of a single terrain type - Clear, Woods or Buildings - each of which has a somewhat different effect on movement and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each square can only contain a single counter. Movement and combat between units is regulated and triggered by playing cards from a personal deck which can be manipulated according to a player's chosen strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns until one player achieves one of his victory conditions at which point the game ends and he's declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
