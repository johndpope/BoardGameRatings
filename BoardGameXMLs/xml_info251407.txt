			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rewrite is a compilation of house rules that I have found to work very well. Some of these come from other editions of the game while others came from magazines or fellow players. This summary is not all-inclusive, there will be many changes that I did not thing of including in the following list that did make it into the final document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the biggest changes involves armor class and to-hit rolls. These were ported from 4th edition (I never used 3e or 3.5e, so they may have appeared earlier). Armor class now starts at 10 (clothing) and goes up, with 18 being plate mail &amp;amp; shield. To-hit rolls likewise changed to fit the new AC system. A complete explanation can be found in the respective sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Class restrictions have changed along with multi-class options. These are more clearly defined than the original works were. Humans now have the ability to multi-class and demi-humans do not have any level restrictions (though these are still in place for NPC&amp;rsquo;s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alignment tongue has been removed as a language since it has no realistic equivalent that I can find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New player races have been added &amp;ndash; particularly the satyr. Along with new classes, the bard class has been revamped into a playable class and converted to a thief subclass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initiative goes by segments, instead of by sides and ranges are given in feet (not the confusing &amp;ldquo;inch&amp;rdquo; system, where 6&amp;rdquo; meant 60&amp;rsquo; indoors and 60 yards outdoors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
