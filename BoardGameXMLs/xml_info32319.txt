			<description>Club 3 was first published as game in the magazine in &amp;quot;WIN&amp;quot; #45, the zine of the &amp;quot;Spielekreis Wien&amp;quot; in Austria. It was published in the Swiss gaming zine &amp;quot;AHA&amp;quot; two months later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is somehow a derivate of Poker - with less cards, less combinations, but more interactions between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck consists of only 24 cards; 4 suits of 6 cards, numbered from 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only 3 combinations with a little strange names: &lt;br/&gt;- Wortklauberei (logomachy): 2 cards with numbers directly adjacent each other&lt;br/&gt;- Redeschwall (flood of words): 2 cards with the same numbers&lt;br/&gt;- Phasendreschen (to rant): 2 cards, 1 showing an &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, the other a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round is played with 4 cards per player; there is no possibility to exchange any of them. The first player, who thinks he has a good hand, starts the game by playing 1 card and any number of chips on it. This bet can be attacked by any player. The attacker can choose, if he wants to attack alone or with the help of another player. That means, that the original better can be forced to play against 2 players! An important restriction is, that a maximum of 3 cards can be used on each side, which would form 1 or 2 combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a preassigned time and the player with the most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
