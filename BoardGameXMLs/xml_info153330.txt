							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spiritual Warfare: Fantasy Mahjong</name>
									
			<description>An ancient curse has been broken and 4 Elemental Spirits escaped, taking possession of 4 mortals turning them into powerful Demigods. Each Demigod took control of one element -  Air, Earth, Fire and Water.  Not content with what they have, the Demigods plotted against each other. They recruited 3 classes to do their bidding: The Angels, the Undead and the Demons, starting an arms race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to be the first to build an army and raid your opponent. The stronger your army the more Spirit coins or Skull Counters you can loot. SNATCH, KIDNAP and AMBUSH your opponents' troops. Use strategy to deter your opponent from forming an army. A game of strategy, skill and an element of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a spin-off from the traditional Mahjong by incorporating new symbols, rules and storyline we hope to allow more people to enjoy this century year old game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
