							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mara und der Feuerbringer: Das Kartenspiel</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The world threatens to sink into the dark and everything still between her and Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods, is, you are. Uses as your visionary skills, transgress with the gods in contact and find them, to bring them back to their homeland. Yet all is not lost! But be careful, the gods do not act entirely altruistic. They will try to influence you with deceit and cunning to get at your rune stones and fight hostile gods. Help your clan to strengthen their claim to the throne of Asgard and place the world order restored-because everything depends on you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Mara und der Feuerbringer: Das Kartenspiel (&amp;quot;Mara and the Fire Bringer: The Card Game&amp;quot;) you embark into the mystical world Maras and the Nordic Germanic mythology. 2-4 players are stalwarts and assume the role of a Sp&amp;aacute;kona and try to stop Ragnarok and to help their respective clan to the throne of Asgard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to collect the most victory point with his cards on the table, victory points stack and rune stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory points can be gained by playing your own authority cards, but also by stealing opponent cards and rune stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as the first player has 14 victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with playing their first mythological place open. Afterwards, each player in turn takes on one of the four stacks in the middle of the table, chooses three more cards in hand (without changing the order of cards in the stack) and then puts back these. Now, each player has five cards in his hand and a mythological place in front of him. It is not allowed to have more than 5 cards in hand. This hand limit, however, can be increased by certain card abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played as round clockwise. Each turn consists of four phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Energy Phase&lt;br/&gt;2. Expansion phase&lt;br/&gt;3. Action &amp;amp; Combat Phase&lt;br/&gt;4. Draw cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
