			<description>Welcomes to the slums where Mob bosses reign supreme! Can you take over enough territories to be the top boss?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;Take over territories by playing cards that represent henchmen, mercenaries and bribes. The card with the highest point value wins the battle... or bribe your way to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henchmen are your foot soldiers. While they aren't always the strongest card, they are the most loyal and cannot be bribed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenaries are the ace up your sleeve, the strongest henchman. They can do any job or take care of any problem for the right price!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Judge and the DA cannot be bribed. With this powerful card, you can immediately seize a territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use money cards to bribe henchmen and pay mercenaries. Sometimes it only takes a little cash to get what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mob Boss are powerful cards that can defeat most other cards but must remain out of play for a turn after use. Beware, if your Mob Boss is defeated in a fight, you lose the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO WIN&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to collect a predetermined amount of territories to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
