			<description>Promenade is a dance-themed, temporary-partnership indie card game. Players are dealt cards numbered 1-6 and colored black or white. Each dance, players form couples of two by playing cards face down, then revealing them, while trying to synch their play as well as possible. To facilitate this, you get to look at your partner's hand for 30 seconds before each dance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The closer the players are in played numbers, the better, but depending on whether the cards are black or white, the couple will perform a certain series of dance steps (walk, turn or sway), which earns them a differing number of points, depending on what the current dance is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
