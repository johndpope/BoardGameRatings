			<description>The alien enemies came from distant stars; they were like insects in a metal shell! They were hiding on the dark side of the Moon, waiting for the teleportation and the occupation of our Earth! An artifact which Gear Guns Squad managed to get hold of was the source of energy for the teleportation. The primary goal of the squad is to destroy the alien enemies on the Earth and destroy the teleport on the Moon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your main task is to defend the Earth against an all-out alien invasion. Using alien beacons, the enemies are trying to call the prime evil. The player will have to capture the enemy beacons during a certain time period. To stop the alien invasion, keep the enemy beacon before its destruction. In the Survival Mode you will also face the progress of enemies, different enemy bases, bonuses for destroying enemies, battles with huge bosses, and etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
