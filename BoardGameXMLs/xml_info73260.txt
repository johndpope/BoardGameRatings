							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sonic Heroes</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Sonic Heroes is a platforming video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, developed by Sonic Team USA and released in 2003 and 2004 for multiple platforms. The game follows four teams of three characters, each of which has a unique subplot, and as Doctor Eggman begins another attempt at global domination, each team follows a separate path to stop him. This game differs from other Sonic games by allowing the player to take control of each of three characters of a particular team, each member of which has a unique ability, that of speed, power, or flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title received mixed to good reviews, according to games aggregates websites. Positive points noted include a gameplay style similar to the series' 2D roots, and the game's vibrant environments and graphics; negative points raised include the camera system, some level design issues, and the game's voice acting. Nevertheless, the game sold well, and entered the &amp;quot;best-sellers&amp;quot; series for each of its respective consoles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sonic_Heroes,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
