			<description>The original jackpot game - J&amp;auml;nnitt&amp;auml;v&amp;auml; kasinopeli (&amp;quot;An exciting casino game&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The deck of cards has 4 suits - triangle, circle, square and star, which also appear on the dice - as well as empties and various special cards. The idea is to roll the 3 dice and to follow up with cards from your hand to make point-scoring series; for example, 3 triangles from the dice followed by 3 triangles from your hand scores 10 points. Triangle and circle are 'normal' suits while star is a kind of joker suit in that it can be combined with the other suits as well as stars, and the square is a negative suit but only if you get 3 of them on the dice; the other players can then follow with more squares from their hand to give you more negative points. There are also 9 different special cards which allow you to steal points from other players, change the direction of play, etc., while the empties are only there to mess up your hand. The board has slots for each player's point card and players use the transparent chips to keep track of their scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first to score 100 points or win the game directly by getting the Jackpot ie. 3 stars from the Pop-O-Matic followed by 3 stars from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;     1 plastic gameboard with Pop-O-Matic dice roller&lt;br/&gt;     150 cards&lt;br/&gt;     8 transparent plastic chips&lt;br/&gt;     4 point cards&lt;br/&gt;     4 point tables&lt;br/&gt;     Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
