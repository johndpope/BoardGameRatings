			<description>J.S. Joust is a local multiplayer no-graphics contact sport video game created by Douglas Wilson. The objective of the game is to be the last man standing. This is done by players trying to cause a rapid motion in their opponent's controller: a PlayStation Move. During the game, music from Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg concertos is played at a slow tempo. In relation to a player being knocked out, there is a tolerance of motion the controller will allow that is linked to the speed of the music. As the speed of the music increases, so does the motion tolerance, which allows players to move more rapidly without setting off their controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Johann Sebastian Joust&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
