							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psy High</name>
									
			<description>When the kids at your high school start developing psychic powers, you and your friends must team up to stop the principal from taking over the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psy High is an interactive teen supernatural mystery novel by Rebecca Slitt, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based&amp;mdash;without graphics or sound effects&amp;mdash;and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as male or female; gay, straight, or bi. Will you be a jock or a brain? Popular or ignored? Use your psychic powers to help others, or to take what you want. Win a coveted scholarship, star in the Drama Club play - or lose it all and spend your senior year in juvenile detention. How much are you willing to sacrifice to get ahead in the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you solve the case? Can you save the school? And most importantly, can you find a date to the prom?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
