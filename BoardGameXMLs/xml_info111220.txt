							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Smithy Tile Set</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly redesigned! The Smithy (or Warehouse) Tile set came about with the revelation that many of us in our local group could not draw on a mat. The players were having a hard time telling what each item within the dungeon was. So we designed these to distinctly show off the different items within your average warehouse. After all many adventures lead the PCs to a warehouse, where they are inevitably ambushed. Using these tiles to layout the warehouse, can allow everyone to see what they can and cannot see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smithy Tiles are lightweight, store in very little space, durable, and quick to set up. When you're done, just scoop them into a box or bag and you're ready to go. Perfect for convention gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2x Anvil&lt;br/&gt;Fireplace&lt;br/&gt;4x Barrel&lt;br/&gt;4x Hay bale &lt;br/&gt;4x Barrels&lt;br/&gt;4x Junk Pile &lt;br/&gt;4x Chest&lt;br/&gt;4x Weapon rack &lt;br/&gt;6x Crate&lt;br/&gt;2x Workbench&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
