			<description>Praktika is a cooperative game for &amp;quot;adult or fairly adult&amp;quot; players that bills itself as &amp;quot;the only useful social game&amp;quot;. The goal is to get the playing piece to the end of the Snakes and Ladders-esque board and communally answer trivia questions to avoid getting penalty tokens that might end the game in a loss. Some questions have no clear-cut answers and players are encouraged to discuss freely (and even disregard the answers given if they disagree with them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a translated and adapted version of the Canadian game Untrivia by Jim Deacove. In addition to including legal, historical and social questions appropriate for a Swedish context, the layout of the board is different and the categories for questions are fewer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
