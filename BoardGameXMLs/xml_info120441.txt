			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you see all the crime and evil that goes on, you have to wonder, why hasn't anyone tried to be a superhero before? It seems so easy. You just make a suit (with a mask of course), get some kind of weapon, and go beat up some bad guys. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get some chicks too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few of problems though. First of all, in real life the bad guys are really fucking bad. They're evil fuckers who kill people, and they're not afraid of any wannabe superheroes, and they never will be unless someone manages to make them afraid. Second, being a vigilante isn't exactly legal, and the police will be looking for you too. Lastly, anyone crazy enough to wear spandex and fight bad guys in real life probably isn't going to be all that competent or stable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
