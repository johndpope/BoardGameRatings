			<description>A very special game edited during the promotional campaign for the political elections in the German State of Hessen in 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a giveaway of the political party of the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) trying to contain some humour against their main opposition, the SPD (Social-Democratic Party of Germany).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a variant of Hoffmanns game JAG UND SCHLAG (Tally Ho).&lt;br/&gt;Thus the rules a rather similar: All the cards are spread out randomly over the board, backside up.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn turns a card over, no more altering its position on an ordinary square.&lt;br/&gt;Each card depicts an arrow, in which direction this card can capture a weaker opponent, if possible.&lt;br/&gt;Each card can travel along the lines as far as the player chooses.&lt;br/&gt;Special rules: In the large cities of Hessen (yellow squares with a red border)the direction of the arrow can be altered.&lt;br/&gt;The large cities can also be captured and if occupied at the end of the game count extra points printed on the board, in addition to each captured card during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very good variant with the extra spice of the large city rules which make play very differently to Tally Ho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also an extra bonus: All the graphics are from Hoffmann himself !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
