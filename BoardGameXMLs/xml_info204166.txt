			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is with sincere joy and trepidation that I welcome you into the Five Orders of the Garden. My joy comes from the pleasure in welcoming another who will worship the glory and wonder of the Creator and His Garden. My trepidation comes from the knowledge that you are no ordinary brother or sister, and that your role will be more dangerous than others. Yet together, we shall worship the Creator by protecting the relics He chose to survive into our time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you have taken this role willingly, we still feel the need to thank you for your sacrifice. You have turned away from a life of simple contemplation and adoration in favor of risk and conflict. Please know that you will be in our daily prayers and that we truly appreciate your work for the Creator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will face many trials. Always keep the truth in your mind and heart: the Five Orders were granted dominion over the relics of the Garden by the Creator. Others may steal them for their selfish purposes, but only we have a divine claim to the relics. That is why you are a claimant; you carry our rightful claim to the enemies of the Creator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On behalf of the Ecumenical Council, may the Light of the Garden bring you consistent fortune, health, and success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
