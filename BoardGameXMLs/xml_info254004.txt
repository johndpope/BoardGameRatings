			<description>A Math-Centered Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ways and Means, 1935 is an in-class role-playing game meant for Quantitative Literacy/Quantitative Reasoning classes. Students debate various social insurance policies (pensions, disability, unemployment, aid to widows &amp;amp; orphans, and health care) in their roles as members of the US House of Representatives. It is meant to occupy two weeks of class time, one for preparation and one for role-playing (with a spacer week or two on some other topics between them), while using many skills and concepts from earlier in the class.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The instructor&amp;rsquo;s manual for this game is divided into [this] public half and a non-public half. The [public half] material...will not give any large advantage to any students who discover it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
