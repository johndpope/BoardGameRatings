			<description>There has been a robbery! Search the board to find where in Helsinki the robber has hidden the stolen hands of the railway station clock. Get to know the attractions of the Finnish Capital and their location while learning how to read map and coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game consists of 24 different cases to investigate. On their turn, the players roll two dice to determine the coordinates and move their pawn on the board accordingly. Each location on board has one of four different symbols which determines the action the player is allowed to perform to collect clues about the location of the stolen item. The game ends when one of the players guesses the location of the item correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
