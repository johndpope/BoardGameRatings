			<description>&amp;quot;Incunabula is a 1984 computer game by Avalon Hill. It was designed by Steve Estvanik. It is the original computerized version of Avalon Hill's Civilization board game. It was eclipsed by Sid Meier's much more successful Civilization, and its following series, released in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay loosely follows the rules of Avalon Hill's Civilization board game. It consists of three type of &amp;quot;scenarios&amp;quot;, Incunabula, Imperium, and Traders. Incunabula resembles the board game most. One to three players can play and the computer players can be randomly assigned basis of law and &amp;quot;personality&amp;quot;. The personalities determine how likely a computer opponent is to attack you. Personalities are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Choleric&lt;br/&gt;    * Phlematic&lt;br/&gt;    * Melancholic&lt;br/&gt;    * Sanguine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The choices for basis of law are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Theocracy&lt;br/&gt;    * Oligarchy&lt;br/&gt;    * Utopia&lt;br/&gt;    * Khanate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat follows Civilization rules with a one for one unit loss. There are no technologies to obtain but each player's progress is tracked through phases such as clan and tribe. The game is won on the basis of accumulating trade.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Incunabula (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
