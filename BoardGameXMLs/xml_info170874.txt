							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unwinnable War: 1914-1918</name>
									
			<description>It began a hundred years ago. Generals imagined it would be a quick Napoleonic-style war to settle nationalist and imperialist conflicts... but soon enough it became a nightmare. Hundreds of thousands suffered and died, as war raged for four years - from the trenches of Flanders to the steppes of Ukraine, from the mountains of the Alps to the deserts of Syria, from the depths of the ocean to the heights of the sky. No one had a clear understanding of how the war could be won. And in the end, it wasn't. It was only stopped for twenty years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unwinnable War is a block wargame for 2 to 4 players. One or two players may play either side, the Central Powers and the Entente.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is PnP, i.e. all materials are freely downloadable. However, players need to provide their own components, including the 70 wooden blocks in order to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
