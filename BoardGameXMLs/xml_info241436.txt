			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get read for an exciting trek through space.  Your mission is to rid the galaxy of Klingon warships, and to accomplish this you must use strategy to guide the starship Enterprise around stars, through space storms, and amidst enemy fire.  Sound and color enliven this action-packed version of the traditional trek game.  Nine levels of play allow the player to make the mission as easy as or challenging as he wishes.  At the highest level you are also playing against time.  Damage to your ship can be repaired in space at a cost of time and resources if you can't make it back to base.  Tari Trek gives you a lot of trek at a low price.  This program is written entirely in BASIC and requires at least 24K of user memory.  For the Atari 800 only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Fabio Ehrengruber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
