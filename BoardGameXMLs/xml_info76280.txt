			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novus Ordum Mundi is a free supplement for 7th Sea and Swashbuckling Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the file's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book in intended for Game Masters to give a background to the group known as Novus Ordum Mundi and information on using them in their campaigns. There is no information in this text for the use of players, excepting those that have an insatiable curiosity to learn about the true masters of Theah and so risk their terrible wrath. The book is split up into three main sections, the first details the history and structure of the group along with its main members, the second part details two major locations of the group and a few minor ones along with some sample plotlines, the third and final part is an essay detailing ways in which Novus Ordum Mundi can be used by Game Masters in their sessions. While a number of people appear in this book for the first time, many are old hands from the printed book line although most have had been advanced to reflect the time since their appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
