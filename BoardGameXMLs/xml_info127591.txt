			<description>Educational game, designed to teach groups how to manage the federal budget over five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not much fun here. It is extremely technical and comes with masses of forms, sheets, references, optional detail and teaching guides. Players are presented with a problem and must choose a way to improve the situation. If they are right, all well and good. If they are wrong, the results of their action are demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winning group are the ones who get the most decisions correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
