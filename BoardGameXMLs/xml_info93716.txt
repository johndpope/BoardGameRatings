			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An elemental spirit trapped by the sundering makes its home, and indeed its body, in an icy glacier of the Icewall Mountains. It has the ability to influence the weather nearby, to control the shape and flow of the glacier that is its body, and to extend its perception anywhere upon the glacier&amp;rsquo;s surface or within its depths. It perceives only cold (and its opposite) and magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small tribe of orcs attempted to camp upon the domain of this trapped spirit. It detected both the warmth of their bodies and the dark magic that infused their creation. As abominations to the natural order, it decided that they should be destroyed and, quick as thought, they were gone. The tribe was led by a powerful kurasatch udareen, however, who bore a valuable resource: an ancient and very knowledgeable lore pool. Over the last few months, her remains and gear have been frozen over into the floor of an ice tunnel, but the lore pool, which was stored in a sturdy, stone vessel, has remained intact within the pack still strapped to her rigid corpse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One important detail of its surroundings has eluded this trapped spirit, however. Many of the slain orcs have risen as Fell, who lumber and prowl throughout the spirit&amp;rsquo;s demesne yet radiate no heat. In a few cases, the corpses of a few of the undead suffered substantial bodily damage at the hands of the spirit&amp;rsquo;s wrath; these Fell do not so much prowl as lay in wait within sealed caverns for fresh meals to come to them. The spirit is blind to these malevolent creatures, so the undead share its domain unopposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the PCs. Unluckily for them, they have been discovered traveling through the coldest north by a large group of hobgoblins led by the legate S&amp;egrave;itheach, a Witch Taker and highly skilled tracker. The legate has pursued the party for days, and has finally caught up to them here, at the border of the trapped spirit&amp;rsquo;s domain. Luckily for the PCs, the spirit is no friend to evil, and they may be able to enlist its aid. Unluckily, the Fell are there to ruin everybody&amp;rsquo;s day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: A GenCon 2005 adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
