			<description>Beyond Shadowgate is a TurboGrafx CD sequel to the 1987 Mac and MacVenture Shadowgate. Unlike its predecessor, Beyond Shadowgate is a classical point-and-click adventure viewed from a platform perspective. The player controls Prince Erik, the descendant of the hero from the first game, Lord Jair. When Prince Erik returns to his home country, he finds out about his father's murder. The Prince is framed by the minister of the late king, who imprisons him where the adventure starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Shadowgate, the player must solve a series of puzzles throughout the castle in order to proceed to the end of the game. Prince Erik can move around, examine, manipulate, and take objects. Commands also allow ducking and punching. Traps and puzzles along the game may cause sudden death of the character, if the puzzles and game elements are not correctly solved. Throughout the game, the player has the opportunity to meet his untimely demise; be it at the bloodied guillotine or at the mere act of peering into a gaping hole in the wall, only to find yourself face to face with a man-eating plant. In the end, one will need a sense of patience, and a sense of humor, if they intend to see the adventure through to the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beyond Shadowgate&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
