			<description>R.A.W. - Realms of Ancient War - is the new Hack&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;Slash (action/role-playing game) from Wizarbox, developed for Xbox LIVE&amp;reg; Arcade, PlayStation&amp;reg; Network and PC Digital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This heroic-fantasy hack&amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo;slash (action/role-playing game) takes you on a continent ravaged by a war that raged ten years earlier. The four Kingdoms of Men, Elves and Dwarves lay in ruins, preyed on by raiders and looters. In this chaos, a new, unknown threat is looming... To discover its true nature, the kingdoms sent detachments to investigate, a dangerous mission from which no one returned. But what about you? You, who were in the wrong place at the wrong time...&lt;br/&gt;Take control of a powerful Warrior, a dark Sorcerer or a Rogue master of stealth, and plunge into a grand quest full of action! The world of R.A.W. leads you, alone or in 2-player co-op, through many levels as rich and varied in every corner of the continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
