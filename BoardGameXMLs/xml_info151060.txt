							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Something Stirs in the Blackscale Brakes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brakes have never exactly been a good place to live: horrible food and real estate, flesh-eating lizardfolk, disease, poisonous animals, violent nature spirits, and more make day-to-day living a luxury. As bad as things seem however, they are about to get much, much worse because...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;something stirs in the Blackscale Brakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign front foundation takes place in and around the Blackscale Brakes, a forest-turned-ever-expanding swamp. The humans settled around its borders try to escape or exploit it, the elves try to restore it to its vibrant glory, and the lizardfolk just want everyone to keep out (and they are not even the most dangerous thing living there).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are planning to start a campaign, started gaming in general, need ideas, or are strapped for time this campaign front foundation has got you covered with three &amp;quot;assumed&amp;quot; dangers, several optional ones, four steadings, a compendium class, and new monsters, dungeon gear, and magic items to get the ball rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is in the swamp? Will the characters stop an ancient evil from awakening, or will they die trying?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play to find out what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
