			<description>Handmade Wars is a strategy war game. It consists of electronic pdf files, which the user before the first play, has to print and cut the necessary pieces out. The game emulates the development of an empire, by building villages, gathering resources and in the end constructing military camps and units to conquer the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players in the beggining have only their capital city and some resources. They have to build worker villages next to the field's resource blocks to generate more resources each turn, needed to build more buildings. Specific buildings allow military units to be produced (which also cost resources). The military units can attack the enemy's units or buildings, with a dice rolling battle system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who manages to destroy the enemy's capital city!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
