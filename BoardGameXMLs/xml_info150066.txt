							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World of Compact Heroes</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Compact Heroes is a generic basic campaign setting for you to use in your games. The map and subsequent descriptions are vague on purpose. They are only there to give you an outline in which to expand your own adventures and world. The map setting is supposed to be vague enough that you can plop down any adventure wherever you want with minimal prep time. On the flip side, there should be enough information given that you won&amp;rsquo;t need to make up everything yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included on the map are some major geographical features as well as several of the larger kingdoms. Not listed on the map are the hundreds of other towns and villages spread throughout, nor the various caves, dungeons, or other geographical features that you may want to include in your own campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
