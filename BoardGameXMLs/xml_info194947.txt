							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mixed Nuts</name>
									
			<description>Mixed Nuts is a party/trivia game with a unique voting element. Each of the trivia cards is double-sided with a question on both sides and the answer to each question on the opposite side; therefore, the person reading the question can play along, too. Each card features an odd trivia fact&amp;mdash;and somewhere in the text, there are two possible choices&amp;mdash;one is a fact, the other is a fib (these choices are a different color than the rest of the text).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player picks one (the fact or the lie), and reads the sentence aloud to the other players. Here's an example: &amp;ldquo;Al Capone's vault was opened on live TV by (Barbara Walters/Geraldo Rivera) and there was virtually nothing of value in it.&amp;rdquo; Players then decide if the given answer was correct. For instance, the active player includes &amp;ldquo;Barbara Walters&amp;rdquo; in their statement. If a player thinks that's right, they put the voting chip in their hand. If a player thinks that&amp;rsquo;s incorrect, they put nothing in their hand and have an empty hand. All players then reveal what's in their hand. The correct answer is &amp;ldquo;Geraldo Rivera,&amp;rdquo; so those players with empty hands receive one point&amp;mdash;in the form of a nut&amp;mdash;to put into their score cup. After three rounds of each player having had a turn to read a card, the player with the most nuts wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
