			<description>Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A game of side-scrolling, world-building, enemy-stomping action.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power-Up! is a multiplayer board game that recreates the experience of playing a classic, side-scrolling video game with/against your friends, but with the added twist of constructing the game as you play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players clamor through a series of obstacles while gathering cash and placing tiles that represent yet more obstacles on the horizon in front of them.  Turn order is constantly shifting, and the 5 choosable powers give the players the flexibility and edge they need to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
