			<description>A children's game Ages 4 and up. The game features a squirrel piece and a bunch of cone-tokens and a die with numbers from 1 to 3. The board consists of 7 squares each with from 1-5 spots for the cones.On his/her turn the player rolls the die and moves the squirrel in any direction the exact number of squares. If the player lands on a square that's filled with cones then he takes all those tokens into his pool and ends his turn. If he lands on a square that's not yet filled he must place one of his cones on that square. After this he must choose whether to end his turn or take another turn. The game ends when a player lands on a square that's not yet filled and doesn't have any cones left to place. The player with the most cones left is then the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
