							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shared Origins: Sky-Q</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a Thin Line Between Genius and EVIL. Sky-Q is such a good &amp;quot;smart drug,&amp;quot; it's a shame it's illegal. Users gain an hour of better memory and concentration--followed by fatigue, irritability, and other unpleasant side effects. A few steady users gain much more: They master exotic sciences and invent radical new technologies. They also develop bizarre megalomaniac obsessions and become supervillains! Some of them become loopy &amp;quot;theme gadget&amp;quot; criminals. Others are rather less funny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what you get in Shared Origins: Sky-Q:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Background and game mechanics for Sky-Q, the smart drug that works too well.&lt;br/&gt;     Four sample villains who gained their powers from Sky-Q, from the farcical Mushroom Master to the monstrous Izverg. Each character comes with a complete character sheet, background, story seeds, and full-color illustration.&lt;br/&gt;     One sample hero, ready to play or use as an NPC.&lt;br/&gt;     A brief discussion of &amp;quot;Origin Substances as reusable explanations for characters gaining super-powers, with three additional examples of this classic origin story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
