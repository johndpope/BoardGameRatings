							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Blast</name>
									
			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;It takes super sailin' to reach the pirate treasure before you're blasted out of the water!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the cutlass and move their ships round the board on their way to the treasure chest. If the spinning cutlass lands on 'Blast', the spinning player gets to attempt to 'blast' an opponent's ship by placing an air pump into one of the two openings adjacent to the move space...and slamming it! The result? Roughly one-in-three chance the opponent's ship will be blasted into the air!!! (and forced back three spaces)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Careful, if your ship is on the same move space, you can blast your own ship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first person to make it around the board and pass the treasure chest. The treasure chest is placed in a new location each game, so players can't memorize the pattern of safe spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar in 'pump' mechanics to BattleBoard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
