							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zeppelins Over London: WW I Airships (1916 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;It is now spring of 1916.  Improvements in anti-aircraft artillery and airplane performance have begun to threaten the zeppelins&amp;rsquo; invulnerability. While British arms manufacturers are busy developing incendiary and explosive ammunition (which would seal the fate of the flammable hydrogen filled zeppelins), the ammunition will not be widely available until the summer. The RAF 39 Squadron, flying the Bristol B.E.2c fighter and established to defend London from zeppelin raids, has just received word that a large formation of zeppelins is approaching the city!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple historical miniatures air combat game designed for classroom use. The game is played by two teams representing the British and German forces. The British players have twenty Bristol fighters divided into five divisions and the German players have twelve airships divided into three divisions. The British players attempt to shoot down as many zeppelins as possible before the airships can move off the end of the board or time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be played using models, or print-and-play paper aircraft, on a 7.5x5 foot hex mat with three inch hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
