			<description>Color Guard was published in the February 2008 issue of GAMES Magazine. However, it was published with the message &amp;quot;From Our Classic Games Department&amp;quot; indicating that this is a reprint from an earlier issue. No indication of an earlier publishing date is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main 5 x 7 gameboard is made up of red, orange, yellow, blue, and green squares. In addition, there is a starting area (rows of 5 and 3 squares) for each player above and below the main gameboard. Each player begins with 5 Guards and 3 Flagbearers. Flagbearers may move forward, diagonally forward, or sideways but not jump other pieces. Guards move in the same way, but have the additional restriction that the squares they may move to and from are controlled by the color of the squares where that player's Flagbearers are currently resting. Additionally, there are rules for capturing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when 1) a player maneuvers three of his pieces onto his opponent's Flagbearer starting squares, 2) a player has fewer than three pieces, 3) a player has no legal move, or 4) as a draw if neither player can achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
