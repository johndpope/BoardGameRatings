							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bandito Rojo 2.0</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torn from his place in history and imbued with super-abilities by the experimentation of his alien captor, Bandito Rojo escaped into a world that had forgotten him. Now he robs from the rich like some modern day Robin Hood (except for that whole giving to the poor thing; that's just not his style).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revised for use with the new Second Edition of M&amp;amp;M, Enemies A to Z: Bandito Rojo provides you with a pre-generated super-villain character to drop into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used in a one-time appearance or as an ongoing super-villain, Bandito Rojo has been statted at PL5, PL10 &amp;amp; PL12 to provide flexible use for any M&amp;amp;M superhero campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
