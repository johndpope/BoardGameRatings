							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost World</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Lost World, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost World is a single large map of a small camp in the middle of an ancient ruins set upon a plateau surrounded by a jungle and an ascending mountainous cliff. The Lost World includes a single panoramic view set in the middle of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost World is an extremely versatile map since it can be used as a primitive, primordial world where an advanced civilization rose up and then fell leaving behind ruins, making it useful as a Lost World hidden on earth or could be used as the surface of an alien world in a science fiction game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map could also be used an archaeological dig site in a modern pulp or Horror action game as well where anthropologists or archaeologists are digging and find something that they should not have discovered buried deep in the ground in the pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic adventure is that through some circumstance such as an earthquake, a cave in, or other means, a group of adventurers are trapped in a Lost World that exists between the earth&amp;rsquo;s crust and the surface above. Being closer to the center of the earth, the temperatures never dropped to become too cold to support most life in the Ice Ages, so life that had flourished in hot climates such as dinosaurs and giant bugs did not go completely extinct as had been previously thought. The group&amp;rsquo;s goal is to survive and escape this Lost World. The group finds a plateau with ancient ruins that have architecture that harkens back to man&amp;rsquo;s earliest days. They decide to set up their tents there, as it is a good spot to set up camp as visibility of both the forest and mountain is good to guard from threats. From here, the Game Master can allow them to investigate the ruins, fight dinosaur or insect monsters from the jungle or mountains, try to climb up the cliff and continue their ascent out of the Lost World, or descend further into the Lost World through a strange pit, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
