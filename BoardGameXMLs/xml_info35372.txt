			<description>&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; is a bowling game played with cards. Each card played represents one throw of the bowling ball. As in regulation bowling, each player is entitled to the throw of two balls (the play of two cards) in one frame to get all 10 pins. If a player can get 10 pins by playing only one card, he has thrown a strike which completes his play for that frame. Each game consists of 10 frames.
