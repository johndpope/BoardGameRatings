							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: The Mortician&#039;s Guild â€“ Strings of the Spirit Weaver</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fear the Spirit Weaver more than anyone &amp;ndash; for how can you fail to be intimidated by one who can direct the spirits of the dead to do her bidding?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Honour, Mason&amp;rsquo;s Guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aloof and cold, Scalpel is a practitioner of the forbidden black magic of Spirit Weaving. She carefully watches the opposition before deadly knives slash through the air to bleed her opponent, the bloodletting allowing her to take control of their very soul with her foul sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unorthodox and unpredictable; these Morticians are capable of scoring goals and victory points from plenty of unexpected angles. The opposition will struggle to stop a team that can reanimate their fallen teammates during their turn before forcing their opponents to change their game plan on the fly. Coaches who enjoy manipulating the opposition will find this side a natural fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empowered by dark magics, this set includes: a ball, 6 player cards, bases, and 6 players: Scalpel, Vileswarm, Veteran Graves, Casket, Bonesaw, Brainpan &amp;amp; Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
