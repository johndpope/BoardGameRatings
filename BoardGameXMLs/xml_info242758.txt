							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Incognito: Road Trip</name>
									
			<description>This is a solitaire adventure playable with ordinary playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four intrepid heroes are on a cross-country trip with the goal of getting the heir to the kingdom safely across the border.  On the way they have to fight enemy soldiers, but this takes a toll on their strength.  As they accumulate money, they may be able to hire sympathizers to fight their battles for them, but when they are alone or out of money, they have to fight their way through on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clubs represent hostile forces, Spades represent the heroes and their sympathizers, Hearts represent hit points, and Diamonds represent money.  One card at a time is turned over and placed on the layout in its appropriate place.  Every time a Club is turned up, the player has to deal with it using the resources available.  The goal is to escape all the hostile forces and get to the border safely without being captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
