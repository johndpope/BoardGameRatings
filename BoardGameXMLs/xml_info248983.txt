							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Looper</name>
									
			<description>Looper is played on a toroidal board represented by a square grid. Only orthogonally adjacent cells count as adjacent. (Thus, there are no diagonal connections.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player places 1,2 or 3 black stones on any vacant intersection. Alternatively, on his/her turn a player may announce &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, after which the opponent continues with white and the taker with black, alternately playing single stones onto empty intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black wins by making a global loop. White wins by preventing this.  A global loop is a string of connected stones that circles the torus (either horizontally, vertically, or both horizontally and vertically) and connects back to itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
