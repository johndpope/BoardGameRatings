			<description>MVP Baseball 2005 is a baseball video game that includes all 30 official Major League Baseball teams and stadiums, as well as the more than 1,000 individual players that populate each team. It includes authentic minor league teams and actual minor league players by including double-A and triple-A-level farm teams. 2005's installment includes single-A ball clubs as well (mostly from the Florida State League), giving each MLB team three levels of minor league farm clubs. Two legends teams, 63 legendary players, 15 classic stadiums, five fantasy parks, and more than 100 retro uniforms round out the list of included unlockable features. Rosters are current as of January 12, 2005, and the game included the then new Washington Nationals, along with their then temporary home, RFK Stadium. At the time, new rosters could be downloaded to the Xbox and PS2 versions of the game by accessing their online play menus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;MVP Baseball 2005&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
