			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn-based computer board game for 1 to 4 players (humans and/or computer).  The goal of the game is to capture the four microfilms in the middle in the board and move them back to one's base. Each player has a team of 12 agents, with different chess-like movement capabilities (some move like a bishop, others like a queen, others like a rook). Agents can capture enemy agents (again like chess), earning points and a microfilm if the captured piece had one. Capture is mandatory: if a player passes a capture opportunity, the other player can capture that player's piece. A player can also invert the position of two of her pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player take turns moving an agent, until all the microfilms are collected and stored in bases. The player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
