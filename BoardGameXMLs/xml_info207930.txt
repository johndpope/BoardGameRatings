			<description>This is a list of 100 items that may be found in a survivalist's retreat, whether this be an extensive construction out in the wilds or a simple bunker or room in an urban setting. Although there are 100 items on the list, many of these can then be split into further items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivalists don't just have guns; they also have other things needed to survive, such as food, supplies, hunting equipment, tools and power sources. These can be useful for any players in any post-apocalyptic setting, whether this be a zombie apocalypse or a traditional nuclear war. they aren't solely of use in those settings either, as they could also be used if the players are investigating or infiltrating a survivalist or survivalist organisation before the end of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;61. Maps (Of the local area, including navigation equipment such as compasses)&lt;br/&gt;62. Matches (Strike anywhere, kept dry)&lt;br/&gt;63. Meat Grinder (For mincing raw meat)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
