			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ringmaster is a niche genre game that simulates showy professional wrestling.  The rules primarily are intended to allow the creation of a variety of wrestlers, from Megastar to Monster Heel, and the simulation of a variety of acrobatic wrestling maneuvers.  Characters have Background, Attributes, Height, Weight, and Traits (derived attributes).  Characters may also have Merits (advantages) and/or Flaws (disadvantages).  Characters track Prestige through several ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrestling (combat) in the game involves a series of exchanges of Maneuvers.  The game presents a lengthy list of Maneuvers and descriptions.  Wrestling primarily involves Attribute Checks using D100 against Attribute, attempting to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; the target.  An unmodified roll of 01-05 is an Ace while 96-00 is a Botch.  The wrestling rules, forming the obvious focus of the entire game, can become quite complex as character utilize a chain of maneuvers with various outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign portion of the game deals primarily with rankings, earnings, skills development, managers, and other aspects of a typical wrestler's daily life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
