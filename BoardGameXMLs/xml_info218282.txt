			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Apocalypse &amp;ndash; The Dice Game is a solitaire dice placement game where you control [4] elite Navy SEALs trying to get home by searching for [5] SATCOM electronic communication pieces, through sixteen possible locations containing a variety of hostile combatants: zombies &amp;ldquo;slow, fast, mutant and radiated&amp;rdquo;, plus dangerous Raiders.  Each of the sixteen locations is randomly generated to create a PATH that must be followed to reach each building and secure each location.   Within five of these locations is one piece of the five necessary electronics components that you must retrieve and install into your portable communication device.  This communication device must eventually hook up to the control panel at the final location: SATCOM #1.   Each of the sixteen locations may also provide critical supplies and equipment to help you along your mission.  Be careful, within each location you will find yourself constantly being attacked by hordes of zombies and murderous raiders that will kill you on site!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
