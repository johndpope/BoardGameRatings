							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">V.I.P.E.R. Ops</name>
									
			<description>V.I.P.E.R. is a super-secret espionage agency based in North America whose directors are managing groups of agents running black ops all over the world.  Operations include surveillance, planting moles, extracting VIPs, sabotage, stealing secrets, frame-ups, staging coups, assassinations, and computer attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;V.I.P.E.R. Ops is a strategy board game for 2-4 players in which you take on the role of one of seven agency directors, each with different specializations, and vie with other directors for missions and gathering of resources such as operatives, agents, gadgets, deployment assets, and intelligence.  But plan well, because the other agency directors are competing with you for the same resources and only the most cunning director will be named the new chief director!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of play, you compete with other players to claim missions. Players then use their budget to train agents, claim power cards and resources to help complete missions or even increase future budget. Completed missions give victory points and other rewards that give new missions or help complete other missions. At the end of 8 rounds of play, the director with the most points is named the new chief director and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
