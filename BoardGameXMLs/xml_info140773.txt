							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">God of Battles</name>
									
			<description>God of Battles is mass fantasy combat system set in the world of Aren and designed for use with 28mm miniatures. Players select an army from one of ten army lists, ranging from fantasy staples such as Dwarfs and Orcs, to more unusual races such as the insectoid T'lekkan and the Sea Elves. Depending on the size of the game and the choice of army, players can field a force containing as little as twenty five minis or as many as a hundred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a streamlined movement and combat system which presents many tactical challenges without bogging the players down, allowing a game to be played in around two hours. D6's are used for most of the mechanics, along with a deck of regular playing cards for the miracles system. Rules for scenarios, weather, terrain, habitat, etc., help create a narrative feel to God of Battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook is a 285 page full-colour hardback and contains all of the rules, all ten army lists, all of the background to the world of Aren, painting guides for each army, and a sample battle report. It is fully supported by a range of miniatures produced by Wargames Foundry and many of the armies are compatible with miniatures produced by other companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
