			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...dark. The cold autumn wind sweeps through the bare trees. The night has replaced the forest's rich October palace with shades of black and gray. In the distance an owl cries out his ode to the night. Five young people gather in a gloomy clearing. Influenced by the cold of October night and the magic gloom of the forest, they stand together in expectant silence. Perhaps one understands the scream of the owl. Everything is quiet....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Athinopa was nice. There were no troubles. In Athinopa, Bjarke could always be with his friends. He enjoyed exciting expeditions or performed incredible deeds. And all in the company of amazing friends. In Athinopa, Bjarke was something special. Bjarke... was King ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...time is near. The fight will come, and who knows what will happen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
