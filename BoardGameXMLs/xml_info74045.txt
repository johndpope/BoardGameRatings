							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bible Match-A-Verse, Book of Psalms</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A Game That Helps You Learn the Scripture&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing mats are divided into six squares, each of which contains a passage from the Book of Psalms with certain words missing. On each the 48 cards are the missing words that apply to one of the passages on the mats. Players draw two cards at a time and attempt to match the cards to the passages on his or her mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After playing several games of Match-A-Verse, a player will learn and be able to quote many of the Scripture passages contained in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for Broadman Supplies by Bridges and Gottschalk, game designers Louisville, Kentucky. (Broadman Supplies was the publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, later known as the Baptist Sunday School Board and now known as LifeWay.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
