			<description>10 levels of a mast aboard a seafairing ship are the stage for a political battle between the birds of the sea. The first bird to the top of the mast will be crowned with the Star Crown as the King or Queen&amp;nbsp;of Sky and Sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each bird has a different approach to how to get to the top. Some hope to soar above their peers with better flying, some risk it all tradeing with the rats, while others rely on their ability to fight to stay ahead. Most birds excel at fishing, which will earn them temporary bonuses, though some sacrifice this most bird-like ability in order to boost another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
