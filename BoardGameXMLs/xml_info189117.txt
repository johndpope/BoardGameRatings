			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1522; Stage One: Thor Hansen; Stage Two: David LaFreniere; Stage Three: Fred Bednarski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note this entry is officially untitled.  The Stage Three version of this game is intended for the FU: the Free, Universal RPG RPG.  The Stage One and Two versions include their own unrelated system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction: During the Fall of 1812 Napoleon was gripped in a fight for control of Russia. His soldiers were working their way forward and the end was in sight. At the doors of Moscow, the Russian emperor called for his cabinet and asked for any way they could turn back the enemy. A plan was hatched to use the most powerful magics at their disposal. A burst of magic flowed from that camp and city far and wide. It is said that the explosion could be seen from the eastern parts of Scotland and heard in the heart of the Levant.&lt;br/&gt;Moscow became a gateway. Creatures imbued with magical properties are tearing through Capitals and villages. National boundaries meant nothing to them. Europe, the grand palaces, and the heart of modern civilization, is in jeopardy. England, perhaps because of the water of the Channel, is so far untouched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What this game is about: Journey, Improvisation and Exploration. The players are specialists hired by the newly formed Crisis Congress who are going to make their way to Moscow. They have been tasked with closing this fount of magical beings and restoring Europe to its former glory. But the road to Moscow is long and far from easy. Thanks to the magical blight, Europe is more foreign and even more alien than the Far East or Deep Afrika.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
