			<description>From the Publisher Catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now, you may have never experienced it--the electric thrill of an involvement so intense that the passing hours collapse seemingly into moments, and what might have been perceived as mere entertainment before has now shaped itself into the tangible magic of incredible challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may have never experienced it. But you will--and the experience has a name--STARFIGHTER, the last word in arcade simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To refer to STARFIGHTER as a game is to pigeonhole it along with other simulations and programs which only hint at the capabilities the microcomputer can provide the user on an  entertainment level. STARFIGHTER brings a gloss and sophistication to your micro that will not diminish with time, for the challenge is nearly endless. STARFIGHTER marries the physical payability of an arcade machine with the intellectual--without the ability to make rapid, intelligent decisions, one may not experience the comforts of old age in the STARFIGHTER universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STARFIGHTER player begins his tour of duty as a NEW PILOT. At this embryonic stage, he or she must prepare for the mission ahead--a mission which will consist of the identification and destruction of enemy craft. Perhaps in time (but only perhaps), the coveted rank of STAR LORD can be attained. But for now, one need only concern oneself with basic survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STARFIGHTER is a multiple skill level game with razor-sharp graphics and sounds that will return its cost a hundredfold in sheer enjoyment. The STARFIGHTER package includes two program tapes (separate Main Mission and New Pilot Simulator), or one self-booting disk, and an extremely detailed 32-page manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
