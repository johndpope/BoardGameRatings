							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OSIRIS!  A Romance in Six Parts</name>
									
			<description>Set has chopped Osiris into six pieces and scattered him all over the world in order to ensure his dominion over creation. Isis must reassemble Osiris and stop Set. One player is Isis, the other is Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isis's goal is to find the six pieces of Osiris: she does so by exploring cities and looting their treasures. Along the way she accumulates additional heroes to control, and spells that alter various game mechanics. Set's goal is to drop monsters, traps, and unfortunate events in Isis's path and hope that she dies before she completes her mission. He commands an endless army of creatures including cobras, hippos, and his own wicked priests. Both players may draw Chance Events, which include extra spells for Isis, extra minions for Set, and encounters with friendly/hostile gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a print-and-play game. Download the game rules and components below, under &amp;quot;files.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
