			<description>From the publishers website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiger leaped into the brawl, a mighty roar calling all about him to fight him.  Some of the earth deamons froze in terror at the might warrior&amp;rsquo;s challenge, but many more answered the call to battle as they poured into the clearing.  The warrior called the Tiger would have fallen then and there, had not his friend, the Monkey warrior, arrived just in time to save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Warriors of the Four Circles, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions.  Taking the S&amp;amp;G skirmish game system and add to it super Kung-Fu masters and martial arts experts and you have a great action game of flying kicks and mighty blows. Warriors of the Four Circles is a great mix of martial art action and elemental magic, all creating the wild world of a mighty battles and high suspense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
