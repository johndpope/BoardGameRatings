			<description>A card game in which the players have to &amp;quot;make up a train by collecting the necessary five cards which match his station,&amp;quot; (quoted from the rule book). The train cards are played to the table in lines. The object is to move your station along a line of trains to the end of the train, simulating the train moving into the station (or leaving the station). Various event cards can be played, some of which allow your station to move forward 1 or more 'spaces' (train cards), or send other player&amp;rsquo;s stations backwards. Wild cards that can match any train or station type also exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game first appeared in 1947. There are at least 2 editions of the game, one of which included &amp;quot;fold out stations&amp;quot;; one edition came in a blue and white box, the other in a red and white box. The Pepys second edition was published in 1955. The first edition included station cards that were folded within the box. The second edition only had stations the size of normal cards and the train liveries were updated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real trains are featured, from the LNER, GWR, SR, and LMS lines (London and North Eastern Railway, Great Western Railway, Southern Railway, London, Midland and Scottish Railway).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
