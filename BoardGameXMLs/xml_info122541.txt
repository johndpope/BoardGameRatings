			<description>In the Urban Chaos: Riot Response, the main character is Nick Mason, a member of the newly formed &amp;quot;T-Zero&amp;quot; riot response squad, in an unnamed modern American city that's been overtaken by the notorious Burners gang. The gang members are attacking civilians, paramedics, firefighters and police officers, and it is up to him to stop them. He must defeat them by whatever means necessary in order to protect the city, capturing gang leaders and rescuing injured civilians along the way.  The weapons in Urban Chaos are from 2 teams, the Burners, and T-Zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Chaos: Riot Response was known by three different names in development. The game was developed using the Havok physics engine for in-game physics effects. ReplicaNet was used to supply the software in the online and LAN multiplayer action. Perforce Software's Source Control Management (SCM) System was used to manage the game's source code, documents, and digital asset development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Urban Chaos: Riot Response&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
