							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cursed Allip</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens to those poor creatures who neglect the gods or their alignments? If they are unlucky enough to die without recommitting themselves to a fixed path they may find themselves on a razor's edge &amp;ndash; neither Good or Evil, but too passionate to dwell in purgatorial realms. This delicate state can shred the psyche of indecisive souls, leaving behind mad shades which are almost impossible to reason with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cursed allips exist on multiple planes at once, flickering in and out of existence and warping the minds of nearby creatures. They have no fixed lairs, but some are drawn locations from past while others are attracted to powerful mag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, their lack of purpose means cursed allips have little purpose in the grand scheme of reality. Some scholars have tried to argue a deeper meaning for their existence, but in all practical terms there are nuisances at best and fatal hazards at worst. Fortunately for monster hunters, this makes cursed allips into lucrative bounties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
