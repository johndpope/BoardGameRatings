			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This compilation from Artic Software consisted of two games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZX-Galaxians - A clone of the classic arcade game, Galaxian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword of Peace - An adventure/puzzle game, which appears never to have received a stand-alone release (though it appears on other Artic compilations. The game has adventure elements as the player explores a dungeon fighting monsters and entering movement commands. However the game does not rely on descriptions of location or the manipulation of objects to solve puzzles. Rather the player must work out how to navigate a dungeon maze, with the aim to reach a particular item hidden on each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sword of Peace Summary (From the inlay):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Crown Prince of Oz and to prove that you are worthy of becoming the Monarch of Oz, you are sent on a quest. You are cast into a dungeon where you must find four objects of state. Each object of state is on one paving stone in a 100 x 100 floor, this stone is called the magic spot. On your travels you will meet monsters. They will either be Good, Neutral or Evil. Evil monsters will try to kill you by casting spells on you which weaken your strength. Neutral monsters will act as either Good monsters will do you good [for example by providing you with tools which guide towards the the magic spot or by providing stronger spells].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you collect an object of state you are transported to another level (5 in all) and when you get to the 5th magic spot you have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
