			<description>Heroes Forever Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes Forever Role Playing Game is an easy to learn game system using the unique D12 Results Table resolution system. A complete game system that allows players to play a broad range of characters and power levels; to play their favorite heroes from their favorite comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following appears on an unnumbered page in the book (none of the pages are numbered):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills, Advantages &amp;amp; Disadvantages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will not be including them in this free book, because we do not have the space for them. If you want them, you could purchase the Heroes Forever PDF for $1. It includes what this is missing. Missing these will not greatly diminish the game and it can be played at a basic form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shelter Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Forever: The Shelter is an Adventure for up to 4 players. Heroes help people and often, people help them. This is the story of Heroes helping out a buddy. The Heroes have gotten tips and help from their homeless friend for many years. Now he is missing and the Heroes need to find out why. A search, a chase, a Demon and a Multi-Billion Dollar Corporation all lead to an answer and the beginning of the end for our Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item is submitted as a bundle because while these are two physical books, the only way they could be acquired was as a package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
