			<description>Utter Nonsense - The Hilarious Accent Game is a card game where players combine silly accents with even sillier phrases to create sayings that are just plain ridiculous. The game contains 50 Accent Cards and 450 Phrase Cards which players combine and act out. Sometimes phrases pair well with the accent, but for the most part they don't - and that's Utter Nonsense. You don't have to be good at accents and the combinations don't need to make sense. In fact, players are encouraged to improvise and make the phrases their own. With each successive round, watch as even your most mild-mannered friends and family become improv masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
