			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starport is the central base of operations for many Traveller adventures - but each one is far more than a collection of refuelling points and patron display boards. Every starport in the galaxy is a living, breathing place, and this supplement will make your adventures stand out by making starports real locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond their symbolic power, they are intersections of galactic commerce: the ports where merchants and brave souls who traverse the edges of known space may seek refuge. They are the beginning and the end of countless adventures, spanning innumerable worlds. They play host to the super-rich and provide cracks into which the dregs of society may fall. They are safety and civilisation; endeavour and enterprise, skulduggery and subterfuge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are starports. Gateways to the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed with information on what facilities, characters, and businesses can be found at a starport, this book provides maps, vehicles, and ships that can be readily used to create your own starports, or you can use one of the fully fleshed out starports included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
