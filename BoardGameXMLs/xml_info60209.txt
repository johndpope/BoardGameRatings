							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trash or Treasure</name>
									
			<description>This is a game inspired by one of my stranger hobbies - metal detecting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your birthday you got a brand new metal detector and a shovel from a buddy of yours who is totally into this rather weird hobby. So you and up to three of your friends take to the fields in search of treasures. What will you find? Trash or Treasure??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this free to print and play board game for two to four players, you grab your Beginner's Detector and a Small Shovel and search a field for hidden treasures like coins, rings and artefacts. But beware, there is not only treasure to be unearthed, but also useless trash. For each treasure you add to your collection, you score one Victory Point. You may sell off Treasure from your Collection to buy new equipment, like better detectors and shovels. For every two pieces of Trash in your Garbage Bin, your VP Score is reduced by one. Whoever reaches 10 Victory Points first is the winner (in a 2 players game - if there are 3 players, you need 7 VPs to win, if there are 4 players, you need only 5 VPs). The other players may continue to play for second and third places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
