			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAN YOU SURVIVE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On April 19, 1906 at 5:18 a.m., one of the most violent earthquakes of modern times decimated metropolitan San Francisco. Now, Jyym Pearson (author of Escape From Traam and The Curse of Crowley Manor) has crafted his finest Other Venture to date: EARTHQUAKE--San Francisco 1906! Painstakingly researched with close attention to detail and historical accuracy, EARTHQUAKE puts you into a topsy-turvy scenario: The city's remains are awash with flame; buildings burn and crumble, and death's dark sentry stands watch over all. It is through this madness that you must plunge. Your chances of survival are directly realted to your ability to reason logically. Hopefully, you will escape from fallen San Francisco with your life. EARTHQUAKE features a new powerful data base and is certain to provide you with many hours of thrilling action &amp;amp; challenging puzzles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
