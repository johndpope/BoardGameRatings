			<description>Skud Pai Sho is inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender and existing fan-made Pai Sho rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Skud Pai Sho, players place and move Flower Tiles on the board with the goal of arranging various flower tiles into a Harmony Ring - a chain of harmonies that encompasses the center of the board. Harmonies are formed when certain flower tiles are lined up with each other on the board. Along the way, players use Accent Tiles to block their opponent's efforts or help themselves achieve their goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player either Plants by placing a new Flower tile onto the board in an open Gate or Arranges by moving a Flower tile already on the board. If a new Harmony between the player's Flower tiles is formed when a player Arranges, the player gets a Harmony Bonus and may be able to Plant a new Flower tile or play an Accent tile that affects the board in a special way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins when he or she forms a Harmony Ring, which is a chain of harmonies that encompasses the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
