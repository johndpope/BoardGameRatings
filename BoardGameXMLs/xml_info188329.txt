							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valence 592 (Player&#039;s Book)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valence 592 is the 1st Edition of the Valence game, published as free HTML and a compiled PDF available for download.  In addition, the game manual was available as a series of PDFs for each major chapter.  A (very) limited number of the compiled PDF version were printed, apparently for development circulation only.  The 2nd Edition of the game, entitled only Valence, was commercially released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the empires which have ruled the universe is long and bloody, analogous, some say, to the history of the human home world, Earth. There have been wars seemingly without beginning or end, ones without purpose or reason, and characteristic influences on the times as a result. Through singular battles and extensive wars the Universe was wrought from its primordial self to the present-day universe, in the Galactic Year 592.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
