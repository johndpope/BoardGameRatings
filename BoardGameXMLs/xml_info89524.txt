			<description>Every Extend Extra is a redevelopment of the popular freeware game Every Extend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is unable to shoot, their only defense being to detonate their ship in the vicinity of the enemy. Enemies appear in randomized patterns, and the aim is to position and detonate at the right moment, setting off a chain reaction of explosions and earning a combo bonus. Blowing oneself up takes away from one's overall 'stock', or number of bombs, with a new bomb being gained after the player gains a certain amount of points, which increases after each new bomb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An enhanced version for Xbox Live Arcade, Every Extend Extra Extreme was later released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Every Extend Extra&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
