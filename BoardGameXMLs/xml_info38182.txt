			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game for 2 or more players. Each player takes on the role of Superman on a similar but alternate parallel Earth. Players compete to see who captures the most powerful villains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players attempt to play combinations of cards to capture Villains. A combination must include the Villain Card to be captured, together with up to two Weapon Cards and one Plot Card. These cards represent the total Villain Point Value. The player must then play a Superman card together with Power, Ally, and Equipment Cards having a higher total value than the Villain Point Value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opponents may then play Weapon and Plot Cards to aid the Villain. The player may then respond by playing additional Power, Ally, and Equipment Cards. If the total value of the Superman cards still exceeds the total Villain Point Value, the Villain is captured and placed in the players Prison Pile together with all Weapon and Plot Cards played to support the Villain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after the last card is drawn from the deck. The winner is the player having a Prison Pile worth the most total points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
