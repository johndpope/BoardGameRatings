			<description>From the Avalanche Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the Great War, the German High Seas Fleet was interned at Scapa Flow at the northern tip of Scotland as a guarantee of the November 11th Armistice. Within weeks, French leaders were demanding that at least a portion of the ships, if not all of them, be handed over to France as compensation for the destruction wrought on French soil during the war. The discussions came to an end in June 1919, when the German sailors still aboard the ships scuttled them rather than see them flying enemy flags or worse, displayed in victory celebrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victoire is a variant for U.S. Navy Plan Gold, in which the French have successfully received the most extreme of their demands: all of the most modern German battleships, battle cruisers and light cruisers. Newly refitted and ready for action, these vessels join the French fleet projecting the Republic&amp;rsquo;s naval power into the Caribbean basin. With the addition of 14 formerly German dreadnoughts and six cruisers, the Marine Nationale is now a match for the U.S. Navy. The Monroe Doctrine is about to become a dead letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harvest 2015 Golden Journal includes twenty new laser-cut, mounted pieces depicting these ships in Great War at Sea format. They bear French livery and new names, and revised artwork. It&amp;rsquo;s a good-looking set. Plus you get scenarios for their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
