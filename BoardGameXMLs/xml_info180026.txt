							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">McGuffin</name>
									
			<description>A hidden roles card game game. Play either the NASTI party or the Foundation to either keep or gain the true McGuffin. Each player takes a role and is given a McGuffin card. On each card there is a special ability to help your team win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archaeologist starts the game with the true McGuffin, the Maltese Falcon. Play is decided randomly. A player may use either the special ability on his McGuffin card or his character card. There is one round per player, so a 6 player game lasts 6 rounds. The NASTI players must use their McGuffins and special abilities to acquire the true McGuffin. They must keep it for one whole turn to win the game. For the Foundation players to win they must stop the NASTI players from retaining it for one whole turn. Special abilities allow the players to look at other cards, acquire them and to reveal others. Characters who die are replaced by others randomly, this may affect the outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
