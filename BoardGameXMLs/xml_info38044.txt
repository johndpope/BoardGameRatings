			<description>This is a simple children's game with the theme of pirates collecting treasure from an island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with an individual pirate game board.  Players place the well illustrated treasure pieces and deck of pirate cards on the larger game board representing the island.  Players take turns drawing a pirate card and following the instructions on the cards, if successful you get variable amounts of treasure as rewards for the tasks to add to your pirate hoard.  When all treasure is collected from the island, the player who has collected the most treasure wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
