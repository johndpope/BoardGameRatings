			<description>The &amp;ldquo;What if...&amp;rdquo; game that could save your child&amp;rsquo;s life- teaching kids how to avoid abduction and abuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest way to reduce children&amp;rsquo;s fear of abduction and molestation, while at the same time offering them the highest degree of protection, is to give them knowledge of how to respond when faced with a potentially dangerous situation. With a &amp;ldquo;What if...&amp;rdquo; game format using question/answer cards, Situations&amp;trade; teaches children how to recognize and respond when confronted with potentially life threatening scenarios. You and your children will learn many of the actual methods and schemes used by real child predators one may read about in local newspapers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will also have a profound impact on opening the lines of communication between children and their parents with respect to these subjects that, for even the best of parents, are often difficult to discuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situations&amp;trade; is a must for homes, classrooms, daycares and other group settings. This game is specifically designed for play between one or more children AND a parent or teacher, and is NOT recommended to be played without an adult. &lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
