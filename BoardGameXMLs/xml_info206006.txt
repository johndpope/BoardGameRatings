			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted more story in your roleplaying game stories?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you're about to read isn't a story unto itself. It's not a finely polished tabletop roleplaying game adventure. It's a template for a particular kind of story. It goes over the three-act structure for that plot type, and covers what has to happen in the beginning, the middle, and the end. It explains the sorts of things that you need to prepare before you start developing the story, and the things that you need to craft and develop after you've got the blueprint for your specific story put together. This book is designed to help you plan how to tell a chase story effectively, with the least amount of work possible. Because it's all about story, it is system-agnostic and useable with any genre or setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
