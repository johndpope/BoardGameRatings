			<description>A children's game, consisting of 32 cards with geese on both sides and a dice. The 32 cards are arranged in a spiral and all players start from the first card. After throwing the dice the player moves accordingly forward on the spiral. If he lands on a card, he has to turn it around and follow its instructions.&lt;br/&gt;The card symbols are sometimes advantageous (e.g. take another turn), sometimes disadvantageous (e.g. sit out one turn). The players can also move other pawns of other players to move them on disadvantageous cards. Therefore it is essential to remember what text is on the backside of the cards. &lt;br/&gt;If two geese meet, one has to follow the orders from the backside of the card, the other must go back to the card where the first goose came from. The player wins, whose goose first passes the last card of the spiral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
