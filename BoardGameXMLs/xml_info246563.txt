							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Titan Empire</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a ship resembling the Starship Enterprise. A militant government originating from a settlement on Saturn's moon Titan have started attacking neighboring moons and planets and taking over their government, similar to the expanse of Germany and the Nazi party during World War II. It is the player's objective to stop the spread of the faction and free planets conquered by them. The player does this by bombing enemy planets and attacking enemy ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the gameplay is strategically engaging, the game suffers from the limits of the home computer power. From time to time, when there is a great deal of content to render and trajectories to calculate, the game can slow to a crawl and become very &amp;quot;jumpy&amp;quot;, sometimes taking a second or more to calculate and render a single screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
