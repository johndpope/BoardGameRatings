			<description>You move around the board by throwing a die, trying to collect all of the different character cards: Betty, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm and Dino. For example, if you end up on a Barney square you take a Barney card. Immediately after you've picked up the card the player to the left of you gets a chance to steal your new card by guessing which one of all Fred's (because this game is about Fred no matter what card you pick up) favorite hobbies is on the back. There are 5 different hobbies represented on each and one of all the character cards (fishing rod, grammophone, grilled meat, golf and TV). So the chance to immediately steal the card is 1 to 5. Once you've collected one of every character card you need to get back home as quickly as possible in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you're picking up cards you might get a specialty card. If the back of the card has a picture of Wilma you must move your piece to the beginning. A picture of a happy Fred lets you take one card from an opponent, and an angry Fred makes you give one of your cards to an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
