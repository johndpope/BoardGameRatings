			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WWII is not a very detailed game, nor was it ever meant to be that way. What I've tried to create is a system which allows for easy conversion from any of the published games out there. At low attribute levels the game is rather deadly, while high-level characters can do some very cinematic things and survive. But whatever the power level, there is not much bookkeeping, even for vehicles. West End Games' STAR WARS RPG is complex compared to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WWII is based on my generic science fiction RPG known as WAR. This version incorporates all of the refinements made after the initial release of the original rules. There are also some additions, which were not included in the last released version (1.3). Some things have been left out because they do not belong in a WWII game. This file does not include equipment or vehicle lists. They will be available separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
