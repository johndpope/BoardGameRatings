			<description>Byle do pierwszego is a board game filled with humor and satire, but primarily build on an attractive mechanics of repaying bills. Yes, it is the bills that are the biggest challenge for the players (3 to 5). If you like fast and dynamic games with quick setup and low downtime, with a significant role of interaction, then this is a game for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Byle do pierwszego players control 6-persons families trying to survive two months in the homely housing estate.&lt;br/&gt;They start a game with certain amount of money and a set of bills, which values are between 50 and 400 zł. By the end of each month, which passage is marked on a special calendar with 12 months to choose from, players must get rid of all bills.&lt;br/&gt;With proper management of family members, which can be sent to several premises on the board, players are able to gain valuable discounts that will allow them to deal with the debts.&lt;br/&gt;A great help (but a chore for rivals) are 3 types of action cards, which players earn after paying the bill. The higher the amount to pay, the better the deck from which the player draws an action card. And how much payment a player will get on hand the first day of the month will depend on its position on the career track.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player is faced with the question &amp;quot;career or family?&amp;quot;. The player who after two months of fighting will have the most nest-eggs will win Byle do pierwszego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
