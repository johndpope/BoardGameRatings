			<description>SET&amp;reg;, the classic card game of visual perception, is now on iPhone. Exercise your brain by finding sequences of corresponding symbols, based on their count, color and shading. Have fun in this quick-to-learn and highly addictive game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to create sets of cards. To create a SET, player must find three cards in which the features on the cards are either all the same or all completely different from each other. SET for Android, Blackberry, and iPhone allows players to chose their level of play, varying the number of features included on the cards depending on the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This makes the SET game perfect for beginners or those looking for a more challenging experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like sudoku or Tetris, SET achieves that rare balance of quick-to-learn, but endlessly challenging. SET for the iPhone can be enjoyed whenever and wherever you are, without requiring significant blocks of time. It is great for keeping your mind sharp!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SET Card Game has sold over 2 million copies worldwide. Heralded by Mensa and winner of 25 gaming awards, SET can now be yours to take with you wherever you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
