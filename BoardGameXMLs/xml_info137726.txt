							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild West</name>
									
			<description>Wild West is played with 48 cards made up of 14 different sharp shooting characters and four plastic pop guns that fire a ping-pong ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained in these 48 cards are 8 cards illustrating wanted outlaws. These 8 outlaws are also hiding in the rest of the cards. One special agent card is also included which, when played, automatically entitles the player to arrest any one of the wanted outlaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect three of the wanted outlaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place all the wanted cards face up in a circle in the centre of the table.&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a gun and places it in front of himself on the table.&lt;br/&gt;Choose a dealer, who shuffles the rest of the cards and deals them out one at a time face down to each player until the pack is finished. Each player then stacks the cards face down in front of himself .The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by playing the top card of his hand face up in front of himself. Play continues in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;When any player turns over a card which he thinks is a wanted man, he should shout &amp;quot;Ambush&amp;quot; and go for his gun.The one who sees the wanted man first obviously has the advantage but he does not win the wanted card until he shoots any one of the players who have now become the outiaws. The one that shoots and scores first wins the wanted card and places it in front of himself. Should the player accidentally shoot the wrong sharp shooting character he should either:-&lt;br/&gt;1.    miss a go if he holds no wanted cards and be shot by the other players or&lt;br/&gt;2.    lose one of his wanted cards and place it back in the centre of the table and be shot by the other players.&lt;br/&gt;When the players have played all their cards the dealer should shuffle the cards and deal them out as above.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first person to collect three wanted cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
