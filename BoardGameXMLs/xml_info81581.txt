			<description>From the back of the book: The inhabitants of Galtor, a sleepy little planet on the Davion/Kurita border, had nothing to interest their neighboring superpowers. Nevertheless, the manipulations of Hanse &amp;quot;The Fox&amp;quot; Davion and the bitter rivalry of two Kurita Military District Commanders engulfed Galtor in one of the largest battles in recent memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Davion planned to lure several Kurita regiments onto Galtor with rumors of a newly discovered Star League cache and then ambush the Kurita forces with his own secret reinforcements. Everything went according to plan until five regiments landed and Davion engineers discovered a real Star League installation. Soon Davion units were fighting for their very existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BattleForce 1 scenario set includes a detailed history of the three-month campaign, orders of battle for the units involved and eight scenarios that recreate the pivotal battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
