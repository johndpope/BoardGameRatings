			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What do Aaron Offspeed, Henry Pickoff, Rocky Start, and the Washington Watergates have in common?  They are all part of a unique game called Wanna Buy a Baseball Team Cheap?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are the owner of a baseball team.  Your goal as owner is to be the first person to buy a complete baseball team at the lowest possible price before any other owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Owners may bid, buy, or trade players.  Owners who buy players pay only the stated price.  However when players are traded or bid on any price is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Owners are able to stay in the game provided they have money.  They may trade in players to the Profit League bank to get much needed cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A player wins by having the most + points at the end of the game provided no other player has completely purchased a baseball team.  Plus points are given for money left at the end of the game.  Minus points are given for each player not purchased during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Wanna Buy a Baseball Team, Cheap?! is not a boring game.  It gives the participants plenty of action and decision making.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-published by the proprietor of M. Foner's Games Only Emporium in Lemoyne, PA, and distributed through the store.  Game seems to be intended to teach mathematics as much as provide a baseball game.  A basketball game also exists, Wanna Buy a Basketball Team Cheap?  No indication of when the game was originally published exists; some of the art strongly suggests the 1970s, although some parts were apparently printed later, in extant copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
