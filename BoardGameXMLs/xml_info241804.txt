			<description>Based on the latest scientific research from Positive Psychology, the Happiness Board Game teaches players how to raise their happiness levels. Players take turns rolling dice and moving around the game board. Game board is made up of three kinds of spaces: positive circumstances and attitudes, negative circumstances and attitudes, and bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When players land on a positive space they take a card from the corresponding deck and read it out loud. Cards present positive situations were points are rewarded for being in a positive circumstance or having a positive attitude. Those points are then multiplied by their corresponding weight (10% or 40% respectively) that the situation has on one&amp;rsquo;s happiness level. Players than move their score tracker the appropriate number of spaces in the scoring area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same happens when players land on a negative space, except the points are negative and suggestions are given on what players can do to raise their happiness levels in negative situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cards provide points of discussion such as, &amp;ldquo;You begin volunteering at the local animal shelter. Scientific studies have found that volunteering increases our level of happiness. Right now have every player name some volunteering work that he or she would like to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends with the first player to reach 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
