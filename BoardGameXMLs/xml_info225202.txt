							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wither&#039;d Murder</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party, consisting of Lord Turquin of Springdale and his retinue are travelling from Vantery in the County of Braeburg to Meore on the coast of Chaubrette. They had been commissioned by the King of Albion to deliver certain exceptionally important (but secret) documents to the Count of Braeburg &amp;ndash; His Majesty needed a group of people who could pass as adventurers but who were lead by somebody with the rank to be taken seriously as an emissary of the King, and Turquin and his companions fitted the bill perfectly. It is autumn as they travel up the road that runs alongside a river through a combination of woodlands and farmlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed for Conquest, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
