							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNO: Seattle Mariners</name>
									
			<description>Standard Uno-themed card game with the addition of the Open Roof card. The Open Roof card works as a standard WILD card but also allows you to look at the hand of another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the tin:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Step up to the plate with America's National Pastime and America's #1 Brand of Family Games in UNO the Seattle Mariners Edition. This grand slam version of UNO is fully customized depicting Seattle Mariners all stars Ichiro, John Olerud, Edgar Martinez and much, much more. We have added the exclusive Open Roof card and rule, where you can look &amp;quot;through the roof&amp;quot; at another player's hand. The whole game comes packaged in a highly detailed collector's tin. Don't strikeout by missing this great tribute to the Northwest's home team.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
