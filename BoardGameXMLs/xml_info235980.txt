			<description>&amp;quot;As God may help, it appears to me that all the flower and honor of chivalry is there, most wisely and expertly drawn up.&amp;quot; -- John Chandos, before the Battle of Auray (29 September 1364)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hundred Years War (1337 to 1453) was a dynastic struggle between the English house of Plantagenet and the French house of Valois for control of the French throne. Armies from across Europe would ally with these families, spreading combat as far from Gascony as Scotland and Portugal. Chivalry rose and fell on the backs of personalities like the Black Prince, Charles the Bad, and Pedro the Cruel, fought over battlefields at Cre&amp;ccedil;y, Poitiers, and Agincourt. By the end of this period, chivalry would be in ashes and from those would be born the nations of England and France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saint-Omer to Saint Crispin is a follow-up (or, perhaps more accurately, a prequel) to Mike Nagel's Charles Roberts award nominated game Sun of York, that covers tactical battles between the English, French, and their respective allies during the Hundred Years War. The game uses a card-based system to activate units for movement, combat, and rally during each of the eighteen(!) individual scenarios. A large variety of combat units are ready for combat, including impetuous French knights and the feared English longbow men. Leadership is critical on the field of battle as command is not only needed to move combat units, but also has an impact upon how they perform. Combat is swift and bloody, with the victor determined by whoever holds the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the large number of historical battles, rules are included allowing players to design their own custom armies. As an added bonus, owners of Sun of York may also use the components provided by Saint-Omer to Saint Crispin to fight out battles from the Wars of the Roses in a more compact space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
