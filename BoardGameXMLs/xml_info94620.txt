							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wing Commander: Academy</name>
									
			<description>Wing Commander Academy built on the Wing Commander II engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a student at the TCSN Academy, you custom-design and fly unique combat, rescue, and search and retrieval missions from the CyberSchool's holographic simulator. In the Wing Commander tradition, the game features a dynamic musical score, improved bit-mapped graphics, and a dazzling array of customizing options. But Wing Commander Academy is not another cinematic extravaganza -- it's an intense dogfighting marathon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Custom-design a variety of missions that match your skill level as you place fighters, capital ships, mine fields, asteroid fields, data pods and ejected pilots -- up to 10 in each of the four action spheres. &lt;br/&gt;- Save up to 24 games to disk and trade with your friends or upload them to bulletin boards to challenge others. &lt;br/&gt;- Request random missions where each action sphere yields an unknown number of enemy ships with pilots of varying skill levels. &lt;br/&gt;- Climb into the cockpits of the new Confederation Wraith or Kilrathi Jrathek fighters for a new combat experience. &lt;br/&gt;- Select a cybernet wingman -- from a frightened cadet to a hotshot veteran. &lt;br/&gt;- Fly from the cockpit or try the chase plane view for a new perspective on the intense dogfighting action. &lt;br/&gt;- Sharpen your combat skills as you compete for high-point honors. &lt;br/&gt;- Engage the &amp;quot;Gauntlet&amp;quot; -- a dogfighting marathon with 16 progressively difficult levels of attacking ships -- including three flights of fighters in each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
