							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fighters versus Bombers</name>
									
			<description>Theme: [from the game itself] Wargames duplicate the action of real or imaginary battles on a miniature scale. By following these plans, you can create a battle between British fighters and Zeppelins. Gotha bombers are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-Play: The game was designed as an educational tool giving young players numerous tasks that build and exercise various skills, from constructing the game itself [following graphic instructions + making precise materials {maps and measures for the aircraft}], to forward thinking in planning British defenses and deploying German Bombers, to making critical decisions in how to best achieve each side's objectives, to finally analyzing the results - applying the lessons learned to refine and improve future game play/decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: In addition to the greater educational benefits listed above, the specific game's goal is to simulate the problems for both the offense and defense in the world's first Strategic Bombing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
