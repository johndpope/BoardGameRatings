							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Engine That Could</name>
									
			<description>In this game, based on the famous children's story, you want to be the first player to make three trips over the mountain and deliver your toys, one at a time, to the children in town. Players all move the same Little Engine piece across the board. On your turn, you spin the spinner and advance the Little Engine to the next color space spun. If you spin the color matching your toys, you take another turn. Once the Engine reaches the mountain spaces marked &amp;quot;I think I can&amp;quot;, players must then spin a color marked &amp;quot;I think I can&amp;quot; on the spinner to move the Little Engine any further. If at any time you spin the space marked &amp;quot;I thought I could!&amp;quot; you move the Little Engine, no matter where it is, all the way to town. If you are the player that moves the engine into town, you place one of your toy tokens, on the town space. The Engine is then placed back on the Start space and begins its next run. Be the first player to deliver your three toys to the town and you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
