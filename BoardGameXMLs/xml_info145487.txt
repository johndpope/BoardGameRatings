			<description>Fiefdoms is a 2-4 player dice based, area control-type game. Each turn players roll four dice from which they create two grid references - determining where on the six-by-six map they can place armies and workers; occupying castles to gain points or controlling villages to gain extra powers. Once placed, your armies will have to fight for the most important locations - using a positional, dice-free combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thematically the game is inspired by the influx of Norman barons into England during the reign of William Rufus - all vying to grab lands and castles. Despite the theme, this is very much a Euro-game - rather than a wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In keeping with the printandroll promise - to provide everything but the dice - the pdf includes a page of cut out and fold armies and workers. However, you may find it easier and more satisfying to use pieces from another game. As with Siegecraft, the rules are printed on the board for ease of reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The files for the game can be found in the files section, below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
