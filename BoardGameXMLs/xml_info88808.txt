							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Menagerie Mogul</name>
									
			<description>From the prototype rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have been hired as curator of a brand new zoo in Europe. Your job is to build a world-class collection of animals for the awaiting public. However, your opponents have been hired in similar positions at competing zoos. Be strategic in the use of your resources, and assemble your collection wisely. If you succeed, you will be known the world over as Menagerie Mogul!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of five rounds, players will draft resource cards from an ever-changing selection. They will then use these resources to compete against one another in hopes of acquiring the most prestigious animals in the world for their zoos. At the end of the five rounds, whoever has achieved the goal of curating the most profitable zoo, wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
