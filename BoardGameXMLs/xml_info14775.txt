			<description>A game depicting the Triathlon. Players progress through three stages of the race - swim, cycling and run - to be the first across the line. Players must manage limited speed points and varying skills to balance the three disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From MNG-AJM Games Catalog: a British race game based on the triathlon. A triathlon race consists of three races within a race, swimming, cycling and running. Players each have an athlete with differing abilities in the three sections, and a poor ability gets you extra stamina chips and vice versa.  Game play is card driven, with the cards having different movement scores for the different phases.  Each turn a card is played and stamina chips may be used to push on further. In addition, cars and pleasure boats can get in the way of athletes, and these are also moved by the players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
