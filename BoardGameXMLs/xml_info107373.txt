							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Reign of Steel: Will to Live</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fatal Error: (A)void / (R)ebel / (F)lee?&lt;br/&gt; For millennia, humanity has mastered tools to further its goals. But what if technology became the master? Imagine a world where robots rule -- a tomorrow where imagination is outlawed.&lt;br/&gt; GURPS Reign of Steel: Will to Live includes all the intel required to upgrade the classic GURPS Reign of Steel setting to GURPS Fourth Edition, such as:&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Completely new fiction by setting mastermind (and GURPS Fourth Edition co-author) David L. Pulver.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Over two dozen lenses, presenting Fourth Edition information on common human character types, plus two bioroid lenses. Take up arms as a mechrider, an info-commando, or an aniroid ranger!&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Details on how to fight robots, including three GURPS Martial Arts styles!&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Full GURPS stats on the robots from Reign of Steel -- over 30 write-ups in all! All the enemies from that setting are now presented as GURPS Fourth Edition characters, for maximum portability and ease of use. Heroes can fight the 351-point XNU-09 Stalker security sentries, find the 436-point &amp;quot;doppelganger&amp;quot; RAU-06 Lilith models, or flee the 6,470-point XAU-03 Juggernaut battle tank!&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Eight templates for robot roles, providing flexibility and alternate functions. Is that bucket of bolts a techbot, an exterminator, or a rogue?&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Advantages, disadvantages, perks, and quirks used by robots -- plus 20 weapons!&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Fourth Edition details on all the gear, weapons, and technology found in the deadly tomorrow. Learn how the latest edition of GURPS Ultra-Tech intersects Reign of Steel!&lt;br/&gt; &amp;bull;Fourth Edition insight on the second-biggest killer in Reign of Steel: disease.&lt;br/&gt; With this update and the original Reign of Steel setting, you have everything you need to play in that science-fiction world. Or, used alone, it provides an invaluable source of Fourth Edition robot templates and characters that you'll enjoy as long as you live . . . or, perhaps, until you're rebooted.&lt;br/&gt; This supplement requires GURPS Ultra-Tech for details of human and robot equipment. The original GURPS Reign of Steel supplement is also necessary to use this volume as more than a catalog of specialized robot designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
