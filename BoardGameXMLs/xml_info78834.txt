			<description>&amp;quot;Rise of the Triad: Dark War (abbreviated as ROTT) is a first-person shooter video game that was first released on February 17, 1995 and developed by Apogee Software (now known as 3D Realms). The members of the development team involved referred to themselves as &amp;quot;The Developers of Incredible Power&amp;quot;. The player can choose one of five different characters to play as, each bearing unique attributes such as height, speed, and endurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of special operatives, known as the H.U.N.T. (High-risk United Nations Task-force), is sent to San Nicolas Island to investigate deadly cult activity taking place in an ancient monastery. Their boat, the only way back, is destroyed by patrols, and the team soon learns that the cult plans to systematically destroy nearby Los Angeles. The operatives, now unable to return whence they came, are then left to fight their way into the monastery  on the island, and eventually put a stop to the cult's activities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Rise of the Triad , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
