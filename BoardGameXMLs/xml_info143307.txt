							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Autumn Ash</name>
									
			<description>This is a strategic game of color change for Looney Pyramids that uncommonly incorporates all ten standard Xeno and Rainbow colors. The pyramids are meant to represent a vast array of differently colored autumnal leaves. The goal is to bag &amp;quot;leaves&amp;quot; (aka pyramids) worth twenty points before your opponent does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is either played on a 5X6 board or on a full chess board (in the &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; rules variant).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each turn, players enter a new piece and move that or another one of their pieces on the board. At the end of their movement phase, the piece moved progresses to a pyramid of the next color in a sequence and is optionally changed to a different sized piece, each of which have a distinct strategic value. Identically colored pieces that are made into rows of three or more are removed from the board and scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
