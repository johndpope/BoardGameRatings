			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghostwood is a Quest for the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game. It is a two-part Quest; the first part takes place within the Ghostwood forest itself, while the second takes place beneath Ghostwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standing outside the forest gives you an eerie feeling; after all, the name Ghostwood is well earned. Rumours of spirits and undead haunting the woodlands before you are well known throughout Arax and people avoid the area like the plague. Unfortunately you do not have that luxury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been charged with the responsibility of tracking down the legendary Thunderhammer, a dwarven weapon of great power. It was stolen from the dwarfs of Valijr Keep a little over a week ago but a dwarf-turned-traitor named Brok. The once respected warrior fled with the Thunderhammer to the west, and you have managed to track him to the edge of Ghostwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He must have been desperate to escape to have entered the forest, you reason to yourself; either that or Brok was insane. His reasons for stealing the weapon are still unknown at this point, though bribery or outside influence are suspected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take a deep breath and prepare to enter Ghostwood. You have a really bad feeling about this, but the dwarfs are paying you good money; that overrides your fear of what you may find so, drawing your weapon, you begin your trek into the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
