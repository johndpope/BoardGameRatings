							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Handicap Harness Racing</name>
									
			<description>A game that simulates harness racing and teaches the player to handicap, or predict real harness racing results.  The game starts with Race #4.  The previous Races (1,2,3) have already taken place and data from these races have been recorded on the Past Performance Chart.  In actual harness racing there are various sources where you can gather the information that is needed to create a Past Performance Chart for actual horses &amp;amp; drivers.  So based on the Past Performance chart you decided how much risk that you can take and place wagers on the race.  The movement of the horses is based on the Past Performance chart data with probabilities of different outcomes based on a history of actual races.  These probabilities are realized in the game thru movement cards and a spinner.  The movement mechanism does not take into account all of the information that is recommended to be collected for making bets at the track.  However, to take everything into account would make for an overly analytical game and would present the false concept that predicting races is just a matter of math.  The game instructions explain all of the common terms and concepts that are considered important when deciding what bets to place.  And it presents a logical method for recording important information needed to place bets.  If you ignore the educational aspects of the game it is a fun game.  The pawns movement mechanism is similar to the more well known Win Place &amp;amp; Show.  In each round the rigs have a movement for the round and then two of the pawns receive bonus movement.  The races in this game are much shorter than most other race games, about 4 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
