			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;Bad North is a beautifully-crafted, minimalistic, real-time tactics roguelite game where you lead a rag-tag group of island folk as they flee the relentless viking hordes. Progress through a series of procedurally-generated islands, fending off nordic raiders and gather what resources you can, before moving on to the next fight. Protect the nobles and commoners you meet along the way and recruit them to your cause - you'll need their numbers in the conflict to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And keep fighting. Not for power or riches or glory, but for the hope that one day you can live a peaceful life again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Charming Brutality: The tiny islands and adorable soldiers belie the true violence of war. As each level progresses, the landscape is soaked in the blood of your friends and foes, reminding you this is truly a fight for survival.&lt;br/&gt;    Deceptive Simplicity: Positioning is everything! You control the broad strokes of the battle, and your soldiers do the rest. *Holding chokepoints, reacting quickly and knowing when to retreat are the keys to victory. The balance always rests on a knife edge.&lt;br/&gt;    Accessible Depth: Hiding behind simple controls are layers of complex systems, with every soldier individually simulated. *Tactical mastery of Bad North comes from feeling out these systems and observing soldiers' behaviours, rather than crunching numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Release expected for Summer 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
