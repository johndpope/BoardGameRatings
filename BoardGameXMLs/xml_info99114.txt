			<description>Niborea game is an online fantasy multiplayer game. A player becomes the prince, whose Stepmother used intrigues to take the throne from him. Something like that cannot be just passively accepted, therefore the throne needs to be retaken and avenge oneself. &lt;br/&gt;Player&amp;rsquo;s objective is to build a powerful city and overcome the obstacles to achieve his goal. In this fight he has to ally or compete with other players. &lt;br/&gt;Niborea is a mixture of building strategy of gaining resources and building a fort, and a so called role-playing game where a player controls the hero by assigning him on quests, looks after his equipment and make him to progress to higher levels.&lt;br/&gt;Interaction between players is crucial. Players can slow each other down, do some damage or help each other on the way to their goal. In Niborea no one can be definitely destroyed. After every attack you can get back on your feet and revenge yourself! &lt;br/&gt;Besides finishing the story you can achieve the victory over a continent, on which are 15-25 players. The winner here is the player or an alliance with enough victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
