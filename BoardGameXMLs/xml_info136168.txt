							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Namer: A Dungeon World Compatible Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People are so careless with names. They spill them forth from their lips wantonly, uncaring, without the reverence and respect they deserve. You know better. You know so many secret names, a disciple of the True Tongue, the language by which the world was shaped. You know the power of names, the power they have over the fey lords, great spirits and even the Gods themselves. You paid dearly to find yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have begun to learn, you can never stop. The words that were once a trickle became a torrent, a flood, an ocean that threatens to engulf you should you fail to exercise care. You must learn them all. Not for you the petty notions of spellcraft or paying service to the name of merely a single God. You wield names with respect, and guard yours carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And with every name you know, you control more of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Namer is a new class for use with Dungeon World. It commands the true names of the world to alter reality itself. This also includes two new compendium classes, the necromantic Deathspeaker and studious Wandering Scholar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
