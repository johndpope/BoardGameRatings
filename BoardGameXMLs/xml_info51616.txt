			<description>Each player starts with 2 Even Cards face-up.  Players take turns rolling a die to determine whether they will draw a card from the Even or Odd deck of cards.  The Even cards are all point cards.  The Odd cards make players lose a turn, lose an Even card, or take an Even card from another player.  Once one player has 100 points of even cards they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
