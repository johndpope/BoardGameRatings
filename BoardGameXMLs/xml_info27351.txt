			<description>Operaatio Panda is a game in which you take part in saving endangered species throughout the different parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players' objective is to find and then deliver these animals back to their native habitat from the hands of the poachers (people who hunt these animals and sell them to live in unnatural places). You can also find poachers throughout the game and deliver them to be punished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All good actions earns you a diploma; the winner being decided by how many of these you've collected during the game. You can also earn or lose these by drawing from the &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; deck, in which you have different features; for example a one-way ticket to any location on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by rolling the dice, then moving around the board in search of the rare species. And trying to avoid letting other players take advantage of your situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
