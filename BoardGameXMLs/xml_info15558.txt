							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunchback of Notre Dame: Electronic Talking Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of this game, based on the Disney film, is to be the first player to rescue Esmeralda by occupying the same space she is on. The game features a colorful 3-D gameboard and an electronic sound module. On your turn, you press the module &amp;quot;PLAY&amp;quot; button, listen to the voices or sounds, and move accordingly. If you hear Phoebus and Quasimodo, you spin the spinner and move to any space of the same color shown. If you hear Esmeralda and Djali, you move the Esmeralda piece to a different space with her picture on it. If you hear Frollo, you're sent back to Start. If you hear the bells of Notre Dame, you move one, two or tree spaces depending on how many &amp;quot;clangs&amp;quot; you hear. The winner is the first player to move onto the space that the Esmeralda piece occupies, or, if your on an Esmeralda space, to have her move to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
