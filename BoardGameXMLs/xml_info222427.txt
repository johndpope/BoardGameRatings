							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jester&#039;s Tomb</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The king considered Dunham to be his best advisor. When the king died, the Jester ruled the kingdom as Steward for several years until the king's grandson could take his place as rightful ruler. Several years later, Dunham died and was laid to rest in a crypt he had designed himself. Always the jester at heart, he built many tricks and puzzles to protect his final resting place, and his treasure. As well prepared Adventurers you have learned several clues before entering: Dunham always insisted on being paid in Silver and he felt that The King was a little to vain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
