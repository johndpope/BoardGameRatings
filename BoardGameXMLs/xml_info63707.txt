							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Weekend</name>
									
			<description>This is a family game for 3 or 4 players. The players take the role of the parents and one or two children. Object of the game is to try to push their wishes for the weekend through.&lt;br/&gt;Wishes for the father are e.g. &amp;quot;Father promised to go to the circus with his son and daughter. Now he would rather read a book.&amp;quot; Now everybody has to pick one of his 15 cards with points from &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;. If the father has more points than the others alltogether he can take a shortcut on the gameboard. If he has less or equal to the others he has to take the regular track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
