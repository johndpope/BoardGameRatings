							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruin Job</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruin Job is a scenario designed by Rodney Thompson for the Dusk City Outlaws tabletop roleplaying game. This Job is meant to be played over the course of 6-8 hours and involves bringing about the financial ruin of an unscrupulous nobleman who buys peoples' debts to make them into his indentured servants. Your crew must find a way to get rob a man who has no material wealth, get past the counting house staff responsible for maintaining the lord's finances, cut off the support of the Church of the Silver Judge, and deal with a pirate captain secretly in league with the noble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruin Job is a scenario intended for experienced Dusk City Outlaws crews and Judges. It breaks the usual format of Jobs in that there is nothing to steal, break, or kill, and the only possibility of success lies in conning, coercing, or convincing a nobleman to do something foolish with his vast, intangible wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
