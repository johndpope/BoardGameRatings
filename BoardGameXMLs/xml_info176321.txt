			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 4-6 characters of level 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipwrecked on an island though not because of bad weather or a hostile sea but because something massive came out of it and smashed the ship to pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What on earth was that thing, and what&amp;rsquo;s so important about this island that no one&amp;rsquo;s supposed to leave it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is the whole place teeming with divine servitors almost as if every god wishes to have a representative here, and what on earth happened to the civilisation that used to once call this place &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most importantly of all: How are you supposed to get away?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Dollar Dungeons are standalone adventures designed to be logical, entertaining, challenging and balanced, and easily integrated into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure has enough material to last three or more playing sessions and enough experience to raise four characters of the appropriate level up by one extra level. Treasure is commensurate with the encounter challenges faced. Scaling information is included for adventuring parties of five or six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set on the island of Serafina, somewhere &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure also contains optional Psionic elements with all of the relevant rules present within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
