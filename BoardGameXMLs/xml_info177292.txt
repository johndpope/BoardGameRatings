			<description>Players in 桜 (Sakura) want to empty their hand of cards before anyone else. Each player starts with 7-10 cards, and the sakura petal-shaped cards come in four suits with three types of special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you can play one card to the table to start a new bloom (with up to three blooms being in play at once), add one or more matching cards to an existing bloom (with no more than five cards in the bloom), play a special card, or (if you can't play anything) discard one card, then draw one. If you place the fifth card in a bloom, remove those cards, then play one standard card to start a new bloom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to empty their hand of cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game, continue play until two players have emptied their hands, with the first player scoring 2 points and the second player 1 point. Play multiple rounds, and the player who first has 5 points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
