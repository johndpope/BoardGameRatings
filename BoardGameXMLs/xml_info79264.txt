			<description>Faces of War (originally known as Outfront II) is a real-time strategy and real-time tactics computer wargame published by Russian publisher 1C Company and developed by Ukrainian developer Best Way. The game is a sequel to 2004's Soldiers: Heroes of World War II. Whereas Soldiers had the player controlling a handful of squad members alone in enemy territory, Faces of War engages the player and his squad in massive battles fighting alongside AI controlled squads. The game features a full 3D engine allowing the player to have much greater control over the camera compared to Soldiers. The engine also allows nearly full environmental destruction. The developers have also improved the multiplayer options from the last game, with many more modes and options. The game was released in Russia on September 8, 2006 and North America for PC on September 12, 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Faces of War , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
