			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kard Combat is a strategy game in the form of a card game.  You select a type of mage: Machine, Holy, Death, or Domination.  Then you are given a deck of cards from five elements.  The first four elements (Wind, Fire, Water, and Air) are shared between the four mage types, but they each have their individual schools of magic with their own types of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a story mode where you climb a tower with each mage type, unlocking more and more cards for use in your deck.  There is also single duel, which is exactly what it says: One battle versus AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has multiplayer mode, versus friends on the OpenFeint game network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
