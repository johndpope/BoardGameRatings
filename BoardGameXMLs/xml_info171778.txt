			<description>Stockyards is a trick-taking, set collection, economic card game for two to four players. In the game, players are selling sheep, swine, and steer to the auction house at wholesale price. After the wholesale pay out, an auction commences. The players leverage trick-taking mechanism to win a meat-packing company a lot of livestock while earning a commission. After earning a commission minus any penalties, the non-winning players may attempt to fulfill contracts using a set collection mechanism. Players will place contracts secretly on a company. At the end of the game, the contracts are revealed for each company and livestock are processed earning the contracting player money. If a contract is not fulfilled, the player loses money. The game lasts for ten rounds and the player with the most money at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
