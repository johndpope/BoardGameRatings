			<description>'You Don't Say' is a word game played over multiple rounds, where players attempt to guess a specific word based on the verbal clues provided. &lt;br/&gt;Players are first divided into 2-4 teams of at least 2 people, who are either the 'Clue Givers' or 'Guessers', which may change between turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the 'guessers' attempt to determine the mystery word, the clue givers are restricted by 3 simple rules:&lt;br/&gt;-Cannot spell all or part of the word&lt;br/&gt;-Cannot use the word itself, in any form&lt;br/&gt;-Cannot use 'rhymes with' or 'sounds like' clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn lasts the length of the included timer (about 1 minute) and so multiple word clues may be attempted if teams talk and answer fast.&lt;br/&gt;Teams progress around the board based on the number of correctly guessed words each turn, plus a roll of the random 'bonus die'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team to reach the 'FINISH' space on the gameboard is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;The Talk FAST, guess FASTER game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talk about it. Act it out...But DON'T SAY IT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Don't Say is the hilarious, high-energy guessing game where fast talkers team with fast guessers to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get your teammates to guess words based on your clues, without saying the words. The more they answer correctly, the father you move on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With six world-encompassing categories and 3000 simple-to-challenging words, YOU DON'T SAY is fast-talking, quick-moving fun for everyone! 500 Cards! 3000 Words!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
