			<description>&amp;quot;Strength &amp;amp; Honour by Magitech is a Microsoft Windows PC game of global domination that combines turn-based empire building and epic real-time tactics. Nations can belong to civilizations ranging from the Romans and Carthaginians in the west, to the West Indians and Chinese in the east.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is around 200 BC. You choose your ruler and kingdom. You hand pick the members of your cabinate, governors of your cities, and the marshals and generals of your armies. Each Character in the game has a number of attributes which dictates their personality. Among these attributes include honor, ambition, loyalty, political ability, leadership ability, fighting ability, naval ability, and popularity. Each of these attributes may help you decide which character is the most appropriate to be appointed to your cabinate position.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Strength &amp;amp; Honour&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
