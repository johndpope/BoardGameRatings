			<description>Objective: to be the first player to hold a hand of plus cards that add up to one dollar without having any minus cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a hand of five cards.  Players draw one card from draw pile. Minus cards may be discarded by discarding a plus card of the same value at the same time.  If there are no minus cards in a player's hand, play moves to the next player.  Play continues, with the discard pile being shuffled to form a new draw pile, until one player reaches the objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
