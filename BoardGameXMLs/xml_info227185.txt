			<description>Each player gets an bank account and pocket money. There is also a joint account. Each player has to get from space 1 to space 120 (Raiffeisen symbol). Movement is determined by a die. On some spaces events benefit or hinder the players, mostly by gaining or losing money. The first player to reach space 120 gets half of the joint account, the next one half of the rest and so on. The player with the most money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing money pictures Deutsche Mark banknotes that were first issued 1961 and 1963.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
