			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a 48 x 30 inch full-color, map of Downtown section of a SciFi City , with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The Zip file contains the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s make this bank crumble, steal the vault, transport it to our lair, and crack it open at our leisure! We&amp;rsquo;ll have enough cash for ray guns for all of us! Muah ha ha!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Cash Strapped Mad Scientist to his Henchmen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downtown is a single level exterior and interior map of a downtown intersection that includes a subway entrance with a food court specializing in pizza, an eat-in diner, a small enclosed park, a bank, a movie theater, and a bowling alley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downtown is intended for use in high-tech modern or near-future science fiction games. The bank makes it a good map for use in a heist game in a supers game or cyberpunk game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villains at Work: An adventure hook idea for use with Subway Station and Trains: Modern (which includes subway cars). The super villain&amp;rsquo;s henchmen are posing as subway construction workers underground. In the guise of subway expansion, they are building a sub-tunnel underneath the bank that connects to the main track. They&amp;rsquo;ve used the tunnel to position a wheeled drilling vehicle with a trailer directly underneath where the vault should be located. When the true heist begins they drill upwards to make the vault fall through the floor onto the trailer. If their auger breaks, they have a backup of explosives to blow up the bank floor and drop the safe. After that they drive the vehicle to the main subway line and attempt to flee with the vault after transferring it to a faster subway car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group can get involved as superheroes or police attempting to apprehend the criminals after the heist begins. Alternatively, they can be playing supervillains or criminals trying to pull off the heist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
