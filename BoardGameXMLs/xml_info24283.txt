			<description>&amp;quot;A Bible-centered word building game for ages 9 and up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Scrabble-like board and letter tiles is used by a &amp;quot;Leader&amp;quot; to form five to eleven words related to the Bible, face-down except for the first letter.  Each square on the board has one, two, or three dots.  Players have tokens that move around the letters of the alphabet that encircle the board.  These letters have a numerical value associated with each, with (like Scrabble) the less often used letters having a higher value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players guess a letter in a single word, but are restricted to guessing the letter their token is on or one of the next seven letters.  The Leader moderates.  Players get points based on the value of the letter correctly guessed times the number of dots in the square it rests on.  Players may move their token ahead seven letters around the board instead of guessing, to get within range of a letter they want to guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Leader keeps score, and the leading scorer when all the words are guessed wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
