							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bioprospecting Report No. 976</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent unexpected seismic activity of the extinct volcano on Mt. Hidrasu, has become the main focus of the study of our Institute. After careful investigation of the information and samples collected during the prospecting expedition to Mt. Hidrasu, we can now confirm that the cause of the disturbance is not the volcano itself, but the mysterious organism which inhabits the volcanic cone. Although the most impressive characteristic of this creature is its colossal size, it remained unknown until now due to the fact that it is a sessile organism, buried deep in the volcanic crater, with only minute portion of its anterior part protruding above the ground. In this report we intend to present the key aspects of this organism's morphology and physiology as a means to better understand its function and place in the nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
