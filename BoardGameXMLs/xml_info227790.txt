			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fastest wordgame in the west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to shout a word that contains at least one letter from each of the 2 central cards AND at least one letter from each face-up card in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start with, you have no cards in front of you, so including a specific 2 letters will get you a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game goes on, better players will have more and more cards in front of themselves. This gives the game escalating difficulty, and also provides a catchup mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of many games playable with the Wibbell++ deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
