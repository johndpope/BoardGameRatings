			<description>Silly, speedy recognition and slams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone starts with one card and then grabs others (one at a time) as fast as they can. Each card must match either the border pattern or letter of the one before. Each card is a point. If you make a mistake you score 0!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any time, you can stop playing and shout 'Grabbell!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last person to stop playing gets as many bonus points as there are cards remaining on the table. Everyone else gets 10 bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are passed left, to be checked and counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A winner is declared and you'll probably want to play again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of many games playable with the Wibbell++ deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
