			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever watched a movie or read a book and wondered what stats the characters would have when they would be characters from your favourite RPG? Or have you ever wondered that your RPG character cannot do the things he should be able to do because you learned the wrong skills in the beginning? If you answered one or both questions with yes than storytelling-RPGs like Storychips might have something to offer for you. The general idea is that the players describe what they like to do and that they succeed if they can convince the gamemaster that they can do what they want to do and/or that it is good for the story if they have success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one problem that can arise with these storytelling games: If everybody can do everything he can explain good enough than it is not really a game but rather creative &amp;quot;writing&amp;quot; in a group. This does not have to be a bad thing. Telling stories to each other or making up stories together is a great pastime but if you want to have a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; game you have to add something else. In the case of Storychips the storychips are this little something. In chapter 2 I will explain how they work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
