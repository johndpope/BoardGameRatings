							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Busty Barbarian Bimbos (/tg/ edition)</name>
									
			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;A parody roleplaying game conceived by accident by the /tg/ forum a while back that snowballed a bit. Original concept by an anonymous poster on 4chan. Early development by a cabal of anonymous posters. Development and finishing work (such as it is) by Burrowing Owl Publications staff. Art edited and used without permission in the spirit of fair use (including but not limited to personal non-commercial use and satire as justification). Not for sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dedicated to the ladies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This is a version prior to the development for publication.  The file is attributed only to Burrowing Owl Publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
