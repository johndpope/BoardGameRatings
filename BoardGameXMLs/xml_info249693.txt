							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super BBQ Barbecue Game</name>
									
			<description>Super BBQ Barbecue Game is a dexterity game where players score points by using tongs to pick up plastic food from a toy barbecue grill.  Food starts out on its uncooked side and is harder to pick up.  A timer causes the grill to jump periodically, flipping some food to its cooked (and easier to pick up) side.  When all the food is picked up from the grill, players total their points and the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summmary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
