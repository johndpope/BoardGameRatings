							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crucible: Processing Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crucible-class is a medium-sized station designed to convert raw materials into finished goods. Some stations are used as industrial ore processing stations or gas mines. Others are employed as military academies or civilian training facilities - transforming recruits into professionals. Still others may process nothing but wealth and power as corporate outposts or crime syndicate headquarters. These stations have room for a hundred personnel and boast a variety of facilities to suit a wide range of duties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crucible package contains several highly detailed, layered PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Main Book&lt;br/&gt;        19 page PDF file detailing the station and interior areas.&lt;br/&gt;        Contains several 3D rendered scenes as well as orthographic views.&lt;br/&gt;        Includes system independent statistics designed for easy adaption to your game of choice.&lt;br/&gt;        Background, art, and text are on different layers for custom display and printing.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Map Pages&lt;br/&gt;        64 page PDF file containing complete interior maps and instructions for assembly.&lt;br/&gt;        Miniature-scale maps for tactical combat with an optional 1 inch = 5 ft grid.&lt;br/&gt;        Divided into pages for easy printing in full color or printer-friendly black and white.&lt;br/&gt;        Selectable layers include: grid, black &amp;amp; white version, optional objects, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Uncut Map Images&lt;br/&gt;        Four single page PDF files containing giant images of the complete deckplans.&lt;br/&gt;        The Hub image is 29x33 inches; the ring is broken into three sectors of 23x37 inches each.&lt;br/&gt;        Select either a light or dark background (for printing or projection/display).&lt;br/&gt;        Includes layers for grid, black &amp;amp; white version, optional cargo, and background choice.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crucible-class is referred to as a station rather than a ship, though a case could be made for either label. The craft has all of the systems and most of the capabilities of a starship of similar size. But it is ring shaped, rotates, and cannot make planetfall. It is also very slow &amp;ndash; being designed to move into place and then remain in that location or orbit for a long period of time. In the end, the label more describes the purpose, rather than the capabilities, of the vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
