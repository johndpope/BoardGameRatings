			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So this is the Ffenargh? Mile after mile of stinking bogs overlain by a swirling mist that clings to the skin and chills to the bone. Ahead, a decrepit causeway rises scant inches above the fetid waters and meanders its way through the twisted forms of stunted trees into the depths of this forsaken land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, these blighted fens have been ignored by the outside world, but now an urgent summons brings you into the Ffenargh, to the Court of the Lords Spiritual at Eylea. A foul murder has been committed. Geoffrey D'Arcy, Lord of Myrkfast, has been slain by his own son and you are called upon to find out why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death has always hung heavy over this mire, but now an ancient evil has returned to haunt the mist - an evil whose icy fingers reach out to crush any who dare delve its secrets. You who have faced death a thousand times, meet it now in ts most terrible guise. Can you defeat it, or will you fall victim to the Ravager of Time?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;the PDF file includes the map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
