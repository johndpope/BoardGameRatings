			<description>Speedway Challenge is a quick playing card game based on motorcycle speedway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races feature 4 riders, with rules for 2/3/4 players determining hand size and whether you control one or two riders each - how many races you play is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A race consists of 5 rounds, with players playing one card per round for each of their riders.  The concept being that the track has 3 lanes (the white line, middle, and round the boards), with bikes only able to play cards in either unblocked lanes, or with a value lower than a bike already occupying a lane that turn.  Since the leading bike gets first play the next turn, there is plenty of opportunity for blocking and jockeying for position before the end of the final lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added to this are the chance of falls, injuries, start line infringements or even mechanical failures, to give a wide variety of race outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
