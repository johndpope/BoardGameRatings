							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blue Marlin</name>
									
			<description>The Blue Marlin is a video game released by Hot-B for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Following in the tradition of its predecessor, The Black Bass, the objective is to win a tournament by catching the biggest fish in the time alloted. The Blue Marlin features four tournament rounds (one in Florida and the other three in Hawaii).&lt;br/&gt;.....&lt;br/&gt;The Blue Marlin features a password system to save the player's progress. A password is generated at the end of every tournament round, and after the tournament is completed (with the player victorious). If the player uses this password to begin a new tournament, they can start over with all of their attributes from their previous game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Blue Marlin&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
