			<description>Take from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook for the 3.5 OGL and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is designed to help make the game seem fresh and new again by providing three brand-new and customizable methods of character creation which emphasize fun and unique characters. These range from the simple, such as Astrological character creation, to the very involved, like the &amp;ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&amp;rdquo; style of character creation. Also included are several &amp;ldquo;mini-adventures&amp;rdquo; designed to get a campaign off to a good start by providing hooks which bring parties together, and adventures which are both memorable and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
