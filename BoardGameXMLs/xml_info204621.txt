							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shoot-Out Hockey</name>
									
			<description>Tabletop sports hockey game, played with either Fast Action Cards (FAC) or dice. Each FAC that is flipped represents an amount of in-game minutes. If value on FAC exists in either team's scoring range, then a scoring chance is processed. Individual team cards list the roster of the team along with each player's ratings, including references for goal scorers, assist ratings, and fight ratings. Team cards also contain individual goalie ratings with home and away ratings. Shoot-Out Hockey focuses on fast &amp;amp; abstracted play rather then other tabletop hockey games that feature individual player cards. Season sets include one card per team that lists all individual players (with extra players listed in separate text file) from that team. Individual historical seasons also available. (This game re-implements &amp;quot;Player Of The Game Hockey&amp;quot; from Downey Games.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
