			<description>Made in the USA is different than any other game you have ever played; it combines elements of card and board games and dominoes. Players create four lines of play using the four different patriotic suits. Players have the freedom to play as many cards as connect, or unit, to each other. For example, you may play a Seven, Eight and Nine of Stars, then play an Eight of Eagles. Play cards that connect to other players' cards. But when you change lines/suits then you will need to draw a &amp;quot;Changes in the Wind&amp;quot; card - so even when you think you have won, the round might not be finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User review: Each player is dealt a hand of cards. The number of cards dealt to each player varies with the number of participants. In turn, a player can add to the cards in the array in the middle of the table. Cards of the same rank are placed in the same row. The cards must be ranked in ascending order from top to bottom. Cards of the same suit must be placed in the same row. Event cards may be played at the beginning or end of one&amp;rsquo;s turn. The &amp;quot;Changes in the Wind&amp;quot; cards are a separate draw pile. These cards are drawn whenever a player begins a new row.&lt;br/&gt;The hand is over when one player&amp;rsquo;s hand is depleted. The other players are penalized for cards remaining in their hands. The game is over when someone has been penalized 500 points. The player with the lowest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
