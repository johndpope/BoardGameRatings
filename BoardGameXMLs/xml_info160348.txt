			<description>18SA is an 18xx game which is set in South America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock certificates of eleven railroad companies. The player with the most stock of a particular company in his possession acts as the president of this company and is responsible for track laying, the placement of railheads (which are necessary for train runs), route selection and train acquisition. Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares - and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game differs from the usual 18xx games a little, as it uses different tokens for either passenger trains or freight trains. The companies also face a lot of building costs - mountains, Amazonas swamps, and crossing a border into another country costs extra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
