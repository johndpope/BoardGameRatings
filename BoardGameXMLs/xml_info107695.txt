			<description>CyberTank! is a set of rules for an arena combat game involving futuristic tanks. (The players provide their own hex map, counters, and dice.) Tanks have elaborate designs, with many different possible types of weapon, different firing arcs for the weapons, drones, armor, ECM and ECCM, wheeled vs. tracked movement, etc. A number of sample designs are provided and players are encouraged to create their own. The game system is fairly simple, with most of the complexity coming from the interaction of the various systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was made available at a 1992 convention as a &amp;quot;pre-edition beta.&amp;quot; It is not certain if there were any further versions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
