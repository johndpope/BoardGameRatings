			<description>Neverland is a Team Partnership, Card Drafting, Take That game with a light Hidden Identity element set in the world of J. M. Barrie&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Neverland&amp;rdquo;.  Players divide into teams and take on the role of Peter Pan, Tink, The Lost Boys, Hook, Smee and The Pirates and battle each other for a stash of treasure.  The team with the most treasure at the end of the game, wins... though players can attack and defend others, steal treasure, of dodge the Croc all in an effort to defeat the other team, and gather all the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played simultaneously and resolved in a rotating order.  Players can either gather treasure cards from a shared deck, steal treasure cards from other players or start the battles by playing attack or defend cards, targeting their opponents.  If the team captains suffer 2 wounds, the game ends and the team with the most treasure win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
