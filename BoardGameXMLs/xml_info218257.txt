							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great War in the Classroom</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many students are turned off by history because it seems to be nothing more than a litany of names, dates, facts, battles, and kings. They do not realize that above all else, history is about imagination. It is a particular kind of imagination&amp;mdash;one that is grounded in the sources upon which it is based&amp;mdash;but no less creative because of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game attempts to recreate Great War events and explore alternative outcomes by utilizing classroom-based roleplaying simulation.  Players in the game are members of a national government and alternate discussion sessions with computer simulation based on group inputs.  The instructor acts as the &amp;quot;game master&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
