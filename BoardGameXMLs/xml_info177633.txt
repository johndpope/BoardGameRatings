							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ciak! Il gioco di carte</name>
									
			<description>Ciak! is a card game where several pictures companies fight for the dominance of Lollywood, recruiting actors, crew members, all-time-legends in order to &amp;quot;pillage&amp;quot; other companies and eliminate them from the game, by making then loose all their &amp;quot;dominance&amp;quot; points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical LCG mechanics are reimplemented in this new setting, and several game modes are available: team game, free for all, one against all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns, divided in phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 1: the active player draws a card from the pile and gains 1 million.&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 2: the active player recruits from his/her hand actors, crew members, all-time-legends, paying their cost in millions, when present. Other players can use &amp;quot;istant speed&amp;quot; abilities and cards.&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 3: The active player chooses an opponent to attack him/her. After performing a successfull attack roll, the attacking player sums all the attack values of his/her recruited cards, while the defending player adds his/her defence values. Istant speed abilities and cards can be used to modify such results. If the attacking player wins, he/she performs a pillage action: the defending player will loose one o more dominance points. If the defending player wins, he/she can damage one of the attacking payer's recruited cards.&lt;br/&gt;    Phase 4: same as Phase 2. At the end of this phase, all damage and activeted abilities are cleared off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A company which looses its last dominance points is eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
