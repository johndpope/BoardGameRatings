			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Module HV1&lt;br/&gt;A 3.5 OGL Fantasy Adventure for Characters Level 4-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: This is not an adventure for the faint of heart! We nearly slapped a parental warning on this module. Some of the situations your players experience in this adventure will stay with them for years to come. You&amp;rsquo;ll take yourself and your players to new extremes when you venture Under the Veil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So read on brave gamer...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background Himmelveil - City of Heaven - on the surface, the jewel of the Talon Kingdom, seat of power of the Talon Kings, a huge and glorious city that has endured for centuries. But under the surface? A seething cauldron of political intrigue, kidnapping, drug running and human sacrifice; an underworld dominated by greed and corruption at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The king is dying and has no heir. As the borders of the kingdom strain under the threat of war from neighbouring Worheim and Crenn, the Dukes and Barons of the kingdom vie for position in the struggle for succession that will follow the king&amp;rsquo;s death. A marriage designed to cement a bloc of two powerful duchies is planned, but just days before the wedding, the erstwhile bride is kidnapped. The kingdom is on the brink of anarchy! Meanwhile, out on the mean streets, a dark plot based on the exploitation of thousands is unfolding&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having recently returned to Himmelveil to enjoy the spoils of your latest adventures, you receive a request from a very powerful man in a desperate situation: &amp;ldquo;Find my daughter!&amp;rdquo; says the Duke, &amp;ldquo;and you will be richly rewarded. Fail and it may mean the end of the Talon Kingdom as we know it.&amp;rdquo; And so you descend, into the dank and murky netherworld that lies beneath the gleaming fa&amp;ccedil;ade of the City of Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a module&amp;hellip; When you buy a WorldWorks adventure module, you don&amp;rsquo;t just get a great adventure, you get new and unique model sets to fit out your tacticals, dress up your tabletop and bring your game to life! WorldWorks leads the industry in beautiful, downloadable cardstock scenery for games of all kinds and this module is no exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Under the Veil module and the Thoumont&amp;rsquo;s Magic Shop set you have the elements to thrill your players in the gritty urban setting of the ancient city. Under the Veil also features floorplans that take the classic WorldWorks model set Pubs and Inns to a new level, and includes a handful of new bits and pieces designed to fit into the Pubs and Inns set. Gothic Realms is also recommended (what can we say, the adventure is just that big).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No figures? No problem! Under the Veil comes with a complete set of standees for every nasty NPC and vicious monster your characters are likely to encounter, from the squirming swarm of giant centipedes to the Valdsparian vampire lord, Count Khachzcyk. Over 20 new standees!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illustrations and handouts The module is illustrated throughout in loving detail by Matthew Cuenca and, of course, includes a set of beautifully-crafted player handouts and floorplans, the clues that will lead your players to the locations where they will uncover the horrific truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out what lies Under the Veil now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome!&lt;br/&gt;Hi there, hope you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a dark and nasty city underworld adventure full of political intrigue, exploitation, kidnapping, betrayal and gratuitous violence, because THAT&amp;rsquo;S WHAT YOU&amp;rsquo;RE HOLDING!&lt;br/&gt;This module is designed to work with (though it does not require) the WorldWorks Games model sets Dungeonworks:Gothic Realms&amp;trade;, Thoumont&amp;rsquo;s&amp;trade;, and Pubs and Inns&amp;trade;, available for purchase online at WorldWorks Games official website &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.worldworksgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.worldworksgames.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;lsquo;ve also included folded paper character markers (&amp;lsquo;standees&amp;rsquo;) for the pre-generated characters, nonplayer characters and the various creatures that may be encountered, if you want to use them.&lt;br/&gt;Under the veil is a d20-system adventure for a level 6 party.&lt;br/&gt;The module is set in the city of Himmelveil, largest city in the Talon Kingdom, a country on the northern shore of the Mysserian Sea in the land of Arcraetia. The story throws the party into a plot to influence the royal succession of the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
