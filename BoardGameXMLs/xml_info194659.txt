These warlords are the clan leaders of specific territories.  Each have characteristics that are based on history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, in secret, choose a castle territory.  When all players choose their castle territory players place their castle into their castle territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clan tokens are placed in territories owned.  Players who wish to make certain warlords strong will stack clan tokens into these warlords.  Clan tokens represent both 1000 samurai and 1 HP for that character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players make 3 actions in turn.  This happens twice which represents 1 decade or 1 round of play.  Players draw cards and get Clan Token bonuses after each half decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions:  Bribe, attack, move, castle movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bribe:  Bribe an adjoining warlord by committing 1 clan token to the action.  11 or 12 must be rolled on the dice.  If successful the committed clan token goes on top of the enemy warlord and his character card is given to the attacking player.  The warlord has switched sides.  If the bribe is unsuccessful the committed clan token gets put into the clan token stack of the adjoining warlord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack:&lt;br/&gt;Attack an adjoining enemy.  Advance as many warlords and their samurai armies to the border of the enemy territory.  The enemy may play cards against you at this time, do defensive troop movements.  The attacker may also play cards against the enemy.  Once card play is completed the attacker must choose which warlord will go into the duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The warlords duel!  D12's are rolled.  The attacker always gets +1 and the difference of the dice determines the damage.  Damage is counted by removing Clan Tokens from the stack of the warlord.  In a duel, the Clan Tokens now represent the HP of the warlord for the duel.  When Clan Tokens are gone the warlord is slain and the victor can move as many or no warlords and/or clan tokens into the claimed territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement Action: During a player's turn they may move as many warlords and/or clan tokens from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Movement Action: requiring an entire decade (4 actions) a player may move their castle from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of Game:&lt;br/&gt;Destroy all enemy castles.  If your castle remains standing you win.  Or, Dueling Samurai has a points scoring system that lets players end the game at the end of any half decade.  This being a tested tournament game, the points scoring system is easy to follow and very well developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Play:&lt;br/&gt;Players may play cards at any time in the game, making this a highly engaging and interactive board game.  &lt;br/&gt;Bonus Cards: (Archers, Dueling Samurai, Horses and Ambush)  These have individual use in the game, but can also be combined during your turn to get more clan tokens.  There is a very challenging balance between hording these cards and using them for combat making the strategy very deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament Cards: (Sumo and Dojo)&lt;br/&gt;Host a tournament.  If you win there are big rewards.  If you lose it can be a devastating turning point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack Cards:  Religious Conversion, Spy, Ninja, Small Pox Demons, Demons, Revenge, Sniper Cannons, Riflemen, Battering Rams, Cannons, Navy, Assassin, Ronin, Pirates, Bandits, Inciting Revolt.  These cards (other than Ninja) can be played at any time in the game.  Each utilize D12 or D6 to deal damage.  1's are always fails and so are 2's on D12's.  On fails players roll against themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defense Cards: These are used to block attack cards, often reversing the attack to a more devastating effect.  Some of them can be played anytime you are under attack, providing a defensive attack option.  Chinese medicine, Knife Cart, Furious Defense, Scouts, Gold, Bushido, Seppuku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peace Cards:  These are used to create peace.  Each card causes a different type of peace based on geography and the location of the clans that go into a truce.  Diplomacy (by Marriage, Decree of the Emperor or by Hostage Exchange), Peace Pipe, Brothels, Festival, Ceremony, Gambling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
