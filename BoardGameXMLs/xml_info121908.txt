							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tiny Skweeks</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A puzzle game. Skweek's numerous offspring were on their way to a youth camp but they decided they wanted to see Earth instead and hijacked their space shuttle. Skweek has sent you a telegram warning you, and now you must catch each of Skweek's children before they reach Earth and start painting everything pink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level has several skweeks of different colours. You must move each of them to a tile matching their colour. Once a skweek is ordered to move in a direction, she doesn't stop until she reaches an obstacle. There are many obstacles, like one-way tiles, teleporters, ice...), as well as bonuses that can be picked up if a skweek walks on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 101 levels, each with a password.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
