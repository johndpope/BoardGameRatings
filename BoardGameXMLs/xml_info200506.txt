							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NYC IQ: The Trivia Game For New Yorkers</name>
									
			<description>The ultimate test of city smarts for the Big Apple! This trivia game allows diehard natives, new arrivals, and nostalgic transplants to prove they know the city better than anyone. The game comes with 400 multiple-choice questions spanning all five boroughs; correct answers are counted as IQ points, and the winner is granted NYC insider status. From Harlem to Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen, the Guggenheim to the Gowanus Canal, Fashion Week to Yankees-speak to Knickerbocker lore and more, this game rewards those truly in the know, while revealing hidden secrets that will surprise even the most knowledgeable New Yorkers. Sleek graphics and game components ensure that this simple but sophisticated package will be displayed on the cityphile&amp;rsquo;s coffee table, seized at dinner parties, and lingered over for serious fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
