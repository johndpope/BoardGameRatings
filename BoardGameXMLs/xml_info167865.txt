			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You spawn the game in a house not belonging to you, with nothing but a torch and a checklist of things to &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot;. You only have a few minutes to grab what you can from the list before the owner gets home. You can play it safe and grab a few things, or try to outrun the owner in their own house and grab as much as possible. The location of some items move from game to game and the checklist changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
