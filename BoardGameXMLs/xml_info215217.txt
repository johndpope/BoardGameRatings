			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owlkeep Academy is a story roleplaying game about the fallout of a magical war. Thirty years ago a civil war was fought inside the walls of Owlkeep Academy, a secret school for children with &amp;lsquo;the gift.&amp;rsquo; The victors stumbled out of the war as masters of their craft, but also as victims of unspeakable horrors. Over the intervening years, those same veterans found they didn&amp;rsquo;t belong in the mundane world. They never &amp;lsquo;quite fit in.&amp;rsquo; Today, they&amp;rsquo;ve returned to Owlkeep to rebuild the academy and mentor the newest students, bringing with them their mastery&amp;hellip; and their baggage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
