			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You kill the dragon!  :gasp:  Now what?  THE TREASURE!!!  The players&amp;rsquo; mouths are watering, and then they hear the GM say, &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s 1,000 gold coins for each of you, write it down on your character sheets.&amp;rdquo;  Whoa!  What a let down.  This is a role-playing game, right?  Fantasy, mystery, cool stuff.  And all the dragon had was gold coins?  Oh, what the GM meant to say was there&amp;rsquo;s all sorts of stuff, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth 1,000gc each.  OK, that&amp;rsquo;s no better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic fantasy games need epic treasures.  No one expects every player to take note of every jewel and necklace their characters find while adventuring, but a GM has to do better than a count of coins.  If this is truly a fantasy role-playing game, then it cannot resemble your high school math class.  This edition is going to help all you GMs and world builders out there create that extra level of fun and make your games more enjoyable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Player and Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 17 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 40 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
