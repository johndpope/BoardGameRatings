							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Transylvania I</name>
									
			<description>Transylvania was the name of a trilogy of computer games released for several home computers of the 1980s. The games were graphic adventure games created by Antonio Antiochia and produced by the now defunct Penguin Software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1982, this game was released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64 and Commodore 128. It was later re-released for the Apple Macintosh in 1984, then the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS in 1985. It sets the player on a quest to rescue Princess Sabrina from a countryside roamed by a werewolf, a vampire, a prankster goblin, a witch, and an alien space ship. The game has a time limit (dictated to the player by a note encountered early on that reads, &amp;quot;Sabrina dies at dawn&amp;quot;), as the Princess is trapped in a coffin in the castle tower. The game's usage of hand-drawn graphics were part of a trend where once entirely text adventure games started to use computer graphics to show the game's environment. It remains the most popular title in the trilogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An iPhone version of Transylvania &lt;i&gt; was released on October 30th, 2009 under the name &amp;quot;Transylvania Adventure&amp;quot;. The iPhone version features a touch-friendly user interface, sounds, and vintage &amp;quot;retro&amp;quot; graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Transylvania (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
