			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mix between memory and the traditional card game where players draw cards from each other trying to form pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of a variety of cards of which there are four of each, except Frankenstein's Monster, of which there are three. These are dealt to all players who put them down before them. Each turn, players can turn two cards, his own or another player's, showing only the second one to all. If he turns two cards of the same sort, they are discarded, and the player gets to apply the special effect of the card. Special effects include sending a card to another player, shuffling cards and other effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who remains with the lone Franken card loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
