			<description>Smart Investor is a card game that simulates the stock trading. Players are dealt a random set of stocks worth 500&amp;euro; - and for winning the game you have to increase the value of your portfolio with four rounds as much as possible. During the course of the rounds, players buy and sell stocks, which impacts the price.  Just remember that every stock you sell decreases the stock value... but every company's first stock you buy increases the value. If one particular stock in sector/industry raises high enough in value, market bubble follows with raising other stocks as well... but beware of market crashes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore - for being successful in &amp;quot;Smart Investor&amp;quot; you have to know when to buy, when to sell and when to do nothing more but wait. Just like in real life, isn't it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
