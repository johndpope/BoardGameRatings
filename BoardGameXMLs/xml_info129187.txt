			<description>User Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bug Blasters: The Exterminators was a rail-gun shooter designed for the Sega CD.  In the game, your character is Hugh D. Player, the fourth member of a bug extermination business similar to the Ghostbusters.  Responding to a chemical spill which has caused bugs in a certain town to mutate and develop the intelligence to work together, you and your team use your array of gadgets, weapons, and modified vehicles to get the job done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The video footage for the game and all of the programming was done before Sega discontinued support for the Sega CD.  About five years later, Sony sold the rights to the game to Good Deal Games, which released the game in the year 2000.  Bug Blasters: The Exterminators was originally called The Exterminators, but was renamed by Good Deal Games before they published it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
