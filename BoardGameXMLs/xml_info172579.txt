							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Terramartian War Part 05: The Shard, Part 2</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While The Shard was being recovered, your party made it on board The Roc, the Martian ship that was sent to retrieve the strange, extradimensional artifact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The passage back to Mars is not long, but it may be uncomfortable, based upon how the party got on board and whether or not the Martians are considered allies. After the destruction of The Sterling and the fate of all the other crew, the party feels lucky, but even in the most agreeable of allegiances with the crew of The Roc, what was seen cannot be unseen. What was witnessed cannot be fully explained. The Sterling crew saw deep into the eyes of darkness and were forever changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this chapter...&lt;br/&gt;Characters continue using their characters from Part 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the characters were stowaways or surrendered themselves in the previous scenario, they were assumed to have been caught and their gear stripped from them. The characters then are interrogated one by one as to what they saw on The Sterling and what happened to the scout team that The Roc had sent to the wreckage. The Stowaways will count as having taken d3 Health points of damage due to the variety of mechanisms and environments they were exposed to by clinging to the fuselage of The Roc. Any injuries they would have sustained would have been treated in The Roc&amp;rsquo;s medical bay. Being allowed to live and not being tortured (as you were led to believe the Martians delighted in) is a welcome respite from the previous trials endured regardless of the physical injures sustained getting to The Roc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the characters were friendly to Mars, they were treated with an unusual amount of suspicion despite the characters allegiance to The Red Hawk and his Martian army. The characters are kept in a series of containment cells for observation. This is a fate not dissimilar to the characters had they been the enemies of Mars and its people. This fact is not lost on the crew. But they are at least alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either way... the characters are in containment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
