							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheap Shot: Cheaper Shots</name>
									
			<description>Cheap Shot is a rummy-style game of insults, with each player starting with a hand of seven cards, which take the form of subjects, conjunctions, verbal phrases, and retorts. On a turn, the active player tries to use the cards in hand to create an insult: &amp;quot;Your Secret Boyfriend / is a drama farmer / and / tells only lies.&amp;quot; Unless the targeted player can come up with a block card, such as &amp;quot;Oh grow up!&amp;quot;, the insult will stand as points. The more cards in the insult, the more points you score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheap Shot: Cheaper Shots ups the drama with edgier and potentially more insulting cards, e.g., &amp;quot;Your Latest Gigolo / is urine soaked / and / is a spaz on the dance floor.&amp;quot; Don't care for such words aimed in your direction? Block it with &amp;quot;Stick it where the sun don't shine&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
