			<description>With a board showing various tracks, business, partner, self-discovery &amp;amp; mystic, politics, good life &amp;amp; travel, there are matching cards with German text. This early semi-pro production appears to be a game to spark discussion of your true beliefs or values. The cards have various statements and I think the other players must judge your reaction before you can progress to the finish. Not exactly a party game, I think this is meant to be testing if not disturbing! Lots of German text, unplayable for non-German speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
