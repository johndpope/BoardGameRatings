			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is up for a little mini-wargaming!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tragedy has struck the Dwarven Kingdom of the Hammerskin Clan. Recent quakes have opened the Dwarven mines to a humanoid invasion that have taken over the Stonegate and Irongate sections of the kingdom. On your last foray into the Dorgel Mountains you were tasked to deliver a plague cure for the town of Timel. On your way through the trade route you discovered the invasion and fought your way through to deliver the remedy. Now you must return to help the Dwarves secure their domain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is suitable for groups of levels 2nd - 4th. This adventure gives players the opportunity to be part of a large scale battle in small managable encounters with the potential of EXPLOSIVE results!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign, however it is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
