							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Baker&#039;s Dozen of Inhabited Worlds</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a science fiction setting, new worlds to explore are often needed, especially if players go off the beaten track. This supplement describes thirteen new inhabited worlds, including an asteroid and a double planet, that can be dropped into a game. The worlds are all described in a system-agnostic manner, enabling them to be used with any system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worlds are primarily terrestrial in nature, although even these can have oddities such as extreme orbits, but as well as the asteroid there is also an ice world, a scorched planet and one that is mostly high, dry desert. Most of the worlds can easily be dropped into most systems, but some are in systems that are themselves unusual in one way or another, such as with a black hole companion, at the edge of a galactic arm or intergalactic space or on the outskirts of a globular cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each planet is given an overview giving its points of interest and an illustration, and each comes with one or two adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is an example planet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey's End - At the very edge of a galactic arm or even a galaxy, this is characterised by a night sky that is, in one direction, almost completely dark, something which has been known to cause psychological problems with inhabitants and visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
