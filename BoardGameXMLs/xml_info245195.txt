							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Train Simulator: Marketplace – DB Donnerbüchsen Coaches Pack</name>
									
			<description>The Thunder Box is a two-axle coach design first manufactured in Germany in the 1920s for Deutsche Reichsbahn. The type was able to seat from 40 to 66 passengers, depending on which travel class they were configured for. Retirement began in the 1960s, though many Donnerb&amp;uuml;chsen remain in use on preserved railway. The Donnerb&amp;uuml;chsen Coach pack for Train Simulator recreates the later steel-bodied versions as they appeared in the 1950s under Deutsche Bahn operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed passenger view&lt;br/&gt;    Dynamic tail lights&lt;br/&gt;    Changeable destination signs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the following coach types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    DB ABie-28&lt;br/&gt;    DB Bie-28&lt;br/&gt;    DB Aie-29&lt;br/&gt;    DB ABie-29&lt;br/&gt;    DB Bie-29&lt;br/&gt;    DB BA-476&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
