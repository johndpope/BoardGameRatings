			<description>From the pen of Dave Parker comes the latest scenario supplement for I Ain't Been Shot Mum, featuring fifteen scenarios covering the actions of the US 82nd Airborne Division in Normandy in 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Split into three key areas, the fight for the La Fiere causeway and Cauquigny; the actions at Chef du Pont and Hill 30; and finally the battles around St Mere Eglise itself, this is a comprehensive piece of work, giving full historical background to the campaign and the units involved on both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scenario has briefings for both sides, notes for any umpire or game organiser, a set of design notes and full historical background along with a full colour map of the tabletop based on 1944 BIGOT maps of the area and aerial photographs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 119 pages in length this PDF supplement has been designed so that the scenario section is as printer friendly as possible. It gives a unique look at this fascinating and crucial area of the D-Day&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
