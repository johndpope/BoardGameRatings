			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His eyes open. He is lying with his belly against her back with one arm around her chest and the other under her head. He looks down on her neck and shoulders. Had she been awake, she too would have been able to see that strange shimmer in his eyes. The way he looks at her is different. Like a butcher looking at a piece of meat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is as if he is outside his own body looking at himself. Looking at his own hands caressing her and form a stranglehold around her neck. He yells as hard has he can to wake her up, but to no avail. She just lightly strokes his hand with her with her eyes still closed. He tries to let go. Move away from her. But cannot. His hand is no longer is hand. He tries to meet his own eyes. But he isn't there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous Occupants is a story of coping with people changing, cast as a ghost story. The players will play the events of two different timelines in parallel, one story of young trustful love and sexual exploration set against a bitter distrustful marriage that ends in violence and disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the ghosts of the past invade the present, the end is completely in the hands of the players. Who will get away alive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story that possesses you. You will never leave the room the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        4 players, 1 game master&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duration:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        1-2 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player type:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        You want intense drama and close-up physical play. You enjoy the freedoms of set story lines but are not afraid to act go wild within the given limits. You think that people are scarier than ghosts. And you are ready to be those people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM type:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        For GMs who would like to try out jeepform. The game uses a very simple technique for swapping storylines, characters and players. Your influences on the events will mostly be indirect, through music, whispers, suggestions and a hotel desk bell. If you're only GM'ing one game this Fastaval, make it this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premier:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Fastaval 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
