			<description>Xtermination is a card game in which players clash between each other and AI System (artificial intelligence) to control the post-apocalyptic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will choose between four different factions, Survivors, Infected, Necrotics and Evolved. They will fight to rule the world using the characters and weapons at their disposal. Lead your faction to victory and ensure your survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different factions directly impact how the game is played, each providing different cards and game experiences to all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Xtermination, characters are the most important cards. They are able to engage in battle and ultimately decide the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can be modified by using support cards that provide different effects and bonuses. There are many different types of support cards, like Equipment, Actions (one-time, instant effects) and Locations, which help characters be more deadly or survive long enough to kill opposing characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the beginning of the game, players set a number of points to be achieved during the game. A player must reach this objective before anyone else to win the game. To guarantee the best possible game experience, the recommended number of points must be between 25 and 50. The game length for this range is about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earn points by killing your opponents&amp;rsquo; characters, and be the first to get enough to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
