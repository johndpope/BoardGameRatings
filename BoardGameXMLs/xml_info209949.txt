							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Remedy: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Remedy is a fast-paced card game for 2 to 5 players featuring humorous characters, silly graphics and easy-to-learn rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 decks: the white deck that contains all of the illness cards and the green deck that contains, well, everything else. You'll draw from the green deck. At the start of the game, a card from the white deck will be flipped; this is your illness card. The illness has a number and your goal is to be the first to bring that number to 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do that, you can use cards like &amp;ldquo;snuggly bed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;delicious soup&amp;rdquo; to make the illness weaker and subtract from its number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also use cards like &amp;ldquo;week old burrito&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;glass of toilet water&amp;rdquo; to make the illness stronger and add to its number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to all of that, you can play various action cards like &amp;ldquo;snot shot&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;disorienting diarrhea&amp;rdquo; to throw your opponents off and give yourself an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
