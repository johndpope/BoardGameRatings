							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ultimate GM Screen II</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate GM Screen 2 is a must have for any fantasy game master. We've incorperated user feedback from our first GM screen to create this masterpiece. Bigger and sturdier than ever, this screen has two dice rolling towers (one toward the GM, one toward the players) and a quick-release disassembly design that allows you to transport or store this bad boy quickly and easily. Storage shelves in the rear are perfect for organizing the minis you need for the game, all while keeping them hidden from the players view. The screen can also be easily expanded to any length, simply by adding additional quick-release wall sections. Designed for the beginner card modeler, this set features our award winning texture graphics, full color instructions, and easy-to-build designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
