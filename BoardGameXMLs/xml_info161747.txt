They arrived and discovered an ancient alien warp gate floating amongst the chunks of ice that made up the planets' rings. The leaders of Earth activated the gate and sent expeditions to find out what was on the other side. The explorers returned and told tales of new worlds to discover, colonise and exploit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now 2265 A.D and with the aid of the warp gate, humanity has spread out across the galaxy. &lt;br/&gt;You are the sole heir to the wealthy Star House of Tamlore. Your palace resides on a frozen world at the edge of the backwater kingdom of Galsia. You have lived a sheltered life knowing little of the wealth your father created by harvesting the Xerer&amp;rsquo;s asteroid fields that dominate the planets skyline, and trading the goods the colonies that you govern have created. In an instant, you are thrust into a Universe full of danger and intrigue where you and your loyal protector Fenrix, barely escape with your lives following a devastating attack on your home world by the insidious Star House Greaver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now completely alone, you must set out to rebuild what you have lost, and seek your revenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By using innovative board game mechanics The Space Merchant of Tamlore is the next evolution of adventure gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
