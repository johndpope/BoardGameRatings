			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usually, Tarot is a famous french card game (also played in Canada and several Mediterranean countries) using a 78-cards deck including a quasi-regular card deck and 22 powerful ordered and colorless trump cards (atouts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here these cards represent the Princes of Amber and the Lords of the Chaos courts. They of course refer to the trump cards the Princes of Amber are using to interact with each other at long range, as described both in the books and as the 'Tarot' power the characters can use in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The illustrations are beautiful artwork from Florence Magnin, who also made the book covers for both the french RPG items and novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the deck is included a little book with explanations about divination with cards and how you're supposed to use it for the RPG. Half of it is also dedicated to a short novel telling how the narrator was able to discover, recover and publish the cards, with an official authorization from the royal family of Amber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no english version of this item developped independently by Jeux Descartes, the publisher of the french version of Amber RPG under the title 'Ambre - le jeu de r&amp;ocirc;le sans d&amp;eacute;'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
