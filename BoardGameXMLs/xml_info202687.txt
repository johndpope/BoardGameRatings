This area has a double-sized city block, three large city blocks, one small city block and seven half blocks. The map has over fifty buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Blocks 02 is intended for use in modern games. It can also be used in post-apocalyptic games as cracks in the sidewalks and road give the city an aged appearance that will fit that genre as well.-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pay Day Loansharks: The older brick section of town is a small Chinatown. Legitimate businesses like the Canton Chinese Restaurant are only a few apartments away from a Pay Day Loans shark of an almost criminal nature. The Pay Day Loans is being investigated by the local police as a potential source of counterfeit bills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are playing as detectives or police officers. They are tasked with figuring out if the Pay Day Loans is laundering funds and to catch the crooks if they can prove they are the source of the illegal funds on the streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An armored car comes in with the loan money every day in the morning and leaves at night. The police have set up a few stakeout areas around town and a small cone blockade on a road they think the armored car is using to get to its destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters can try many different tactics to figure out what is happening such as tailing the armored car to see where it is going at night, staking out the pay day loans, breaking and entering the Pay Day Loans to investigate with the danger of being discovered for illegally searching without a warrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the armored car discovers they are being tailed, they flee while firing on the police officers, leading to a dangerous chase through the Chinatown block&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
