							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rituals of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysteries From Beyond the Grave&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occult rituals, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, bring magic to the masses, with lengthy and difficult to perform magical rites which can be performed even by non-spellcasters, but which come with a cost, as well as the risk for terrible backlash to occur for those who meddle in things they do not understand. Unlike traditional spells, only a handful of occult rituals made it into that book however, which begs the question of what other strange and unknowable rituals might be lurking about in obscure tomes lost to history and memory. Tomes like this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a collection of 10 brand new occult rituals for use in your game, all of which are thematically linked to death, the afterlife, and the undead. Presented in the guise of a fictitious tome that player characters might stumble across, the book also includes a flavorful introductory section that can be read aloud or handed out to players, and suggestions for how to incorporate the book into your game. The rituals in this book allow players (or nefarious NPCs) to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Anchor the spirits of the dead to the Material Plane, using them to create haunts of whatever type the caster desires.&lt;br/&gt;    Conjure the spirit of a shadow demon into the body of a deceased, seeming to restore them to life, but actually just allowing the demon to use their body as a puppet.&lt;br/&gt;    Steal the appearance of a corpse, allowing you to look and sound like the creature did when it was alive.&lt;br/&gt;    Transform yourself into one of several different kinds of vampires.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
