							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eamonn Andrews Quiz Panel</name>
									
			<description>The box boasts &amp;quot;200 Questions&amp;quot; which is pretty mean by today's standards. A straightforward trivia game. Your objective is to score the highest total of points after 25 questions.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a question sheet. Players answer questions individually by inserting the wooden peg into the corresponding hole on the board. Each question has a code number. Turn the dial to the correct code to reveal the correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep a note of your score and continue until all questions are answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eamonn Andrews (1922 - 1987) was a Irish boxing commentator who transferred to mainstream TV. He is best remembered for hosting This Is Your Life in the UK, for nearly 25 years. Bell used his name and image on three of their board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
