							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Harlem Globetrotters Game</name>
									
			<description>The Harlem Globetrotters Game uses basketball cards for scoring baskets on the gameboard.  The card spaces have pictures of each player on the famous TV basketball team.  This game is like the Globetrotters, fast, skillful and fun.  However, unlike the Globetrotters, you don't have to understand basketball to play.&lt;br/&gt;Players place cards on spaces with pictures of the Harlem Globetrotters.  Each card has a design of a different colored basketball.  Baskets are scored by having 3 of the same colored cards, side by side.  It takes skill and a lot of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
