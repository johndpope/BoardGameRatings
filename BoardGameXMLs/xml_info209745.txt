			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After many days of travel you have reached the gates of Dyvers. You have come here in search of adventure, to have a place where you can spend your gold and have a good time at it.

As you draw nearer you can see the enormous gate, towering above the city walls with its 30-foot height and 20 foot width. The two huge wooden ironbound double doors of the gate are open. At each side of the gate an image of a dragon curves upward, carved out from the stone, meeting its counterpart at the apex of the gate, their snouts almost touching. Between the snouts of the creatures is the shield device of Dyvers, the tritower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 6th to 12th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
