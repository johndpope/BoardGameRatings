			<description>And educational game for &amp;quot;Occupation, Study Hour and Home Play&amp;quot; with cards on various parts of American history such as the Civil War and National Expansion.  The game plays like &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; with each player asking other players for pairs of cards and creating sets based on various themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The pack contains 56 cards, in which seven historical divisions are treated, as follows: Territorial Expansion, Commerce and Industry, Education and Religion, Invention, Transportation, Finance, and War.  Each of these division treats of two or more subjects, events or movements, two cards being given to each subject event or movement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The editor of the series declared that &amp;ldquo;The games are in no sense a substitute for other work, or anything extra, but a re-enforcement of the regular assignments along most interesting lines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
