			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 5th-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 10, 15, or 20 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;After the agents track down a Faceless cell in China, the Agency learns of Walter Wainwright&amp;rsquo;s secret headquarters, a presumably abandoned company office in New York City and the penthouse above. The agents are given the green light to raid the complex and put an end to the villain&amp;rsquo;s plots once and for all.  Unfortunately, their timetable is short, given that Wainwright seems ready to sell the Avis drug to the highest bidder, and that the sale is slated to happen inside or from his headquarters within the next 24 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the team enters the building, they find signs of recent combat and evidence that at least two rival forces are trying to kill each other on the premises. Further investigation on the ground floor reveals that the building is rigged with a variety of elaborate, high-tech death traps, and that another of Wainwright&amp;rsquo;s plans is already in motion. Worse, the building&amp;rsquo;s exterior windows and doors are apparently sealed shut and soundproofed &amp;mdash; even direct gunfire can&amp;rsquo;t penetrate them. Radio and other signals can&amp;rsquo;t enter or escape. Screaming at windows has no effect, either, as they appear to be one-way mirrors &amp;mdash; the agents can look out, but no one can see in. Wainwright wants what happens inside the building to stay in the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
