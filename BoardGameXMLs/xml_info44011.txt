							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sea Hunt</name>
									
			<description>This game is one of a series of roll-and-move games published by the Regent Book Store in Singapore in the 1970s or 1980s. The games all have a paper board with graphic illustrations in the style of that period. Text on the board is in both English and Chinese. The boards were printed by Koon Wah Lithographers, Singapore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sea Hunt, the board depicts the sea around a sunken galleon overflowing with treasure. Players roll a die and move their token around a winding track, moving forward or backward or missing turns if they land on certain special spaces. Moving to another space happens if you land on a space with a dotted line connecting to where you are supposed to go; landing next to a whale makes you miss a turn. The first player to reach the sunken treasure ship at space 96 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
