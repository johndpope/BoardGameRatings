							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ESCAPE! The Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>In this new Print and Play dice game, from MM Games, each player starts with an escape plan listing various items they must collect in order to carry out their escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players can roll the &amp;lsquo;Search&amp;rsquo; dice to look for items; they may get to select one item at random or if they are lucky they will be able to search the item deck for the counter of their choice. Their turn ends immediately if they are sent to their cell, and a cell search will mean that one of their collected items may be confiscated by the prison guards (and discarded).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of rolling the search dice on their turn, a player can opt to roll the &amp;lsquo;Steal&amp;rsquo; dice to try and take an item from another player&amp;rsquo;s cell. This option comes with its own set of perils; your opponent may stop you with a &amp;lsquo;shank&amp;rsquo;, you may be sent to the &amp;lsquo;Hole&amp;rsquo; (you remain in the hole on each subsequent turn until you roll to leave), or there may be a cell transfer meaning that all your items change hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have collected all the items on your escape plan you win the game. There are optional rules to make escapes a little harder and extend the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
