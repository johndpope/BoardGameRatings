			<description>This is a fun game of dexterity action balanced by tactics. Each side has a force made up of poker chips which represent units in their armies. A smooth playing surface is necessary, as you flick the chips to move and attack with your forces. You must use strategy and skill to defeat your opponent. Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses - from multiple flicks per turn to immunities against other unit types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is up to you to use your Infantry, Walls, Catapults and other forces effectively to win the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a range of scenarios which can take from 5 minutes to an hour to play.&lt;br/&gt;Traps and magical effects are represented by static poker chips placed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
