							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Babau and Hezrou</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisonous Fiends from the Heart of the Abyss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All demons are noxious, repugnant, and vile, but two stand out as perhaps the most disgusting and toxic of them all: the slime-drenched babau and the oily, stinking hezrou. The lean, quick babau are the assassins of the underworld, born of serial murderers, and so inherently wretched that their skin constantly weeps an acidic ichor that covers their entire body. The hulking hezrou, by comparison, is a powerful abyssal heavyweight that corrupts and warps everything it touches, and pollutes the very world around it. Many fear and revile these loathsome creatures, and rightfully so, but they are nothing when compared to the mythic paragons of their species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for mythic babau and mythic hezrou, both of which have unique abilities never seen elsewhere. Mythic babau are expert assassins who not only excel at making powerful, deadly sneak attacks, even when others would not be able to, but also are invigorated by making a bloody kill, and gain the ability to spit blobs of clinging acid at their foes from afar. Mythic hezrou, by contrast, can cause bodies to twist, warp, and putrefy with a single touch, can surround themselves with a deadly miasma of toxic gases to punish those who would dare approach them, and can even corrupt entire landscapes in a 10-mile radius with their mere presence. In addition to these game statistics, the book also introduces rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by players of any class in order to summon mythic babau and mythic hezrou, with both specific game rules for doing so and detailed flavorful descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
