			<description>Contents&lt;br/&gt;1 Wooden Base.&lt;br/&gt;2 Tree Trunk Sections.&lt;br/&gt;1 Palm Leaf Connector Unit.&lt;br/&gt;4 Green Palm Leaves.&lt;br/&gt;1 Chimpanzee.&lt;br/&gt;12 Monkey's in Four Colour's.&lt;br/&gt;2 Dice.&lt;br/&gt;Rules Are Printed on Inner Box Lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A race game but you are racing up the plastic palm tree instead of around a board. Each player has an equal share of the monkeys. Dice are thrown to climb (Each notch is 4 apart).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monkeys want to get to the fruit at the top of the tree - therefore the objective is to climb the tree as quickly as possible. The first to get all their monkeys on to one of the palm leaves, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware the black chimpanzee as he wants all the fruit and will chase the monkeys down when he catches them. The chimpanzee moves when a double is thrown and tries to catch the monkeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
