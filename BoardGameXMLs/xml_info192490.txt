							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Takeda&#039;s succession struggle</name>
									
			<description>The second issue game of Game Journal #51.&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Yumiko Endoh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts at the moment of Hon-noh-ji, the death of Nobunaga Oda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three factions, Uesugi, Tokugawa, and Hohjoh started to get the piece of the Koh-Shin area, the heritage of Takeda-clan which had been controled by Nobunaga at the moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though there are 3 factions, this game is played with only 2 people.&lt;br/&gt;The faction each player control is decided randomly just after the first turn.  And this information can be kept secret as long as that player would like to reveal and take full control of that faction.  Until that moment, each faction is controled by both players alternatively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victory is achieved that the faction that player control have conquered the determined numbers of areas.  If no player can achieve the criteria, then both players lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
