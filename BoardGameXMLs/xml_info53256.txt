							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Playelf 2</name>
									
			<description>A Swedish freeware RPG, available as a number of free PDF downloads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(translated from the manual)&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;kobold-nostalgic and chauvinistic role playing game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of Playelf was initiated with an illustrated calendar featuring naked female elves drawn by H&amp;aring;kan Ackeg&amp;aring;rd, the Swedish staple RPG artist from the 80s. The idea then popped up to make this into an exaggerated RPG where everyone looked like Red Sonia. The result was a humouristic and silly RPG that started out as a joke but in reality was really playable. It  was released as a self-printed stapled rulebook, on conventions in Sweden for several years, and is now available as a free download on R&amp;auml;vsvans f&amp;ouml;rlag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Playelf, the player character are typical exaggerated RPG clich&amp;eacute;es, scantily clad she-elves, Conan-sized warriors or whatever. It's a world of unrealistic heroic fantasy, where everything is Save the Princess or Do Something Silly.&lt;br/&gt;The system is a simplistic d6 system where the better you describe your action, the more the dice you roll (this system was later used in many of R&amp;auml;vsvans print-and-play RPGs). Also, clothes you wear are in the way, and thus give a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the not-so-serious setting, the rulebook for Playelf did cover all the necessities, complete with tricks and hints for adventures, character creation tables, example scenarios and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is just one book, but it's split into several PDFs, the order of which you have to figure out for yourself.
