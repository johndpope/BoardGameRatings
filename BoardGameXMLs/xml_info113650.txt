			<description>Tebes is an abstract strategy game inspired in the Greek legend of the Seven against Thebes. The checkered board is set up randomly in each game, so black and white spaces are randomly located. Then the player's pieces are put on the board, completely filling it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules and movements depend on the colour of the square you are occupying. Pieces can move and kill at a distance of two spaces if they are in a space of their own color, but only move and kill at a distance of one space if they are in a space of the other player's color. Pieces can also jump over pieces of the same color. To win players have to reach two positions that represent the two war phases: the two corners of the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
