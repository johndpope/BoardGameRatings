			<description>The aim of the game is to race along the ground avoiding all the hazards such as, the Earthquake, the Dinosaur fight, the Marsh etc before you can be the first to cap the erupting volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has its own playing grid to move along, which is three squares wide, you role the dice and move the appropriate number of squares, you can only move straight ahead or diagonally, so keep an eye on what instruction squares you want to miss and which ones you want to land on. Knocking down a tree allows you to move extra spaces (2 squares for a small tree, and 4 for a large tree). Instruction squares may move you forward, may move you back, may allow you to place a tree on your playing grid, or remove a tree from an opponent's playing grid. If you land on a fight square you must fight the player to your left, highest dice role wins. The winner moves forward three, the loser goes back three. The first to cap the volcano wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
