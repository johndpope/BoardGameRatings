			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City-Block set new standards for Games Workshop's already mind-boggling range of floor plans. Not only are these plans fully compatible with those in the awesome Slaughter Margin supplement, but they are also ideal for playing out Warhammer 40,000 combats in buildings and Hive Worlds...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;++ DATA++ Box Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;++Four full-colour, card stock, cut-out overlays++&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;++ Eight large (297 x420mm), full-colour, plan sheets++&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;++A 20-page Block-generation booklet, including new rules for WH40K++&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a supplement for the scrotnig Judge Dreed The Roleplaying Game, City-Block is an invaluable aid for GMs and players alike. Carl Sargent's Block generation system is nothing if not comprehensive. Now you can design a complete Mega-City Block, and there are even tables for the random generation of inhabitants and their criminal records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use the plans straight out of the box, or follow the examples to lay out a variety of locations: from the Entrance Plazas to Sky-Rail Stations, from a Citi-Def Armoury to a Helipad. So the next time your Judges conduct a crime-blitz on the nearest sector block... you'll be ready for 'em!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The floorplans in this set are approved by the Inquisition as morally pure and suitable for use with Warhammer 40,000. Captain Flavius Exoculis has personally tested the new rules for fighting on a square grid, and guarantees that the plans make an ideal simulation of Hive World complexes. The accompanying booklet (compiled by Graeme Davis and Alan Merret) also provides a complete system for generating Hive World gangs and their equipment. Armed with these details, the Legion Astartes (Space Marines) can take the fight against corruption to the heart of the enemy's lair...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Well, what are you waiting for, Trooper? He who hesitates is dead!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
