							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Name That Song</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Jerry White.  Here is great entertainment for everyone!  Two players listen while the Atari starts playing a tune.  As soon as a player thinks he knows the name of the song, he presses his assigned key or joystick button.  There are two ways to play.  The first way requires you to type in the name of the song.  Optionally, you can play multiple choice, where the computer asks you to select the title from four possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard version requires 24K of RAM (32K on diskette) and has over 150 songs on it.  You also get a 16K version that has more than 85 songs.  The instructions explain how you can add songs to the program, if you wish.  Written in BASIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
