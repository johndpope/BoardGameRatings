							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mirkmoot&#039;s More Magical Mayhem for Creatures Small and Great</name>
									
			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;We here at Troll in the Corner's Magical Emporium are constantly searching the known and unknown worlds to bring you, our wealthy and overly encumbered adventurers, the finest magical items. We've journeyed the planes, trawled lakes of fire, flitted through realms composed of clouds and consorted with demon princes and godlings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're not quite sure why it is then, that we continue to be fascinated with the objects created by one forlorn and grumpy goblin, but fascinate us the creations of Mirkmoot certainly do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're ecstatic to announce then that Mirkmoot has returned! Actually, he hasn't so much returned as never left, really. We've tried asking him to leave but every time we get as far as &amp;quot;We'd like to have our bathroom back and. . . &amp;quot; he vanishes in a cloud of toilet paper and eventually turns up mumbling to himself hours or days later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
