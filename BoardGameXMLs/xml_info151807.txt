			<description>Broken, busted, over-powered and imba; just some of the common phrases you hear when playing some of your favorite competitive video games. Are you tired of playing video games that release patch after patch but still never seem to get the character balance correct?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMBA to the rescue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMBA is the board game where you take the role of lead game designer of a popular competitive video game. Your job is to make sure your video game has been thoroughly tested and that all the characters in your game are balanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMBA is a card game for 2 to 4 players. Each player will be assigned a different character to balance and its up to you to stand out as the best designer by making sure the characters you're in charge of are not too strong, not too weak and free of exploits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
