							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Manor (Issue 6 - May 2014)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #6 of The Manor features OSR luminaries Matt Jackson and Ken Harrison.  Matt has created a must have brothel outside of one of your towns.  He's created a place were the most perverse pleasures can be satisfied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ken has created a trio, set of rooms where adventurers need to use their brains to figure out the puzzles.  It highlights Ken's skills of deception and distraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've created a guard class so when adventurers come into town, guards have their own special skills on how to deal with unruly visitors.  In addition there is a random table for guard greetings.  Alternatives to, halt who goes there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And lastly, an adventure I created using the resources from other OSRians.  Matt Jackson for the map, Tim Brannan for his Witch class and Dylan Hartwell for his Big Book of Spiders.  All were used heavily in creating this one-shot adventure.  Take your adventurers up against some spider worshiping witches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
