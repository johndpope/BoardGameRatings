							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agents of the Crown</name>
									
			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGENTS OF THE CROWN combines Victorian heroic action in the tradition of pulp stories, comic books, and the Penny Dreadfuls of the 19th century with the solid play and tremendous versatility of the Basic Roleplaying system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents of the Crown allows players to take the roles of super-agents in Victorian England serving Queen and Country combating evil in a myriad of forms. Whether foiling assassination attempts against the country&amp;rsquo;s Royals or members of Parliament, or rooting out vile cult activity amidst the sweat and squalor of London&amp;rsquo;s Bainbridge Rookery, the operatives of her Royal Majesty Queen Victoria know the truth. Evil is out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its minions are legion. They inhabit the edges of England&amp;rsquo;s vast, world-spanning empire, corrupting, waiting for their chance to sew chaos and disorder. And so the Agents of the Crown must face these threats as they come. Their lives are sometimes lost in the cause, but never given cheaply. Indeed, the Agents possess powers and skills beyond the average man or woman&amp;rsquo;s. Whether by accident of birth, or from the borne of the world&amp;rsquo;s brave new sciences, they are often more than human. Yet still it is their courage that most sets them apart from ordinary citizens, for they must endure hardships that run the gamut of human experience and beyond. One day it might be a terrible threat from beyond space and time, while the next it might be an all too human killer who stalks the innocent along rain-slicked cobblestone streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
