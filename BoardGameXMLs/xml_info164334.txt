							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiestru</name>
									
			<description>Before mankind arose, there was the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiestru, the name for darkness and evilness, surrounded all the world. Evil forces were rising, ruling the skies and the earth. Too much pain and suffering were endured by humans in the fight for freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedom was the light, the light to imprison Tiestru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The absence of light in the Tower of Light, gave the evilness its power. After decades of darkness, the Tower of Light became the Tower of Tiestru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was believed that, if one could bring light to all the levels of the tower, the evil would fall. This hope took the life of thousands of heroes in the dark corridors of the Tower of Tiestru. No one has ever succeeded&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you are the chosen one. As the Sorcerer of Rihesrik, you are determined to wield the power of arcane crystals, and make your way through this dangerous journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BE WISE AND CHOOSE THE RIGHT CRYSTALS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
