							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">National Gallery Artist&#039;s Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Four card games using the same pack of commemorative cards from the National Gallery. Each card is of very high quality and features one of 52 famous paintings. Two of the games are familiar e.g. snap or memory. Two of the games have been created especially for this pack of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 'Collector' you are collecting different paintings from different schools in a game akin to Happy Families. In 'Curator' one player acts as a curator for a museum collecting different schools of paintings in exchange for chips (not provided)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
