							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prestigeous Organizations: The Order of the Nullblades</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This story, like so many others, begins with an old man in a tavern; he was not the wise old man of so many clich&amp;eacute;d tales of fantasy, but rather a wizard who was completely and utterly smashed on the local nectar. Needless to say, the tavern goers were nervous. A crazy guy grabbing a chair and smashing another guy over the head was something they could understand and run from, but a drunken wizard who is likely able to turn anyone who makes any sudden movements into a newt for a few days? Why, that is something else entirely. Finally getting fed up with this pointless standoff, over a few silver on a tab, no less, an adventuring fighter stepped up to put an end to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After recovering from being a newt for nearly two weeks, the fighter decided that enough was enough. Something, anything, had to be done about these blasted spellcasters! Though his knowledge of magic was miniscule, he recalled that magic, particularly divination, had issues around lead. Thus laden with lead-based talcum powders from the local alchemist, the fighter went on to make almost impossible victories against obnoxious users of magic, that is until he died of lead poisoning a little over a year later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rallying around this man, now seen a martyr, a number of fighters and clerics of arcane-hating gods continued his crusade. Calling themselves The Order of the Nullblades, these individuals are committed to the elimination of the &amp;quot;misuse of magic&amp;quot; and can be seen battling mad wizards, planar incursions, and strange arcane anomalies the world over, for a price, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Organization overview for The Order of the Nullblades, including ranks and responsibilities, business model, internal politics, chain of command and several ways for PCs to get involved with the Order that just scream &amp;quot;Easy plot hook!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for randomly generating chapterhouses in settlements, including special amenities that nullblades can use&lt;br/&gt;     The nullblade prestige class&lt;br/&gt;     NPC writeups for Drimble Underhill, halfling knight-champion of the Order (CR 8 fighter/nullblade) and Cerabiel, elven chaptermaster of the Order (CR 12 bard [arcane duelist]/fighter/nullblade)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
