			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-panel Keeper's Screen mounted on thick hardcover stock that folds out to 22&amp;quot; wide. Contains varied and useful tables and rules pertinent to playing the Horror on the Orient Express campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sold as a shrink-wrapped bundle with a front slip sheet including the product code, description, ISBNs and UPC; the reverse of this sheet includes a greyscale version of the &amp;quot;Routes of the Orient Express&amp;quot; map from Horror on the Orient Express.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screen's outside face contains art and a colour version of the &amp;quot;Routes of the Orient Express&amp;quot; map (split into two parts); the inside includes multiple tables and rules summaries:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Indefinite Insanity Gauge&lt;br/&gt;     Phases of Insanity*&lt;br/&gt;     Determining Difficulty Levels*&lt;br/&gt;     Comparing Results*&lt;br/&gt;     Pushing the Roll*&lt;br/&gt;     Bonus and Penalty Dice*&lt;br/&gt;     Wounds and Healing*&lt;br/&gt;     Firearms&lt;br/&gt;     Full / Half / Fifth Values Table&lt;br/&gt;     Scenario listing for Horror on the Orient Express*&lt;br/&gt;     Fighting Rules for Close-Quarter Combat*&lt;br/&gt;     Orient Express Staff*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the first-printing screen, the sections marked * have very tight text justification which makes words appear to run together (e.g., &amp;quot;ifdrawtheinitiatingattackerwins&amp;quot;). An update sent to backers of the Horror on the Orient Express (2nd edition) Kickstarter campaign on 8 July 2015 suggests that a corrected printing, &amp;quot;triple checked for no font issues&amp;quot;, is in production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
