							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empires of the Shining Sea</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dusty trails from the North have brought you to the warm and welcoming coasts of the Shining Sea and the Lake of Steam. Here is history spanning millennia, not just centuries; passion, profit and danger; dreams of power and conquest; and wonders and mysteries centuries older than any hedge realm north of Dalagar's Road and the Snowflake Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empires of the Shining Sea goes farther and deeper into the southern reaches of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, providing a breadth of scope and a level of detail never before published. This boxed set includes a 192-page book filled with information on these topics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History The Empires of the Shining Sea hold tales and legends passed down by word of mouth across the years. The myriad mysteries and dramas of more than 300 rulers across four empires&amp;mdash;including the infamous Shoon Imperium&amp;mdash;reveal themselves in the history and timeline spanning more than 8,000 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Calimshan The long-fallen empire of Calimshan rises yet again, as a new ruler and new power groups take control of the former land of the genies. Updated and expanded by more than 100 pages since its first appearance in FR3, Empires of the Sands, Calimshan shows itself to be a land bent on returning to its former greatness&amp;mdash;at any and all costs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Land of the Lions This rugged land sandwiched between the Deepwash and the Lake of Steam seems empty, but many surprises lurk among its plains and woods&amp;mdash;nomads and raiders astride giant lynxes, elder orbs, ruined cities, lost cultures, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Lake of Steam This steaming bay of the Shining Sea unveils its secrets, proving that it holds more than easy trade routes to the Inner Sea. Scarlet pearls the size of a human fist or the smoking majesty of the volcanic Arnrock tempt those who dare test its deceptively calm waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also inside are two full-color poster maps showing Calimshan and the Lake of Steam region at 30-mile-per-inch scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to adventure in the conspiracy-laden Empires of the Shining Sea is here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
