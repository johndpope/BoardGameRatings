			<description>A solo card game. &amp;quot;Simulates a battle between Soviet Union and Finland in December 1939. To be played on Finnish side.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Finns and the Soviets each have unique custom decks of cards. The cards depict attacks, events, and weapons of the historical campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the Finn player may play any standing defenses from the cards in his hand. One to six Soviet cards are then turned up (as determined by a die roll.) These cards represent the Soviet attack for the turn. The Finnish player tries to play a defensive response with a higher total Force Value than the Soviet cards. If the total Force Value of the Soviet cards is higher, the different in Force Values represents the number of casualties suffered by the Finns and is subtracted from the Finish troop count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player wins if there are no cards left in the Soviet deck and there are still troops remaining. If all 100 of the Finnish troops are killed, then the player loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
