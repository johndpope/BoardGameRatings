							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Hills</name>
									
			<description>Happy Hills is a physics-based puzzle game with hillarious and explosive arcade fun for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Euphoria is a land filled with joy and merriment, every day is laughter and the songs of the Happy Hills ring through the land. But now the Gloom Blocks are raining down from the skies of Euphoria; sour lumps of nastiness that live only to bring depression and misery to all, oppressing the once happy hills and spreading sadness throughout the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is your task to dispose of the Gloom Blocks and bring back the smiles to the Happy Hills. In a series of devious and increasingly complex levels, you will progress through distinctly different areas of Euphoria. Complete a level simply by removing all blocks off the hills by placing bombs on or near them. Additionally, you earn a star for each block that you destroy by leveraging their specific weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
