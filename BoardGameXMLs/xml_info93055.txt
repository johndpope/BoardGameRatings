							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D6 Magazine (Issue 1 - Feb 2011)</name>
									
			<description>From page 1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every article, adventure, and interview included in the D6 Magazine is a labor of love, written for fans, by fans, of the OpenD6 gaming mechanic started long ago by West End Games, Inc., and now released to the public under the Open Gaming License. The first issue&amp;rsquo;s theme revolves around winter, the cold, and everything subzero. I want to thank all of the contributors for their submissions and hope to see the community grow to love this free publication as it grows in both size and submitted material. I have played role-playing games for the better part of my life, and they have suffered me through some of the hardest times in my life. I enjoy the very social aspect of sitting down to play with good friends, to the mechanics of the dice systems, to the&lt;br/&gt;shared imaginary worlds we experience together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OpenD6 Gaming represents the best thing to come to Table Top Gaming in over a decade, since the inception of and popularity of the West End Games product lines such as Ghostbusters and Star Wars. This issue of the D6 Magazine marks the first in a long line of&lt;br/&gt;community-produced material that will be sure to bring a little of our imaginations as writers and game developers out to you in the public. Unlike any other form of gaming, OpenD6 Gaming is simple to learn, easy to play, and incredibly customizable and simple, yet&lt;br/&gt;robust enough to withstand every genre of game play imaginable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am super happy to have worked with the contributors who not only submitted material here, but did it free. I want to extend my personal thanks to Khairul Hisham for all his hard work on the cover art for the D6 Magazine, and Bill Smith for agreeing to do an&lt;br/&gt;interview for our readers. This has turned out as a particularly well formed first issue, and I am excited to work on many future incarnations of the D6 Magazine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
