			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twilight Creations published the best-selling Zombies!!! board game in 2001.  The board game has several aspects bordering on traditional role-playing, leading the author to adapt the game's basic concepts to more traditional table-top role-play.  The game transpires on a playing area made of tiles that are placed by the Zombie Master as they are explored by the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Statistics (Attributes) with randomly determined values, including Health (2D10+10), Muscles (1D6+1), Brains (1D6+1), and Aim (1D6+1).  Atypically, when health reaches 1 the character is unconscious; when it reaches 0 the character is dead.  Characters otherwise need only perform inventory management and &amp;quot;Point&amp;quot; tracking.  During play characters gain Points and may also spend them to alter narrative events.  Movement is derived from the board-game heritage:  characters roll 1D6 and may move up to that many spaces.  Combat is a simple D10 + modifier vs. D10 + modifier.  Damage ranges from 1D6 (crowbar) to 2D10+5 (flame thrower) - explosives do even more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the nature of the game, character mortality is high.  The game mechanics essentially presuppose brief campaigns, offering only limited options for multiple sessions and character advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
