							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tools of the Shamed Samurai</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lone, resilient samurai is an archetype that has captured the hearts of many through portrayals in modern media. But few have so fascinated us and gained as great a following as the man out of his time, the anachronistic samurai. He is trapped in an alien world where his enemies constantly assail him, a world where absolute evil rules and will not rest until he is defeated. After years of survival, the anachronistic samurai has returned to the light to reignite his battle against the ultimate evil, fighting to restore an honor lost to him in years of defeat. Join the fight against darkness with the tools of this shamed samurai!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
