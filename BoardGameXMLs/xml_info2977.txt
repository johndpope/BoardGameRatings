			<description>Headlines is a Monopoly clone quiz game, in which players try to compose tabloid headlines from stories read to them. Whilst a sand timer runs down, roll &amp;amp; move round the track, stopping on categories like Sports, Law, Business, Lifestyle. A card with 4 stories is taken for that category and one of the stories read out to the player. Using key words from the story, the player declares the headline. Getting it correct boosts your paper's circulation. On Photo-scoop cards, you must identify the celebrity. There are also Extra! cards for gain/loss and other players may Grab the headline in question. The game has a quarter-board with 2 tracks, the inner for the Sundays, and 560 question cards, the stories drawn from British papers in the 90s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
