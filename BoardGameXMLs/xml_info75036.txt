			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of AGENT X. Since the beginning of civilization there has been government, from the primitive tribal chieftain to the modern day heads of state. Where there is government, there exists a need for &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot;. Just as kings in ancient days sent forth scouts to observe the movements of enemy armies and had their spies mingle with high society and royalty in other nations to gain information. Governments of today employ high technology and age old techniques to keep one step ahead of the enemy. &lt;br/&gt;Amid media reports and government propaganda the average citi-zen is oblivious to the &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;. The fact is, most of us suspect things arent as they present themselves to be. We know more than we are willing to admit. Conspiracies abound; no longer are battles fought only on land, air and sea. Now the governments and syndicates of the Earth are engaged in a war of lies and secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are no longer part of the unknowing masses. You are an &amp;quot;Agent of Influence&amp;quot;, sworn to uphold the law and at the same time protect the secrets of a horribly corrupt system. However, you can only be a part of the corruption and deceit for so long, before it becomes a part of you and you are faced with the question...Whose side are you on?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT ROLE PLAYING GAMES If you are familiar with Role-Playing Games, then you will slide into the role of an Agent quite nicely. Although most gamers will recognize AGENT X as another Role-Playing Game (RPG) we prefer to use the term &amp;quot;Interactive Literature&amp;quot; when describing what AGENT X actually is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first form of AGENT X is the &amp;quot;sit down&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tabletop&amp;quot; game. Players sit around the table and use little more than their imagination to explore the world that the Director (sometimes called the Game Master) has laid before them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second form of AGENT X is the Live-Interactive Literature form of the game, which is known in the gaming world as a LARP (Live Action Role Playing) Game. In the LIL, you come dressed as your character and interact with other players much like you would in an Improvisational Theater environment. AGENT X is unique in that you can play either form without a change in rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE DIRECTOR The role of the Director, in AGENT X, is much like that of the game master or storyteller, in other role-playing games. The primary difference is that the Director not only officiates the but also takes the role of the Director of the agency that the players represent, giving her an active role in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, during live-action, or LARP, play Assistant Directors work with the Director in setting up scenes and scenarios, acting as NPCs (non-player characters), keeping the plot moving and resolving conflict and combat situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
