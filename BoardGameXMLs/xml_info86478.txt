							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perfect Picnic</name>
									
			<description>Throw the die and be the first to fill your rug with a complete set of picnic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes it in turn to throw the die. If you throw a six, you take a rug; if you throw any other number before getting your picnic rug you pass. Once you have your picnic rug, you take the other pieces as follows. When you throw:&lt;br/&gt;One - a bottle of pop&lt;br/&gt;Two - a sandwich &lt;br/&gt;Three - a piece of cake&lt;br/&gt;Four - an apple&lt;br/&gt;Five - sausage roll&lt;br/&gt;Six - pass&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you throw a number you do not need, for example, two, when you already have a sandwich, then you must pass. The first player to complete their rug and make the Perfect Picnic wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Jumbolino and Cootie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
