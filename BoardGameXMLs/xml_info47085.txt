			<description>Reflex is a game of streaking lights and whirling sounds that cause your mind to race and your fingers to fly.  It's a game of quick reactions and precise timing.  REFLEX can be a personal challenge or a one-on-one contest.  Most of all, it's five different fun and exciting games that will keep the whole family coming back for more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five games including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-JUGGLER(1 player).  It's an age-old skill with a new twist.  But the object is the same-keep a ball of light going back and forth without &amp;quot;dropping&amp;quot; it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-WINDUP (2 players).  Imagine you're trying to wrap a ball around a pole while your opponent is trying to do the same from the opposite direction-and you've got the idea behind this game of speed and timing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-ACCELERATOR (1 player).  Boost the speed of a ball of light faster and faster and then &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; it.  If your timing is just right, your score will &amp;quot;soar&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4-POUNCE (1 player).  Discover the patterns of two rapidly-moving lights.  Then stop them as quickly as possible-and stop them at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5-POUNCE (2 players).  This 2-player version of POUNCE pits you against an opponent to find out who has the keener eye and the faster fingers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
