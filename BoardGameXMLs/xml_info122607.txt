			<description>A competitive or cooperative, dice rolling, Zombie survival experience.&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player rolls dice to acquire different resources. These resources are used to build and maintain a group of survivors who are working to eliminate the Zombie horde while trying to survive. Each roll of the dice presents difficult choices as players must decide which of these valuable resources they will keep, spend, or chance in order to best equip their survivors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game begins players take turns rolling dice. Players must work to feed their survivors, buy items such as weapons, or special skills that allow players to manipulate their dice rolls to best benefit their survivors. Players will work their way through Town, battling Zombies and gaining Victory Points for each Zombie eliminated and each survivor that remains alive. But players must beware of opponents who can draw Zombies to their location as they try to move in and steal Victory Points and other valuable rewards that are specific to each location in Town. The pace is frantic, the Zombies are hungry and survivors can easily turn on one another!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
