			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Sanctuary of the Silver Shine&amp;quot; is a Rivendell-like city which was deserted by the Elves half a millennium ago, and is hidden still amid the mists, and still full of relics of the sublime architecture and magic. The PC's are the first of mortal Men, to have rediscovered it and have a chance of learning about its secrets, the treasures and the Sentinel and the legendary ghostly unicorn. In the Sanctu?ary one can gain the friendship of a mighty ally, a safe haven, some mag?ic, some treasures and wisdom, or do over a dozen missions... You just simply cannot be bored..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forge Studios presents and represents a new quality in game's accessories combining 'art' packs and ordinary gaming material.&lt;br/&gt;Every PDF from The Forge Studios consists of two parts. The first one is designed exclusively for the DM. In it you can find exact plans, visualizations, ideas, and adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is a set of visual aids which can be easily printed or presented to other players during a session, in order to enrich the description and create a more precise presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Sanctuary of the Silver Shine&amp;quot; consists of:&lt;br/&gt;- 19 page long description&lt;br/&gt;- 1 map of the lavender valley&lt;br/&gt;- 2 floor plans&lt;br/&gt;- 6 view drawings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
