			<description>The 'Wensput Spel' (Wishing Well Game) is a children's game loosely based on the 'Sprookjesboom' franchise from the Dutch theme park 'Efteling'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players start as one of the many creatures of the enchanted forest (like a frog, a snail or a hedgehog). All other playing pieces are stored -together with the prince charming playing piece- in a mechanical and musical wishing well. The players then start their journey through the forest trying to reach Cinderella's castle before the other players do. In order to win the game, they must transform their playing piece into the prince charming piece before reaching the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For that purpose, players roll-and-move through the forest and whenever they reach a transformation square they may (depending whether their playing piece is shown on the square or not) transform into another creature. To do so, they drop their playing piece in an empty slot of the wishing well, then spin the handle on the well until another creature 'magically' pops up out of the well. The player then continues the game with that playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
