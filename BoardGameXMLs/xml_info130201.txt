			<description>Frozen Death  is Numbskull Games' representation of the Winter War which depicts the Finnish struggle against Soviet expansionism in 1939.  A block styled, card driven, dice combat system war game that adds fog-of-war elements to the already brutal climatic elements of the hell on earth that was the Winter War.  Finnish resolve was exemplified by the term &amp;quot;sisu&amp;quot; roughly translated as &amp;quot;guts&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;motti&amp;quot; (chopping wood to kindling) tactics of their elite ski battalions &amp;quot;sissi&amp;quot;.  Altogether this was a very embarrassing episode for the Soviets from which they only were able to negotiate a victory  of sorts because of their over overwhelming preponderance in men and especially equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
