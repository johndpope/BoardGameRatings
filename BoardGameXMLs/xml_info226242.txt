							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alpha Arkana</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows what existed in the beginning. All that is known is that what is now called the Alpha Arkana was the first spell. It was the spell of creation. It was what created the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the moments after the casting of the Alpha Arkana, the newborn universe was awash with magical energy. In these first moments of existence, the beings now called gods became. They were not born. One moment there was nothing but magical, chaotic energy. The next moment these beings existed. It is said that they numbered more than the stars in the sky or more than the grains of sand in a thousand beaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
