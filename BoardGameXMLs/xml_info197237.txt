							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demon Hunters: A Comedy of Terrors</name>
									
			<description>Vampires infesting the mayoral office. Lycanthropes prowling the suburbs. Another kraken making its way upstate along the river. Crazed cultists masquerading as door-to-door religious nuts. Every one of them edging the world one more step toward the next demonic apocalypse. In your line of work, that&amp;rsquo;s called Tuesday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an agent of the Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch, hand-picked to serve as Earth&amp;rsquo;s first and last line of defense against the servants of Darkness. Oh sure, there are others in the Brotherhood who seem more hand-picked than you were, and yes, you probably only work out of a small office somewhere in Michigan or Wyoming or South Dakota, but when it comes to dealing out the damage to the infernal instruments of Hell taking over that shopping mall or the Craz-E-Mart, the buck stops with you. Lock and load, baby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book&amp;mdash;packed with tabletop roleplaying rules based on the Fate RPG system has everything you need for playing Demon Hunters and creating badass adventures so they can strut their stuff. Produced as a result of a highly successful Kickstarter project, it&amp;rsquo;s got random charts, monster stats, examples, illustrations, page numbers, and a ton of fancy words. But best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s got you and your imagination to kick off one hell of a good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
