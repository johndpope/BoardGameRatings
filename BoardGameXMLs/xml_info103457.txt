			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mike Stewart's Pro Bodyboarding&amp;quot; is a 3D bodyboarding arcade game with realistic waves, where you can perform real life tricks while surfing. The game is named after Mike Stewart, one of the pioneers of the sport, and winner of nine world championship titles. It features six different modes of play: Contest, Arcade, Slalom, Practice, Training and &amp;quot;Hot-seat&amp;quot; for Two-player. &lt;br/&gt;You can choose between eight different characters - including Stewart himself, to ride the waves, eight different bodyboards, and eight surfing locations from around the world, each with their own unique waves.&lt;br/&gt;When starting a game, the player needs to ride the board inside a wave, rendered in 3D. The boarder can be moved around and perform tricks such as forward spins, reverse spins, air rolls, backflips, double barrel rolls, and much more, for points. There are twelve types of tricks in total. The boarders also need to avoid rocks, buoys, and swimmers in some modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
