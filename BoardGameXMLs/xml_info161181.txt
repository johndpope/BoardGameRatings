			<description>In Totem!, you need to build the higher totem.  The game ends when a six-head totem is built or if no more cards can be drawn (the common deck is empty) and one player has no more cards in his hands. &lt;br/&gt; On each turn, each player either plays a totem head (which have an effect), a &amp;quot;low blow&amp;quot; card (which is discarded after the effect has been applied) or draws two cards. Of course, as you do this the other tribes are trying to do the same to you, wrecking your totem while building theirs. &lt;br/&gt;Cards allow to combinate effects and you can manage to play more than once during your turn. Team play and bluff is highly recommended in order not become a target for other players.&lt;br/&gt;That's why cards have action not only to upset players, but also to make alliances and help others !&lt;br/&gt;You can play several rounds to win points (when you win a round you score as much as the totem! height). A board where all players can score their points is provided. After each round you can then decide your next better target (which can be the leader of the race if it is not you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
