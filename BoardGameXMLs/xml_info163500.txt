They establish they colonies four planetary systems and gave birth to our people before gone. We lived centuries of peace and prosperity. But as it was predicted as the eras passed we became divided into four deeply different societies, four enemy factions. Our became starving for power, obsessed for domination. We started to insanely hate each other and now we only thing our once united societies thinks is about conquest. Each one built their own starship armada and declared war. Dreadful times came to our galaxy...May the K'wertz S'terats have mercy of our actions. Go to war my sons but remember: in the dark and cold space only death prevails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stellar Supremacy is a space combat game where 2 to 4 players struggle to domain the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four ways to win the game: Map area control, Home Worlds Control, Victory Points or opponents elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game brings to the players strategical and tatical levels of action and the ability to combine game elements to implement them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
