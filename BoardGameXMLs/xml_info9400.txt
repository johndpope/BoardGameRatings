			<description>Realistic game of modern naval warfare, without getting the player bogged down into too any technical details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is appreciated that modern naval vessels are equipped with highly sophisticated electronics and weapons systems, but their prime object is still to destroy enemy shipping or incoming missiles. It is therefore assumed that Ship&amp;rsquo;s Captains and Gunnery Officers will be aware of the best means to fight off incoming attacks and will use all available missiles and gunnery to its best advantage, as they close to tactical battle range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A percentage system has been adopted and therefore a lair of percentage dice will be needed to play the game. The dice -one red (10&amp;rsquo;s) and one white or black (units) are always thrown in pairs (e.g. an 8 on the red dice and a 2 on the white or black dice represents a throw of 82%). All figures in the tables are basic percentage chance of hits or detection, after this has been amended by the tactical factors which may apply, the final score is arrived at. A throw of this percentage or less is sufficient. A short measuring tape is provided for use when moving ships but an expanding metal tape will be of use for measuring the ranges of long range weapons.&lt;br/&gt;GROUND SCALE: 2 cm = 1 Nautical Mile&lt;br/&gt;TIME SCALE : 1 move = 5 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
