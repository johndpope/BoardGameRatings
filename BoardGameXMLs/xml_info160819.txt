							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcatype</name>
									
			<description>Arcatype is a combination of elements from strategy card games coupled with tactical-based unit placement on a hexagonal map with a number of capture points for players to fight over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player can summon a unit from his party onto the battlefield, evolve a unit already on the battlefield, move and attack with any units on the battlefield, or use a powerful spell card from the Arcana deck. Arcana cards are based on the Major Arcana cards of the Tarot, and each card has a powerful spell effect that you can play at any time to help turn the battle in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
