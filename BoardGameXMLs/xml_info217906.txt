			<description>Campaign Background and First Module&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Neverwinter has steadily recovered from the cataclysmic tear which ran throughout the south eastern city districts, many factions and individuals have flocked to the city to try to establish a foothold in one of the most promising regions in the known world. With surrounding lands rich in natural resources, the ideas of trading, crafting, protecting, thieving, exploiting, praising and praying, have people travelling from all over for a piece of the action. Now with the giant chasm sealed and vacant land up for grabs, many a merchant and individuals are marking plots of land to call their own.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;A merchant has been asking adventures or sell swords to look into some people disappearing happening within a small Village 32 miles south east of Neverwinter. His brother owns a small mill there and he is worried about the small township.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local guard are aware of this quest and will point characters towards the merchant who operates a small trader store on the southern outskirts of Neverwinter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For low-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
