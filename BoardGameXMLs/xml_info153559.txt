			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Future Is Back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of tomorrow comes into focus again, as countless near-future possibilities coalesce in front of your eyes. This month's issue of Pyramid -- the PDF magazine for roleplayers -- takes a look at the Transhuman Space setting. The latest installment unleashes the following memes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Three Offices, Port Lowell&amp;quot; explores a handful of the factions active in a bustling Martian town. The Transhuman Space Line Editor, Phil Masters, gives details on a few of the key people (including GURPS stats) and places likely to make the lives of residents and visitors very interesting.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;We Are the 9.9%&amp;quot; makes it simpler than ever to ease into Transhuman Space. Written by Jason &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot; Levine (author of GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions and other player-friendly guides) offers five new 100-point GURPS templates suitable for many different groups. Additionally, a campaign outline enables a GM to include just as much of each Wave as the players want.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Weapons and Units of the Honduran Civil War,&amp;quot; this month's Eidetic Memory offering from Transhuman Space creator David L. Pulver, presents the most common military mat&amp;eacute;riel of both sides of the conflict, including his notes and GURPS stats for this perpetual hot spot.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Indentures Inc.&amp;quot; puts a post-modern twist on servitude. After your heroes have perused the secretive company's brochures, will they be ready for the &amp;quot;best sleep you ever had&amp;quot; . . . and get paid in the process?&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Eloi Games&amp;quot; helps the wealthiest of Fifth Wavers figure out what to do with their lives. From William H. Stoddard -- mastermind of Transhuman Space: Transhuman Mysteries -- comes an examination of what it means to be &amp;quot;eloi,&amp;quot; what to do with all that money, and how to get into the right circles. This mini-supplement includes four new GURPS character traits and plenty of adventure ideas . . . whether you're in the inner circle or on the outside peering in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, Random Thought Table will help you mesh what authors thought would happen with what we all know has occurred, and Odds and Ends has a new GURPS bioroid template that couldn't fit elsewhere. With this Pyramid, your world of tomorrow is better than ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
