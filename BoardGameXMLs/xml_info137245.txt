			<description>The 4 seasons (Homebase) is a memory game with all illustrations in the theme of the various seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players try to get rid of their stack of cards as quickly as possible by searching matching cards. When the upturned card matches the card that the player is, those two cards from the game and a new map of the player's pile reversed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game lets you play at different levels: easier for young toddlers and harder for older or more experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;This game exercises: the concept of 'seasons' and the specific characteristics of each season. This game trains the memorizing and recognizing identical images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
