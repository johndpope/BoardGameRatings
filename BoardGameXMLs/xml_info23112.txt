			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Court in the Act is a murder mystery game for 13 to 21 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us at the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England for an evening of revelry, intrigue and murder. You will be in the middle of the action and it will be up to you to wheel and deal with the other guests. Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Court in the Act? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Court in the Act you will discover the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Who murdered the Archbishop of Canterbury? &lt;br/&gt;    Why must Queen Elizabeth never marry? &lt;br/&gt;    Who wrote Shakespeare's plays? &lt;br/&gt;    What is the secret of Dr John Dee's magical powers? &lt;br/&gt;    ...and can England be saved from defeat by the Spanish Armada? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in Court in the Act!&lt;br/&gt; Court in the Act&lt;br/&gt;The Court of St James's Palace, London, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. All present have but lately arrived from the Royal premier of Master Shakespeare's latest rib-tickling comedy, Two Ladies of Venice. Now, the Queen makes merry and entertains her courtiers, guests, would-be husbands and envoys from foreign powers with a sumptuous banquet. But while all prepare to feast and frolic, dark clouds gather, the sound of war-drums is heard in the distance - and that dear old man the Archbishop of Canterbury, who surely had never an enemy in the world, is found brutally murdered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Court in the Act lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (35 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
