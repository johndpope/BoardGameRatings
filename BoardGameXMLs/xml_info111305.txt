							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paul Panda</name>
									
			<description>Paul the Panda loves to sit and eat bamboo all day. Unfortunately, bamboo is a resource needed by man so the bamboo forests are being destroyed. In Paul Panda, players want to plant enough bamboo so that Paul has enough to eat and man has enough for their needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box has a perforated image of Paul Panda that can be lifted away from the surface and set vertically. This allows players to insert the included bamboo leaves into his mouth when he eats, with the leaves falling into the box. The bottom of the box consists of an &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; forest where the 24 included bamboo poles can be placed to represent a growing bamboo plant. The remaining component is a spinner with four different areas in which actions will be randomly determined based on a spin of the pointer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, after placing some bamboo poles in the forest, each player receives an equal number of poles, then the youngest player spins first. The four actions on the spinner are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Paul needs to eat. The player takes a bamboo pole from the forest and adds it to his supply. One of the ten leaves is then placed into the Panda's mouth, removing it from play.&lt;br/&gt;     The lumberjacks cut down some of the forest. The player takes two bamboo poles from the forest area and adds them to his supply.&lt;br/&gt;     The sun shines brightly. The player takes one bamboo pole from his personal supply and adds it to the forest.&lt;br/&gt;     Rain helps bamboo grow. The player takes two bamboo poles from his personal supply and adds them to the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to run out of bamboo poles wins; however, if Paul eats all ten bamboo leaves, the player with the fewest bamboo poles left wins the game, along with Paul the Panda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
