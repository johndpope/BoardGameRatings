							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Daimyo: Rebirth of the Empire</name>
									
			<description>Daimyo: Rebirth of the Empire is a game of strategy and action optimization. In a Japan that has renounced technology to focus on mystical and traditional values, you are one of the daimyos struggling to become the new emperor. What kind of leader will you be? Will you seek to expand your empire, to walk the mystical paths of the Kami, to confront enemy forces, or to gather the heroes of the country? Your success will depend on how you travel the path you have chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 3 colored dice and a 3-region personal board. After rolling your dice, allocate each one of them to a region. The regions will take into account either the side or the color of the die. It will allow you to do actions and earn mana. Use them well to move your meeples on the main board to get advantages from the controled zones. You can also use cards from your hand to do unforseen actions and take your opponents by surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways of getting Victory Points. It is up to you to try them all, or to focus to one or two of those ways. You can attack your opponents, spend your gold to enroll Heroes, expand your territory or choose the right colored dice at the right moment to go deeper in the mystic paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
