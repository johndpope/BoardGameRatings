			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soul Gambler is an interactive graphic novel inspired by Goethe&amp;rsquo;s Faust, a tragic play written in the 19th century. Soul Gambler puts you in the role of Faust, an ordinary young man living in the present day. His destiny is about to be changed forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Faust was leaving his boring work, a mysterious woman approached him. She made him a tempting proposal: by selling parts of his soul he would in exchange get all his wishes fulfilled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
