			<description>User translation from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The dwarf tore his long beard in horror and despair when he saw what we had freed when we opened the magical portal. Inside the glowing force field, on the other side of the pillar hall, a monster head started to take shape with huge drooling jaws and evil red cat eyes. 'Flee! Back to the ice cave!' the mage by my side shouted in panic, and we fled, fled like we never had fled before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we reached the eastern entrance of ice cave we saw the ancient dragon still in a deep magical slumber caused by our mage with his hexagram. With a speed that only the most terrifying of fear can create he erased the red chalk lines that kept the monster asleep, and as the dragon awoke we heard the demon lord's laughter and steps in the opening on the other side of the cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We ran towards the exit as if all the devils in hell were after us and when I think back to the sounds from the cave below us I wonder if that might have been true. In that moment we were probably the first in the world to hear the roars of a terrified dragon...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Monster you can find over 200 creatures for Drakar och Demoner's fantasy world detailed.
