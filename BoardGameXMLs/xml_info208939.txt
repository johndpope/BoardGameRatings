			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scratch the planet, discover the planet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many people often imagine what is in the universe and on alien planets. Planet Surprise is a game in which you can fulfill your dreams of exploring the universe. Perhaps you can find out what's hidden on the planet in the shape of a tennis ball, or what's in the mysterious flying box?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is wonderfully minimalist as each player has only one scratch card (similar to a scratch ticket). On your turn, you can land on a planet, which means that you scratch the scratching layer of one planet (with a fingernail or a coin) and look at what is hiding underneath. You will always find a point value underneath, positive or negative, and also certain surprises in the form of funny graphics. The goal is to uncover the planet with the highest score. (During ten actions, you will uncover about ten planets out of sixteen.) Each set includes different deployment of points and different jokes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of scratching, you can navigate the opponent to land on a planet of your choice, without doubt the most beautiful one of those that you discovered. Some actions will allow you to gain insight into your opponent's game so that you might know better on which planets it pays to visit and which to avoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet Surprise originated as a little brother of a much larger project, a fantasy offline/online game with scratch cards called Scratch Wars. All you need to play Planet Surprise is one scratch card for each player, but they need to be all from the same set of cards (as players need to explore the same universe).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
