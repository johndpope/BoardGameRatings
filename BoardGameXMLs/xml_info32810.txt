			<description>Featured in the book Games We Play as an example of an early game from Nuremberg.  The game appears to be a four person game of checkers played on cross with 33 holes, and the playing pieces are pins about the size of golf tees.  The board is actually the lid of a wooden box that holds the pieces.  Unlike other games from this early 1800's Nuremberg period, there is a chance copies of this game exist, even in mint condition, because it looks to be all wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
