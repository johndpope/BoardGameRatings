							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maure Castle: Chambers of Antiquities</name>
									
			<description>From the Adventure Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary architect of the Maure Castle dungeons was an enigmatic and mysterious figure known only as &amp;quot;Uncle.&amp;quot; Uncle created the Chambers of Antiquities as a place to store artifacts and other powerful magic items the family obtained or discovered. During the Maure reign, the family studied the contents as time allowed, but due to their many other projects and designs, most of the items Uncle collected went untested. The family's notes, in books deposited here in the various libraries or in quarters adjacent to the artifact in question, can sometimes give a clue to the item's nature or history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Gary Con event listing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maure Castle is one of the seminal Castles from the early day of the hobby and the one-time home of the powerful and influential Maure family. This adventure locale offers much for the bold adventuring party. Characters can seek out valuable artifacts such as Sir Robilar's Dragon Ring of Lynn, the Ruby Robe of Spell Warding, or the Codex of Dead Names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure that takes place in a single level of Maure Castle.  The DM, Jon Hershberger, handed out copies to the players in his game at Gary Con VII. The pages are printed out and stapled together, but were not folded. There is a paper cutout depicting the Maure family crest that has been glued to the cover. The map, which is separate from the rest of the &amp;quot;book,&amp;quot; is printed, cut by hand, and glued to a second piece of paper. There is also an additional sheet listing the (known) levels of Maure Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
