			<description>This game is a combination of the three games: R&amp;eacute;union &amp;amp; Mauritius, Mauritius &amp;amp; R&amp;eacute;union and Rodrigues &amp;amp; Mauritius.  The rules for each game are consistent and apply to this game also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need all three boards (side by side in that order) and tickets plus each player will need three sets of wagons (one for each board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will start with your markers at zero on each board.  Begin play on one island (Rodrigues, Mauritius or R&amp;eacute;union) and, if you wish, stay on that board throughout the game.  However, when you reach the coast, you may take a ferry to another island &amp;ndash; now you may still play on that board or you may continue your journey from the port of arrival on the next board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may travel in any direction from board to board, always travelling to a part-island and then moving to the same port on the main island.  Or stay on one or two boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
