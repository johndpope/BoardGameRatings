							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fool&#039;s Gold</name>
									
			<description>(From the Publisher and or Back Cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fool&amp;rsquo;s Gold is an Aces &amp;amp; Eights adventure set in Lazarus, a&lt;br/&gt;boomtown on the rise, and the hills of El Diablo&amp;rsquo;s Caldera, land coveted by Imperial Mexico, the Republic of Texas, Desert, and the United States, but occupied by &amp;quot;heathens, squatters, Indians and bandits.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange influx of gold nuggets has caused a great deal of interest among the townsfolk of Lazarus, but is all that glitters really gold? Does a strange, solitary prospector hold the answers - or is it the local Apache - or a notorious gang of bandits? And whatever happened to the missing prospectors - or to the ghost town of Christian&amp;rsquo;s Folly? Attempting to answer these questions reveals ominous hints that everything is not what it seems. What ensues puts the players on the path to the solution, but the&lt;br/&gt;odds are against them, and many encounters await them within the dusty hills. Even what seems like success may be merely a prelude to revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as providing adventures in town, wilderness, and subterranean settings, Fool&amp;rsquo;s Gold includes hooks for various types of player characters, plus local rumors, several reference and area maps, non-player character&lt;br/&gt;statistics, and more, all in an easy to use format. Even after the players finish the adventure, you can use the supplemental material again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
