							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lawrence of Arabia</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card Game for 2+ players. Each player represents an incarnation of Lawrence of Arabia. Players recruit Arab allies and use them to attack the Turks. Victory: The first player to have Mission cards in his Victory pile with a total Force Rating of 40 or more wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of cards. There are five types of cards in the deck: Events, Leaders, Tribesmen, Missions, Defenses. The players put Leader cards into play in order to recruit Tribesmen. Leaders and Tribesmen are assigned to complete missions on Mission Cards. Defense cards are played against other players. Each time a Leader and his band are used for a mission, there is a chance they may disband and be removed from the player's control after the mission has been completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
