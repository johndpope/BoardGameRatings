			<description>Tomb Raider: The Prophecy is an action-adventure video game released in November 2002 for the Game Boy Advance, part of the Tomb Raider franchise. It was developed by Core Design and Ubisoft Milan, and published jointly by Eidos Interactive and Ubisoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based around an ancient prophecy written in the Tome of Ezekiel, which tells of three magical stones, used by various powerful rulers around the world. Lara must find these stones before a cult known as the Teg-du-Bhorez can collect them all and use them to revive a mystical being known as the Great Grey One, thus bringing about the end of the world. Throughout the game Lara searches for the stones and thinks that she has found them. However, she realises that she was mistaken and has to come back to defeat the game's villain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tomb Raider: The Prophecy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
