			<description>The cards are placed in the middle of the table. The players roll a die and take cards accordingly to the result of their roll. If no card of the rolled number is in the middle of the table, the player steals a corresponding card from another player. The players try to collect 4-card-sets (&amp;quot;Staffeln&amp;quot;) as specified in the game rules.  For each completed set, the Player gets a specified amout of game tokens from the other players. A Set of one only color or number is called &amp;quot;Hauptstaffelreihe&amp;quot;. After the Points f&amp;uuml;r a &amp;quot;Hauptstallelreihe&amp;quot; are awarded, the cards are taken out of the game and can't be stolen by other players. When there are no more cards in the middle of the table, the game ends and the player with the most game tokens is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
