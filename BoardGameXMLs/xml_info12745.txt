			<description>A Teetotum is a cube skewered on a spindle so that it spins like a top and lands on one of its sides giving out a random reading. Probably originating in Ancient Rome, it was used for gambling through the ages, and is the forerunner of Dreidel, Morgan's Revenge and Put &amp; Take Game. It was later modified into a polygonal shape to either increase odds or function as multiple sides of a die. Since the church frowned upon tossing dice, the teetotum also became a random chance substitute used in Victorian Era board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some variations of the rules in existance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)Players bet money on a numbered diagram, then would wait to see which of their numbers comes up, like a roulette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2)Players agree on a set ante, then follow the lettered spinning top's instructions till somoene lands the top on &amp;quot;take all&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3)Two players spin the top and the person landing it on its highest or lowest value wins the pot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants of markings include&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H (Half)&lt;br/&gt;P (Put)&lt;br/&gt;T (Take)&lt;br/&gt;N (Nothing)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malta/ Italy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M (Mezzo)&lt;br/&gt;P (Paga)&lt;br/&gt;T (Tutto) &lt;br/&gt;N (Niente)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
