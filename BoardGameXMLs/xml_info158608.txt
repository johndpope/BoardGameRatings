			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in rpgs often have abilities are not tied to their class, race or skill, although they may be related/useful to it. These are called Feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may be combat related, a way to tweak spells or even to do with the crafting of an item. Some will be useful to almost everyone, others only in very certain circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition of &amp;ldquo;Fantastic Feats&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a series of feats based around a certain theme or subject &amp;ndash; is about Paladins, those noble warriors who oppose evil with their body and soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feats you find inside:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Companion Bond - Have a better bond with your party&lt;br/&gt;     Empathic Expert - Become better at being empathic with animals&lt;br/&gt;     Expert Tracker - Your favoured terrain is your second home&lt;br/&gt;     Favoured Damage Maximise - You know just how to hurt your favoured enemy more&lt;br/&gt;     Favoured Intimidation - Your favoured enemies are more intimidated by you&lt;br/&gt;     Risky Combat - Your favoured enemies damage can decrease, but sometimes increase&lt;br/&gt;     Terrain Master - Become one with your favoured terrain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
