							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Symposion</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A Symposion is a Greek word meaning a Wine drinking party. These were popular in ancient Greece. Depending on the Host (Symposiarch), the emphasis of the gathering could range from purely Intellectual discussion to Hedonistic debauchery.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players score points by hosting a Symposion. This is done by playing a set of cards and declaring whether the Symposion is intellectual, social, or hedonistic. The type of Symposion determines how points are calculated for the particular cards played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the deck has been gone through three times and no player has a Symposion to play. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
