			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: The Arrangement is a transmedia setting enhancement for Contagion Second Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity. Supernatural creatures stalk the night, hiding among, and sometimes hunting, humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent months a group of demons, the Mastim, have shifted their approach to collecting human souls. While the majority of the Mastim caste seeks worship through the use of false gods, the recent return of the Ilu has led to brutal conflict inspiring some of the more forward-thinking Mastim to change their approach to seeking followers. This small group of Mastim, known as the &amp;ldquo;Sales Department,&amp;rdquo; has abandoned the standard M.O. of the Mastim in favor of directly marketing damnation to the human masses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: The Arrangement focuses on one such deal, where the demon Gallu seeks to finalize a pact with a desperate human woman, Sheri Bronson.  Tragedy has touched Sheri&amp;rsquo;s life and she pins all her hopes on Gallu to resolve her problems. Naturally, Gallu offers his aid, but for a very steep price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Stories: The Arrangement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 17 page setting enhancement detailing two new feats and two adventure seeds.&lt;br/&gt;    Biographical information and pregenerated character sheets for the two new characters featured in War Stories: The Arrangement.&lt;br/&gt;    A short film/video asset to be used as an in-game prop/story aid by the Gamemaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
