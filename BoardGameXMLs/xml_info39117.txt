							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fish Frenzy Toss</name>
									
			<description>This game is for 2-4 players.  Components include folding game board, and many different colorful fishes.  The game board represents a body of water with a sleeping fisherman floating in his boat and several scoring zones worth differing amounts.  The object is to toss or flick your fish to hit the highest scoring zones (or knock opponents fish off of them!) while avoiding the fisherman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
