			<description>The player rolls the dice to determine how many spaces to move. If&lt;br/&gt;the second roll is the same as the first roll, the player draws a card.&lt;br/&gt;If the player lands on, or passes over the end of a level, the player jumps up to the next level. This does not count as a move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can win the game by being the first player to reach the bowl of&lt;br/&gt;dog food at the top of the board. You must land exactly on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
