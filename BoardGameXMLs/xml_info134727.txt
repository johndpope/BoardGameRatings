			<description>Rules:&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a color. Red is for Edam cheese, yellow for Gouda. The 18 pieces are placed on the 18 circles in the board according to their color. A coin/die is tossed to decide who goes first. The aim of the game is to stack three cheeses in your color on top of each other.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn moves a disk in his color one space in any direction (orthogonally or diagonally). Disks can either be moved onto an adjacent empty space, stacked on a disk of whatever color, or removed from the top of a stack and moved one space further (only the top disk on a stack can be moved). A lone disk cannot be moved onto an empty space. A player must move a disk when his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to stack three disks of his color on top of each other, or to block the opposing player so that he can no longer move on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
