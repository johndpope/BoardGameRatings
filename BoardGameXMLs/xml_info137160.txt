			<description>Game that appeared in More Games, Puzzles and Pastimes , published by Odhams Press in 1959.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for this novel game:&lt;br/&gt;For this game you require a pack of playing cards. Shuffle and place them face downwards on the table and each player in turn, commencing from the left and going round clockwise, draws one card from the top of the pack. You must not look at your own cards until all have been drawn from the pack. Each player then turns up his &amp;ldquo;catch&amp;rdquo; and adds up the total number of ounces.&lt;br/&gt;You will see the weight of each fish is given in the picture together with numbers which represent the numbers on an ordinary playing card. If you draw a 9 or Jack they are too small to count and you must return the 9 with one fish from your catch and return the Jack with two fish from your catch to the pool.&lt;br/&gt;If you draw a 2 you will find you have been &amp;ldquo;caught in the weeds&amp;rdquo; and you must return your heaviest fish to the pool. As there are four 2&amp;rsquo;s in the pack you may have to return more than one fish.&lt;br/&gt;Divide the total number of ounces you have &amp;ldquo;caught&amp;rdquo; by 16 to turn the ounces into pounds, and the first to &amp;ldquo;catch&amp;rdquo; 100 pounds of fish will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
