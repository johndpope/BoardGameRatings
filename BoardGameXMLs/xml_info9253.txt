							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keep Smiling!</name>
									
			<description>Your smiles against your opponents, your smiles against your grimmies and the neutral. A nice collection, face down and lined up against each other! The aim of the game is to make the breakthrough with your smilies, using psychological tactics, good fortune and a poker face, But your opponent is trying to do the same. It's enough to make you a grimmy yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But who wants to identify with something that will count against you later on, So keep smiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
