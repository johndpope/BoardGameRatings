			<description>This is a children's game based on the Disney movie Pocahontas. Players take turns rolling a die and moving around the board to collect various leaf tokens. The first player to collect all the leafs and return them to where they belong wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a &amp;quot;Gigantik&amp;quot; board--a large, plastic playing mat measuring 76x96cm (30&amp;quot;x 38&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Join Pocahontas and all her friends on an adventurous trip to discover the colours of the wind. A gust of wind has blown through Grandmother Willow's enchanted glade and scattered an assortment of coloured leaves into the river. Help Pocahontas, John Smith, Meeko and Flit collect their leaves and return to where they fell from. The first player to return all of their leaves wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
