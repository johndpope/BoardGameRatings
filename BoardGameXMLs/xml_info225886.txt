							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">North Vs. South: A Civil War Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card based strategy card game where players are trying to secure the most cities as possible before the fight between the North and South is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will obtain cities as they go and try to hold as many as possible by placing defense cards to protect and keep them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other players will use attack cards to attack the cities and acquire them, while drawing from the deck.  Drawing from the deck will allow players to build their army and obtain free cities to keep and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when Abe Lincoln, the Emancipation Proclamation, Gettysburg address and Appomattox courthouse are drawn.  The players with the most cities at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
