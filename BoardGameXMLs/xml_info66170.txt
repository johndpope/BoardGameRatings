			<description>Some of London's main streets are familiar to a host of children and adults through the Monopoly board game, with almost everyone recognising the names of Mayfair, Park Lane and Bond Street.&lt;br/&gt;This Christmas, the towns and cities of Wales will become equally as familiar, with a new Welsh-language version of the game. Cardiff Bay will replace Mayfair and the Menai Straits will take over from Park Lane.&lt;br/&gt;In welcoming the new Welsh-language version, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Minister for Heritage, said: 'We are extremely pleased that the Books Council have been able to support the Welsh-language Monopoly and its success will not only bring pleasure to many this Christmas, but will also enable families across Wales to play this popular board game through the medium of Welsh.'&lt;br/&gt;Winning Moves, who have produced a number of versions of the popular board game based on different regions of Britain, are pleased to add a distinctive Welsh-language version to the collection, with the players winning or losing their fortune as they travel the length and breadth of Wales.&lt;br/&gt;The company invited the Books Council to assist them in selecting appropriate names for the game board, and the Council sought the assistance of the leading language expert D. Geraint Lewis, who has published numerous dictionaries and grammar books.&lt;br/&gt;'We were delighted to be able to work with Winning Moves to produce the Welsh-language version of this popular board game,' said Gwerfyl Pierce Jones, Director of the Welsh Books Council.&lt;br/&gt;'The Welsh-language version of Scrabble proved to be a best-seller and we are sure that Monopoly yn Gymraeg (Monopoly in Welsh) will have similar success amongst Welsh speakers and Welsh learners of all ages. The whole process was a most pleasing challenge and D. Geraint Lewis's contribution as a consultant was a key factor in ensuring that the game reflected all the different regions of Wales.'&lt;br/&gt;A set of both English- and Welsh-language rules are included with each game, to assist Welsh learners.&lt;br/&gt;D. Geraint Lewis added: 'Nothing gives me more pleasure than seeing people playing board games through the medium of Welsh, and to know that these games are of the highest quality.'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
