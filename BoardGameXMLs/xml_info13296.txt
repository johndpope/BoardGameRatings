			<description>TRADITION - a game of Jewish facts, trivia, and humor - has stimulated and delighted Jewish as well as non-Jewish minds since its introduction in the U.S. in June, 1985.  The 250 cards contain 3,000 questions and answers (all reviewed by a rabbi) in the following categories:  Yiddish, proverbs &amp;amp; more!; Customs and holidays; History, Geography &amp;amp; politics; Israel; Ancient and Biblical history; and Arts, sciences, entertainment &amp;amp; sports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two or more persons or teams, aged 13 through adult can play TRADITION.  A player rolls the die and moves in either direction around the board, trying to land on one of 40 squares with values of 5, 10, 15, or 25 points.  The players must then answer a question correctly to move again, each time claiming the square and value.  Once all the squares are claimed, the points are added and the player or team with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some sample questions: (1) What does the Yiddish word &amp;quot;nosh&amp;quot; mean? (a snack or treat) (2) What is the marriage canopy called? (Chupah) etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
