			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for characters of almost any background and a fair amount of experience, preferably in league with the forces of good and order. The setting is the south of France, near Ste. Tropez. It would probably be most appropriate that the characters be on vacation and not involved in some kind of mission. It is likely that someone will have suggested that while they are in the area they look up Revancheur and La Sorciere (two members of the Defenseurs), who have a beach house near San Tropez. The adventure will begin when they go to make this call. Almost any sort of character could be appropriate for the adventure, preferably a fairly small and varied group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
