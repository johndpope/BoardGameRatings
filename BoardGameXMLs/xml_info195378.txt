			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the world, there exists a darker side to the world of superhumans. Called the Underbelly, it's a world of Covert Ops units, superhuman serial killers, vigilantes and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brotherhood of the Black Lotus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Started by Mongolian Monks who studied at Shaolin Temple, the Brotherhood has evolved into a criminal syndicate of some influence. Led by the Black Lama, they have spread out from Hong Kong across Asian and North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightdevil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Drake lost his regular sight, but gained the power of Infrared Sight. Recruited by the Nemesis Foundation (who revealed his father was killed by the Brotherhood), Nightdevil wages a one man war against the Black Lotus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who own Search &amp; Destroy, the Black Lotus organization is statted out using the rules from that supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
