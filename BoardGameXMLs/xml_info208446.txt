			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure starts in the town of Borschweig, some fifty miles west of Middenheim and situated along one of the lesser used roads to that city, and the town of Blutgel-on-Gwyth which is upriver from it. They are situated along the minor river Yurtz and one one of its tributaries, the Gwyth. Players would happen upon Borschweig while travelling either to or from Middenheim while staying off the main trade road and, of course, GM's have the option of simply transplanting the entire Yurtz to nearly anywhere in the Old World and most of the details should still be correct. It is most suitable for characters on perhaps their second careers and should take, at most, no more than four hours to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
