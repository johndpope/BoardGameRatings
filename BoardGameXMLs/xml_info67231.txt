							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treetop Village</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The old guy said the village was here! cried the fighter glancing in the woods around him. So where in the hell is the damn village?.We absolutely need a cleric for our wounded companion shouted the wizard.&lt;br/&gt;The ranger stared toward the sky and smiled&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The treetop village is suspended between huge trees. Many crawlways link various buildings of the village, snaking around the branches and spiraling around the gigantic plants. Some well-hidden stairs lead to the village and an elevator provides a more comfortable way to climb up. The village has everything it needs: a villa, a meeting hall, a council hall, a great inn with detached bedrooms and some shops.&lt;br/&gt;Some hints to use the village follow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The adventurers are walking in the wood when a couple of arrows drop over them. The arrows bear a distinctive mark. The PCs discover the village over their heads and climb up to investigate. The treetop village dwellers are elves and the PCs discover that the arrows belong to the son of the elf king who was spending the night at the village. The young elf claim his innocence but all seems against him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The PCs stumble into the treetop village and spend the night at the inn. During the night an elf PC (or NPC) disappears. If the PCs investigate, they find that during the last month 30 elves disappeared. A doppelganger took the identity of the innkeeper and, using some drugs, he sells elves to the drow who dwell in the underground near the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A small community of men and elves have built the treetop village in order to defend themselves from the orcs and other monsters. Suddenly, while the PCs are visiting the village, the druid discovers that the huge trees are dying. An unknown plant disease is found within each of the village&amp;rsquo;s trees. The PCs must unmask the orc shaman, polymorphed and disguised as good druid who pretends to heal the plants with his magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
