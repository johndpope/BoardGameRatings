			<description>In Reliquium each player takes control of one of four warring factions: Chaos Legion, Alliance of Nature, Order of Light and Mountain Brotherhood in struggle to achieve uncontested domination. Path to victory lies through conquering new lands and getting access to more resources, managing troops, and calculated use of legendary warriors from Bestiary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 3 castles already built (one of each type). &lt;br/&gt;Each castle gives player an action based on type of territory it occupies:&lt;br/&gt;Plains - march or issue attack order&lt;br/&gt;Mountain - recruit or issue support order&lt;br/&gt;Forest - build a castle or summon legendary creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players resolve actions one at a time, cycling through all players until no more actions left. After all players are done then combat resolves. Afterwards, play continues to the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who manages to build all 9 castles first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
