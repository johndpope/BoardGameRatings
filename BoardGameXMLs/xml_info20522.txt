			<description>This game is played on a four-by-four grid, and the object is to get four disks of your own color in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.  At the start of the game, the board is populated with neutral brown disks.  Each turn, the current player pushes one of his or her disks onto the board using one of eight entrance ramps.  As a result, a different disk gets pushed off the opposite end of the board.  Players may shove off neutral pieces or their own pieces, but not pieces belonging to their opponents.  If a player runs out of men, then the player may use a neutral disk. The plastic game board doubles as a storage case for the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;16 Tan Discs&lt;br/&gt;8 Orange discs&lt;br/&gt;8 yellow discs&lt;br/&gt;rules &lt;br/&gt;board&lt;br/&gt;tray that attaches under board to hold pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
