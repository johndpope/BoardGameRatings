			<description>Run, Hamster, Run! is a somewhat cut-throat strategy game for two to five players.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;See the following site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/games/rhrnoframe.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/games/rhrnoframe.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a hamster on a 5x10 conveyor belt that leads to a pit of hungry Alligators. The object of the game is to be the last hamster left in play. There are several hazards that make this challenging:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Conveyor Belt: You must keep moving up the Conveyor Belt or you'll get dumped off the edge into... &lt;br/&gt;     The Alligator Pit: At the end of the Conveyor Belt is a pit with one or more hungry alligators in it. If it comes down to a battle between a hamster and an alligator, my money's on the reptile. &lt;br/&gt;     Other hamsters: Other hamsters may try to push you into the Alligator Pit to increase their odds of being the last one in the game. Be careful! &lt;br/&gt;     Fatigue: The stress of constant exertion will wear down even the heartiest hamster. You've got to stop running eventually you know... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of using dice, Run, Hamster, Run! has players put chips in a bag to determine the outcome of contests. This use of chips creates a strong focus on resource allocation. As the hamsters take damage or become fatigued, they lose chips from their pool, further emphasizing the importance of careful resource usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
