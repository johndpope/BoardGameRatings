			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MindMush is the first in the Canary Overdrive: Missions series, each of which is designed to take one session to play. Missions are broken up into three acts that ramp up the adventure as the mission goes on. Each act contains one or more objectives, which offer a simple breakdown as to what the players will be doing during that act. Each act also has its own NPC recommendations for the Puppet Master to use as liberally as she likes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prologue sets the scene of the mission and offers the Puppet Master an insight into what has happened before the mission begins. This should not be shared with the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t find a lot of minute detail in this book. The idea is that you and your players work together to create a thrilling story that is more about the plot than minutiae. Try not to get bogged down in the details just have fun making an action-packed experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
