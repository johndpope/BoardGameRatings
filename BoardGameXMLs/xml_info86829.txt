To return among normal people, Tibor has a long way from his village to the castle of Countess Zarina Sibilskog in which  Kosinius, a scientist created a magic potion for the vampire. Will Kosinius' magic potion help Tibor to become again an ordinary person?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;1 board&lt;br/&gt;40 playing tiles&lt;br/&gt;10 scoring tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this simple game the players place tiles on a grid, trying to connect their village with their castle (if they place a tile with a garlic on it, they gain a score tile with 1-3 points).
