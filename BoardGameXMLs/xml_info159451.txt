			<description>Confounded is a game for two, played on a 3x9 rectangular grid of squares.  Each player has nine pieces, or &amp;quot;spots,&amp;quot; in their own color.  The board is divided into three 3x3 sections, with each player claiming one side and the central territory in dispute.  Three each of a player's &amp;quot;spots&amp;quot; are marked with either the number one, two, or three.  The game begins with the three spots in the row closest to the players, the two spots in the next row inward, and the one spots in the next row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving one piece at a time and try to claim the central area or prevent their opponent from doing so.  All spots move only forward.  One spots move one square diagonally.  Two spots move two squares directly forward.  Three spots move either two squares forward and one square sideways, or one square sideways and two squares forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capture of pieces is by displacement and there are a number of rules governing it.  To win the game, a player must occupy five squares of the central area, or block his opponent from moving, or reduce his opponent to less than five pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
