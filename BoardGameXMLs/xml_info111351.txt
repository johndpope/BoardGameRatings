			<description>From on-line store product description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermopolia (singular: thermopolium) were bars serving hot drinks and snacks) were common in the Roman world. This floor plan is based on the thermopolium of Asellina, the best-preserved bar in Pompeii, and a larger establishment in the villa of Julia Felix. Both were preserved when they were covered in ash by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79, and provide a huge bounty of information to historians. Asellina's bar had rooms for rent and thus is also a small inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book describes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Asellina's Bar, Pompeii, AD 79.&lt;br/&gt;    The bar in the villa of Julia Felix, Pompeii, AD 79.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
