							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ori Velasquez</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her name is Orinda Velasquez. Her family tried to protect her from a history of violence, but they could only protect her for so long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the path to vengeance led only to a humiliating defeat, her father called in some favors, and that's when her life got very interesting. She went from being a world-famous swimsuit model to a woman of action overnight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's what happens, though, when you're in the world of HOT CHICKS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fifth in a series of Character Studies... detailed examinations of characters that occupy the back alleys and shadows of the Earth of 2015. Included are over forty images of Ori in various stages of dress and imperilment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read her history, study her form, and view her statistics. She makes an ideal NPC companion, ally, and is a beautiful complication for your Hot Chicks games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
