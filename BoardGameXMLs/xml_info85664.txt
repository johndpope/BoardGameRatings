							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atlantis Class Cruiser</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATLANTIS Class Cruisers measure over 500 feet in length and are comprised of 4 levels. The ship itself is divided into three main sections, a forward hull than includes all command areas and engineering, a main hull that includes most living quarters, weapons, defensive and environmental systems, and the rear engine cluster that is made up of three independent engine units. Each standard Atlantis Class Cruiser is equipped with 4 fusion beams in two batteries of two, a battery of two CHE missile launchers (24 missiles each), magnetic defense field emitters, an autopilot system, a chaff launcher, a decoy drone launcher, a point defense system, radiation shielding, a self destruct system, and an improved damage control system. Sensors include a Class III array and targeting system. The outer hull is made of vanadium, and the engines are a combination of fusion torch and thrusters. The ship has a crew of 95, with an additional passenger capacity of 50 in emergencies. The  characters can be crew members onboard, or discover the ship adrift in space without her crew or possibly be tasked with retrieving the ship after it has been commandeered by hostile forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
