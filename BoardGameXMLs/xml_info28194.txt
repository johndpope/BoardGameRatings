							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lawn Darts</name>
									
			<description>Lawn Darts is quite simply a game about playing lawn darts indoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harken back to the good old days when you had a 2 foot long dart that you threw or tossed at a small plastic yellow or red ring.  (and incidentally maybe at your friends toes or random appendages). Relive the summer fun with this quick mini reproduction of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note... this is not the real thing... if you were to be playing this game... well there is not a foot and half long metal dart flying through the air.  We use smaller magnetic tipped darts and our field of green is a felt field with rings backed by a magnetic strip.  The essence of the game is still the same... get it in the rings.  But if you want a bit of danger well we've included two felt feet as well... impale one with a dart and you lose points.  Finish the round without sticking a dart into the tender tootsies... and you'll find your score climbs up a bit more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have any questions... well I'm (mbourgeois) the guy to ask.  We don't forsee production on this game anytime soon.  There simply isn't the current market for it.  However if you'd like to make your own... just ask for info and we'll send off the material requirements and measurements to make your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2279107#2279107&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2279107#2279107&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
