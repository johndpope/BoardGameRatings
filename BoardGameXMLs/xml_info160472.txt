			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working as a government leisure consultant full time (on the dole) is nor really the job for you, so you decide to go in search of some way of earning a quick buck.&lt;br/&gt;Wandering the streets you are unable to find a vacancy anywhere, until you spot a vacancy sign hanging in the window of a small hotel down a quiet side street. You enter this rather ramshackle place to find the vacancy is for a waiter, pure desperation for work makes you apply for the job, and the mean looking boss man decides you'll do, but warns he'll be keeping a beady eye on you. You are soon fitted out in your natty waistcoat and trousers ready to serve the customers' every whim. you wait in the reception for your first call, and it doesn't take long for the first guest to scream for service, so off you run to find out what they require. In the first lift you leap as it passes taking you up into the building, you have been called to the third floor so on that floor you leap out. You have to wait for the next lift to pass and leap in, you timed it wrong and your tip is dropping but you'll soon learn. The lift finally passes, in you dive. now you have the knack you race into the next lift and so on to the next. This is the final lift so you wait for it to pass the floor form where the customer is waving, out you leap and find out what they need.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;WINE!!!&amp;quot; they call and off you run to the floor where the wine is served, pick up the glasses of wine and serve them and pick up your very small tip. You are only paid by tips so the quicker you learn this waiter lark the better for you. Returning to the reception there is already a call for you, and once again you are off on your merry way. But remember the manager will always be around and if you trip on your way to into the lift you will get a written warning and if he sees you, you'll be sacked on the spot. The tip is always dropping and if you haven't served them by the time it reaches zero they will throw back their drink and in a drunken stupor come and find where you have gone to. If they do find you they will not be too pleased and probably knock your drinks everywhere, their complaints to the manager bringing yet another written warning. That's two written warning, another one and you're out on your butt, so be warned.&lt;br/&gt;Yep the life of a waiter sure ain't an easy one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wacky Waiters you play a waiter whose job is to transport drinks to customers. This involves traversing four moving lifts over six levels. If you miss a step onto a lift, then you fall down the shaft and lose a life. You must move quickly because your tip is always counting down. Completing a round trip to a customer, to the drink they ordered and back to the customer scores the remaining value of the tip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Eugene Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
