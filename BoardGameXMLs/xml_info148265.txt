			<description>Life in the Fast Lane is a real-time card game playable only with the Strength Stack 52: Bodyweight Exercise Cards deck or with another deck of numbered cards. To start, deal the cards evenly among all players, with players leaving those cards face down in front of them. Place one card face up in the center of the playing area; this forms the &amp;quot;Fast Lane&amp;quot;, and the final digit on this card (and each other card) is what's important during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing at the same time, everyone picks up and scans their cards, trying to find a legal play, specifically a card with a final digit one number higher or lower than the top card of the Fast Lane. As soon as someone plays such a card and announces the number of the card played, players must now find and play a card matching this new top card. If a player has a wild card, he can play it at anytime, announcing the number that it represents. The first player to play all of his cards wins, while the losing players must perform all of the exercises on the cards they are left holding. Anyone holding a wild card must perform their exercises twice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a speedier and wilder game, place two cards in the Fast Lane. Now everyone has two stacks on which to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
