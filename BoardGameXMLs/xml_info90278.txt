			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills make up an important part of any role playing game. A character's skills are what make him or her versatile and unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 4E, skills are broken down into a small number of broad categories, with each able to be used in a number of creative ways. The latest incarnation of the game has also introduced us to the skill challenge, a dramatic encounter where the situation is resolved through a series of skill checks instead of the combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Skill Alone includes notes on designing your own skill challenges, presents a collection of new skill challenges suitable for parties of all levels from the heroic to the epic tier, gives new uses for every skill found in the 4E player's book, and also includes three new Rituals whose results are based on skill usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
