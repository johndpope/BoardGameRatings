							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tierra y Libertad: The Mexican Revolution Game (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Come back in space and time, now you are in the Mexico of 1910, Porfirio Diaz has been in power for more than 30 years. With the slogan &amp;quot;Order and Progress&amp;quot; the country has been brought to modernity, electricity is implemented in cities, train lines are spread throughout the Republic, foreign investment appears everywhere and the exchange rate of the Mexican peso It is equal to the american dollar.&lt;br/&gt;But ... on the other hand, the peasants live in deplorable conditions, outrageous laws are stripped of their land and then hired to work as salaried employees, the dismayed people observe how the political contenders are repressed and the new reelection is prepared.&lt;br/&gt;The Flores Magon brothers use the press to express the dissatisfaction of the people and Francisco I. Madero prepares an uprising with the phrase &amp;quot;effective suffrage, no re-election&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Tierra y Libertad is a cooperative game, take a place at the table, you will take the role of one of the rebel factions and together they will try to change the Constitution of the country so that it includes the demands of the people.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this, notable revolutionaries will join your faction, you will also need plans that represent historical events, which are activated with resources (troops, weapons, revolutionary ideas and political power) that you get in different regions of Mexico. The combats are the order of the day, and the actions of the factions do not always help the cause. Players should carefully plan their planning so as not to be crushed by the conservative machinery.&lt;br/&gt;If the players manage to reach the fourth round and also all together make 100 or more victory points then they will have won as a team and a new and inclusive Constitution will now govern the country's destiny.&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise, if objectives of victory points are not met at the end of each round or at the end of the fourth round the factions do not reach or pass the 100 victory points then the counterrevolutionaries will have won, the flame of the Revolution will be extinguished and the course to prosperity will be conducted with the rules of yesteryear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
