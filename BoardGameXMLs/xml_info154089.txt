			<description>Pioneers is a thematic card game inspired by the old video game Oregon Trail. You play as a pioneer crossing the United States in the 1830's. You gather supplies, play action cards, and encounter events that can help you along, or hinder your travels. The goal is to get to the west coast first by spending resources to travel to cities. You will be collecting supply cards, surviving events, and interacting with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Every player starts the game with a party leader card that grants special abilities along with 3 party members. If all 3 party members die, you lose and the game continues. In the center of the table are destination decks that every player is trying to travel to. To travel to a destination, you spend the required resources shown, acquire the card, and move on to the next destination. The player that gets the set of 2 rivers, and 3 cities, ends the game and wins after a final round if no other players collect all their destinations. Your party size is used as a tiebreaker if needed. &lt;br/&gt;Each player turn consists of drawing cards, playing actions (on themselves or other players), traveling to a destination, and discarding cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
