			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The giant Celt laughed out loud. &amp;ldquo;Of course! I would have to be you two!&amp;rdquo; he said as he gathered both girls into a giant hug. &lt;br/&gt;        &amp;ldquo;Y-You know us?&amp;rdquo; Tara said.&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;ldquo;Know you? Know you! My dear sweet Liath, I would know you if my eyes had been plucked from my skull! Do you know me? It is I, Fionn!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;ldquo;Finn. Ok, so who are we then?&amp;rdquo; asked Willow.&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;ldquo;My dearest Bodhmal! Always with the riddles, ok I will play. You both are my mothers! We must celebrate, our family is whole again!&amp;rdquo; Fionn said as he pulled the two, very confused, girls into another enthusiastic bear hug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the title page:&lt;br/&gt;An Episode for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Ghosts of Albion Role-playing Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from What You Need:&lt;br/&gt;[This scenario] is intended for Original Buffy Cast Members from Season 5 or post Season 7. Characters supported are Buffy, Xander, Giles and Willow and Tara. It can be run in Sunnydale but that need not be the case. The Episode should not take more than one session to complete, but may be enhanced as the Director sees fit to go longer. &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this episode you need to own a copy of one of Eden Studios Core Rule Books for Cinematic Unisystem. The best bet is The Ghosts of Albion RPG. The rules presented in that rule book are best for a Willow and Tara game for a variety of reasons &amp;hellip; many of the rules herein use the world of Ghosts of Albion as the default.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One can also opt to use The Buffy the Vampire Slayer RPG, the Angel RPG or even Army of Darkness. From these sources one can pick up the modern rule changes (Ghosts of Albion is strictly Victorian era), the demon creation rules from Angel and the added spells from the Magic Box supplement. You can also play this game using the Classic Unisystem RPG WitchCraft. Rule changes for any game will be detailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;This is a rewrite of a scenario originally public in Games Unplugged&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
