							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Puss in the Corner</name>
									
			<description>The game includes 32 cards with a small instruction booklet on how to play.  &lt;br/&gt;The playing cards are illustrated with prowling pussy cats, hungry rats, and sneaky mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with placing the four special marked Puss in the Corner cards in the center of the table, corner to corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then takes one card for each player playing from the pack and sets it to the side for using at the end of the game.  The bottom card should be a Puss card.  Puss cards are numbers 23 through 28.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the remaining cards are all dealt to the players, players take turns placing cards to the Puss in the Corner cards.  Top cards are turned over  from the player&amp;rsquo;s face down pile and placed in the following ways.&lt;br/&gt;If a player turns over an Even numbered rat or mice card, he plays it to an Even numbered Puss card in the center of the table.  An Odd numbered rat or mice card is played to an Odd numbered Puss card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player turns over a single Puss card, he can take the pile that states the either Odd or Even card.  A  Puss card depicting two cats can take any pile.  If there aren&amp;rsquo;t any piles to take, then the player just plays the card to the matching Even or Odd pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players are out of cards, they take from the dealer&amp;rsquo;s set aside pile.  Once these are all gone, then the winner is decided upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who captured the most mice and rats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
