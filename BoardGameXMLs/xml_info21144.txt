			<description>From Black Powder's Website:&lt;br/&gt;The Species Conflict&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2038.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man has grasped deep into the ocean, the wild lands, and into the orbital space, colonizing and tearing resources for the peoples use in a darkening future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future at a glance seems hard, for the birth of Risen animal species to intelligence and form like the human kind. Species hatred flares as humans have employed these new lifeforms where humans deem fit. Life has been hard for the Hybrids and the Risen, often worked to their deaths in colonial construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well, many humans are fearful that they may be placed the loser in species conflict. Older folk are afraid of the frog, rat, and feline folk that now live next door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the while the Corporate Lords take their due as new leaders of the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Pacifica, your role is as a thief and a soldier. Leaders of Buka Units such as yourself will do battle, live as a rogue, and all the while laugh at those who do not know honor and freedom. Southeast off the shore of Japan, is where you are needed as the the 1,000,000 souls of the Pacifica Ocean Settlements are at odds with seeming rebels. These insurgents may be backed by powerful forces, so beware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacifica makes its pay from oil drilling, tourism, research programs, and especially, the Titan Naga Platform that taps and collects geothermal energy from the earths core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the internet now exists as both the wire of mother earth, and as playground. Webcrawlers with HUD net access fly as Deva across the shadowy illusion that is the Cybernet. Pays to keep a few of those people around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some, like yourself, will make their pay by covert operations. Welcome Buka rogue,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy your stay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a build-it-yourself PDF download.  It includes a modular board, units (infantry, vehicles, and weapons) a rulebook, and 44 cards used to represent background &amp;quot;cyber-combat,&amp;quot; or the opponents' wrestling for control of the computer system of the building they are in.  Physical combat is decided by a more conventional roll-to-hit system.  Rules are included to simulate combat in flooded and fully submerged locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is out of print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
