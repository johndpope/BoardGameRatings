			<description>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains. And it is another widely held truth that Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the New York Times best seller, was in want of the perfect video game to bring it to life or at least back from the dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now available on the iPhone or iPod Touch, play through the classic story of Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s Pride and Prejudice with an added dose of zombie in Freeverse&amp;rsquo;s 2D sidescrolling action beat &amp;lsquo;em up. With 12 levels of beautiful graphics and all the classic romance only a slew of gory unmentionables could enhance, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies offers everyone from gamers to literary enthusiasts the most fun any Classic could offer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
