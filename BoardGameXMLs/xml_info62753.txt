							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bedlam</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many speak in hushed tones, of the dark asylum, brooding atop the Goblin Moors, and of the unspeakable horrors, which dwell within. Of the strange and sinister Master, who comes to town always after nightfall, to collect supplies, only to quickly speed away into the night with his accursed carriage, toward the nightmare, which is Bedlam. People vanish, to reappear weeks or even months later, dead and drained of blood upon the moors. Those who enter the asylum on the hill, be they adventurers seeking treasure, or travelers seeking shelter for the night, are never seen again. One entrance can be seen in the cold stone walls, but it is whispered in taverns and spoke of in local tales of folklore, that there are many ways to leave, once within the great, grey walls. Recently, new scandal surrounds the asylum. The son of a popular and influential nobleman has vanished, never returning from a lone hunting trip upon the Goblin Moors, more than four weeks passed. A fine reward awaits he who can return the lad to his father. It is believed that the Master holds him within the asylum, for some diabolical, hitherto unknown dark purpose...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so it is, that the asylum of gloom awaits adventurers brave, seeking to uncover some of the dark mysteries which surely dwell within. Minstrels sing of the great treasures to be found within, tempting thieves and warriors to travel across the cold, wet Goblin Moors, to enter the asylum of darkness, seeking fame and fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the next one to pass through the portal of madness, and enter Bedlam?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability - 1 first level or newly-created character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
