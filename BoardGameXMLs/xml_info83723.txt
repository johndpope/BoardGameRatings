							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloody Hooks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collector of horror movie memorabilia is found dead in his home and his collection is missing some key elements. A new homeowner discovers there may still be someone in the old bomb shelter buried under his backyard. A late night infomercial turns horrific as the host demonstrates his new gizmos that make vivisection so easy! A man in a vegetative state suddenly gains the power to prevent the doctors and his wife from &amp;quot;pulling the plug&amp;quot;. Someone or something is repossessing transplanted organs from their recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloody Hooks is a collection of short adventure hooks and ideas suitable for modern horror gaming. Each entry is short, usually no more than a paragraph, containing only the strange premise, the hook, designed to spark your imagination and inspire you to craft a suitably diabolical and horrific scenario for your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
