							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pencil Football</name>
									
			<description>Pencil Football is played on a sheet of lined paper. The lines are numbered along one edge, goals are drawn near the ends, and then irregularly-spaced line segments are drawn along the lines to create obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kick-offs, extra points, and field goals are accomplished by placing a pencil at a certain point, closing your eyes, lifting the pencil, and attempting to bring it down as close as possible to the goal line (for a kick-off) or in the goal area (for a field goal or extra point).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regular plays are done by placing the pencil at the spot where the ball is, closing your eyes, and attempting to draw a path towards the goal that avoids obstacles. Each player gets four chances (downs) to advance the ball in this way, then the opponent takes over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solitaire using a provided board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the January 1987 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
