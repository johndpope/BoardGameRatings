			<description>Neutopia II (ニュートピアII, Nyūtopia Tsū) is an action/adventure game developed by Hudson Soft for the PC-Engine in 1991, it was released for TurboGrafx-16 in 1992. It is the sequel to Neutopia. Players take control of Jazeta's son, who must begin a quest to both save his father and defeat Dirth. This game as well as the original was released on the PlayStation Network and Virtual Console. The game's ending has a message about Neutopia III, saying &amp;quot;To be continued, 199X Neutopia III&amp;quot;, but the game was never made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutopia II shares many similarities in visuals and gameplay with the early &amp;quot;Legend of Zelda&amp;quot; titles. The player takes control of a young boy who freely roams through a vast 2D environment. The player may progress through accepted tasks in any order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
