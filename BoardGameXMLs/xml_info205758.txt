			<description>[Taken from the publishers site.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'THE WOODLANDS, A TABLETOP ROLEPLAYING GAME'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodlands is a game about woodland creatures, both big and small, who have banded together to fend off the dangerous and callous predators who have plagued them since the first sunrise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To see this done, they've created an order or animals known as The Wardens. The Wardens  patrol the woodland passageways, carry messages between animal settlements, defend the borders, and help those in need wherever they may be and whatever the danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a Warden, whether newly recruited or a veteran of many battles, you give your time, and if necessary your life, to keep others safe from harm. You'll face many challenges in the wild, from raging storms to the most dangerous of predators, but you will prevail; 'A Warden gives all to live all!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was funded through My Patreon and requires previous experience with another Powered by the Apocalypse roleplaying game to play. Inside you'll find the playbooks, moves, and MC materials to play and run The Woodlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4-6 Players. Ages 12+. Low-Prep. Low Emotional Intensity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
