							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scream Aim Fire: WW2 Rules</name>
									
			<description>Scream Aim Fire is a set of miniatures wargame rules for the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before play, a deck is created with a card for each vehicle or squad of infantry. In each turn, cards are drawn, one at a time, to determine which unit attempts to activate next. A unit that fails to active has to take a shock and awe test to avoid being eliminated! A unit that does successfully activate, or one that fails but survives the shock and awe test, gets three dice to divide between movement, loading, and firing. Fire is resolved by a mixture of dice rolls and chit draws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the interests of a quick and simple game, differentiation between different unit types is minimal: all tanks are the same, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
