							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lookee: The Clue-Solving Scavenger Hunt Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Lookee is a new spin on the scavenger hunt. It allows kids to have fun and learn critical thinking skills at the same time.&amp;nbsp; The object of the Lookee game is for player(s) to solve clues, the answer to those clues provides player(s) with information about where to find their next clue. You decide how many clues and where the adventure takes the player. &amp;nbsp;Lookee can be played as a single player, team or multi-player game. Lay out separate &amp;ldquo;paths&amp;rdquo; of clues for multiple players, or have everyone work together to solve the same path and win as a group!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Determine how many clues and locations your scavenger hunt adventure will have.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Choose one card to be the &amp;ldquo;Starting&amp;rdquo; point.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Layout the cards based on the answers to the clues; for example, if the answer to the clue is the refrigerator, the next clue should be placed in, on or near the refrigerator.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Once you&amp;rsquo;ve placed all your clue cards, direct player(s) to the &amp;ldquo;Starting&amp;rdquo; Point. Give player(s) the first clue and send them on their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have ideas for your own clues? Lookee also includes blank cards, so you can write your own. Have fun and get creative!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
