							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Liners and Transports</name>
									
			<description>This is a game of global travel and trade. It consists of six miniature ships, two different spinners, and a four-section map of the world measuring roughly 35&amp;quot; x 20&amp;quot;. The map bears a variety of different routes available (Panama vs. Cape Horn, Suez vs. Cape of Good Hope, etc.) that can be sailed in either direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to complete a trip around the world while picking up the greatest value of cargo. Players each start with a ship in New York and spin for their initial cargo. They then announce a direction and destination, and when they arrive at that port, can add a cargo based on the chief exports of that port as listed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When leaving a port, players who spin greater than 3 move quickly but face a financial penalty (for being delayed in port). The winner is not the player who completes the round the world voyage first, but whoever finishes with the highest total value of cargo. If a ship is destroyed by landing on a storm, all cargo is lost, the player gets a spin for insurance to offset the lost, but starts again from New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
