							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How to Play a Great Rogue</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rogues come in all shapes and sizes, this is perhaps why they're called something as generic as &amp;quot;rogue&amp;quot;. Literally, any kind of underhanded person is a rogue, anyone who by definition will not or prefers not to live to the dictations of society. No, a non-conformist who paints their face with bad clown makeup and listens to droned out suicidal music is not a rogue, they're the lowest common denominator and nothing to aspire to or emulate in a role playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This great guide won't tell you everything you need to play a great rogue, but it will help you to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
