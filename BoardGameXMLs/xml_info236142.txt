							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saving Face</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiny fishing village of Rock Rump has only one claim to fame: its juicy and flavorful fried clams. This settlement near the Teeth is not much frequented, but those visitors who come always try the local fare. The annual Clam Fest is the highlight of the year, an opportunity for the village&amp;rsquo;s enterprising clammers to make impressive profits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But recently the Demon Lord&amp;rsquo;s shadow touched the clam beds, unleashing a terrible infestation that threatens the entire coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saving Face is an adventure for a group of expert characters. They might have come to Rock Rump to sample the famous clams, provide security during the Clam Fest, or commissioned by a local noble to investigate strange happenings. Perhaps they were forced ashore to make repairs to their vessel, or stopped in the village on their way to other business in the Teeth. Whatever the reason, they arrive as the infestation is starting to take hold. As they investigate the situation, they learn more about the village&amp;rsquo;s history&amp;mdash;and how a living nightmare might save the village from a fate worse than death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
