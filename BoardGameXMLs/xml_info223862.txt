			<description>Big Little Buddy, a friend you can share! Need a friend? Call on the corporation with money to spend! Enter BUDDYFINDER&amp;trade; - the premier subscription-based friend rental service. Rental friends starting as low as 12.99 a month!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In sport, there are usually a couple of big sponsors that pay for exclusive primary advertising and presence. In GKR: Heavy Hitters, Big Little Buddy is that guy. He&amp;rsquo;s made available for the match (as well as serviced and repaired after the match) by his premier sponsor &amp;ndash; BUDDYFINDER &amp;trade;. They&amp;rsquo;ve got money to burn and they want their name everywhere. IN YOUR FACE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtle, Little Buddy is not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Big Little Buddy is deployed to the gameboard, he advertises for whichever Faction has unlocked him for that round. Players can try to claim Little Buddy by playing a special Sponsor Card &amp;ndash; a move that can only be deflected by playing a counter-hack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player controls Lil Buddy, the fun begins. Move him during the Movement Phase, and use him to attack opponents in the Combat Phase with his own unique cards: 3 Weapon Cards and 1 Unit Card. Each round, he can only fire 1 of these weapons in his arsenal BUT he does not require Energy to fire. Making him really rather handy in a pinch. Once the Combat Phase is over, players lose control of him once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all Units, Little Buddy can be destroyed. Once he&amp;rsquo;s destroyed, he&amp;rsquo;s removed from the game completely. Buh bye, Little Buddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One important note: Lil Buddy is not considered a &amp;ldquo;Support Unit&amp;rdquo; so he&amp;rsquo;s not bound by Support Unit rules. That also means he can&amp;rsquo;t tag buildings. Standing at 70mm he&amp;rsquo;s a mid-size Unit that, we think you&amp;rsquo;ll find, more than pulls his own weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Little Buddy, you&amp;rsquo;re not just getting an awesome new mini, 1 unique Unit Card, 5 new Sponsor Cards, and 3 new Weapon Cards. You&amp;rsquo;re getting a little friend to keep you warm through those long lonely nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
