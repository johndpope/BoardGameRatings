							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Penalties Shootout</name>
									
			<description>The game represents the penalties shootout of a great final of a soccer championship. The goalkeeper tries to guess where the shot goes; the pitcher tries to throw the ball the other side. Simple. It is the same psychological game that the soccer players live before kicking the ball: where should I shoot? Where should I dive to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a card game. Each of the two players has a team composed of 3 Goalkeepers (each one protects a part of the goal: the left side, the right side or the center) and a set of 7 Shooters (each one shoots in one direction: to the left, to the right or to the center Panenka style).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each throw, the players select one card and show it at the same time. If the Goalkeeper guesses the direction of the ball, he stops the shot. If the Shooter deceives the goalkeeper, he scores a goal. The back side of the Shooter card is used to track the failure or the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a version of the game that includes a single team. It represents the previous training of Penalties Shootouts. It could be sold in soccer club shops with cards of all its players of the first team squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
