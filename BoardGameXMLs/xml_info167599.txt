							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rogue Soul 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays fairly similar to Rogue Soul, but with a fair number of differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is no longer an endless runner. Now more a sidescrolling platform game broken up into levels. Soulons can be used to purchase upgrades. Stars (1-3 earned for each level passed) can be used to unlock skins for character and weapons. Game now has more of an emphasis on platforming skills. The parachute and double jump are now default abilities (once unlocked) and are not tied to an item you must find in the level. Giving the girl a flower still produces an award, the results of which are variable. They can be double soulons, invincible, magnet or infinite ammo. The game now also has boss battles at the end of some levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
