							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barnyard Brawl</name>
									
			<description>The barnyard is getting crowded and the animals are getting bored. So what do you do to fill an afternoon?  Why not battle it out for bragging rights and first go at the trough tonight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barnyard Brawl is a two player abstract strategy game in the spirit of Chinese Chess. Players control armies of farm animals across the barnyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each animal has its own movement rules and some come with special abilities. Animals may defeat opponents of equal or lesser value, or two lesser pieces may sandwich a higher value piece to take it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also begin the game with two randomly drawn Combat Cards which allow them to break the rules at some point in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add to the mix there are fences and a mud-hole that may be set up in different patterns to change the barnyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
