							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SciFi Weapons Free Sample: SciFi Weapon Cards</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Free ammunition magazine with gun purchase!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sci-Fi Weapon Card Freebie for Savage Worlds adds an additional 3 weapon cards that can be used as a standalone product or in conjunction with the Sci-Fi Equipment Cards base (48 cards) and expansion sets (27 cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are intended for use in modern and near or far future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The front of each card has the equipment&amp;rsquo;s image and Savage Worlds basic weapon statistics in order of range, cost, damage, weight, rate of fire, and clip size. The back of each card has the weapon&amp;rsquo;s notes and an ammo track to cross out as ammunition is expended. The weapons in this pack are an assault rifle, minigun, and sniper rifle. The cards are available in PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not needing to write down the weapon stats by having them on cards speeds up character creation for both Players and Game Masters allowing for faster Player Characters, NPCs, and convention game pregenerated character generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The weapon cards can be used as an equipment treasure deck with the base and expansion sets. When the Player Characters loot an area, they find the listed equipment on the card. The Game Master could also use the deck as a way to randomize the equipment of extras or wild cards giving them the equipment drawn and the player characters can pick up any of equipment that survives the combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
