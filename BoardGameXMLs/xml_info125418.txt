			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spellflag is a game played by the student-wizards of Redhurst, as described on in Redhurst Academy of Magic. The sport was founded at Redhurst ten years ago under the guidance of the game&amp;rsquo;s creator Andarlin, Redhurst&amp;rsquo;s current headmaster, and its skyrocketing popularity has spawned teams in most of the best arcane colleges throughout the Known Realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document records the official rules of spellflag as Andarlin first set them forth, including various modifications he has made over the years. As with many new sports, the various teams playing the game often experiment with all sorts of new ideas during their intramural matches, but these rules are the final arbiter for interacademic play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
