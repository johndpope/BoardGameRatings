			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a role-playing campaign using the Stormbringer 5th edition rules, and will take player characters from the dark and decadent lands of the Young Kingdoms to the cold and silvery paths of the roads between the worlds and beyond. It will be a game of epic fantasy adventure, with philosophical and pop-culture overtones, just like the novels of Michael Moorcock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since not everyone is familiar with Moorcock&amp;rsquo;s works, this &amp;lsquo;bible&amp;rsquo; is meant to give general background information on his worlds, themes, characters, books, and maybe a few brief looks into what&amp;rsquo;s going to be happening in the game. With luck, it will help guide you in creating characters that are suited to a tale of dark cosmic fantasy and adventure along the paths trodden by the Eternal Champion and his foes the Lords of Law and Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
