							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyclopes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the cyclops. These terrible, one-eyed monsters have plagued human imagination since antiquity, and, in some recent campaign settings, are depicted as having ancient roots themselves, and being the descendants of a mighty empire of diviners, which fell long ago. The first cyclops in this book, the baleye cyclops (CR 9) represents a cyclops that took a different path, honing his eye for use with evocation, not divination, which can fire deadly rays from his eye, and which is vulnerable to attacks made against his eyes. The second cyclops, the cyclops brute (CR 12) is more typical of modern interpretations of cyclopes as large, hulking, stupid creatures. Larger than his kin, the cyclops brute is truly vicious in combat, and can crush his foes into the ground with a terrible foot stomp. Finally, the cyclops seer (CR 15) represents a cyclops who has tapped into the strong divination powers of his ancestors, and who can see the world for what it truly is, as well as influence the future with ease, making him a terrible foe to face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
