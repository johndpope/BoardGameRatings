			<description>I do not know much about this game, here is the little I know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I belong to the San Luis Obispo Railroad Museum. The board for this game is displayed on the wall in the museum. The board displays the names and logos of 48 different railroads of the united states circa 1948. The board shows the routes of these different railroads and the major cities they services. I assume this was a pickup and delivery game, but I am not sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is 15 X 24 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little more information from the Museum on this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The box was falling apart and so was discarded, as was the instruction sheet. I recall there were also small, lightweight cardboard markers, probably some original and some added by a previous owner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object was to earn points by delivering carloads of freight to destinations named on the board, and to earn more points than opponents by controlling routes so they could not make deliveries.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Of the 48 railroads named, only two still operate under those names: Union Pacific, and Kansas City Southern.&amp;quot; December 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
