							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cluckbot: Fight League International</name>
									
			<description>You are a cluck operator competing in the Cluckbot Fight League International, a brutal realm of mechanical combat as popular as it is illegal. Pick one of 10 cluck models, gather your arsenal, and take them into the arena!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cluckbot is a board game for 2-player combat dueling. Each player controls a robotic cluck, one of 10 models, each with its own &amp;ldquo;cluck sheet&amp;rdquo; defining their attacks, gadgets, grapples and rush combos. You have 8 turns in the pit to eliminate your opponent either through raw damage or forcing them off the stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players set their cluck&amp;rsquo;s movement (direction and facing) and action (step or leap) while the opponent does the same, double-blind. After revealing the commands, players resolve actions while spending &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; to activate weapons and gadgets as they go. The right commands can foil your foe&amp;rsquo;s assault. Will you lure them under your claws? Outflank? Surprise attack? Strategic planning, anticipating your foe, and a bit of bold improvisation are key to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
