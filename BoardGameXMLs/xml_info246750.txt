			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You grew up in the forest village of Birkville, and despite some bumps in the road, ended up drawn to the Church once you became a young adult. Father Thomas identified you as a promising Cleric, and took you under his wing. After several years of service as deacon, he is so impressed with your devotion that he's decided to send you to Severan, the seat of the Church's power in the land; to serve as assistant to the Bishop, and possible promotion to priest and a parish of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
