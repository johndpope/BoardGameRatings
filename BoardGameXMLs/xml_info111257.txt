			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four to six 3rd-level agents may play (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agents are tasked with assassinating a Krypt mission team on assignment in Ibiza, Spain. The team consists of 2 unwitting Krypt agents and 2 agents infiltrating the shadow cell &amp;mdash; 1 from Intelligence Division and 1 from Operations Division. The shadow cell has identified the Division agents on the target Krypt team as moles responsible for recent failures, and wants them eliminated during their current Ibiza operation &amp;mdash; with extreme prejudice. The unwitting Krypt operatives are also to be liquidated, so a plausible explanation can be introduced to explain the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown to the players, the shadow cell also knows that the Krypt team has struck a deal with a female mercenary in her 30s named &amp;ldquo;Core,&amp;rdquo; who is one of the few true successes of the mysterious Messiah program. Although the Krypt team&amp;rsquo;s assignment is left undefined at the serial&amp;rsquo;s start, the agents may eventually learn that it is a mission of mercy &amp;mdash; to rescue an elderly woman named Doris Hague from a ruthless underworld black marketeer named Vassili Dragen, who is using the woman as leverage to force Core to do his bidding. Specifically, Dragen is forcing Core to raid a seller&amp;rsquo;s heavily guarded hotel and steal a prototype laser weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
