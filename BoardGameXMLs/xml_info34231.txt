			<description>A game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of all of the kings and queens in the Tudor dynasty, King Henry the VIII (1509-1547) is perhaps the most well known. After his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Henry wanted to divorce from her, against Roman Catholic mandates. Not agreeing with the Pope, Henry starts the English reformation, branching off into the Anglican Church. Henry then marries 5 more times during his reign, the historical order of his wife&amp;rsquo;s goals which is best remembered in the mnemonic device &amp;ldquo;Divorced, Beheaded, Died, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can live the life of King Henry the VIII and give your six wives the same fates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to meet 4 different goals; &amp;ldquo;divorce&amp;rdquo; two of your own queens, &amp;ldquo;behead&amp;rdquo; two of your queens, have one of your queens &amp;ldquo;die&amp;rdquo;, and to have one of your queens &amp;ldquo;survive&amp;rdquo;. Each of these goals requires a different interaction of pieces and or positions to be met. The first player to meet all of these goals is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
