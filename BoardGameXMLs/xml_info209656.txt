			<description>An Army of Bone approaches! The King of Bones marshals his forces to appease the Bone Dragon! Hope is scarce... but can You turn the tides of war? Face the hordes by yourself or with friends, as you seek to turn the Wheel of Fate in your favor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pocket Dungeon Adventures allows for up to 6 players to enjoy a light and fun dungeon exploration on the go! Choose from six different and unique classes, whilst battling against the enemy hordes! With each victory climb the ladders of fame and fortune!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Army of Bone, players have lots of options with regards to gameplay and variety. They can opt to play solo, or choose from 2 to 6 player co-operative play. Then, players can choose to tackle either a single dungeon level (out of 3 varying difficulties), or face the entire dungeon as a 3 level campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of play, players will &amp;quot;explore&amp;quot; the dungeon level by flipping the dungeon cards, revealing items, traps and monsters. These will be acquired or defeated, gaining Gold for the players. Gold is used to purchase upgrades, to health, skills and weapons. Combat is resolved via dice rolling and use of skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Dungeon level is cleared, the Boss is challenged to gain access to the next level in campaign, or to gain victory, in single or final level play. After the campaign or level is defeated, all players win together in co-operative play. Note: if any player falls outside of a boss battle, the party automatically forfeits. In boss battles, fallen players are revived after it's defeat, to carry on to the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pocket Dungeon Adventures - Army of Bone is the first standalone game set in the Pocket Dungeon Adventures Universe (PDAU)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
