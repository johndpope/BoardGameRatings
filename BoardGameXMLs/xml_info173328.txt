			<description>Zuqi is a game of intense strategy in which players try to achieve the classic goal of getting four pieces in a row or occupy all four corners at once, but there's a twist. Each piece in your arsenal has unique movement abilities, capture abilities, and other powers at their disposal, and you may only bring 5 out of 8 of them to every game, so each game will play out very differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With unique rules that keep the game balanced and fair from beginning to end, every game is intense, and even if you're winning in one moment, the tide can quickly turn. Compete with your opponent for supremacy on the battlefield in a mental tug of war. You take one piece from him, he places another. He takes one from you, you place another. Eventually something has to give, and it shall. This is a game of strategy and skill and only the strong shall prevail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
