			<description>This game, similar to Whist, is mostly played in Minnesota and South Dakota and was brought there by settlers from Norway.  It is extremely similar to a Scandinavian game, often listed in English language card game books under the name Norwegian Whist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four players in two fixed partnerships. Using a standard 52 card pack and no trumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High / Low Bids&lt;br/&gt;Each hand is played either &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;low&amp;quot;. If it is played &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;, the partnership that takes at least 7 of the 13 tricks scores points. If it is played &amp;quot;low&amp;quot;, a partnership must take 6 or fewer tricks to avoid losing points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With High bid, when all 13 tricks have been played, the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick they won in excess of 6. While with low bid, the side which won more tricks loses 1 point for each trick they have in excess of 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the Game&lt;br/&gt;The partnership which first reaches 13 points wins the game. This takes several deals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South Dakota Whist&lt;br/&gt;    This version has different scoring than Minnesota Whist. If players win fewer than 7 tricks while bidding high, they lose 1 point for each trick below 7. The other team does not score. If everyone bid low, the team that takes 7 or more tricks loses one point for each trick in excess of 6. The game is played to 11 points rather than 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
