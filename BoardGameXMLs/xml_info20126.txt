			<description>A game between dreams and reality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King of the Darkness, Ariman, reigns with dark power over a mysterious fairyland. Who can free this enslaved country?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four heroes are ready for the adventure, but they must first grow to master the difficult task. They travel to the Fire Spirits, Nixies, Elves and Dwarfs. After telepathic tests, they will become master of the four elements. Armed with this magic, they will enter the realm of darkness, to defeat Ahriman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, before they come that far, they need to defend themselves against many unknown dangers and to respond to unexpected calls for help. In the meantime, Ahrimans powers will dwindle. Only with harmonic cooperation can the players succeed in defeating Ahriman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
