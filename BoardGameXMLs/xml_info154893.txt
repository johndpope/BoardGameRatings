							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wurf &amp; Wort</name>
									
			<description>The word game Wurf &amp;amp; Wort challenges you to think in syllables instead of letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a category card is revealed, e.g., &amp;quot;on the beach&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;at the airport&amp;quot;; each card shows a points multiplier and a few dice icons. Someone rolls these dice, then everyone tries to be the first to come up with a word that fits the category and falls within the restriction of the dice (as not all dice will be rolled each time). The number on the syllable die indicates how many syllables the word must be; the forbidden die shows which letter cannot be used in the answer; and the two letter dice show a letter that should be used in the answer along with a point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever comes up with a valid word first scores the sum of the letter values for each appropriate letter in her answer times the points multiplier on the card, up to a maximum of ten points. If the answerer chooses an inappropriate word &amp;mdash; or a majority of players vote down the word for being off-category &amp;mdash; the answerer loses three points. After all 25 category cards have been played, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
