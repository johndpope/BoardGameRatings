							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost Mars</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost Mars is a roleplaying game set on the newly-settled planet of the same name. Players take the roles of scientists, engineers and explorers going about their business of investigating Martian phenomenon and avoiding death or serious injury while doing so. If this does not seem particularly challenging, then in one sense you are right. Of course there are challenges, but the missions in this game will only form the backdrop for each game. The real story focus will be on the player characters and their motivations. Trapped on Mars, working in isolation with the other player characters in the team, stories will pick up on and revolve around a character's personal interactions with his team-members. On rivalries, secrets, hidden agendas, lies and on mutual interests. More than anything, then, scenarios for Outpost Mars will involve very real-world inter-personal story elements. Often, roleplaying games leave inter-character reactions wholly to the imagination of the players. And often there is no inter-action, many roleplaying groups acts as one, almost as a multi-tasking &amp;uuml;ber-character. Rivalries, competition and personal agendas are routinely seen as a bad thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
