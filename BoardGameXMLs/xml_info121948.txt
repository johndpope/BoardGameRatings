			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical adventure game which can be played by two players, since it has two main characters and a split screen (players still have to take turn issueing commands though). The game uses a traditional western setting. Mike &amp;amp; Moko are brothers, each one has been captured and they're held in different places. The first goal of the game is to reunite the brothers. Other goals emerge later after their escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
