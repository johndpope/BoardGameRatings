			<description>A Two-Round Adventure for Six Musketeers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round One: For the Queen's Honor&lt;br/&gt;Round Two: Honor's Ride&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The life of a musketeer is truly grand. The excitement, the respect, the daring-do. Your group is all fairly new to the musketeers, with only a few months of experience under your sash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Already, however, two of you have been promoted. Santhos Krimais, son of the captain, has been promoted to sergeant for his leadership in a recent crisis involving the king and the evil Magistrate Zhackal. Armathos has been promoted to corporal, for his work in the same crisis. Highest of all in rank is the only woman in your company. Captain Nicolette de Servais, niece of the queen, was named captain of the soon to be formed queen's musketeers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
