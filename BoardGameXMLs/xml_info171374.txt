			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;Experience Court and Jail Procedures!&lt;br/&gt;Object: life and crime, court action, detention.  Player with most money at game end is winner.  Game can be played in short amount of time or can be lengthy - you decide.&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Game board, player pieces, sentence log, playing money, sentencing cards, appeal/parole cards and pair of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Description:&lt;br/&gt;Roll and move game where players go along the outer track receiving money for various life events, but also are at risk of being convicted of various crimes. Cards from the &amp;quot;Sentencing&amp;quot; pile determine how long a player must go to jail (i.e. the inner track) or whether they have received probation. Various spaces on the inner track (each circuit around being one year) also earn you money and random card draws may win you appeals, probation, or an overturn of your conviction. Score sheets (&amp;quot;Sentence log&amp;quot;) allow players to keep track of all the crimes they've been convicted of and how much time they've served for each. According to the game rules, there is no set goal; players must agree on a length of time to play or an amount of money to reach first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is apparently intended as a criticism of the lenient &amp;quot;revolving door&amp;quot; of the U.S. criminal justice system, similar to &amp;quot;Capital Punishment&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Public Assistance.&amp;quot; Although the game was made in 1995, it fails to take into account the then new but growing &amp;quot;three strikes&amp;quot; system in many states, as well as criminal court's tendency to impose harsher sentences on repeat offenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
