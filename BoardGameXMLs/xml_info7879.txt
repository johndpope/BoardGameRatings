			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are a team of House Detectives coordinating their efforts to prevent a gang of sophisticated Thieves from robbing the Hotel Guest&amp;quot;s Valuables, worth Millions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have Surveillance Cameras, Burglar Alarms, Handcuffs, sets of Fake Valuables, and Brilliant Minds (that's us) to assist in our fight against Crime. With a bit of luck, lots of cleverness, and good Teamwork, losses will be little or nil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we must not underestimate those Thieves. Just look at their plush Hideout loaded with Goodies. They know how to use the Elevators and Hallways to advantage. They are Specialists in thieving particular Valuables, although there is one who knows no limits and will steal everything. Millions of dollars are at stake, not to mention lots of Reward money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is up to us to outfox the foxes and teach them that Crime doesn't pay, no matter how slick and greedy you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
