							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pharaoh&#039;s Pyramid</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sits on the sands of Egypt - silent, foreboding, the blue waters of the Nile sliding silently by.  Pharaoh's Pyramid beckons to us across millennia, mysterious, alluring.  Where did the stones come from?  How were they laid one on top of another?  How many lives were lost under hot suns and cool moons to provide a resting place for the pharaohs of Egypt?  Now you can have a personal stake in its completion.  Match wits with the ancient Egyptian God, Osiris.  Take advantage of gifts given you by the beautiful Isis.  Fight through the plagues of Moses as brick by brick you build one of the wonders of the world.  There hasn't been a greater challenge since the original Pharaoh's Pryamid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
