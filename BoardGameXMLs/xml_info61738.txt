			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil Genius #2: Crime &amp;amp; Punishment is a collection of four scenarios of robbery, extortion, kidnapping, and general mayhem, plus the price you pay for doing all of the above. Crime does not pay, but there&amp;rsquo;s always someone who didn&amp;rsquo;t get the memo:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Deep Runs the Dreadnaut&amp;ndash;The armored Dreadnaut plants mines in the city&amp;rsquo;s harbor, holding the seas hostage until his demands are met.&lt;br/&gt;     Great Armored Car Robbery&amp;ndash;Armor-plated battlewagons stage daring daylight bank robberies. They&amp;rsquo;re not robberies of armored cars, they&amp;rsquo;re robberies using armored cars!&lt;br/&gt;     Doing Time&amp;ndash;After thirty years trapped in a moment of frozen time, an innocent man blames the heroes for his unfair imprisonment. Now it&amp;rsquo;s their turn.&lt;br/&gt;     Fame is Fleeting&amp;ndash;In a bid for fame and fortune, Speed Demon sets out to rob more banks in a single day than any criminal before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure outlines the main action, but you can expand or compress the pacing as you see fit. A single scenario could be drawn out across multiple game sessions or finished all in one sitting. They are also peppered with new Action Shticks (Sinking Ships, Hit by a Car, etc.) that you can lift and use in your other games, and each scenario has Variants to give you alternate ways to run them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have other Lame Mage adventures (like Zodiac Ring, the Dr Null series, or Evil Genius #1) there are places where you can use Action Shticks from those releases, but they are not necessary for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later issues of Evil Genius will feature other collections all designed to give you, the GM, tools to put the game on the table. Because the real evil genius isn&amp;rsquo;t the criminal mastermind, it&amp;rsquo;s the person behind the screen.&lt;br/&gt;Just don&amp;rsquo;t do the crime if you can&amp;rsquo;t do the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
