			<description>A One-Round Adventure for 3rd Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cabal of Shadows Faction Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aboleth slavers and their skum minions have long been a problem on the voyage to Stormreach. Their danger will soon become perfectly clear to the PCs. In COS-01: The Sahuagin Stone, members of the Cabal of Shadows ran afoul of a party of skum slavers. The PCs&amp;rsquo; contact in the region, a sahuagin named Dilmoolgha, identified the enemy and assisted in driving them off, warning the PCs what would happen to them should they ever be captured by the tainted creatures. In COS-02: Shadows Over Stormreach the Cabal of Shadows dealt with the disembodied intelligence of a cloud giant named Deondag, and through this interaction learned the last known location of a psionic shard: a device used to store mental images of information. This device contained the thoughts of one of Deondag&amp;rsquo;s clan mates regarding a portion of the Caldyn Fragments that dealt with the Mere of Shattered Souls. Believing themselves to be the only faction with any lead to controlling this portion of the Prophecy, the Cabal of Shadows has dispatched the PCs to recover the long-lost shard from the aboleth-haunted depths of the Thunder Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
