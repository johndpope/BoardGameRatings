			<description>This is a simple two player card game that is an abstract depiction of two armies facing each other on the battlefield. It can either be played as a simple two player card game, or as a sub-game to a more complex wargame &amp;ndash; say a campaign where you wish to resolve minor battles without resorting to setting&lt;br/&gt;out model soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game takes a couple of minutes, and only requires a standard pack of playing cards (with jokers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
