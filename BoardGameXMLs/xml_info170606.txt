			<description>Do you have what it takes to build an airline empire? Find out with AEROSTAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fun filled game will keep you coming back for more. AEROSTAR is an easy to learn yet dynamic game. Do you have what it takes to hire, invest, and build the best airline? If so you will be crowned the next AEROSTAR. Let the bidding begin!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start a round of play by bidding to hire an executive for their airline. All Executives are not made equal so choose accordingly. Then each player has an opportunity to invest in airline tech stocks, fuel stocks, or several other money making opportunities. This segment is also bidding based so budget wisely or your opponents might outbid you and steal your investment opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next Players buy their Airplane Fleets. This segment is Auction/Bidding based also. There are 4 airline tech companies providing 30 different fleet types, all with different money making abilities and fuel efficiencies. After this, Players must buy fleet fuel from the market in order for their fleets to operate. This market price is constantly changing so be careful when building your airline fleet or you might lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then have the opportunity to buy Terminals in Major and Minor Cities in a start to creating their Airline Empire. By creating connections players earn money if their fleet can fulfill the connections and have the fuel to do so. Each round ends with connection and investment profits being paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A yearly market card is drawn that effects the next rounds game play. In AEROSTAR there are market fuel increases, Union Strikes, and many more global impacts. You never know what might happen in the adventure of becoming the next AEROSTAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
