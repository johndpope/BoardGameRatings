							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Up</name>
									
			<description>Triple Up consists of 40 different cards, each card has no numbers only 3 different symbols from a regular card deck (Heart, Spades Diamonds or Clubs) this is a trump and bidding game. The instructions suggest after all 13 tricks are played, score the game and 1st person to 500 points wins. This game can have almost as many variant card games as a regular deck of cards. Triple Up is a new and refreshing twist on classic trump/bidding card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
