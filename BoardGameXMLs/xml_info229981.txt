							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Destiny With Evil</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two knights of the Defenders are found dead in the town of Rayjank, and the evidence points to a very disturbing conclusion.&lt;br/&gt; While investigating the deaths of their comrades, the characters quickly realize something far beyond a random act of violence is at work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clues draw them into a deepening plot that suggests they are up against a foe of immense power. Worse yet, it appears they have went from being the hunters, to the hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only time will tell whether or not the characters can pull all the clues together and make the necessary preparations in time for their inevitable destiny with evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Destiny With Evil&amp;rdquo; is designed to follow the adventure, &amp;quot;Garadon's Pass&amp;quot;, but can be played on its own.  It is suggested, however, that characters have earned at least 100 Advancement Points before tackling this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
