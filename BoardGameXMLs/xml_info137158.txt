							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brautkraut</name>
									
			<description>German has the tongue-twister &amp;quot;Blaukraut bleibt Blaukraut und Brautkleid bleibt Brautkleid&amp;quot;, which translates as &amp;quot;Red cabbage remains red cabbage, and a bridal gown remains a bridal gown&amp;quot;. The game Brautkraut takes this tongue twister to the extremes as each of the game's 66 cards depicts two of the following four items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Blau (blue)&lt;br/&gt;    Kraut (cabbage)&lt;br/&gt;    Braut (bride)&lt;br/&gt;    Kleid (gown)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one pile, on which players place cards from their draw decks. On a turn, the active player has to say aloud, what was on the now covered card, and the one, the previous player just put on top of this. After having said this, he reveals one card from his/her draw deck and covers the top card.&lt;br/&gt;You have to check the arrow on each card telling you the order of the parts of the word, which have to combined into a compound noun, and if the next one is the same or not. When ist is the same, the player has to say &amp;quot;bleibt&amp;quot; (remains), when the new word is different, he has to say &amp;quot;wird&amp;quot; (changes into) between the nouns.&lt;br/&gt;For example, a player might say &amp;quot;Brautkraut wird Blaukleid&amp;quot; and p&amp;ouml;aces his topmost card onto the &amp;quot;Blaukleid&amp;quot; card. The next player has to start now with &amp;quot;Blaukleid&amp;quot;, continuing with the now visible card ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional confusion comes from three extra cards that circulate between the players and change the linking word from &amp;quot;wird&amp;quot; into the similar sounding trio of &amp;quot;traut&amp;quot; (weds), &amp;quot;klaut&amp;quot; (steals), or &amp;quot;braut&amp;quot; (brews).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player makes a mistake, she must take all cards played since the previous mistake. Whoever gets rid of all her cards first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
