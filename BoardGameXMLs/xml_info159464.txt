			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Full Metal Planete is a video game adaptation of the board game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BGG description&lt;br/&gt;In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over. Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners. The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free. Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units. Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
