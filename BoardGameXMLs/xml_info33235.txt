			<description>Features:&lt;br/&gt;All professional teams from the year 1920-2006 are included. (APFB, AFL &amp;amp; NFL)&lt;br/&gt;Teams are rated in overall offense, defensive and execution (&amp;quot;X&amp;quot; factor, which is based on win percentage.) Teams are also assigned a power (P) rating, which fine-tunes a squad's offensive strength.&lt;br/&gt;Fast and accurate results: Play a complete game in 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;As in the high school game, the game engine is self-driven. You may still call for the 2-point conversion, run out the clock, attempt a 4th down conversion, use the hurry-up offense, and attempt onside kicks.&lt;br/&gt;100 pre-printed action cards included, or you may use your own 10-sided dice or pre-printed random number sheets. (#'s 1-100)&lt;br/&gt;Keep score and track the time expired as you play. Tally each team's cumulative plays and total yardage, if you wish to accumulate stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
