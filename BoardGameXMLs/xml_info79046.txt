			<description>Dark Seed is a computer game in the adventure game genre. It was developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, which is based on the artwork by H. R. Giger. It was one of the first adventure games to use high-resolution (640 x 400 pixels) graphics, to Giger's demand. A sequel, Dark Seed II, was released in 1995. The original game was released for Amiga, Amiga CD32, DOS, Macintosh, Sega Saturn and PlayStation. Both console versions were released only in Japan; however, the Saturn version is not dubbed in Japanese, only subtitled[1], making the game's story still accessible to English speakers. The Saturn version is compatible with the Sega Saturn Mouse. There was also a version developed for the Sega Mega-CD and even promoted for American release, but publisher Vic Tokai never released it. An unlicensed version was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Chinese. The main character, Mike Dawson, is named after the game's designer and producer. He also lend his appearance to the character's sprite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Dark Seed (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
