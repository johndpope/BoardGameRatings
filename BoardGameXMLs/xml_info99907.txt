							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Electrocop</name>
									
			<description>From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word just arrived that the notorious Criminal Brain had kidnapped the President's daughter.  The Criminal Brain's ransom demand is completely unacceptable--give him total control of the entire world or the First Daughter dies.  The President's voice shook with emotion as he called you personally.  You, the Electrocop,are the only one capable of rescuing the President's daughter before time runs out.  If you fall, the Criminal Brain will assassinate her without pity or remorse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's up to you to penetrate the Criminal Brain's technoid stronghold,the Stell Complex.  Inside you will encounter explosive traps,electrified floors, and hordes of criminal driods.  With a little luck, you may also find powerful weapons to help you defeat the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find computer terminals throughout the complex.  The computer will help you open doors, relieve stress with video games, or understand the dastardly ways of the evil mastermind.  But the computer will not give you the quick reactions and good judgement you will need to survive.  For that you must rely on your own abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to rescue the President's daughter and &lt;br/&gt;serve justice to the world's most evil criminal?  Or are you destined to be just another victim of the Criminal Brain's frightful plan? The world is relying on you. Perform your sworn duty as an officer of the law.  But remember: this rescue mission is not as straight-forward as it sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
