							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Boy Who Cried Werewolf</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Beverdale has long rested at the edges of the Kingdom, a sleepy peaceful village &lt;br/&gt;untouched by the plagues and horrors beyond... until now. Sheppard Goddard's body has been found, &lt;br/&gt;horribly mauled by some beast unfathomable to the likes of man. Goddard's son testifies he saw the &lt;br/&gt;fell beast, a wolf that walked on two legs like a man, its teeth dripping blood and gore in the full &lt;br/&gt;moonlight. The town is abuzz with the news, and it is clear: a werewolf walks amongst you. The town &lt;br/&gt;elders must come together, use their wisdom to determine who the skinchanger is amongst their ranks, &lt;br/&gt;and mete out justice.&lt;br/&gt;There is just one problem. There is no werewolf. Only a simple hungry wolf, and human folly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
