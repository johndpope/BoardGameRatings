			<description>From the Front Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;iexcl;The Dice Game of Mexican Wrestling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     For 1 or more players!&lt;br/&gt;     Play for hours, or just a few minutes!&lt;br/&gt;     Customize characters with your own one of a kind Luchador Mask designs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A match is played between two or more characters who are defined by three attributes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Strength that starts at two dice&lt;br/&gt;     Agility that starts at two dice&lt;br/&gt;     Stamina that starts at 12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A character also has an additional die that is placed in either Strength or Agility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players choose to roll either their character's Strength or Agility, with the higher score winning, and the loser subtracting the difference from their Stamina. Rolling doubles explodes the dice (roll the doubles again and add to the previous roll). Any rolls of 6 automatically cause 1 point of damage to their opponent's Stamina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If a round was won using Strength, any character reduced to zero or less Stamina loses and is out; if all characters have no Stamina, the match is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;     If a round was won using Agility, the winning character has pinned the losing character. Pinning a character for three consecutive rounds will cause that character to lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each match, players can increase their character's stats using Glory Points (1 GP is gained for each point scored in their rolls, and an additional 100 GP goes to the winner of a match). Buying an additional Strength or Agility die costs the current number of dice x 100 GP (each additional die bought also adds 5 Stamina).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are additional rules for using teams, weapons, and stunning. The game includes a worked example, pre-made characters, and blank character cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
