			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PICK UP YOUR WAVE-PARTICLE SWORD AND FIGHT FOR FREEDOM!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not your world.  Once you leapt between worlds in gleaming starships, fighting for freedom, helping the oppressed.  Then came the crash. Your ship was damaged beyond repair, leaving you with only your Wave-Particle Sword and your ideals.  So you ventured out into this world of primitive weapons and magic, determined to find a way back to your own Sphere.  Along the way, you have found that there are noble causes to fight for here as well.  Perhaps you will become a champion for good in this world as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps it is your destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A full character class description (including new special abilities), for use with Old-School (OSR) games including LABRYRINTH LORD&lt;br/&gt;    Helpful charts to take your Paladin of Space from level 1 to level 20&lt;br/&gt;    Options for both Ascending and Descending AC are presented&lt;br/&gt;    Suggestions for incorporating Paladins of Space into your campaign&lt;br/&gt;    Pregenerated characters at first and third level.  Just print and play (or use them as NPC&amp;rsquo;s)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
