			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Solar Cup race has just been announced, a rocket race that launches from the Indianapolis Interplanetary Rocket Port, flies around Venus, and shoots back out to Mars before turning around and heading down the straight towards Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As much as race fans and the rocket set are looking forward to this contest of men and machines, a dark cloud hangs over it. An extortionist calling himself Ghost Racer has sent letters to the race commission threatening to disrupt the race if they do not pay him a ransom. The Solar Cup Commission have not take him seriously, but two days ago a bomb was found in one of the rocket ship hangars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our heroes must join the race incognito to protect the racers and spectators from this Ghost Racer. But can they catch him before it's too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rocket Racers is a 20 Pages black and white PDF featuring a Rocket Age episode designed for three to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
