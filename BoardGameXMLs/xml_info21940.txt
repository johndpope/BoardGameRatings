							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sure Shot Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Various versions of this game have existed for many years. I am not sure if this game has been renamed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure Shot Baseball is a two person game played much the same way as outdoor baseball.  The game consists of nine innings of 3 outs each.  The &amp;quot;pitcher&amp;quot; rolls a plastic marble down a slide and it heads toward a batter controlled by their opponent.  The &amp;quot;batter&amp;quot; tries to hit the ball out of the stadium by turning a batting knob.  If it goes out of the unique up-curved field the &amp;quot;fielder&amp;quot; then tries to catch it.  Singles, doubles, triples, foul balls, and home runs are determined where the ball goes over the wall.  The &amp;quot;runners&amp;quot; stay in their team dugouts until it is time to position them on the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each &amp;quot;batter&amp;quot; gets only one pitch. A missed pitch counts as one out.  Each team gets three outs and then players change positions.  Players play nine innings and whomever has the most runs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few other simple rules.  The game is quite tricky to learn and play competitively.  But it is definitely a fun experience if you enjoy baseball!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
