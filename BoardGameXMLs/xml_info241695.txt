							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Building A Better Monster</name>
									
			<description>Building a Better Monster pits players against each other as Mad Scientists competing to be the first to build a unique creature and bring it to life. When not acting as the Mad Scientist, you take on the role of Angry Villagers trying to work together to stop the current Mad Scientist's work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays using one standard 6-sided die to determine what twisted blueprints they&amp;rsquo;ve jotted down from fever-dreams and insane visions, as well as 6 custom Mad Scientist dice to determine what building blocks they&amp;rsquo;ve managed to collect from local cemeteries, mortuaries, hospitals, or prisons. Each scientist uses these materials to make their twisted schematics a reality. With the help of their faithful lab assistants and the occasional pack of ghouls at their summons, the madness is contagious. The Angry Villagers have their own set of 6 custom dice to determine their actions for the night. Will they storm the lab with a Pitchfork or Fire? Will they decide to cut off the Electricity instead? Maybe some will sleep through the night or decide to go Grave Robbing instead to use for their own creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
