			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Routine Expedition...&lt;br/&gt;... is what it all seems like when Dr. Edgar Haskins hires the posse on as guards for his Explorers Society-funded expedition.  All they have to do is accompany him down into the Grand Canyon, retracing the final steps of the vanished explorer Major John Wesley Powell.  It seems a few of the canyon pioneer's possessions have shown up, and seem to indicate he made some sort of amazing discovery before the hostile confines of the Grand Canyon brought him low!  It seems like a chance for a cowpoke to see one of the natural wonders of the world up close - and get paid doing it!&lt;br/&gt;But before they know it, the heroes are embroiled in a race against desperate enemies, Hell-bent on finding Powell's discovery themselves - and willing to kill to get there first!  There's more to this archaeological find than just a few pot shards...&lt;br/&gt;This epic 128-page adventure for the Origins Award-winning Deadlands (tm) roleplaying game takes your posse down into the depths of one of the natural wonders of the Weird West (tm).  Can they unlock its amazing secret?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
