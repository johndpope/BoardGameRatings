			<description>Book Intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. . .So, on my way to consummate what should have been a lucrative trade with the Osarians, I chanced upon the haunted Black Rock Keep-every bit dreary as the Barrow of Acara, where I swear the foul breath of the rotting Winshar dogged me every step. . . which was, of course, not the same exhilarating thrill provided by the visions atop the Cliff of Eternity, as I so thoroughly elaborated to Alistra Monshae&lt;br/&gt;in her famous Dancing Dryad over precious dragonberry wine.

From the Keep is where I retrieved the long-lost DeGaullis. Or was it from the Whispering Sphere? Nevertheless, it was rather unfortunate when I was forced to relinquish the prized masterpiece in exchange for my life at Illandra&amp;rsquo;s Vigil. . . Well, regrettably I must attend to some urgent business now, but just between you and me, I have recently compiled my travel highlights in this prestigious handy journal here, available for a modest fee. Therefore, if&lt;br/&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re interested...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
