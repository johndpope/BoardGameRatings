			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;Take a deep breath and dive into fascinating shark-themed card games like Shark's Tooth Rummy, Sink or Swim, and Wild Wobbegong. Want to know which sharks are nocturnal? Which can leap out of the water? Which is known as &amp;quot;white death&amp;quot;? This fact-filled deck turns the world of sharks into games for your brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Shark cards are similar to a standard set of playing cards except each of the 4 suits contains 12 cards (rather than 13). Each of the 12 cards contains a picture of a shark and a description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also 12 Challenge Cards that ask players to look for Sharks with particular characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has rules for 5 different games:&lt;br/&gt;Deep Dive (Similar to Go Fish)&lt;br/&gt;Sink or Swim (Similar to Concentration)&lt;br/&gt;Shark's Tooth Rummy (Similar to Gin Rummy)&lt;br/&gt;Wild Wobbegong (Similar to Crazy Eights)&lt;br/&gt;Food Chain (Similar to Solitaire)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
