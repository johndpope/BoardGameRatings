							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">d30 Random Horse Generator Tables</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in fantasy role-playing games generally tire from having their player-characters walk everywhere sometime shortly after character creation. Usually as soon as the PCs can scrape up enough coin they get horses, allowing them to explore, loot, and pillage much more easily. In my experience the players tend to underestimate just how valuable their mounts are and they just see them as simple, replaceable tools in-game. With this set of d30 tables you can quickly generate a simple horse for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
