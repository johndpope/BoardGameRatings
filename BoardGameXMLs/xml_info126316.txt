							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Realm of Dream</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Realm of Dream is the place where all dreams of every people of all Arthad and of seven other worlds coexist. It is not a true demiplane or similar thing. It is more like a magic land, which has its own rules. It is said that a conclave of seven beings oversees on the Realm of Dream. In fact, on each of the seven worlds connected to the Realm, there are people who, in a way or another, have the ability to walk the dream. In the world of Arthad, for example, they are clerics called &amp;ldquo;The Brotherhood of the Dream Walkers&amp;rdquo; (for more information on this see the Brotherhoods sourcebook, available at &amp;Oslash;one&amp;rsquo;s website).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally, when a man sleeps he creates a small area in the Realm of Dream. In these areas, dreams take place, and when the dreamer awakens, this area disappears. No one else who enters the Realm while normally sleeping, can go outside his area nor he can see beyond his area&amp;rsquo;s borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brotherhood of the Dream Walkers, as well as other people on other worlds, has the ability to walk between these areas. Normal men, temporary, can gain this ability by consumption of certain substances. It is said that Zenith shamans can effectively walk the Realm by using the Flower of Dream mixed with other fruits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: the material presented here is excerpted from Warriors of Dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
