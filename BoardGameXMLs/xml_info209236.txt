			<description>Stuff the Universe is a family friendly, turn based strategy game where players explore the universe to amass the most victory points. No game is ever the same as the universe unfolds while the players explore it, the Ancients arrive based on player actions, and the difficulty of navigating the sectors is affected by the battles that occur within them.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Equip your ship with crew and weapons to safely navigate the universe, colonize new worlds, and combat aliens that get in your way. The fate of your faction is up to you; what edge will you find that leads them to victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
