							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magical Rainbow Board Game and Play Set</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's and Toy Directory websites:&lt;br/&gt;The board is used on a slight incline and the game pieces are magnetic. The Magical Rainbow is a magnetized game that takes children on a special adventure through 7 magical lands. Players race to a pot of gold, watching out for Paddy the Leprechaun, who on every turn travels from land to land protecting his gold. Throughout the journey players will try to collect gold coins, avoid the Leprechaun and his lucky trinkets, and use strategy to win the game. The first player to reach the pot of gold at the end of the Rainbow wins, however the game encourages sharing with others in need. This game is designed to teach children color recognition, sequencing, patterns, counting, strategy and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Using a rainbow game theme lets kids imagine what it would be like living on a Magical Rainbow, and helping Paddy the leprechaun give out his gold to people in need.  The rainbow game combines colors and a magnetic 3d game set that keep kids entertained game after game.  The other goal for Magical Rainbow was to create a board game that could be played with one child.  There are a lot of one child families and what good is a board game if you don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to play the game with?  Magical Rainbow can be used as a standalone make believe play set.&amp;quot;  The game pieces double as flexible magnetic play pieces that have letters and numbers on the reverse side. They can be used on the front or back of the game board or on any metallic surface to assist children in developing recognition with the alphabet, numbers and words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards: 2009 Family Choice Award, Creative Child Magazine's Game of the Year award, Dr Toy Best Picks, 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
