			<description>From the rules booklet: &amp;quot;A minature game (like) snooker with a difference.  A game designed for 2-4 players from 8yrs to adult.  A game as thoughtful as chess played with the tenacity of skillful snooker players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game seems to be about shaking some dice and moving the cue ball until it strikes another ball.  The rules are rather vague about what happens when a ball strikes multiple balls, either at the same time or in a chain reaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Score Sheets&lt;br/&gt;    Pencils&lt;br/&gt;     Dice Cue Off Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Rules book and 24 balls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
