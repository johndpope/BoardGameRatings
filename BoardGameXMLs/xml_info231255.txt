			<description>Cargo Cult: Shoot'n'Loot VR is an episodic Steampunk VR shoot &amp;lsquo;em up in which players take control of the last airship of the Great Mechanical Armada. In order to retrieve the legendary treasure of El Dorado, players will have to venture deep into the hostile lands of the Cargo Cult, a world full of ancient wooden mechanisms and stone golems worshipping them, beautiful palms and deadly homing missiles. Players can expect a highly engaging sky pirate experience, taking them from a tense fight with a giant Doomcopter to fending off hordes of flying Bombers and dodging falling debris in the blink of an eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hurricane Shoot&amp;rsquo;em Up + Virtual Reality = Unlimited Drive! The titanic rock is falling right on your head! You have never felt such a deep experience before, but you can now!&lt;br/&gt;     Cover yourself with a shield, fire with two hands, make a real Armageddon with a machine gun in one hand, shotgun in the other and piece of huge rock you have blown up! Unlock and upgrade all types of weapons including deadly Doom Rocket Launcher!&lt;br/&gt;     Six-barreled Machine Guns with Grenade Launchers &amp;amp; Light Shields! Upgrade it or unlock destroy-them-all-style steam Rocket Launcher!&lt;br/&gt;     Battle against fast swarms of Iron Hornets, mad Kamikadze Ships, heavy and armored Doomcopters, merciless Missile Towers, and more. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget about giant and powerful BOSSES made from deadly parts forged into one crazy mind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
