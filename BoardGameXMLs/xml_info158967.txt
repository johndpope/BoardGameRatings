			<description>You are a well-known kaleidoscope designer in the Edo period. One day, you are summoned by the Shogun to his castle. On arriving at the castle, you find some other kaleidoscope designers, and the Shogun gives you all an order: &amp;quot;I want to see a magnificent kaleidoscope. You have to cooperate to create it! Gold will be rewarded to whoever's creation is the most outstanding!&amp;quot; Let's see whether you can catch the Shogun's attention by creating a masterpiece!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kaleido, the players take turns placing their colored tiles (along with two white tiles) in the game boards. Before or after a turn, a player can add one of her two additional game boards to the playing area. When a hexagonal game board is filled, a scoring takes place, with the player who has the most tiles in this board earning 8 points and the player with the secondmost tiles 4 points; after scoring, the active player can rotate this game board as she wishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the tiles have been placed, players then score for the filled hexes created by three adjacent hexagonal game boards, with scoring being the same as for those hexes filled during the game. Whoever has secured the best positions on each game board and rotated her tile to serve double-duty will win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
