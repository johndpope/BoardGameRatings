							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guardians: The Game of Heroic High Adventure</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guardians RPG is quite unlike any superhero role playing game currently on the market. Using the same basic rules as Justifiers RPG, it is an easy to-play percentile based gaming system. Both player and gamemaster are given plenty of opporunity to tailor characters they will enjoy gaming. Getting back to its comic book roots, Guardian has an established continuity, or history, which is presented throughout the game as comic art sequence. You can set your campaigns anywhere (or at any time) in the Guardians timeline, and the mechanics are such that they can be used for almost any genre of role playing. Comic art sequences are also used in adventure scenarios to give the GM an additional tool; instead of describing the scene, the GM can now show it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
