							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valcarta I: Rise of the Demon</name>
									
			<description>Valcarta is a magical world suspended high above the clouds out of reach of you or I... And on this island-like world are many things far greater then anything our world has seen. Magic and Monsters rule over these lands, not machines or money. Valcarta is a strange place indeed, will you dare to take a peek?&lt;br/&gt;â€‹&lt;br/&gt;Valcarta I: Rise of the Demon, takes place on this magical world, within a province called Drachell. You will play as a young man named Valak, a villager from Orm. On a special day, where he is called upon by the mayor, Valak finds himself thrown into adventure by receiving a mysterious power by a witch! Little does he know, he is now on his way to sealing the fate of Valcarta and all on it forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valcarta I: Rise of the Demon is a game that uses a split path in order to tell it's story. However, this game is unlike many other split-path games, as one must play both sides to be able to understand all that is going on within the world. A strict time-line is followed for mind-blowing storytelling through this epic adventure in Drachell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pathway which the player can take through Drachell, is unique. Both paths play entirely different, championing different ideals and learning and meeting different people, bringing a refreshing feeling to the world of split-path RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weather or not you champion the side of the Brotherhood, or the side of the Empire, Valak will meet several wonderful friends along the way, each with their own heartfelt story.  Explore, adventure and learn about each character as the story goes on.&lt;br/&gt;Discover the secret of the Shaman and Beastmen Clans of Drachell, and unfold the myths and mysteries behind the Elemental Lords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
