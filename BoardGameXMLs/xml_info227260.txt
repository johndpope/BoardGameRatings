			<description>Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Don't Poop On My Lawn! is to be the first &amp;quot;neighbor&amp;quot; to lay out six grass cards and build a beautiful, &amp;quot;poop-free&amp;quot; lawn! The problem is the neighborhood is full of dogs and they're out to poop on your lawn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 7 cards and will play &amp;quot;Grass Cards&amp;quot; out in front of them to build their lawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To wander about the neighborhood you must play a &amp;quot;Walkies&amp;quot; card.  Below, the &amp;quot;doggie&amp;quot; is ready to head out into the neighborhood. Move your dog onto your neighbor's lawn to poop! Ready to poop? Take the &amp;quot;Poop Pile&amp;quot; and turn over cards one at a time until you get to a poop card! Count how many cards you turn over and place the same number of &amp;quot;poops&amp;quot; on their grass card! But wait! Sometimes its a false alarm! If you turn over a &amp;quot;Fart&amp;quot; card before you get to a &amp;quot;Poop&amp;quot; card, you don't get to poop at all!  (Fart Card = No poop!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player lays out 6 grass cards that are completely poop free. That player is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
