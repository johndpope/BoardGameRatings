			<description>'User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Hockey is an arcade style hockey game that features 4-on-4 gameplay.Players choose from 6 national teams to play as. The only differences between teams is the uniform color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may set their line up of 4 players to consist of any combination of Light, Medium, and Heavy skaters. Light players skate fast and are strong at face-offs but have a weak shot and weak check; while Heavy skaters skate slowly and are not good at face offs but have a strong shot and strong check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game speed and the length of each period is variable. Game speed ranges from 1 to 5 while period length ranges from 5 to 15 minutes. The game speed affects how fast the timer for the period moves as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the basics of pass and shoot, and can also &amp;quot;check&amp;quot; the player with possession of the puck to try and knock it loose. However the player in possession can also resist the check. If this goes on long enough a fight will start, sending one of the players to the penalty box. This is the only penalty in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icing can also occur, which is when a player shoots the puck the length of the ice from his own defensive zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
