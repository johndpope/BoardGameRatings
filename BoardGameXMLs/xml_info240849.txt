			<description>Prismal is a cooperative card game for 2 to 6 players, from 10 years old, of about 15 minutes. PRISMAL is the first game from the anthropomorphic universe we are developing:&amp;quot;Kingdoms of Isempar&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to decrypt the cards face down in the middle of the table. Team spirit and deductions will be required to decrypt these cards using the information provided by players as they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick randomly one card of each colour and place them face down in the middle of the table. These six cards are called &amp;quot;encrypted&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the rest of the selected cards and deal them all to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important: Players cannot communicate with each other about the cards in their hands. A player can only see the colour of other players' cards by looking at their backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turn, a player must perform one of the following two actions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Place a card: The player takes a card from his hand and places it face up in front of the &amp;quot;encrypted&amp;quot; card of his choice, without covering the one (s) already placed. This card can be placed in front of an &amp;quot;encrypted&amp;quot; card of a different colour.&lt;br/&gt;     The player takes a card from their hand and puts it face down in front of them. Players may at any time consult the backs of cards that have been discarded from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the players have no more cards in their hands or when all players have successively discarded a card. Then they flip the &amp;quot;encrypted&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;The number of cards placed in front of each &amp;quot;encrypted&amp;quot; card must correspond exactly to its value. Players then estimate their success rate based on the number of cards they have decrypted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
