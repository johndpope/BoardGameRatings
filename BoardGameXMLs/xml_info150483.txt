			<description>&amp;quot;Ships in space. Lots of them. There was peace, then shots were fired, and then there was war.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;-Official statement, as provided by Anonymous Pilot-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, there was peace. But once a package is opened, up to 16 various Pilots (players) have stumbled into the growing conflict, and each turn shots are exchanged until only 1 leaves the battlefield alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each package (the game comes in booster wrapping to provide a random drafting feel similar to various card game tournaments) includes the instructions and enough randomly assorted Pilot cards for a full game of 2-16 players (16 players means that each player only gets 1 Pilot for a game, but additional packs or fewer players allow for more Pilots per player.) The front of each card includes their ship name, their health/damage values, and up to 4 actions (1 on each card edge)that the played Pilot can choose to take for a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat and damage plays out in a form similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors with a couple of twists. Each turn, all players play a Pilot card from their hand face-down, with the action of their choice being pointed towards the center of the group of players. The active player then chooses a target, and both of them flip over their Pilot cards and resolve the combat, the loser reducing and keeping track of their remaining health. If the targeted player has chosen a &amp;quot;Pass&amp;quot; action, then the target becomes the player in the direction of the Pass and they participate/resolve the combat instead. These steps continue until only one player has any Pilots remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
