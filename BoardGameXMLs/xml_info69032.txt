			<description>&amp;quot;Viva Pi&amp;ntilde;ata: Party Animals is a video game developed by Krome Studios for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console and set in the world of Viva Pi&amp;ntilde;ata. The game was first announced at Microsoft's E3 2007 press conference on July 11, 2007, and was released on October 30, 2007 in the US, and November 16, 2007 in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the original Viva Pi&amp;ntilde;ata, Party Animals is based on elements from the television show, including its characters and voices. Furthermore, the title provides a mini-game based experience, similar to the Mario Party series, rather than the sandbox environment of the original. There are over 40 mini-games, as well as kart-style races which are conducted on foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Viva_Pinata_Party_Animals,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
