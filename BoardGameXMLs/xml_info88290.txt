							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Michael Jackson&#039;s Moonwalker</name>
									
			<description>The story, which is taken from the Moonwalker film, follows Michael, using various music and dance related abilities, on a quest to save kidnapped children from the hands of the evil &amp;quot;Mr. Big&amp;quot;. The games incorporated synthesized versions of the musician's hits, such as &amp;quot;Beat It&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Smooth Criminal&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versions of the game were released for the popular 8-bit and 16-bit home computers of the time. They were developed by two small softhouses, Irish Emerald Software Ltd and American Keypunch Software, and published by British company U.S. Gold; all of these have since gone out of business[1]. The home computer versions are the only games to make reference to the early portions of the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;e games featured four different levels. The first was a top-down maze-style level based on the 'Speed Demon' short, involving wandering the studio to collect various items and costume pieces, with the final piece being the motorcycle, all whilst trying to avoid the crazed fans. Stealth elements were used, with an onscreen map similar to that used in Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. The next level had similar gameplay, riding the motorcycle collecting tokens, upon which turning into a car in order to jump a barrier to the next part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third level was a sort of side-scrolling level based on the &amp;quot;Smooth Criminal&amp;quot; clip, collecting ammunition and shooting at gangsters in openings above you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final level involved morphing into a robot and shooting at soldiers in openings, with the player controlling a crosshair. The four songs used were &amp;quot;Bad&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Speed Demon&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Smooth Criminal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Michael Jackson's Moonwalker&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
