							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mercado de Arte: SÃ´nia Menna Barreto</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The players should buy and sell paintings of S&amp;ocirc;nia Menna Barreto, the only Brazilian artist to have one of her works (Leonard Chesire) included in the art collection of the British Royal Family. To win the game, a player should acquire at least 3 of 5 artworks depicted on his goal card. After that, the player tries to move his pawn to the Art Club space, where he receives the valuable artwork Leonard Cheshire. Then, the players check the value of all their possessions, including artworks, money and stores that sell the artist&amp;rsquo;s products, and who has the highest amount is the winner. Artworks and stores can be directly purchased from other players or by auctions or can be earned on special spaces on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
