			<description>Vertellis - which means &amp;quot;tell us more&amp;quot; in Dutch - is designed to create a moment in which families and friends become much closer by asking in-depth questions. Questions that make you reflect, cherish, and share the important and beautiful moments of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vertellis is played through a total of four rounds.  Cards are stacked in four piles as labeled on the back of each card, Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, and Round 4.  Cards in Round 1 consist of questions answered individually about the past year.  Cards in Round 3 consist of questions answered individually about the upcoming year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only in Rounds 2 and 4 can you receive points.  These Rounds consist of three questions each that are answered by everyone.  Each participant can earn a maximum of six points throughout the game. It is possible for more than one player to tie for the win, but we believe that during a successful night everyone's a winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
