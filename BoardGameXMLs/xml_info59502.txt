			<description>Publisher Blurb: The Big Night is a cooperative storytelling game with puppets to cut out and color.  Together, the players will tell a story about a group of stuffed animals, snowmen, and other creatures, who help out the Fat Man to deliver presents to children on the Big Night.&lt;br/&gt; The Big Night is a very simple game.  It can be played by anyone who loves stories, but it is designed especially for young children.  This game uses no dice, and no numbers higher than 3.  At least one player in the group must be able to read the book, but their younger brothers, sisters, and friends will be able to enjoy it also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
