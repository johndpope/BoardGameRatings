			<description>Like Hex, Twixt, Connections, and similar games, the object of Antipalos is to connect opposite sides of the board.  Antipalos is played on a 16X16 grid of squares, or 17x17 points.  Pieces are placed in turns diagonally across the squares, connecting vertices.  It is possible (unlike Hex and Twixt) for opposing lines to cross each other, where they meet at a vertex.  Players are limited in the number of pieces that may be played.  When the limit is reached, players must remove pieces and reposition them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
