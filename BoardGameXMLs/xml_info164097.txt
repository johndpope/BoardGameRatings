							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brain Slugs from Planet X (Aether)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Came from the Stars to send you to the Grave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a mysterious crash, two teachers return to school and they're just not quite...right. You and your friends start to put together some clues about them and the janitor and your missing friend, and the dead girl in the work shop. Yup...the clues are becoming less subtle all the time...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the crux of all of this is a group of three body-snatching brain slugs that just want to get home, but they understand that they can't have any witnesses, even if that means killing every single kid in the High School. The Player Characters are all high school kids, and the adventure includes several templates to use, hitting all the tropes to let you adapt this to any time period, from the 1930's clear up through the modern age!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is at home in the 60's, 70's, and 80's, and it revolves around the kids being the problem-solvers, staring at the center of their very own B-movie. It also utilizes the High School map put together by the always-awesome Fabled Environments, and while this adventure does not require it, it was built specifically to use their map!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
