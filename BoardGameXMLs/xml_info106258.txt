							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Age, Proxy Edition</name>
									
			<description>Dice Age is a game of unbalanced, figurative, and toyish collectible dice which are both cool to look at and fun to roll! They are utilized in a game of strategy and risk-taking with simple but engaging rules. On his turn, a player rolls one of his dice, with the goal of never overshooting the last number rolled, or he loses all the dice he rolled in the round. The last player in play wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;The Proxy edition, made by hand in the author's garage, gave birth to the Alpha Edition, plastic injected, and was used from 1997 to 2011: the early development of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
