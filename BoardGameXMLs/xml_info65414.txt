			<description>The players will be able to memorize the names of anatomical structure and their placement in relation to other anatomical structures. In the affective domain, the students will have fun learning what it often considered a difficult subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get two runs of three and four cards representing the sequential (deep to superficial) order of the five main anatomical components composing each suit. The dealer deals seven cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed face down and the top card is turned over to begin the discard stack. Moving clockwise from the dealer, the first player chooses either the discarded card or a card from the face down pile. The player determines which cards to keep and discards the extra card. The first player to create two runs of three and four cards places the cards down and must name three structures (e.g., three bones, three muscles) represented on each card. The other players refer to a reference sheet that indicates all the structures on each card to ascertain whether the player is correct. If the player cannot name at least three structures on each card, the player subtracts 1 point from his or her score for each card on which he or she failed to name three structures. The player with the winning hand adds the value of the cards laid down, subtracts the points for any unnamed structures and adds the total to his or her score. The players with the losing hands add the value of their cards and subtract it from their scores. The game is over when a player reaches a predetermined score. If a time limit is set instead, the winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;40 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
