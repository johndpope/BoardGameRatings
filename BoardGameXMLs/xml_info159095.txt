							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Gab</name>
									
			<description>Monster Gab contains two decks of cards -- In one deck are word cards such as &amp;quot;Have&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Four&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Five&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Feet&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Hands&amp;quot;.  The other has four-word phrases such as &amp;quot; I have four feet&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I have five hands&amp;quot;.  Most words appear in several phrases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 3 rule sets, of ascending complexity.  The first and second are vaguely rummy-like.  The third is a variation on slap jack.  All three involve collecting sets of word cards to match a target phrase before the other players do.  The player who scores the most phrases after a predetermined number of rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters who like to gab...?&lt;br/&gt;These monsters have something to say about themselves and each other!  Find out what they have in mind, and they may try to keep the scaring down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
