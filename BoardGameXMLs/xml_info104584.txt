							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Air Hoops</name>
									
			<description>This is a dexterity game with a basketball theme. The design is similar to &amp;quot;Space: The Game that Defies Gravity&amp;quot; and features the same battery operated air cushion. Contestants guide the floating basketball across an abstract circular court as they maneuver the ball around two teams of basketball player figures and into hoops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four levels of play based on the number of figures on the court and the number of basketball goals positioned on the outer ring. There is also a timer to increase the level of competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the plastic court display, two teams of plastic players, three basketballs, and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
