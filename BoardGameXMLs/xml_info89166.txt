Create your own fiendishly clever worlds with the professional style level editor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge other squads in 10 specially designed multi-player levels or team up with friends against the Scay&amp;rsquo;Ger in the new cooperative mode. Buy your copy of &amp;quot;Incubation: The Wilderness Missions&amp;quot; and prepare for new tactical challenges that will turn your darkest nightmares into merciless realities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
