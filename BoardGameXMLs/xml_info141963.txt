			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Beyond 20th Level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In support of the wildly popular &amp;quot;Legendary Levels&amp;quot; guide to Pathfinder gameplay beyond 20th level we've conujured some serious spellcasting material! This book has 50 new spells (29 true dweomers, 21 sacred spells), alternate legendary classes for all 6th level casters, new feats, and a whole lot of new magic items! Ready, set.. cast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolute Power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lure of magic has captivated the hearts and minds of mortals since before their first ancestors carved images into stone. The wishes of those without the powers of the gods seem to be able to be realized through this great and mysterious force. But there is a cost... There is always a cost. Within this tome&amp;rsquo;s pages are magical items rivaling the power of the greatest artifacts, spells that can make a god kneel, and the means to rule the worlds across countless spheres of existence. Those who risk everything (and perhaps more) to harness the power of the ultimate magical energies need seek no further than these tenebrous pages. Beware what you find within, for the desire for power can sometimes be so great that even a paragon of all that is good can be tempted to do wicked things to possess it. If you pursue that which can grant dreams, be sure that those dreams do not become nightmares. One phrase comes to mind when meditating on the actions of the beings that hold such overwhelming power:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Absolute power corrupts absolutely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been warned. For those of you who would still seek such awesome power, pray that the gods have mercy upon you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Book Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    50 new spells for characters over level 20. (29 true dweomers for arcane casters and 21 sacred spells for divine casters)&lt;br/&gt;    Alternate more spellcasting focused variant legendary classes for the following character classes: Alchemist, bard, inquisitor, magus, mystic summoner&lt;br/&gt;    A magic weapon based fighter legendary class&lt;br/&gt;    New magic rogue talents&lt;br/&gt;    A handful of new feats for legendary characters intrested in magic!&lt;br/&gt;    3 new weapon enchantments&lt;br/&gt;    31 new magic items (rings, rods, and wonderous items!)&lt;br/&gt;    Original Artwork by Jonathan Achey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Requires Legendary Levels to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
