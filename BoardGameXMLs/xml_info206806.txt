							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Across the Atlantic</name>
									
			<description>This Chad Valley game is a simple roll and move affair in which up to four players race their passenger liners across the Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players leave from the UK (Liverpool, Bristol, Southampton and London), and have their own 75-space tracks ending in the Americas (Quebec, New York, Kingston, and Panama). Each track has four special spaces: Miss a Turn; Go Again; Back 3; and Back 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-section board has some nice graphics including scenes from Africa and South America and various incidents en route. The green player must be thankful that technology has improved since 1912: the iceberg off Newfoundland causes only a missed turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is 17&amp;quot; x 11.5&amp;quot;, and has two folds, with an almost square center piece and smaller Eastern and Western side pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
