			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of useful items that could be found by players scavenging for supplies from corpses, vehicles and buildings following an apocalyptic event. Most of these items are useful, although sometimes they may not be specifically useful for players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general, or sometimes specific, type of item is determined, followed by the quantities found, or quantities inside, followed by item specifics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;70. Sewing Kit - Contains 3d2 needles, 4d2 reels of thread in different colours, 1d3 safety pins, 1d2 buttons, 1 soft measuring tape, 1 small scissors, 1 metal thimble and 5d10+10 pins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
