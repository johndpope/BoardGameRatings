							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leverage: The Quickstart Job</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dennis Holland is not a good guy. He's responsible for bank failures, collapsed mortgages, and dozens of innocent people being forced from their homes. He collects seventies memorabilia. He's a bad man. And he's hosting a party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nathan Ford and his Crew are on the job, but it has to be done fast, and there's not much time. Presented as a training exercise for newcomers and experienced gamers alike, The Quickstart Job lets you and your friends play Nate, Elliot, Parker, Hardison, and Sophie as they take down Holland and his corrupt schemes. Included are rules, characters, and all the twists and complications you need for a night of high-stakes LEVERAGE action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
