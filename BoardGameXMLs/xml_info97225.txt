							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Brass: a game of colonial exploration (CRN Games edition)</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Expedition Afrique&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1892, the French led a military campaign in Dahomey, the &amp;quot;Slave  Coast&amp;quot; between Nigeria and Togo, against its kings so that they might  have control of Porto Novo, a coastal city. They marched all the way to  Abomey, the capital of the land, and found the rulers gone. They  amused themselves by looting the city for souvenirs. The French press  was most impressed by a white parasol decorated with human jawbones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They never saw the inside of that parasol. Inside it was a map drawn  in human blood, a map that pointed to a legendary city deep in Africa's interior. This city was called the City of Brass, a bastion of ancient  African civilization full of treasure, both gold and knowledge. Sadi Carnot, the president of France, sent a expedition on that  doomed journey. It only took three weeks for them to become hopelessly lost in an uncharted land. To this day, no one knows what happened to them. According to legend, only one of them made it, and his  greatest wishes were given unto him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you will play those lost souls. Trapped in Africa's interior, with a map drawn on a parasol and not enough resources, you  search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note about this play of this game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about people who will cheat each other and maybe even  kill each other. As players, you are bound to follow the rules of the  game. Without adherence to them, and the honor not to cheat, the  game will not work. So don&amp;iexcl; t be a bad player, only a bad character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
