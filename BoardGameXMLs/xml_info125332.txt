							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Theatre</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In times long past great comedies and tragedies were played in this small theatre for an exclusive audience. But these times are long gone. Nowadays the theatre lies empty most days, but rumor has it that in some nights an entirely different kind of sinister tragedy now takes place there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theatre was entirely built from sandstone. The stage pit and the semicircular ranks that once seated the audience are still mostly intact, but most of the columns that surrounded the theatre at some time and provided protection from the sun have fallen over the years. Only some of them are still visible, while most lie buried under dirt and sand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
