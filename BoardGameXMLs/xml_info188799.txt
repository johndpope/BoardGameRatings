			<description>2015 Solitaire Print &amp;amp; Play Contest entry description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure awaits you in Card Quest: Kingdoms, a solitaire card game you can play almost anywhere. Play as one of four heroes, each with different abilities. Each kingdom Quest card offers a unique challenge requiring different strategies to win. The journey is treacherous. Even the most experienced will fall to its dangers. Emerging victorious requires keen knowledge of the cards, timely use of gear and hero abilities, and a bit of luck. Card Quest: Kingdoms is easy to learn, but always a challenge to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on one of five quests by defeating monsters, collecting their loot, and equipping gear.  Each card serves multiple purposes, allowing for a lot of variety while only using a small deck of cards.  If the player can successfully complete their quest without dying, the hero is triumphant and they can test their skill in another quest or try to improve upon their completion time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
