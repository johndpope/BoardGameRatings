			<description>THAT SPORTS GAME is a newly produced classical board game that uses dice for player movement, a card game within the game to compete for amateur sports. The sports are the sports in the list of sports approved by the Olympics for athletic competition at the quadriennial games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That being said, there is NO TRIVIA, and no knowledge of sports required. The only requirement is a love of board games, and an understanding of how board games function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That Sports Game game play involves everyone at the table, whenever a sports event space is encountered by landing on it. The SPORTS EVENT card is drawn, every player must 'pay' to enter the sport, and then using the GET SET deck, that includes 5 cards per person at the outset, each player 'bids' for the event by using their skill, experience, and training against each other competitor. The winner of the Sports event keeps the SPORTS EVENT CARD, as well as takes the honorarium designated on the card, plus the cash of all the other competitors in the event. The aim is to get enough sports event cards to qualify for a coach (if you don't get a coach by other means) and a sponsor, so that you can move up to national and global competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When landing on other spaces like HOST CITY, a Host City Card is&lt;br/&gt;drawn, and specs followed.  Drug testing may be required, taxes, fund raising and Bonus spaces also are  part of the mix. Scoring as per the score card, determines the winner in most games if timed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We enjoy playing 1:23   (that is one hour and twenty three minutes) and then compute the winner. You might be surprised to find yourself an athletic champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For lots of information, look to our website:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thatsportsgame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.thatsportsgame.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
