							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">East India Company: Pirate Bay</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;East India Company did not originally have pirates as a playable faction as we wanted to concentrate on the actual companies. However, we received an incredible amount of feedback from people who told us how much they would love to play as pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It became clear that the best way to implement pirates as a playable faction was to make a separate campaign for them. The best part about the campaign is that you can actually compete against other players and find out who's the best pirate by uploading your points to EIC homepage afterwards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Kim Soares, Lead Designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a pirate!&lt;br/&gt;Starting out modestly, build up your fleet by commandeering new ships.&lt;br/&gt;Single fleet and captain provide whole new approach to the game.&lt;br/&gt;You have 20 years to hoard as much wealth as you possibly can.&lt;br/&gt;Upload your personal high score to EIC-website to see who's the best pirate of them all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
