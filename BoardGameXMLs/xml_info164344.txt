							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faro Playing Cards</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the pack:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This deck is a representation of typical 19th century playing cards.  Like many of those encountered in the Shattered Frontier, it is not pristine.  Rather it bears the smudges and grime long use has imparted.  Gritty realism at its finest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A deck of cards is frequently used to determine random outcomes in the Aces &amp;amp; Eights role playing game.  This deck is a perfect companion to the game offering a &amp;quot;period feel&amp;quot; no other playing cards can match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Enclosed within are 54 cards in standard suits including two distinct Jokers.  As such, it is eminently suitable for use in both Faro and Poker games as well.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
