			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the thirteenth entry in our line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the end of the twenty-third century approached, the United States authorized construction of a small warship to reduce the need for the USSN to use larger vessels for escort and patrol duties. Like other major national powers the United States was finding that maintaining a space navy capable of defending her interstellar colonies was an expensive exercise and the hoped for economic offset from those colonies was, in reality, much lower than the projected outcomes had promised. In order to reduce the operating costs of the fleet without reducing its strength, it was determined that a smaller and thus less operationally expensive warship class was needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2293 Congress authorized the construction of the Strikemaster-class brig. The selection of the classification of &amp;ldquo;brig&amp;rdquo; caused some surprise as the US had not operated a brig for over four hundred years, that role, back in the age of sail, being replaced by fast frigates and corvettes. However, the use of the hull classification was revived with the new design performing exactly the same roles as those larger vessels but at a much reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 13: Strikemaster-class Brig comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The prospector is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, this ship could easily be used in any science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
