			<description>A game based on the #1 selling small doll, Polly Pocket. Polly and her friends are out at the Beach when they get invited to a super cool party, which is great, but what will they wear? It's a race through the trendy beach promenade while the girls frantically look for the outfit of their dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel around the board visiting different shops. When a player enters a shop, they may look at one of the face down cards located in that shop. If the item matches their dream outfit, represented on the players outfit card, they may take the article of clothing and dress their doll with it. First player to get all the items of their dream outfit and make it to the SUV to go to the party wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polly &amp;amp; friends are on a &amp;quot;what to wear?&amp;quot; quest,&lt;br/&gt;For the hottest looks that are sure to impress&lt;br/&gt;Shop 'til your card and outfit's the same,&lt;br/&gt;then dash to the SUV to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
