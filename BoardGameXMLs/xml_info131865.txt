							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Anna Never</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The young merchant Anna Never is a complete mystery. As she travels around Gaia she seems to unconsciously position herself to be involved with major issues and problems facing the world. Additionally she has exhibited martial abilities unheard of for a girl of her age an apparent lack of training to possess. With no known connection to any established power block, one can't help but wonder that maybe there is more to her than she is letting on ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light Wanderer Warrior &amp;mdash; Lv. 45&lt;br/&gt; Innate Abilities: Critical Mastery.&lt;br/&gt; Destiny's Chosen: After seeing the roll for an attack that targets Anna, you may spend one Gnosis Point to have your opponent to reroll the attack.&lt;br/&gt; The One: You cannot spend Gnosis to improve any roll made by Anna. However, Anna rolls an additional dice an keeps the highest when making any roll.&lt;br/&gt; Stubborn: Anna cannot be included in a party that has more Dark units than Light units in it.&lt;br/&gt; Void God (Ki, Attack) +3 Attack.&lt;br/&gt; Libera Me (Ki, Dodge) +3 Defense.&lt;br/&gt; Infinity Requiem (Ki, Attack) +1 Attack / +2 Damage. You may spend any amount of Gnosis that you wish when making the attack. Anna makes an additional Infinity Requiem attack with the same target as the first one for each Gnosis point spent when making this attack (up to 2 Gnosis points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
