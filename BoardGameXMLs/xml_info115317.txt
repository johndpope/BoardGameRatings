							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken Bottle</name>
									
			<description>Broken Bottle is a grim tale of alcoholism and brutality in a post-apocalyptic world. It was written for the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge 2011, but has been updated a little since. The game is mostly story-focused, following an alcoholic as he tries to find the surface following a nuclear war. Alcohol also plays an important part in several game dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
