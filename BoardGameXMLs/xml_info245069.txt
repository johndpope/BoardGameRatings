This particular discovery has special relevance, as it is believed to be the last resting place of one of Ibrahim&amp;rsquo;s followers, a devoted disciple who escaped the fall of ancient Arcadia and brought his teachings to the Khitesh people. Garriot was a mage of considerable power, so there is no telling what secrets and wonders this venerated martyr took to his grave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arm yourself with the best weapons and spells, and prepare for a grueling gauntlet as you venture deep into an ancient repository. Dark magic and fiendish traps will attempt to thwart your progress, ensuring that this tomb's treasures remain forever hidden. Do you think you are ready for this ultimate challenge? Then best you come prepared...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
