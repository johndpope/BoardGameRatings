			<description>Dimension Jump is a precision puzzle platformer, where you don't just jump between platforms, you jump between dimensions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've picked up the basics you'll have to master the art of dimension jumping, gravity switching and teleporting to get through some of the most challenging levels on offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dimension Jump is now available on Steam. The game has 90 levels to complete, each with two additional challenge modes, with plenty of content to challenge all skill levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dimension Jump you can collect Steam achievements by completing level sets, challenge your friends with your own custom levels using the level editor, and compete against the world on global leaderboards for the fastest times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
