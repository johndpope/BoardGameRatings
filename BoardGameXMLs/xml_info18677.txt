			<description>Which Reflection Goes Which Direction? You Make the Connection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, a random maze of Mirror Blocks is set up on the board.  Players use their spatial relations skills to try to predict various paths through the maze in an attempt to find the highest-scoring path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the simplest version of the game, the player is allowed to see the arrows on top of the Mirror Blocks to find scoring paths that lead to Target Pegs.  The instructions also include optional rules to increase the difficulty of game-play for more expert players.  Players can move or rotate a Mirror Block to increase their score or to try to block their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player places the View Cube at the beginning of a selected path.  They then place their finger on the Target Peg that they think is at the end of the path.  The player looks down into the View Cube.  If the predicted Peg is seen, the player scores by adding the values of the Mirror Blocks and the Target Peg to their existing score.  If the selected Target Peg is not correct, the player scores nothing&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirror Mania is a fun and relatively quick-playing game, and the Day-Glo&amp;reg; hot pink, electric yellow, and fire orange Mirror Cubes are a retro blast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
