			<description>From GTM Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The goal of One Thing, Two Thing, Red Thing, Blue Thing is to have the most Victory Points at the end of six rounds. During the game, players collect Things (in four different colors) and have the option to trade Things in for Victory Points through the course of their actions. Each round consists of players placing their Action Chits in turn and one at a time onto eight Action Boxes. After which, each player must carry out the specific action listed on that box [ex: &amp;quot;Take 1 Thing From Any Player&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Discard Up to 4 Different Things Gaining 1 Victory Point Per Thing Discarded&amp;quot;].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play One Thing, Two Thing, Red Thing, Blue Thing you will need the components listed in the lefthand box (they do not necessarily need to be the listed colors). &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
