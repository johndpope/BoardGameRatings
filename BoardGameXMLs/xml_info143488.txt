							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wer weiß ... 25 bunte Fragen?</name>
									
			<description>Inter-war trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains 25 tiles, each with a subject on them (e.g. Fluss (River), Dichter (Poet) and so on). There are also 17 circular counters, each with a different letter on them. The idea is to name a subject beginning with a certain letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game master sets the 25 subject tiles face down in front of him, and the 17 letters should be placed in a bag. Now he turns the top tile over. Then he draws out the first letter counter. Now, the players call out possible answers (Example Subject could be Country and the counter might by R. Correct answer could be Romania). Who answers first gets the question tile. The letter tile is however is placed back in the bag so that it might re-occur in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a tile and counter is not answered by anyone, then the tile is pushed under the stack and will be later revealed to ask that subject again but hopefully with a different initial letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who finally has the most tiles when the tiles run out, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
