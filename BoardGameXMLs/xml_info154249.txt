							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WWII: The Struggle for Asia</name>
									
			<description>WWII: The Struggle for Asia simulates the Second World War at a strategic level. It features seasonal turns and a unique combat featuring historical leaders, initiative, the movement of reserves, and alternating movement rather than more the predictable &amp;quot;you move / I move&amp;quot; system. Geographic influences on play includes mountainous, forested, wooded, rough and arid terrain, major rivers; amphibious assaults, air transport, supply, rail movement and more. This game is designed for players who would like to buy their own miniatures, paint and mount them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a beautiful 4&amp;rsquo;x6&amp;rsquo; rolled-up map board of the Asia &amp;amp; Pacific Theatre &amp;ndash; from Aleutians to Ceylon and from Novosibirsk to Fiji; as well as files for all of the necessary charts, unit counters and rulebook on a disk. Players will need to print and mount the counters which have all been sized to accommodate miniatures which players can purchase and paint to their taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WWII: The Struggle for Asia can be played by 2-5 players, but is ideal as a 4 player game (2 Allied and 2 Japanese players). Tabletop space is recommended to be at least 4&amp;rsquo;x8&amp;rsquo; to accommodate the map as well as the battleboards and country charts needed to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
