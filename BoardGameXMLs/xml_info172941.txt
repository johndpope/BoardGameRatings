			<description>War can be profitable.  Five medieval factions are at war.  It's your job to keep them supplied.   Visit the Medieval underground and acquire weapon contracts.  Use your wagons, actions and gold wisely.  Be quick to finish the contracts before your enemies do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The medieval underground contain contracts of items to purchase.  These contracts will contain 3, 4 or 5 items.  There are 10 different weapons to shop for.  Your playing hand starts with five items that you need to match to the contracts in the dungeon market.  Don't worry if you are missing an item, you can always trade in the market if the item is available.  Purchase new wagons to hold more items to complete more contracts.  Watch out for the events that will destroy the market and steal your weapons!  Plan your 2 actions per turn well and you will profit from war!  End of game bonuses await you if you are clever enough to sell to the same faction or to all of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game works very well with 1, 2, 3 or 4 players.  A 2 player game is about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
