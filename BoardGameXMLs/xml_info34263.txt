			<description>This is a small &amp;quot;envelope&amp;quot; game, that is obviously tongue-in-cheek.  According to the back cover, the game is &amp;quot;a fun and exciting game for 2 players as the U.S. tries to capture Gen. Manuel Noriega, infamous drug dealer and dictator.  Heck, even George is here to help!&amp;quot;  This begs two questions.  Which George (probably the first) and, can't we just go to a prison in Florida?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
