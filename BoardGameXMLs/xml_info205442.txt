			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is for use with the Krendel game system. The setting is magical steampunk. It tosses in a lot of flavors so you can sample them all. This lets it work as a fun introductory scenario, and five unique characters are supplied to that end. The set up lets you familiarize yourself with a variety of different traits, skills, powers, equipment, and possibilities, often highlighting the uses of certain abilities or items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As provided here, this scenario is fairly linear, but this does not mean that you can&amp;rsquo;t change it up. You may have different thoughts of how to do things, and players have a tendency to surprise you with their ideas. That&amp;rsquo;s OK! Change as little or as much as desired or needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as a ZIP archive including the 16-page PDF adventure document and five separate PDF pregenerated character documents (ranging from 3 to 5 pages each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
