			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Yankee is a tabletop miniatures wargame that is set in a fictional World War III in 1985 based on the novel of the same name by Harold Coyle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a standard two player miniature wargame with each player taking command of a company or battalion level force consisting of hand painted miniatures. The game provides one 6 different missions for the purpose of pickup games. There are also several scenarios in the book that allow the players to recreate some of the battles from the Team Yankee novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has an accompanying line of 15mm scale miniatures to use but it can be played with models from any manufacture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Thunder introduces new Soviet vehicles. First and foremost is the T-64 tank. The T-64 is a more sophisticated tank than the T-72. It comes with its own optional anti-tank guided missile that is fired through its 125mm 2A46 smooth-bore gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Thunder also introduces the BTR-60 mounted Motor Rifle Battalion and Companies. The BTR-60 is an 8-wheeled armoured personnel carrier mounting 14.5mm and 7.62mm machine-guns in its small turret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Thunder is also packed full of other stuff. There are three Scenarios that can either be played as one off games or as part of a three game campaign. The book also covers the exploits of the 2nd Guards Tank Army, 94th Guards Motor Rifle Division and Major Yuri Volkov&amp;rsquo;s Tank Battalion during World War III, plus lots of other background and technical information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
