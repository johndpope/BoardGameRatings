							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Humps &amp; Horns Rodeo Board Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple roll and move game in which players travel around the board paying to enter in bull riding events in different cities. Dice are rolled to determine how long players were able to stay on the bull and money is awarded in increasing amounts depending on the length of their time. If anything lower than 7 is rolled a Hung and Dragged or Bucked Off card is drawn with various penalties against the victim. Play continues until only one player has money left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
