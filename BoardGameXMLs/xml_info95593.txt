							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Simulacrum Roleplaying Game: The Mines of Moria</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been Thirty years since the crowning of King Ellesar of Gondor. Thirty years since the destruction of the One Ring and the defeat of Sauron. Thirty years since the death of the Balrog at the hands of Gandalf the Grey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas, son of Thranduil, with the blessing of King Ellesar have returned to Moria. This time, with an army...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes of the War of the Ring seek a stout force to help retake the Dwarven city of Kazad-dum. The call of such renowned men has been heard and answered by the people of Middle Earth. An army marches to Dimrill Dale. The thought of Dwarven treasure beckons to some, the thought of revenge to others. Adventure and glory await. But so does death. Which will be found in these dark caverns?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The army storms the Eastern Gate, meeting heavy resistance from the orcs and goblins inside. As stalwart friends and companions push westward, many fall to orcish scimitars and goblin arrows. How many good Men, Dwarves and Elves will die to retake these dark passageways? How long will hope last?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last, after many days of battle, the broken Bridge of Khazad-Dum appears. The army must stop and set up camp at the edge of the fathomless Chasm. Here, the Dwarves reveal their secret weapon. It is a steel bridge to span the depths, but it must be assembled piece-by-piece. The Elves and Men are left to stand guard against goblin archers and raiding assaults by orcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The darkness and unending tension take their toll. Even the bravest soldier is at risk of going mad from fear. The only distraction, the only tenuous hold on sanity, takes the form of patrolling the black caverns. The orcs must be kept away. The army must be protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fantasy RPG created by Tim Morgan and debuted in Sabledrake Magazine (Issue 22 - May 2003).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
