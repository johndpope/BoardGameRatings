							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DRAG (1977)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRAG allows the user to design his own dragster and then race it against a dragster designed by another player or the computer.  you must specify the horsepower, rear end ratio, tire width, and tire diameter.  There are no limits to these parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aha! you say.  &amp;quot;I'll just design a two million horsepower dragster!&amp;quot; But it doesn't work that way, because your mass is related to your engine size, and so you usually end up with a top speed of something like 33 MPH.  The computer is extremely hard to beat, but it's rumored that it can be done.  Note: on some systems the amount of time between printouts can be aggravatingly long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Language: BASIC (HP 2000C)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRAG was published as type-in source code in Creative Computing, Vol. 3, No. 1, January/February 1977.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
