							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TUGS: The Universal Game System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TUGS: The Universal Game System rules were published as free online HTML and also as a downloadable ZIP archive containing six ASCII text files.  Although the system was presented as a generic, universal system it was implemented in the science fiction genre only (planned fantasy expansions were never completed).  The system primarily is a conglomeration of discreet rules components from several commercial systems which are credited in the introductory materials.  Most of the game's innovations are found in the &amp;quot;Hardcore&amp;quot; combat rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
