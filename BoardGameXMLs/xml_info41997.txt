			<description>The High Druid is a political game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  Players take turns either committing a vote (a disc) to one of the seven colleges, or permanently shifting the border between two colleges by one seat.  Once everyone has passed, dropping out of the game, the player with plurality in each college wins all the valid votes therein.  Tied players in a college cancel each other, so in a three-player game, a 50-50 split would give the college to the third player, even if she had no votes there.  Additionally, each player has a secret color to which they can play invalid votes, which will be removed before tabulation of the college.  This also means that those votes are not awarded to the winner of that college.  Finally, each player has a secret &amp;quot;fetish stone&amp;quot; in the inner ring.  If you win the college containing your fetish stone, you win two bonus votes.  The player with the plurality in final votes wins - respecting the same unforgiving rule for ties as is used for the colleges!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Druid is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
