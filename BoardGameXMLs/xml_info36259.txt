Each figure represents a single Ship (unit). Victory: You win if you Destroy the opposing Flagship.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seventeen different fleets that the players may choose from. The fleets have between three and eight ships, each of which is rated for hits, class, and special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid.
