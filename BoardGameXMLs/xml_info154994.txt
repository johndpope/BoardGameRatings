			<description>The players move their cars according to their dice rolls on the road from the start near Vienna to Schwechat. When they arrive in a city, the players have to answer a question about this city. For the right answer they get a game coin. The Player who gets the most coins wins the game. The first player to reach Schwechat gets the 3rd place, if he hasn't enough coins to get the 1st or 2nd place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in the 1950s or 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
