			<description>Adventuring on the World of Mper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ross is in his room and hears some voices. Lighting a candle he sees no one in the room, his new hat is however in the middle of the floor. He retrieves it and lays down with it over his face. When he wakes up later the hat is back in the middle of the floor. Even when he ties the hat to his head the hat is back in the middle of the floor after he goes to sleep. He takes the hat over to Estryellia (in the next room) to see if she can detect magic on it. &amp;ldquo;No, there&amp;rsquo;s no magic on the hat&amp;rdquo; she confirms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set on the world of Mper, this item provides an adventure narrative (much like a session report), with game element presentation.  Some of the content is advertising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
