			<description>The object of the game is to be the player whose dragon collects the most magical ring using the tail-pulling mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you begin, you and your friend(s) race to hook rings on to your dragon's tongue, pull its tail so that its neck bends back and drops the ring into the ring container and repeat. You can also use your dragon to try and knock rings off the tongues of opponent dragons. Once all the rings are gone, count them up. Whoever has the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because there are three different colors of rings you can easily institute variants where certain color rings are worth more than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
