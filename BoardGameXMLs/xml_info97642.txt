			<description>Publisher's Promotional Flyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can finally have UNLIMITED LEVELS for Wolfenstein 3-D!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apogee has three Wolfenstein Super Upgrades that are designed to increase the play value of your original Wolfenstein 3-D game. All three are easy-to-use and add tremendously to the level of excitement and enjoyment you can get from your original purchase of Wolfenstein 3-D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade #1 - WolfMaster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get 815 NEW Wolfenstein levels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apogee has hand-picked the best 815 of these levels from third-party level designers. Imagine: 815 uniquely designed--and often bizarre--levels, full of action, danger, traps, enemies, secrets, and bonuses. Can you see yourself playing these new levels, trying to survive through all the mystery and excitement? It might take you months--or longer--to play through all of these new levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new levels are not just rehashed editions of the original 60 Wolfenstein levels--we wouldn't do that to you. These new levels are utterly unique and inventive. In fact, they take advantage of features and special tricks that were never used in the original Wolfenstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade #2 - Wolf Creator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can custom create an unlimited number of new levels!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apogee has enlisted the help of programmer Alan Hemphill, who has created an incredible program that actually generates challenging levels for Wolfenstein, at the touch of a button!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is called Wolf Creator. You simply type &amp;quot;wolfgame&amp;quot;, and you get a menu with several easy choices. If you simply want a standard-style game, you hit a button and within one minute you have 60 new levels! Or, if you want a little more control, you can use the &amp;quot;customize&amp;quot; option and adjust everything to be exactly how you want it. For example, you can have a game without bosses, but packed full of regular guards. Or you can have levels with a dozen killer bosses, ammo everywhere, and health kits, too. With the &amp;quot;customize&amp;quot; option, you are in control of each game you create.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade #2 - MapEdit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can design your own devious levels from scratch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, so you can generate unlimited custom levels using Wolf Creator, but what if you want to design every detail of the levels to play yourself or give to friends? Do you think you can make better levels than in the original Wolfenstein?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's only one program that gives you absolute control to create your own levels exactly the way you want them. It's called MapEdit. It's a full-blown level editor that lets you design levels from scratch, building your own rooms and mazes, and placing guards, traps, bonuses, and secret rooms anywhere you want them. You really get to be a game designer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
