			<description>Undertome is a horror themed strategy card game comprised of 100 unique cards which players draw from a single deck (The Tome). Each card has a different effect which players must carefully choose to play during their turn because once a spell has been cast, the page is burned in the ashes never to be used again (or is it?). Players have a limited amount of Courage which they must guard as once you lose it, you are filled with overwhelming dread taking you out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
