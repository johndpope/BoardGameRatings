			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloodied ziggurats. Immortal beasts. AI gods. Sleeping colossi. Gene cults. Plague bogs. Jungle demons. Fledgling societies cling to life in a time of chaos. Salvation is buried in Hell&amp;rsquo;s corridors, and the barons of Heaven watch the world&amp;rsquo;s woe with silent indifference. Welcome to Enoch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A millennium ago, the world ended. Civilization was devoured by plague and fire. Mankind faced extinction. The handful who survived were scattered to the wilderness. They scoured the Earth for the Promised Land: a place untouched by the Fall of Man. They searched for ages but found only Man&amp;rsquo;s ruin and Nature&amp;rsquo;s malice. Finally, their journey stopped where it began. Old and weary, they waited for death. &amp;ldquo;There is no Promised Land,&amp;rdquo; they told their children, the tribes of Enoch. &amp;ldquo;So you must build one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enoch is the story of man starting over in a world that has not forgot his sins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the absence of civilization, nature has flourished to prehistoric levels. Rising ocean and creeping jungle have buried the ruins of ancient cities. Millennia of technological progress have been swept away, leaving man to fend for himself against ravenous beasts and waves of plague that spill into his settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all that was buried is dead. The underworld bustles with electric life, thrall to a pantheon of machine gods. Demons, the ancient slaves of man, toil leagues underground. Driven mad by failing power and frayed circuit, they claw their way to the surface, to the peril of their old masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fear and oppression shackle man. Living hopeless lives with one-dimensional needs, the masses cling to authority and religion. They will happily, even greedily serve as enforcers of a brutal regime, or as acolytes of a twisted cult, so long as they are promised a better life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Enoch&amp;rsquo;s natural order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As rebels, you and other mortal men and women have chosen to defy Enoch&amp;rsquo;s natural order. You battle so that the new world won&amp;rsquo;t share the fate of the old. Your trials will be legendary. You will deliver man from bandit hordes, despots, demons, and monstrous freaks of nature. However, your most troubling foe will always be yourself. The new world will be built on your deeds. Should you find yourself compelled by greed, power, or vengeance, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly see your own actions reflected in the world around you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
