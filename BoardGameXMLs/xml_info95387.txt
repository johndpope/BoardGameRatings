			<description>From the Game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insanity Fight, as the title suggests, is a game of mad and mindless shooting and destruction. Once the game is underway, your space ship is constantly under attack from aliens which snake around the screen very smoothly. Aliens and various background structures can be shot for points, but some parts of the background must be avoided, which can be tricky at high speed. Every now and again, a massive spaceship comes down the screen with its cannons blasting. It's safer to dodge it, but shooting it results in a colossal explosion. With excellent atmospheric effects and smooth movements, Insanity Fight is a must for all &amp;quot;shoot'em down&amp;quot; lovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
