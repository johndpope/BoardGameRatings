							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Young Gods of Old Egypt</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is set in ancient Egypt. Not the Egypt that you might know, the one that really was, but Mythical Egypt, the one that never was, but still exists in the imagination. This is the lost age before recorded history, the golden age of pyramids and sand when the gods were young and which of them would be remembered was not yet set. You may have heard of Anubis, Horus, Bast or Set, but this is before their glory earned them a place in history's books. Maybe this time it will be your name that is remembered and theirs that is forgotten; because this is the time of the Young Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
