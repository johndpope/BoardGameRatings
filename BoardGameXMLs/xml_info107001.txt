							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Madden NFL 12</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madden NFL 12 is the 2011 release of the venerable American Football series that allows you to call the plays and execute them through the roles of quarterback, receivers, and running backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule changes for the 2011-2012 NFL season -- such as 35 yard line kick-offs and delayed return of players due to possible concussions -- are reflected in game play as well as increased penalties for helmet-to-helmet contact.  Also, at long last, an on-side kick can be made from a regular kick formation, so that the opponent can be caught off guard. Of lesser strategic interest are the graphics of cheerleaders and mascots, as well as detailed graphics for quarterback throws.  That's right, now you can feel the awkwardness of that Philip Rivers heave into coverage.  For longer game series under the franchise mode, there are many changes, the most important being free agent signings, draft pick trades, and injured reserve replacements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
