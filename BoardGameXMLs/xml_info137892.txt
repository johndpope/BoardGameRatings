			<description>Soccer Card Game is a two player card game, each player will have his players with their own abilities in a representative 52 card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will have to manage their hand, and place the players in the field, according with the ability of each player so they can move the ball toward the goal. But...the defensive player will have to work on making it hard for the attacker... One way or another the ball will move!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finish your deck to end the first half, go for a second round for a full game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick to learn, easy to play, a fast and blast of a game! ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- V3 --&lt;br/&gt;A WHAT CAN BE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this V3 of Soccer Flow, i added Tactic Cards, that allow coaches to choose the starting tactic and add some special cards to the team deck.&lt;br/&gt;I also add the Special cards, that allow the game to be more unpredictable as a soccer game should be!&lt;br/&gt;Now each player, will have a different number depending on each position they will play, allowing the teams to be more competitive, and each coach has to choose wisely the players for the team deck!&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have a combination of 0 to 3 special abilities, and a star number that indicates the max. number of cards of that player that can be in the team deck.&lt;br/&gt;So coachs will have to choose 10 players +1 Goalkeeper, and the sum of the star numbers of each team will difer, as so the number of actions each team can do in the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In real soccer, my team is always best than any other!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
