			<description>Extrapolated from Game Cabinet translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components&lt;br/&gt;3 Game mats &lt;br/&gt;55 Cards of the following types: &lt;br/&gt;7 &amp;quot;Scoring Rule (Wertung-Regel)&amp;quot; cards &lt;br/&gt;5 &amp;quot;Prediction Rule (Prognose-Regel)&amp;quot; cards &lt;br/&gt;16 &amp;quot;Correction Rule (Korrektur-Regel)&amp;quot; cards &lt;br/&gt;10 &amp;quot;Voting Rule (Abstimm-Regel)&amp;quot; cards &lt;br/&gt;10 &amp;quot;Incident Rule (Eregnis-Regel)&amp;quot; cards &lt;br/&gt;7 Place cards&lt;br/&gt;20 Voting tiles with yes/no (Ja/Nein) stickers &lt;br/&gt;80 Chips (20 each in 4 colors) &lt;br/&gt;1 Scorepad &lt;br/&gt;1 Rule book&lt;br/&gt; The three game mats are placed in the middle of the table. They should be arranged so that every player can easily read the writing on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chips&lt;br/&gt;The chips are also placed in the middle of the table and they form the pool. The pool should be easily reachable for every player. For 4 or 5 players use all the chips, for 3 players only use 15 of each color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voting tiles&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 4 voting tiles.&lt;br/&gt;Only one Correction Rule for a given chip color can be in play at a time since they are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if two Correction Rules which contradict each other are revealed during set up replace the second with a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining &amp;quot;Correction Rule&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Voting Rule&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Incident Rule&amp;quot; cards are shuffled together and dealt to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of cards per player:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 players = 6 cards &lt;br/&gt;4 players = 7 cards &lt;br/&gt;3 players = 9 cards&lt;br/&gt;The remaining cards are placed on the (Discarded cards) space of the game mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pencil and Paper&lt;br/&gt;Each player will also need a pencil and a piece of paper. On the paper each player lists his prediction for the first Prediction Round. (i.e. he lists the place that he thinks he will occupy in the standings after the Scoring Round has been completed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player now takes 7 chips of any combination of colors from the pool. The other players also get 7 chips each according to their seating (not the place cards). The starting player now starts the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mats and all chips are put into the middle (3 players: 15 chips per color).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are laid out: 2 Correction Rule, 2 Voting Rule, and 2 Incident Rule. The first Scoring Rule is Single + Bonus, the first Prediction Rule is Own place = 15 Punkte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 4 voting tiles + 7 chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Correction, Voting, and Incident Rule cards are shuffled together and dealt: 5 players = 6 cards, 4 players = 7 cards, 3 players = 9 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone gets pencils and paper and writes down their first prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Course&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 5 rounds. Each round is divided into 3 parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move Round(s) &lt;br/&gt;Scoring Round &lt;br/&gt;Prediction Round&lt;br/&gt;In each round players can score points. The player with the most points at the end of the fifth round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
