			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows &amp;amp; Shapes is an ultra-lightweight fantasy RPG. The rules are only a few pages long, and suited for one-shot games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All conflicts in Shadows &amp;amp; Shapes are resolved with playing cards. The combat mechanics are based around a trick-taking card game, so if you've ever played Bridge, Hearts, or Oh Hell, you'll have no trouble picking up Shadows &amp;amp; Shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system has an unusual feel, since the players' decisions are highly constrained. Although strategy is important, there is often a single optimum strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration is at the heart of Shadows &amp;amp; Shapes. If you set a foot wrong, it might be somebody else who pays the price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
