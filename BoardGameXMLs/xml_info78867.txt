			<description>From the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Russia, November 1942:  After five months of German advances on Stalingrad and the oil fields of the Caucasus, the German army has settled in for a bitter winter on the Russian steppes, with their Rumanian, Italian, and Croatian allies to bolster their flanks.  But the Red Army has other plans.  Stalin, having pulled reserves from every front and military district in the Soviet Union, is about to hand Hitler his first major defeat.&lt;br/&gt;Following quickly on the success of Operation Crusader, comes Stalingrad, Volume II of the award-winning World At War series, from Avalon Hill and Atomic Games.&lt;br/&gt;Stalingrad lets you play against the computer or a live opponent - either locally or by electronic mail.  Assume command of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants to pound the Fascist invaders with your massed artillery.  Or, take control of the fast and fluid panzer divisions of the German Wehrmacht to save your outnumbered forces from frozen defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stalingrad is packed with high resolution sound and stunning graphics (the terrain even changes as the weather changes).  Documentation includes a detailed, full-color manual and a large battlefield map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
