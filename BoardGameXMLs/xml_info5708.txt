							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planet of the Apes</name>
									
			<description>The game is based upon the movie Planet of the Apes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is trap all of your opponents in a cage in the center of the board.  On each turn, you roll two dice and move yourself with one and an opponent with the other. If you land on a space that matches your pawn's color, that pawn is considered safe and cannot be moved by an opponent. If an opponent moves one of your pawns to a &amp;quot;Captured&amp;quot; space your pawn is placed on top of the cage and the trigger knob is spun and pressed. If the top of the cage opens, your pawn falls into the cage and is out of the game. If the cage remains closed, your pawn may be rescued if you can move one of your pawns to a &amp;quot;Captured&amp;quot; space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
