							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D20 Fantasy Weapon Cards</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of having to remember how much damage a Sai does to a Medium sized creature? Tired of have to remember the critical modifier is on a Spiked Chain? Tired of having to remember if a Javelin is a Simple Weapon (Ranged) or a Martial Weapon (Ranged)? Now you don't have to. With D20 Fantasy Weapon Cards you have all the statistics for all the SRD weapon right there at your finger tips. And best of all you can print them out and cut them up and only use the ones you need, without flipping back and forth through a lit of books. Also included with this PDF are blank Weapon Pages so you can key in you own new weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
