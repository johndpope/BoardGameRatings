			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the colonization of Morden, Hebron and Hyphrates shared an enmity. In part, this was because of their nearness and competition for many resources. Their cultural differences, however, served to intensify the division as well. Hebronites are generally far more devoted to family, while Hyphratians tend to embrace personal goals. These differences often triggered misunderstandings and hostilities between the two cultures, leading to an endless series of conflicts. Much of this was swept aside in the face of the Grand Coven, when all the nations of Morden cooperated under the banner of the Armies of Light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sand and Stone provides additional information about the nations of Hebron and Hyphrates within Accursed's setting of Morden. It includes a broad range of different adventure hooks for GMs and players looking to explore these specific regions. It also introduces three new banes as well as Hindrances and Edges specific to these cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accursed provides additional details about the setting used in this scenario, and is required to fully make use of the game mechanics presented. Savage Worlds and the Savage Worlds Horror Companion are also required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF uses layers for ease of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
