			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battling a conspiracy to destroy the future empress before she can realize her imperial destiny, you have overcome all who stood in your way. As you set out to cross the endless cold lands at the top of the world, however, your enemies are not so quick to forgive or forget the dead left in your wake. A mother&amp;rsquo;s love is undying, but so too is her hate. In her eyes, you are murderers, and she will gather dark sisters from far abroad to draw you into a mystic nightmare from which there will be no escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure for characters of 6th to 7th level supplements the epic journey through the northern wilds of the Far East Adventure Path campaign. It allows GMs to show the dynamic nature of the campaign world as forces they thought defeated turn out to have allies that do not take the defeat of their kin lightly. While easiest to include as part of the journey through the mountains of the subpolar north as their caravan approaches the arctic, scaling notes suggest methods for leveling up the adventure for use after the arctic crossing as the PCs&amp;rsquo; caravan descends into the Eastern Realms. Apart from an Adventure Path, this adventure can be easily dropped into any campaign to infuse it with an air of malevolent witchery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Matt Goodall with the Legendary Games Design Team of Jason Nelson, Neil Spicer, Clinton Boomer, Greg A. Vaughan, Russ Taylor, Jim Groves, and Clark Peterson. Amazing art by Jason Juta and magnificent maps by Rob Lazzaretti. Who better to provide you with supplemental adventure material for your Adventure Path campaign than the very writers of those adventures themselves? Answer: no one. Legendary Games' Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail. Legendary Games combines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this 25-page adventure and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
