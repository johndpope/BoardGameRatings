			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEEP TROUBLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before science, before history, an era of magic existed in our world&amp;rsquo;s dim past. Magic flowed freely, touching every aspect of the lives of men and women of the Name-giver races. It was an age of heroes, an age of fantastical deeds and mythical stories. In this Age of Legend, bold heroes from all across Barsaive band together&amp;mdash;ready to fight for life and freedom against the remaining Horrors and the oppressive Theran Empire, which seeks to bend the rebellious province again to their yoke. Through noble deeds and sacrifice, the heroes of the world forge Barsaive&amp;rsquo;s future, arming themselves for their daunting task with powerful magical spells and treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthdawn is a roleplaying game set in a world of high adventure, high magic, and terrible danger. Shards are a series of unrelated adventures and encounters for the Earthdawn game, intended as an inexpensive resource for Earthdawn gamemasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackout is designed for three to five Journeymen adepts of any Discipline. In this adventure, the characters travel to the tunnels and caverns far beneath the Inner City of Hustane, investigating a rumor about a potential threat to the kingdom of Throal. What they find in the darkness, however, is far more serious than anyone had expected...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackout is a revised version of the First Edition Earthdawn adventure Deep Trouble, originally published in the Throal Adventures supplement. Requires use of the Earthdawn Player's and Gamemaster's Compendiums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
