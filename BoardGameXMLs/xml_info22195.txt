			<description>Seems to be a variation of Yahtzee, themed for the track &amp;amp; field event--the Decathlon.  Each player rolls four blue dice and two red dice five times in succession, locking in only 1 red die and any number of blue dice each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blue dice constitute the event (e.g. if you can get three 1s out of your 4 blue dice, you have qualified for the first event, the 100-meter run; if you can get two 3s and two 4s out of your 4 blue dice, you have qualified for the 8th event, the pole vault).  Fail to qualify for one of the first 9 events (not matching one of the necessary patterns with the blue dice) and you can use your rolls as one leg of the 10th event, the 1500-meter run.  In essence, these are free failure rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The red dice, summed together, are your score for the particular event.  So, if you lock in three 1s and any other blue die, after four rolls, you have rolled all 5 red dice.  If your red dice are 6, 5, 5, 3, and 4 then you score 23 for the 100-meter dash.  Any event with a score of less than 15 means you aren't Olympic caliber, so you don't even get to peg your score on the board...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of which, that's the &amp;quot;peg&amp;quot; part of the name.  There is a cribbage-like board where players peg their event tallies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
