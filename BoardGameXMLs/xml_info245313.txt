			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This modern list describes 100 base items, with some possible variations, that could be found by players looting a modern school physics lab, whether following a zombie apocalypse or for some other reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items covered are those used in teaching physics. Some are potentially useful, others are potentially dangerous, and some are simply clutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some sample results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;47. Magnets (Magnets of different shapes, such as ring, bar, horseshoe and spherical, different  sizes and different materials, such as iron, steel, neodymium and ceramic)&lt;br/&gt;48. Mass &amp;amp; Hangers (A hooked metal hanger on which dish shaped masses of known weight can be attached, usually in such as 100g divisions, made from such as cast iron and brass)&lt;br/&gt;49. Materials Kit (A collection of rectangular blocks made from different substances, including woods, polystyrene, paraffin wax, iron, aluminium, Perspex and glass, for comparing different material types)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
