			<description>Stop an encroaching army of heroes from taking your plundered riches in 'Cursed Treasure - Don't Touch My Gems'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've pillaged and plundered to build a mass of wealth but now a bunch of heroic do-gooders are intent on taking it and restoring piece to their land. As an evil lord, you are in no mood for their trifling and need to put a stop to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build dens, crypts and temples to prevent them from carrying off with your gems in 15 action levels. Place them strategically to mow down the invaders with their firing turrets. Use earned money to upgrade your towers and place them on Mana spots to earn even more powerful attacks. Stop them from taking your treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
