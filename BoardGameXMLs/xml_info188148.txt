							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sundered Epochs: Generations (4th Edition, Book 1 - Core Rules)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This manual presents the Sundered Epoch Generations (SEG) game system and contains all of the basic rules necessary to play the Sundered Epoch Role-playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the sole purpose of this staff to create a realistic, universal game platform that was fun, versatile, and easy. So it has become the SEG game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years the Sundered Epoch rules have faced several changes with over ten years of play testing, tweaking, consolidating, and even more testing just for the purpose of making it as close to perfect as humanly possible. What lies within these pages is a unique game engine that is both flexible and scalable and will allow you to add more details as your group wants. It is a careful balance between cinematic role-play and simulation allowing you to decide just how realistic you want your game to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
