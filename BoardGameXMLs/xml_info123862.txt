			<description>The King is dead! And your eyes are set on the throne. To be victorious in the coming succession struggle, you must spread your influence across the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;Every space you capture brings you one step closer to the crown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fealty is a game of positioning and territory control. Each turn, all players add one piece to the game board, with increasing constraints on placement as time goes on. Some pieces have an effect when brought into play. At the end of the game, all pieces place influence in order of speed, claiming territory and blocking slower opposing pieces. The player who has maneuvered their pieces to place the most influence onto the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iPhone/iPad edition for 1-4 players features options for AI opponents with a choice of two difficulty levels, local hotseat play and async online play through Game Center.   The app highlights possible piece placement, and displays influence and score with each piece as you try different placement options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
