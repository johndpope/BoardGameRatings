			<description>Man at War is a trivia game where players (or teams) move their pieces through 5 layers of the Pentagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each trivia card has 5 categories of questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Commanders&lt;br/&gt;2. Troops, Units and Installations&lt;br/&gt;3. Battles and Campaigns&lt;br/&gt;4. Traditions, Uniforms, Decorations and Insignia&lt;br/&gt;5. Weapons Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the outer layer of the Pentagon, players are required to answer 1 question to continue their turn. Each layer that players move towards the center of the Pentagon requires the players to answer an additional question to continue play, until the center of the Pentagon is reached where players are required to answer all 5 questions on a trivia card. If all 5 questions are answered correctly, the player received the rank of General of the Army. If any question is incorrectly answered the player must return to the start of the game and begin again or &amp;quot;gracefully resign&amp;quot; out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
