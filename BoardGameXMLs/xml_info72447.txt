							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Critical Decisions</name>
									
			<description>From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a gambling game for people who like to think and make decisions, or who like to discover how other people think and make decisions. The objective of the game is to acquire a greater dollar value of poker chips than any of the other Players. The game ends when either 1) the Bank is broken, or 2) an agreed upon time limit expires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 different Versions of Critical Decisions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) The first, Version A, can be played by 2 or more people. It relies on extensive consumer research, and gives Players a good idea of how specific groups of Americans react to Critical Decisions. This is the informational Version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B)The second Version, Version B, can also be played by 2 or more Players. It asks particular players how they would react to Critical Decisions. It provides a friendly opportunity to explore the philosophies of your friends and acquaintances. This Version is played best with people who already know each other, or who want to know each other better. It's the personal Version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) The third Version, Version C, is complicated analysis of group reactions. It should only be played by odd numbers of people. For those seeking just a little relaxation and interaction, it's a headache. For the hardcore cerebral types, it presents an unusual challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
