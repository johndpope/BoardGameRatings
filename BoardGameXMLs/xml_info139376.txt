			<description>Place the 22 picnic cards. Each player in turn spins and moves his (or her) playing piece the number of spaces spun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on hot dog, he draws a picnic card and places it, color side up, in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a skunk, he must go back two spaces unless he has a picnic card. He discards one or more picnic cards to the bottom of the card pile and move forward one space for each card discarded. He may discard as many cards as he chooses. HINT: It may be a good idea to save some picnic cards for another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach Finish. A player does not need to spin the exact number to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
