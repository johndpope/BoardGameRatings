							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fantastic Four Compendium</name>
									
			<description>Over 25 years ago, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby gave us the FANTASTIC FOUR, and comic book history was forever changed! Through the years, we have been introduced to the uncanny INHUMANS, the wondrous inhabitants of ATLANTIS, the hunger of GALACTUS, and the awesome powers of HERBIE, all in the pages of the Fantastic Four!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you'll meet all the heroes who have at one time or another been members of the Fantastic Four, the group's extended family, their friends, and their allies. You'll also find stats for the Fantastic Four's most hated and feared villains: DR. DOOM (both of them!), the PUPPET MASTER, the members of the FRIGHTFUL FOUR, and many others. Details are provided for the old Baxter Building and the new Four Freedoms Plaza, for such locales as Project: PEGASUS, ILIAKANDA, and HANDAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Fantastic Four's first battles with GORMUU and the MOLE MAN to their latest adventures, you can find everything you need to play the Greatest Superhero Team Ever between these covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
