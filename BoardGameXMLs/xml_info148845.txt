			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Brief provides a small selection of new, revised, or expanded creatures to be pitted against your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this product you will find the dark elves, beings exiled from the surface long ago for some forgotten transgression (or not-so-forgotten, depending upon your game), dark elves have ruled over their own matriarchal, wealthy civilizations in the depths of the Underearth for millennia. They are cruel, sadistic, and operate within a highly formalized caste system that makes extensive use of slaves, worship god-like demons of unspeakable, and has carved kingdoms of vast territories out of the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold the cursed arachni, half dark elf, half giant spider, and all rage and vengeance. From amongst dark elf society are the twisted painlords, torture masters and deadly combatants, the warlocks who have mastery over arcane magic but must still act subservient to the priestesses who rule dark elf society, yet even the latter must answer to the formidable high priestesses. And what of the Deepstalker Cult, a mysterious group of fanatics who somehow fulfill their secret agenda by hiring themselves out to other dark elves as assassins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
