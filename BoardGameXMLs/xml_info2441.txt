			<description>BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bones is a two player strategy game in which each player tries to be the first to get 5 squares of his colour in a vertical or horizontal row.  It may seem similar to other games, but Bones has a unique aspect that makes game play very different from what you might expect!  Can you deal with the overlapping of pieces better than your opponent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 9x12 grid, with pieces that measure 1x2; each player gets a set of 18 pieces, but more can be made if necessary.  The first tile must be played so it occupies part of the middle; later tiles can be played anywhere as long as they're entirely within the playing area and as long as it does not cover up an already played tile in one move (in other words, it's OK to cover a tile completely, but this must be done in two turns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
