			<description>Includes superheroes from comic books published under the Mighty Comics imprint of MLJ/Archie (who were more successful publishing teenage humor comics featuring  Archie and friends). Many of the featured heroes are members of the Mighty Crusaders team. For some reason several of the names are slightly different from how they appear in the comics. The ten heroes featured are: The Shield, The Web, Mr. Justice, Fly Girl, Fly Man (originally called The Fly), Captain Flagg (spelled with one &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; in the comics), The Hood (The Black Hood), Mr. Fox (The Fox), Mr. Jag (The Jaguar), and Mr. Steel (Steel Sterling).  First to the middle wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
