							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gadgeteer: Mother of Invention</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invention is its own reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world brimming with wizards who learn the secrets of magic, sorcerers born with magic in their blood, and ethermancers who communicate with a cosmic blob of energy and subsequently throw bits of that blob around, it seems strange that there would be intelligent individuals who decide to work with the laws of physics rather than tell the laws of physics to sit down and shut up. Still, they exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These individuals are known as gadgeteers, imaginative engineers who prefer the hands-on nature of physical experimentation over the constantly staring at books that is arcane experimentation. Wielding custom-built weapons and a myriad of strange and amusing accessories, the primary advantage of the gadgeteer over the wizard is flexibility in creation. Though a wizard may know hundreds of spells, it takes weeks of work to make a fireball behave even slightly differently. A gadgeteer, on the other hand, can simply rewire her gadget tomorrow morning and have something new ready to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end result of over two months of development, The Gadgeteer: Mother of Invention is Interjection Games' largest product by word count to date. Skirting the line between offensive spellcaster and support character, the gadgeteer's primary innovation is the advent of a Structure Point, or SP pool. These SP are used to create custom weapons from whatever stock weapons are lying around, as well as strange and ridiculous accessories that range from duct tape to a spy cigar stocked with everything from a one-exposure camera to a parachute. In short, a character who wants better accessories must make do with inferior weapons, and vice versa. Custom weapons and accessories can be changed daily, making the feel of the class somewhat like the Incarnum of the old Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gadgeteers who invest in the Juryrigging feat become capable of creating accessories on the fly, much like a certain secret agent whose name prompts a roll on the Lawyer Random Encounter table.&lt;br/&gt;Roleplayers are not left out in the cold with the gadgeteer! The Professional Angle class feature helps to define the gadgeteer's backstory and grants a number of bonus class skills that help the class behave the way the player wants it to be played. For the mechanically-inclined, this same class feature actually defines which of the three saving throws will have good progression, giving the optimizer that much more freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Gadgeteer base class&lt;br/&gt;     Favored Class Bonuses for all common races and many featured races&lt;br/&gt;     A smattering of feats&lt;br/&gt;     58 custom weapon gadgets&lt;br/&gt;     13 accessories with a total of 97 addons, making each accessory comparable to a sorcerer bloodline or an oracle mystery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
