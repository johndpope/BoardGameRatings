							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Billygoat Mountain</name>
									
			<description>Billygoat Mountain is a light, fun &amp;quot;race to the top of the mountain game&amp;quot; for 2-6 players, and plays in around 15-20 mins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are randomly placed in a pyramid shape that forms a series of goat tracks leading to the top of a mountain.  However, not all paths head toward the top, some are rock-falls or dead-ends or lead in different directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a Billygoat, each of whom starts at the bottom of the mountain and must race their way up to the top.  The first Billygoat to reach the top is the winner.  However, as each player takes their turn, they change the paths leading to the top, to either help themselves or to hinder other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
