			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a remote planet orbiting a distant star...&lt;br/&gt;...the worst criminal scum from a dozen star systems have been dumped, charged with building new lives under the watchful eye of Authority. Within a brutal hierarchy of savagery and servility, convicts and guards alike must make hard choices. Every colonist has their own code of conduct and their own aspirations&amp;mdash;aspirations that invariably come at the expense of everyone else. This dangerous new world is too small for everyone to succeed. In fact, it may well be too small for anyone to succeed. Only the shrewdest, the toughest and the luckiest will get a chance to find out. Will you be among them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Durance is a fast-paced, low-prep, highly collaborative game in the tradition of Fiasco. Players in Durance assume the dual roles of convicts and guards trying to survive on an outrageously hostile planet. The thin veneer that separates the two classes tends to erode during play, raising questions about corruption, justice and mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
