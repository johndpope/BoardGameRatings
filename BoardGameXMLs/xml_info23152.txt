							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cottonfield Kidnapping!</name>
									
			<description>A trip to the Old South might be more your style and there's been a kidnapping at Helta Skelta Delta Plantation, in Pippy, Mississippi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date is September 27, 1861 and way down yonder in the land of cotton plans are in progress for the annual &amp;quot;Cotton Picker's Cotton Pickin Picnic&amp;quot;. The plantation is buzzing with excitement as the O'Hoara family tend to the preparations. All is going well until it is discovered that Massa Big Daddy is no where to be found!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that Big Daddy's favorite slave, Gusbo Tac, came across his beloved Massa's straw hat, treasured pipe, and blood stained monogrammed handkerchief in an empty slave cabin. Sensing foul play, Gusbo ran to the main house to inform Massa's wife (or as she is known to the slaves, &amp;quot;Miz Massa&amp;quot;) of this alarming discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back at the plantation a ransom letter is found on the mantel in the great room. It is printed in block letters and reads as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIZ MASSA, IF YOUIN EVER WANTS TO SEES YOUR MAN AGEEN PUTS $100,000 IN CASH OR GOLD IN A SACK AND GIVES IT TO AUNT MAMMY. SHE BE GETTING STRUCKSONS. DO IT, OR MASSA, HE BE DEAD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who wrote this note? Why? Will Massa be released&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..or is he, be dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come join the suspects, Massa's daughter, Scarface O'Hoara; his devoted wife, Ima O'Hoara; famous proctologist, Butt Rhetler, M.D.; and adopted son, Al A. bammy (just to name a few) and test your sleuthing abilities and try to detect just who swiped Massa&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;maybe it was you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
