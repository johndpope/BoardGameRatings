			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things have changed. We have changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth is lost to us, but even in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, we grow, evolve and even prosper. We have witnessed the death of our mother and the birth of a new era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In what might have been the end, the synthesis of biology and technology proved our salvation. Augmentation, ranging from basic genetic manipulation to Apotheosis, set us on the path of prosperity. But it also emphasized the importance of identity, individual humanity, and the purity of the species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loss of Earth and the resulting Exodus gave us a oportunity to start over with a clean slate. And we seized it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the need for organization, stability and a reliable government was clear, the old ways were seen by most as archaic, clumsy and too prone to corruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was time for a new way&amp;hellip; a Nova Praxis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, social networks allow the will of the people to be measured instantly, accurately and without the need for representation. The Coalition, guided by the collective voice of its people, has established new homes on worlds lit by new suns. Molecular assembly technology has made it possible for society to provide a quality of life never before imagined, at essentially no cost, to everyone.  And we are virtually immortal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But can this would-be Utopia last?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corruption in the Coalition government fosters decay from within. The Houses, our benefactors and patrons, run shadowy networks of intrigue, espionage and assassination. Apostates, non-citizens, condemn those who would trade their privacy for the Coalition&amp;rsquo;s false security. Remnants of Earth&amp;rsquo;s old governments wage an unrelenting guerilla war on Coalition forces. Ideological extremists commit acts of terror using the latest horror to spring from a factory or test tube&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the value of a human soul is weighed and measured in lines of code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nova Praxis is a post-singularity sci-fi setting that explores transhumanism and post-scarcity societies against a backdrop of action, adventure, conspiracy and intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nova Praxis is&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;a table-top role-playing game featuring an evolution of the award winning FATE game system utilized in Strands of Fate; streamlined and tailored specifically for Nova Praxis.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;self-contained. You do not need to own, or be familiar with, any other FATE game to play Nova Praxis.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;a relatively &amp;quot;hard sci-fi&amp;quot; setting that takes place in the aftermath of a short lived technological singularity.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;an exploration of the tropes of transhuman sci-fi. Mind uploading, resleeving, AI characters, and body augmentation.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;an exploration of the societal impact of a reputation based post-scarcity economy.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;a game in which players play characters who know how to slip between the cracks of civilization and perform the jobs their patrons would rather keep off the books.&lt;br/&gt;...a setting full of conflict. The Houses wage a secret Shadow War against each other, purist and transhuman ideologies erupt in violence, and apostates lash out against the oppression of the Coalition government.&lt;br/&gt;...home to gauss rifles, powered armor, star ships, security drones, bipedal war frames, swarms of nanomachines, kill-sats, and the horrors of accelerated evolution gone wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
