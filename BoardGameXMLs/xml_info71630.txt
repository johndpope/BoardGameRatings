			<description>User Description: Star Fox 64 (Or Lylat Wars, as it is known in some parts of the world.), is an on rails third person shooter for the Nintendo 64. The players take on the role of Fox McCloud, son of the famous hero James McCloud. After losing his father to Andross, Fox assembles a new Star Fox team, consisting of former member Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad, Falco Lambardi, and himself. When Andross once again threatens the universe, Star Fox travels across several planets, helping General Pepper and the Cornerian Army fight off the Evil Andross and his forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is level based, each level representing one planet or small sector in the galaxy (Such as Corneria or an Asteroid Field.). At the end of every level is a boss, and defeating the boss will take players to the next planet in the galaxy towards Andross's homeworld. However, by meeting certain conditions and requirements in particular levels, players can take alternate routes, leading to different planets, or an alternate ending. As the players traverse each level they destroy enemy ships, collect power-ups, and help their team members survive their own dog fights. If a team member's health reaches zero they retreat back to the Great Fox, the teams traveling Home Base, for the remainder of the current level and all of the next while they make repairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Fox 64 is a complete re-envisioning of the original Star Fox (On the Super Nintendo Entertainment System). The game has several different modes, including a four player multiplayer battle game, and a training mode for players to really get the hang of the games controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
