			<description>Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #202.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taipei is an operational level game on the hypothetical invasion of the Republic of China (known also as Taiwan) by the communist Peoples' Republic of China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game covers a wide spectrum of modern operation warfare, including rules for not only land and air warfare, but also has extensive rules covering C4I and political support for the warring sides.  Players may choose from different options, which affects the number and strength of units available to both sides, at the expense of political points.  Victory is determined on two levels, political and military, with each being given equal weightage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units protrayed are mainly divisions, with special brigades, such as airmobile units, spec-ops units and helicopter units being represented.  The game map covers the entire island of Formosa (also known as Taiwan).  Map scale is 10km per hexagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
