							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Inn of Lost Heroes</name>
									
			<description>Module Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Inn of Lost Heroes is a Labyrinth  Lord&amp;trade; adventure for 4-6 characters of 3rd  through 5th level (about 15-20 levels total). This  adventure was designed as a one-shot that can  be dropped into any existing campaign. The  party should ideally contain at least one fighter  or dwarf, one magic-user or elf, one cleric, and  one thief or halfling character. The adventure  centers around an inn that has become trapped  in the nightmares of a vengeful spirit. Escaping  the inn is the primary goal of this adventure,  however, resourceful characters may also find  the courage to free the trapped souls of former  adventurers and finally lay the spirit to rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note: Know your group! This  adventure begins by trapping the characters in  an extraplanar dream world where some of the  game mechanics they are accustomed to are  slightly altered or do not work at all. It contains  strong elements of horror as well as thematic  material that may be disturbing to some.  Common horror tropes of isolation, injury, and  &amp;ldquo;taking the toys away&amp;rdquo; are also present. This is  not an adventure that can be overcome by  combat alone. If you suspect your players would  not have fun with this type of setup, you may  want to pass on running this module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
