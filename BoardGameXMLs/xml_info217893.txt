							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mah-Jongg Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This 1923 publication was designed to transform Babcock Rules Mah-Jongg into a card game. (As the rules book notes, Mr. J. P. Babcock &amp;quot;originated the name Mah-Jongg, adapted all that was best of the Chinese forms of play, and added the Arabic numerals&amp;quot;.) The rule book credits Douglas Lawson for having &amp;quot;correlated&amp;quot; the Babcock rules with card play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 164-card deck replicates the mix of tiles in the classic game. It includes four cards for 1-9 for each of the three suits (Dots, Bamboo, Characters), as well as four each of the North, South, East and West winds and Red, Green and White Dragons, plus the 8 Flower cards. As in the classic rules, players try to collect sets or 3 or 4 of a kind or in a sequence, with bonuses for various combinations and special tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of ivory or bone scoring sticks, the card game uses thin colored wooden rods for scoring. The game includes 40 short green sticks worth 2 each, 32 medium-length yellow sticks worth 10, 36 longer red sticks worth 100, and 8 long blue sticks worth 500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the rule book focuses on the Standard and Royal games for four players, it does include variant rules for 3, 5 and 6 players. (The Babcock rules were largely superceded in North America in the 1930s by American Mah-Jongg rules.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
