			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hear ye! Hear ye! All ye Kings &amp;amp; Queens, Knights &amp;amp; Nobles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an evening of Medieval Madness planned to honor the noble marriage of Baron Bartholomew to the Lady Diana of Dunnsberry. From the notorious knights to the seedy sheriff, the conniving chambermaid to the meddling maids, all the subjects of the manor are not only invited, but ordered to be here by command of the lord. With all of the secrets in the manor, it is hard to tell who will live through the night-- for any betrayal to the lord or the king IS punishable by death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The package includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Host Guide&amp;mdash; A complete how-to of throwing your party which includes directions on preparing the invitations, assigning characters and preparing for the party.&lt;br/&gt;     A Schedule of the Night&amp;mdash; A step-by-step breakdown of how the night will go.&lt;br/&gt;     An Introduction&amp;mdash; to be read to the guests upon arrival.&lt;br/&gt;     Designed Invitations&amp;mdash; that you can customize with the details of your party.&lt;br/&gt;     Manor Announcements&amp;mdash; to be sent with the invitations, it includes background information on the happenings in the manor and the guests coming to the reunion.&lt;br/&gt;     Laws of the Land Poster&amp;mdash; a poster to be hung up at the party explaining more about medieval times and how King Kyle rules his lands.&lt;br/&gt;     21 Character Sheets&amp;mdash; full descriptions of the characters, including costuming and acting tips.&lt;br/&gt;     21 Character Objective Sheets &amp;mdash;this includes objectives for each character to try to achieve at each stage of the game in order to uncover evidence and find the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;     21 Name Tags&lt;br/&gt;     Fake Money&amp;mdash; to be distributed to guests and used in the party for scheming and bribery.&lt;br/&gt;     Evidence &amp;mdash; more clues that will be presented towards the end of the night. This evidence will help your guests solve the mystery and find the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;     Solution&amp;mdash; a detailed description of who the murderer is, why the murder happened and the clues that led to the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;ldquo;Who Dunnit&amp;rdquo; Cards&amp;mdash; to allow your guests to guess the murderer, along with vote for the most animated character and best outfit.&lt;br/&gt;     Award Certificates&amp;mdash; to be awarded to the best costume, the most theatrical guest, the player with the most money at the end of the night and to each of the guests that solve the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THREE SEPARATE VERSIONS FORMATTED FOR UP TO 80 GUESTS!&lt;br/&gt;10-15 GUESTS -- 15-21 GUESTS -- 20-80 GUESTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nightofmystery.com/A_Knight_of_Murder.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nightofmystery.com/A_Knight_of_Murder.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
