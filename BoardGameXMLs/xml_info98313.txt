			<description>What it is: A game centered around Viennese dialect. Unplayable if you are not familiar with the German language in general and Viennese dialect in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: Bribing the attendant of the &amp;quot;G&amp;auml;nseh&amp;auml;ufel&amp;quot; (a forested sand island in the Danube with a large open-air bath) into giving you the last of the almost-sold-out lockers. The player who is first to successfully bribe the attendant wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played: To bribe the attendant, one needs to collect three &amp;quot;Wirtshauskarten&amp;quot; (inn/restaurant cards). These are gained by moving one's player token to the &amp;quot;Wirtshausfelder&amp;quot; (inn/restaurant spaces) on the board. When a player lands on a &amp;quot;Wirtshausfeld&amp;quot;, he has to interpret a &amp;quot;Wuchtel-Karte&amp;quot;. Each of these cards contains a lighthearted comments in Viennese dialect and four sentences in standard German. The active player first tries to interpret the comment. If he is successful, he gets to draw a &amp;quot;Wirtshauskarte&amp;quot;. If not, he may pay 200 &amp;quot;Kaiserm&amp;uuml;hlentaler&amp;quot; (game money) to have one of the four possible translations read to him and to guess if the translation is correct. If he is successful, he gets to draw a card. The &amp;quot;Wirtshauskarten&amp;quot; have alcoholic strengths printed on them. If the card has the same colour as the player's secret task card, he/she can try to bring it to the attendant to bribe him. But at the bath's entrance, there is a policeman conducting alcohol checks. Depending on the alcoholic strength of the active player's cards, he either has to pay a fine, or the other player/s who initiated the alcohol check have to pay the cost for the check.&lt;br/&gt;Other special fields on the board let players win or lose money (through gambling, staying at the office, selling or auctioning off &amp;quot;Wirtshauskarten&amp;quot; etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
