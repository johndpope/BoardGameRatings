			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crowd couldn't make it over for the regular weekly game? Relax your personal computer will play 5 card Draw Poker and bring the crowd with it. Computer Draw Poker sets you up with four other players controlled by the computer. Lucky, Shifty, Ace, and Slim are their names and they play a smart game, each in their own personal way. Players betting strategy is based on their hand and the betting behavior of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone is dealt five cards, you can see your hand but not the cards held by the other players. You start the game with $2,000.00, opening bets and raises are limited to $100.00. A player must have a pair of jacks or better to open the betting. Once all the players have a chance to look at their hands, the dealer tells you what the other players have decided to do. You must then decide--based on whether they've bet or folded--whether you want to open. The opening player then gets a chance to discard and draw new cards from the deck as betting continues. Each time the dealer lets you know the opposing players moves--whether they've raised, called, folded, or checked, and asks you what you want to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try if you want, but it takes steady nerves to bluff in Computer Draw Poker. Your opponents do not bet foolishly, although you'll soon discover they are not afraid to bluff occasionally. So be prepared to become a high stakes loser, or if lady luck is with you, a big time winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ante Up and test your skill. It's man against machine...may the best win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
