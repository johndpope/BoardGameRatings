							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Forge: Gold</name>
									
			<description>It's a Golden Age&amp;mdash;commerce, exploration, and innovation have brought unmatched prosperity to the kingdom. A growing merchant class and fickle nobility demand finer things and higher levels of craftsmanship. It also doesn't hurt that gold was recently found in underground rivers and caverns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this age of new wealth, Queen Gertrude's style and manner are all the rage. The Queen has even announced that non-royal versions of her Jubilee gifts may be made available to the public. A spirit of pride and elation fills the realm ...blinding everyone to a darker element slowly creeping in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mini-expansion King's Forge: Gold adds gold dice and a selection of luxurious golden items to King's Forge. In addition to these new golden items, all of the original Queen's Jubilee expansion items have been re-balanced and ranked for the main deck. The Gold mini-expansion adds a total of 40 items to the man crafting deck (the most added by any expansion or even the base game). Additionally, 9 Gather cards represent the times across three thematic groupings; 3 gold-related, 3 prosperity-related, and 3 nefarious element Gathering cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New rules and scenarios introduce exciting wrinkles and new decisions to gameplay. This mini-expansion is aimed squarely at fans of the base game and new players looking for an exciting entry point to the King's Forge experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
