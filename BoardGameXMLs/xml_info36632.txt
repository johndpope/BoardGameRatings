							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spanish Armada</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Solo card game using a regular deck of cards. Based on the Failure of the Spanish Armada to invade England in 1588. The Armada had 122 Ships. The English 66. The English sank 2 Spanish Ships and were able to disperse the Armada. The dispersed Armada drifted into the North Sea and had to circle around Ireland in treacherous weather to return home. On the journey home 39 transports foundered or ran aground.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is split into two halves, the red half (Spanish Armada) and the black half (English Squadrons). Each turn has two phases, a Straggler Phase and an Engagement Phase. The player must use his English raider ships to disperse Spanish stragglers, which are then placed in the player's Victory Pile. The victory conditions set the level of success or failure based on the number of cards in the Victory Pile after the Spanish Armada Deck has been exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
