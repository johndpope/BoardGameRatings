			<description>The object of the game is for 2-4 players/owners to purchase and race with the option of betting on horses.  &lt;br/&gt;During the game, ownership cards for 2- and 3-year old trotters, pacers and thoroughbreds are gained through a roll and move mechanic, where spaces on the game board represent the different horses.  If the horse is currently unowned, the player may purchase the horse with the price equal to the number on the horse multiplied by the dice total times $100.  If the player declines to purchase for that price, the player pays a penalty of $50.  Any fines or other monies paid due to &amp;quot;Risk&amp;quot; cards go into the &amp;quot;Winner's Circle&amp;quot; in the center of the track.  Players go around the track twice before each of the four races occurs.  The first player to finish each tour is given Post Position #1, the second #2, etc.&lt;br/&gt;During the racing phase, owners determine if their horses will race, with a fee of $100/horse being paid.  Placings in the race are determined by the post position times the roll of the dice.  Awards for win/place/show in each race are given in a table in the rules, with each successive race having a larger purse.  Horses that win/place/show are marked with a colored clip.&lt;br/&gt;During the races, betting can occur beforehand with each horses odds ti win are determined by the number on the ownership card times the number rolled on a single die.  Maximum bets are $100/horse.  There is an odds dial to keep track of each horses' odds.  Odds to place or show are reduced by 1/2 and 1/4, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winners of the four previous races are entered into the &amp;quot;Blue Ribbon Invitational&amp;quot; at the end of the game for the largest purse.  Before the start of the invitational race, money is counted by the players and the total recorded on a piece of paper before all monies are returned to the bank by the players before the invitational race and the total recorded.  Betting is unlimited in this final race and you can bet on any horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that has the most money at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
