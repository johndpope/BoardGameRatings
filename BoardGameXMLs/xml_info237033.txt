			<description>A Two-Round Tournament for Red Steel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a rainy evening in Cuidad Real, as I step into the coach. The driver, Francisco, is a plain looking woman, wearing dark wet clothes. My clothes cling to my skin, and I wonder why I rode all day in the dust and the mud to meet the coach. Of course, I know the reason. It is the note! The neatly written note that told of problems in Cuidad Tejillas, home! Francisco drives the coach through the rain towards Paso Dorado, the next stop and where I am to meet Horter. Hortez is the man who sent the note to me. He was a local farmer in Cuidad Tejillas. Last time I was home I spoke with him briefly. He was still very upset that Descuello, my sister, spurned his marriage proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coach has stopped, time to meet with Horter. Why did he pick The Gold Gobbler? I hope they have forgotten my last visit and the brawl that destroyed most of their inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
