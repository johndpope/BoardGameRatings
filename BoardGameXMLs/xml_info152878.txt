			<description>Mystique Maze is a card game for 2 to 4 players that is played with a Mystique Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players compete to create a chain of cards that connects two opposite corners of an imaginary 3D rectangular prism. The three dimensions of this maze are the three characteristics of the Mystique deck: Colour, suit and number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets her 'corner cards' facing up:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player A gets the Ace of Yellow Suns and the 5 of Blue Arms.&lt;br/&gt;Player B gets the Ace of Blue Suns and the 5 of Yellow Arms.&lt;br/&gt;Player C (if any) gets the Ace of Blue Arms and the 5 of Yellow Suns.&lt;br/&gt;Player D (if any) gets the Ace of Yellow Arms and the 5 of Blue Suns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dimensions are connected in this manner:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colour: Yellow - Red - Blue (Blue is not connected to Yellow)&lt;br/&gt;Suit: Moons - Suns - Arms - Crowns (Moons is not connected to Crowns)&lt;br/&gt;Number: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 (1 is not connected to 5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 8 cards facing down. The remaining cards are placed in the center of the table forming a pile, facing down. This is the drawing deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns in order drawing a card from the drawing deck or the last discarded card (that's facing up next to the drawing deck) and discarding a card from their hand facing up on the discard pile afterwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the deck runs out, players should reshuffle the discard pile to make a new draw deck, leaving the last discarded card as a single-card discard deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End game and aim:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cards are said to be connected if they share 2 common characteristics and the third one is 'consecutive' (see above).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: The 2 of Blue Suns is connected to the 2 of Blue Moons, but not to the 2 of Blue Arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins when, at the end of her turn, the cards in her hand form a chain of connected cards that links her two 'corner cards'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
