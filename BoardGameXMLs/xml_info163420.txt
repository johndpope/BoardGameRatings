			<description>StartUp is a business board game in which players compete to guide their startup company from launch to the completion of a corporate headquarters. Along the way there are Business Opportunities, Capital Opportunities, and IPO Opportunities. Build Expertise to increase your chances for success and your company's value in an Initial Public Offering. Navigate lawsuits, price wars, networking opportunities and shock cards along the way.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other business board games, Startup is a lot of fun, even when you are not winning. You lose by succeeding more slowly, not by getting crushed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Startup board game teaches business and math skills and models many real business situations, such as the value of investing in your business, the risks and rewards of business opportunities, and the trade-offs in a Capital Opportunity or an IPO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Startup is fun for the whole family and will have your 9 year old jumping up and down thrilled to have completed an IPO!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;StartUp is challenging for any age from child to adult. Although there is some luck involved, the better player will usually win, kind of like real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
