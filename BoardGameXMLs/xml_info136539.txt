			<description>Final Order is a small trivia based game. Players decide on a number of rounds to play and the player with the highest score at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, one question card is drawn from the box. The card lists a question and three answers. It is the players' task to order the answers as requested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, one card might read &amp;quot;From Highest to Lowest, put these countries in order of population: A. United States, B. China, C. India&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players must lay out their answer cards (reading simply &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;) in the right order score points in each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
