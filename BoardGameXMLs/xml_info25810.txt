This is a&lt;br/&gt;game were everybody plays equally - not where one player controls the bad guys and everybody&lt;br/&gt;responds/submits to his decisions. Each player controls his own little band of misfits AND controls&lt;br/&gt;the critters that another player will encounter. Each player is someone else's nemesis.&lt;br/&gt;All encounter and miscellaneous event rolls are done in the open, and are a surprise for everybody&lt;br/&gt;to enjoy. The whole point of this little endeavor is for everybody to have fun, so it helps&lt;br/&gt;if you don't take things too seriously. These rules are not intended as an overly detailed, exhaustive&lt;br/&gt;study in the complexities of subterranean armored combat. Nor will they require you&lt;br/&gt;to undertake a prolonged course of study in order to properly equip and prepare your party for&lt;br/&gt;eventual world domination.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Elegance in Simplicity&amp;quot; is the rule, even when it comes to brawling in the dark recesses of the&lt;br/&gt;dungeons. Hopefully you will find DungeonCrawl to be reasonably quick and reasonably fun.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;All players will begin the game with essentially equal parties. In the standard game, parties are&lt;br/&gt;composed of 1 fighter, 1 archer, 1 cleric, 1 thief, and 1 mage. For more advanced games, players&lt;br/&gt;may customize their party to suit their playing style. All players have roughly the same goal&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; get their party out alive with as much loot as possible. In the basic game, the winner is determined&lt;br/&gt;by the player with the most loot at the end. More advanced games have differing goals,&lt;br/&gt;or specific objectives to be accomplished in order to claim victory.&lt;br/&gt;But it all boils down to:&lt;br/&gt;Kill Critters, Get Goodies; try to get out alive so you can brag about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
