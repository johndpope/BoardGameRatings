			<description>Four favorite games for children:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Footballmatch - Just like in a real football game two teams try to defeat one another by scoring the highest possible number of goals within a set course of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ring Game - An easy, but very attractive game of dice by which each player tries to claim rings of the same color from the starting points of his opponents and saves them up at his own starting point.  Luck at throwing the oracular die and the tactics at choosing the colored rings ensure diversified and exciting rounds.  The first player who manages to place 3 rings of the same color on his starting point wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cat and Mouse - An asymmetric game where one player plays the cat, and the rest of the players (up to 4 others) control the mice.  The cat wins when she is able to capture all mice.  The mice win when one mouse succeeds at arriving at the winning point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car Race - A game of dice for 2 to 4 players from the age of 6 on.  Players take turns rolling and moving up according to the number on the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
