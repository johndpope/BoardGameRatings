							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GOP Nominee</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 Republican Primary was one of the most polarizing and exciting events to happen in American Politics in the last decade. The wildly different personalities of the candidates suddenly transformed the nomination process into a civil war of fundamental differences. In GOP Nominee, you will take on the role of one of the four major candidates running for the Republican Nomination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOP Nominee is an asymmetrical game played over 6 Rounds where each round represents 1 Month of the Primary Elections (Including Super Tuesday which counts as its own Round). A 7th Round is possible if the game goes to a Brokered Convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each Round, Support Cubes may be gained or lost to Candidates and Actions will be played in an effort to increase the probability of your Support Cubes being drawn during the Voting Phase of the Round. However, Mud Cubes will also be gained by Candidates, decreasing their number of Support Cubes added to the drawing. Voting results determine which Candidates gain Delegates and get that much closer to winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
