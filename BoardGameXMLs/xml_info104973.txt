			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Solar Station Alps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's another day of sitting around, waiting for the daily jobs to arrive. About the only interesting thing on this backwater station is poker. Of course, there's nothing worth betting out here, so the person who wins gets to pick the job. Whether it's worth the effort or not is a gamble in and of itself, but out here you have to make your own fun. The upper crust sure isn't going to do it for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the universe is filled with Anthromorphs, or human/animal hybrids. Whereas most games featuring furries give you many choices to entertain, this game gives you one. You are a goat. While this is not really the most glamorous of Anthromorphs, they are usually the hardest working in the galaxy. And Solar Station Alps is where your company sends out the herds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will pretty much start the same way. During the daily poker game (one of the few luxuries afforded to the herds), jobs will be posted. Whoever wins the last hand of poker gets to choose the job the herd will undertake. Complete the job and the company profits. Miss out on a deadline, well... even the station needs window washers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
