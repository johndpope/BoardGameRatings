			<description>This game which premiered at Essen 2000 is for Ages 5 and up.  It is educational in nature -- children who have some ability to count are able to develop their skill.  Each of the games is a bit more challenging than the last so once they master one game they &amp;quot;graduate&amp;quot; on to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially the child simply counts. Later the child uses an included ink stamp to make a number of marks equal to a die roll.  Later, players have different colored pencils and take turns coloring parts of the picture.  They must figure out the number that they can color.  The player coloring the most wins.  So children are learning counting while they think they're only playing a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
