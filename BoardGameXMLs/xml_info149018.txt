							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spud!</name>
									
			<description>Common root vegetables? Simplicity in a burlap sack? NOOOOO &amp;ndash; Spud is a load of hot-hot-HOT potatoes and sizzling swift thinking and rapid reacting! Wild mayhem spills out and reckless hot potato passing begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OBJECT:&lt;br/&gt;Move around the Potato Cards by following the directions on the Action Cards. Avoid being stuck with Potato Cards. The person with 5 Potato Cards is out. (Toss potatoes to other players quickly and repeatedly. Remember, the potatoes are smoking hot. Move fast my friends, or you will get burned.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CARDS:&lt;br/&gt;Spud consists of different cards: Action Cards &amp;amp; Potato Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Potato Cards &amp;ndash; have potatoes. &lt;br/&gt;Laughable characters like &amp;ldquo;Wedge&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Tots&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Yukon&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Couch.&amp;rdquo; (They are a hoot.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action Cards &amp;ndash; have actions to explain where potatoes should be passed. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Left&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Anyone&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; you get the picture. Draw a &amp;ldquo;Spud!&amp;rdquo; card and you get to draw a Potato Card to give to another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SNAFUS:&lt;br/&gt;The action cards have actions, and they also have colors. Green, orange, blue. A Potato Card can only be moved if the color on the Action Card is the same of that on the Potato Card. If you do not have an action card of the right color to move a Potato Card &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the Potato Cards are &amp;ldquo;Rotten Potato,&amp;rdquo; he&amp;rsquo;s one tough character. Draw him and you&amp;rsquo;ve got to keep him. And some deceptively sweet-looking potato cards that count as two potatoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cards create general chaos &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Everybody immediately draw 3 Action Cards&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Everyone pass your hand to the left.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENDING THE GAME: &lt;br/&gt;When you are piled up with 5 potatoes, you are out. Though the fun still continues until only one player is left. The last player standing (or sitting) without 5 potatoes is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
