							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neo-Troops (1st Ed.)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition of Neo-Troops is written in Finnish; no English translation was made, though subsequent editions of the game were written in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players run characters that are bio-engineered super-varans.  Super-Varans, large humanoid reptiles, begin life with no feelings, no personality, no memories, and no personal motivations, existing only to complete missions.  Missions invariably involve extensive combat, much danger, and much killing.  Varans are created to fulfill a specific mission role, and that role defines most of their abilities and how they are intended to function on a tactical level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Varans always are heavily armed and armored, and additionally have extensive equipment support including performance-enhancing drugs and even the occasional cybernetic implant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
