			<description>The players divide themselves into two teams.  The two decks of cards (black and white) are placed between the two teams. Team A selects a player to begin.  During the turn, the player rolls a die and takes a Black card and a White card randomly.  Then the player reads both cards and shows them to the opposite team. Then he acts (he can speak, but not say the key word) to his team until they guess the word written in the card in the time established by the die.  Team A tries to guess the word while team B measures the time and checks that the player or team A don&amp;acute;t break the rules.  When the time&amp;acute;s up the team scores 1 point for each word written on the card or 2 points if they guessed all 4 words in the card.  Then is team B's time to act and guess. The team with more points after 20 rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
