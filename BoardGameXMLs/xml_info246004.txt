			<description>Deadly Concoctions is the lethal card game in which you mix heart-stopping, madness- inducing, soul-crushing potions, in an effort to kill your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Separate the &amp;quot;Life&amp;quot; cards (Mind, Heart, Spirit) from the deck and give one of each to all players, who are to set them face-up on the playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the deck and deal each player 6 cards. Set the deck face down between all participants. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn, a player draws up to the hand limit of 7 cards [from any combination of atop the deck or discard field), and discards 1 card into an open field of cards on the playing surface (concluding the turn). If, prior to discarding, a player matches a &amp;quot;Potion&amp;quot; card with the 2 &amp;quot;Ingredient&amp;quot; cards shown on it, the 3 cards may be played on any opponent's Life card. When this occurs, set aside all 4 cards to remove them from play. If one loses all life cards, he or she is dead and out of the game. A player may attack only once per turn, and only the Life form targeted by a potion. &amp;quot;Secret Ingredient&amp;quot; cards are wild. Use them in place of ingredients needed to mix a potion. The &amp;quot;Serum X&amp;quot; card is a complete potion that, by itself, may attack any Life form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sole surviving player, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
