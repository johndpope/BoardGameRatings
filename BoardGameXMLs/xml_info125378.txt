							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sprawling Shadows, Weapons: Book of Swords Vol. 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sprawling Shadows, Weapons: Book of Swords is exactly what it appears to be? a book of swords. Within these pages, you will find twenty four uniquely created magical swords for use in your D20 campaign. Every weapon includes full D20 statistics, all Open Game Content, which include the item's Rarity, Properties, Damage, Critical Chance and Damage Multiplier, and Weight. Each entry also includes item creation information including Required Caster Level, Prerequisites, Market Price, and Cost to Create. The swords range from having moderate enhancements, to grossly powerful magical properties. Some have been generated randomly using the magic item creation tables in the System Reference Document, and others have been carefully crafted to fit a specific concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, each weapon in this volume is further brought to life by an exciting historical background, or carefully written flavor text. This support information is designed to give players and DM's an insider's glimpse into the adventure-filled world of Sprawling Shadows. With all D20 statistics being Open Game Content, the backgrounds can be ignored, and these weapons can be inserted into any campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
