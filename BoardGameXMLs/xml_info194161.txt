			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some point in your campaign, your PCs are probably going to stop off for a drink and a bite to eat at a local tavern.  Instead of just deducting a few gold pieces and letting your PCs regain some spells, give them a chance to explore and interact with the city around them at Tuffy&amp;rsquo;s Good Time Palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all know the wrong side of town can be a great place to off load that ill-gotten treasure, pick up some information, or hire a little assistance for a dirty job. Tangible Taverns: Tuffy's Good Time Palace brings a little life to a place few dare to frequent. From an organized gang of street thugs, to a brawler who dabbles in the art of pickling, to an all-woman mercenary outfit, to uncoordinated table dancers and the inept piano player, there&amp;rsquo;s a little something for everyone at Tuffy&amp;rsquo;s Good Time Palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only question is: are your PCs brave enough to try the pickled pig&amp;rsquo;s feet or will they just turn tail and leave a dingy dive like Tuffy&amp;rsquo;s for greener pastures (or cleaner glasses)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tangible Taverns: Tuffy's Good Time Palace details a dilapidated tavern filled with the city's least desirables. The drinks are terrible, the food is limited to the pickled variety, and not a soul would bat an eye at stealing your coin purse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes detailed information on a local gang and its leader, the town healer (who could be more than he seems), and of course the memorable tavern employees (including Tuffy herself); rumour and event tables, and a tavern map, meaning you are all set to have some role-playing fun when your PCs stop off for a drink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
