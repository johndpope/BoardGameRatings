							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sons Of Hercules</name>
									
			<description>Based on a syndicated television show from the 1960s.  The show itself was a repacking of a number of Italian sword-and-sandal epics, most of which had nothing to do with Hercules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six events shown on the game board, but they have noting to do with the mechanics.  Players roll two dice and by using the number on each die, or the sum, try to cover one of the six spaces on the board.  The player that covers the last spot receives an award ring.  Players can also challenge an opponent for their rings.  First player with four award rings wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Milton Bradley number is 4632.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
