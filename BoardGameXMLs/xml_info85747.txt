			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free scenario by Peter Schweighofer introduces readers to all aspects of gaming in Pulp Egypt: Adventures Along the Nile, 1933-1939, from ancient ruins and sinister Bedouin to desert expeditions and Nazi spies preparing an invasion of Egypt. As members of an archaeological expedition, the characters move quickly to rescue their staff photographer when she&amp;rsquo;s kidnapped by mysterious Bedouin during a nighttime ambush. After deciphering her notes and undertaking a dangerous trek into the western desert, they explore a long-lost temple and discover that Egypt&amp;rsquo;s enemies still lurk at the edge of the Great Sand Sea waiting for the right time to strike! This 16-page adventure also includes maps, pre-generated characters, a player hand-out, and a copy of the Any-System Key for easy reference. Check out this free scenario to get a feel for the kinds of adventures you can play in the Pulp Egypt sourcebook available from Griffon Publishing Studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers can easily adapt this Any-System Key adventure to their favorite roleplaying game rules. The Any-System Key describes character skills and task difficulties in terms that easily translate into nearly any game system. These terms do not link to any one game engine, but serve as general guidelines to give readers an overall sense how they fit within their own game&amp;rsquo;s stat and difficulty scale. To use this scenario you&amp;rsquo;ll need the copy of the Any-System Key included in this adventure and your favorite roleplaying game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
