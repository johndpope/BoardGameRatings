							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reverse Charades: 2015 Tabletop Day Edition</name>
									
			<description>Reverse Charades flips the charade standard of one person giving clues to a large group on its head by splitting the players (six or more) into two teams, then having all but one person on a team work together to get that one person to guess as many words as possible in sixty seconds. Each guessed word is worth one point; each word spoken or mouthed costs that team a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has guessed once, the team with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version was given out during Tabletop Day 2015 and consists of 51 double-sided cards, a rule card, and 2 cards promoting other USAopoly games. (no box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
