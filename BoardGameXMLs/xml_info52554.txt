			<description>Tabriz (your unfriendly neighborhood spell-slinger) has convinced the Kobolds to ransack BOOM Town and nearby Mount Boom in search of glowing Spell Pages.  Apparently, two really powerful wizards got into a bit of a tussle, which resulted in them reducing one another to ash and blasting their spellbooks to pieces, scattering their ridiculously powerful spells all across the mountain.  Tabriz is waiting on top of the mountain to reward Kobolds who bring him pages.  (Un)fortunately, the Koblolds have discovered that they cold cast these ridiculously powerful spells if they crumple them up and toss them at things!  Can the Kobolds survive the untold perils that await them in the sleepy hamlet of BOOM Town as well as the treacherous passes of Mount BOOM to reach the summit?  And just what reward does await them if they happen to make it?  Thes and other burning questions, like &amp;quot;How many Plague Rats does it take to kill a Mime?&amp;quot; will be answered when you play Volcano A-Go-Go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
