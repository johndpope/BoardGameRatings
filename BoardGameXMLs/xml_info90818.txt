							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Face To Face: The Face Identity Game</name>
									
			<description>Object: &amp;quot;To be the first player to correctly identify two photos of each color (a total of at least eight cards), and to them correctly identify a &amp;quot;Final Face&amp;quot; photo.&amp;quot; (From the rules of play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 to 8, individuals or teams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: 2 card boxes, 800 Face cards, 1 pair of dice, 1 master list, 4 card holders with locking windows, 8 player tokens, 1 game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin play, players insert (without looking) one Face card of each color (gray, burgundy, blue, and gold) into the matching-color card holder, making sure the six windows on each holder are closed. Each card holder is then placed window-side up on the game board, in the matching-color rectangle. Each player selects a token, places it on the 'Start' space on the game board, and rolls the dice to determine who plays first (highest roller, play continues clockwise).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ona player's turn, that player rolls the dice and moves his token that number of spaces in any direction (backtracking in the same turn is not allowed). If the player lands on a colored, lettered space, the player must open the corresponding window (by letter) on the corresponding card holder (by color). If a player lands on one of the four outside corner spaces, &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; the windows on the corresponding card holder (by color) may be opened. When a player lands on a pink &amp;quot;Face ID&amp;quot; space, the player selects &lt;b&gt;any&lt;/b&gt; card holder and opens all unopened windows. When landing on a pink space marked FAID, the player selects any holder and opens the F, A, I, and D windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn, after opening any windows allowed, a player may try to identify the person on the card in the card holder that corresponds (by color) to the space his token is on. To identify the person, the player must state the name of the person on the card--&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; the name of any character the person has played. (Example: &amp;quot;Bob Keeshan&amp;quot; would be correct, but not &amp;quot;Captain Kangaroo&amp;quot;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players determine whether the player is correct. If there is a dispute, the Master List is consulted by revealing the identification number at the bottom of the card. The player making the identification consults the list in secret. If he is correct, the card is removed from the holder and rewarded to the player, who closes the windows and places another card in the holder. That player rolls the dice and moves again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player is incorrect, he places the card holder back on the board (leaving the windows open or closed, as they were). He does not reveal the correct identity of the person on the card, but he may not (of course) make another guess on the same card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An incorrect guess, or no guess, ends a player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a player has collected two cards of each color, he must land on a FACE ID space to attempt a Final Face Identification. When he lands on a FACE ID space, the player must attempt to identify the face in the corresponding (by color) card holder. The player consults the back of his collected face cards, which contain assorted letters. Those letters determine which if any of the unopened windows on the card holder he may open before attempting to identify the person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player is incorrect on the Final Face Identification, his turn is over and play resumes as normal. On that player's turn, he must attempt again to land on another FACE ID space to make another Final Face Identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player is correct on the Final Face Identification, that player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
