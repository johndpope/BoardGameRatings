			<description>Retruco is described on the box as &amp;quot;A Game of Skill, for Winter Evenings, Playable on any Table&amp;quot;. It also is an early example of celebrity marketing, as the box declares &amp;quot;Played at Warwick Castle During the Visit of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, May 1895&amp;quot;. The box claims &amp;quot;Patent No. 575&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules say the name is Spanish for &amp;quot;a recoiling&amp;quot; and the game consists of 9 wooden pins, 3&amp;quot; tall, and a wooden ring. The eight yellow pins are set up in a square and the single black pin goes in the center of the square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns propelling the ring by pushing down from the top so that it moves forward with a reverse spin, one that brings it back toward the player if it hits a pin. A player gets three shots, plus one more for each hit. Pins are reset for each player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitting a pin scores 10 for those in the rank nearest to him, 20 points for those on either side of the black &amp;quot;king&amp;quot; pin, and 40 points for those in the far rank. Hitting the &amp;quot;king&amp;quot;, however, wipes out his score and ends his turn. First player to reach 500 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
