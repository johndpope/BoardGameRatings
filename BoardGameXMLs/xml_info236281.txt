			<description>Tired of games where the cake is a lie? Well Baking Simulator is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baking Simulator lets you explore all of your culinary desires, without the mess. Pour, mix, crack and bake to your heart's content. Move freely about the kitchen following recipes to bake the greatest and tastiest food ever devised by man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't like the idea of facing the baking challenge alone, grab a friend and bake in local co-op mode, where you'll each work together to take control - one of you controls the player movement and the other will control the hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
