			<description>Tisbyis a word game, sort of a cross between Scrabble, Alfred's Other Game, and Boggle, with luck removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has their own set of tiles.  A group of letters are randomly determined (by dice rolling versus a table) and each player starts with the same letters.  Each player has their own 7x7 grid and a player screen to hide their boards from others, and tries to create the best score.  Words must be connected a la crossword puzzles, with the same set of letters everyone else is working with.  The first player done starts a timer, which the other players have to race against.  A game lasts six rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
