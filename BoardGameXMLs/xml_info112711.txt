			<description>An abstract game on a 5x6 grid of African origin. It is similar to Dara with a few exeptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 12 pieces (stones, bids, etc.) of his colour. During initial set-up players take turns to place their pieces on empty squares of the board, two pieces (one piece in Dara) at a time. They must avoid 'three in a row' orthogonally during this phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase players move their pieces to adjacent squares trying to form 'three in a row' (diagonals don't count). After making 'three in a row' a player removes an enemy piece which is adjacent to either side of this row (that's another difference to Dara). A player loses the game when only 2 pieces of his colour remain on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
