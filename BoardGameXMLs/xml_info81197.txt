							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wing Commander: Armada</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Wing Commander: Armada is a computer game set in the universe of Chris Roberts Wing Commander franchise. Created by Origin Systems and distributed by Electronic Arts in 1994, Armada was the first, official game of the Wing Commander series to feature multiplayer mode. This game was released shortly before Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger and features a new graphics engine, capable of rendering fully three dimensional ship models, which is more powerful than that used in Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi. This is a result of Origin using Armada as a &amp;quot;test-bed&amp;quot; for the Wing Commander III engine; Armada however lacks the hi-res SVGA rendering that was introduced by the third chapter of the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Armada's background is provided by the Human Kilrathi war, the game does not expand the main story, but is rather intended as a stand-alone product.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wing Commander: Armada&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
