							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Trip Through Europe</name>
									
			<description>This educational board game was one of a trio of games published around 1900 by The Educational Game Company, headed by Elmer E. Johnson, also president of The Regents Institute, a school for boys and girls in Brooklyn, NYC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The square paper game board features five maps, one in the middle showing Europe as a whole, and the rest showing parts of the continent. It has a perimeter track of 13 squares per side, and six square tracks leading to the middle map from the center of each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corners and middle squares are blank red. The rest bear the name of a European city with a number suggesting where it may be found on the board. Each player has four tokens and a &amp;quot;clock&amp;quot; spinner that enables moves of 1-12 spaces. When moving, the player must announce the name of the city to which he is moving and the country in which that city is located. He may look at the maps for help, but if he can immediately name the city and country without looking, he gets another turn to a maximum of three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on another token sends it back to the nearest red square, and first player to complete a full circuit and then move to the centre with all four tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
