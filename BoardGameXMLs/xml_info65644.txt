							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horror at Dagger Rock</name>
									
			<description>This is an adventure designed for 4-6 characters of levels 1-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At the edge of the Daggerstone Hills is Dagger Rock; a pinnacle of granite that thrusts more than one thousand feet into sky. At its base sits Relford; one of the oldest and most popular mining settlements in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since a recent earthquake, Relford is slowly dying: The mine has closed and the mighty Rel River has all but dried up. Terrified locals flee their homes, abandoning their meagre livelihood with no explanation. Those that remain&lt;br/&gt;have keep their doors locked and are wary of strangers. There is talk that some people have simply disappeared ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that between the dark and dead trees of the hills, inhuman tribes lurk, preying on the unwary. Who&lt;br/&gt;knows what horrors have crawled from out the shadow of Dagger Rock ?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
