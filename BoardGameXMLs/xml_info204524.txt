							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat Companion Module (RMC)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ERA you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. But no adventure is complete without some gritty combat. Blows must be dealt, and damage resolved. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample weapons and 3 critical tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RMC Combat Companion package for ERA provides 3 RMC professions with their spells, and 19 attack tables with their corresponding critical tables. It also offers new options when creating combat styles and resolving combat.&lt;br/&gt;Expand your professional possibilities by choosing from the warrior spell users: Champion, Elemental Warrior and Venturer. All their base lists with complete spell descriptions are also included, and automatically offered on character creation.&lt;br/&gt;When creating your character, the Combat Companion package offers an improved weapon skill step where you can assign your baseline costs and get automated assistance in computing the final skill costs.&lt;br/&gt;Change the rules of combat with the Combat Companion armor by the piece rules, by choosing elegant styles such as chain boots and gauntlets with a leather cuirass, or a plate helmet and neck protection over your cloth robes.&lt;br/&gt;No matter how your opponent defends, you can attack using the weapon attack tables with their specialized criticals. Savor the differences in slashing caused by animal claws and long blades like never before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
