							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Finnish Civil War</name>
									
			<description>Finnish Civil War, is a simulation game of the civil conflict in Finland in the early months of 1918.  The game is for two players, one representing the recently elected government of the recently independent state (the White player) and the other the perhaps-irresistible forces of proletarian revolution (the Red Player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in two versions: &lt;br/&gt;1) a company/battalion scale one which uses a system heavily modified from the designer's previously published games Freikorps, Konarmiya and War Plan Crimson; and &lt;br/&gt;2) a brigade scale one that uses fewer counters and an even more heavily modified system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both versions use the same map (hex grid of southern Finland, at 12 map miles/ 20 km per hex). Special units and chromy bits include: variable-strength Red and White Guard units; Armored Trains; the spring thaw that occurred midway through the war; peace negotiations, German intervention and Russian withdrawal (including the Future Guilt Clause!); General Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim; guerrillas; purges; and the Swedish Talent Agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was available for free download at designer's personal webpage from end of 2009, but in October 2012 the designer concluded an agreement with Compass Games for them to publish this game in Paper Wars magazine. Compass Games has requested that the free version of the game be taken down. Both versions of the game appeared in issue #84 of the magazine, in December 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 7 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 12 miles / 20 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Brigade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 17 x 22&amp;quot; full-color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (240 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 20-page Finnish Civil War rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-6 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: One 6-sided die is needed for play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
