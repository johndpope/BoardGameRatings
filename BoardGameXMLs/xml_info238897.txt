			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Wieden and his experimental research team discovered something unbelievable during a high energy experiment dealing with chaos theory and entropy. Unfortunately, it cost them all their lives. Although Wieden, himself, wasn't dead his body and mind were both completely corrupted by dark energy... and something else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With his new, destructive abilities he embarked on a life of crime as he seeks money and equipment to continue his research and make a life for himself more fitting to someone of his genius and power. When the ENTROPIC MAN attacks, the entire city trembles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
