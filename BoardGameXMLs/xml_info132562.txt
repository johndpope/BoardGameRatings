			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main box for the Wolflend quest game; A card-generated role playing game that can be played in one hour, and does not require a Game Master. Players use cards to represent events, monsters and dungeons, and other cards with keywords to motivate what they are doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in Wolflend, the world of Monster Maker fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game box contains 128 cards (chara cards, keyword cards, scenario cards), 2 dice, various cardboard chips and rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back&lt;br/&gt;No need for a game master! Play in one hour! Complete with a dungeon scenario that can be enjoyed time after time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you know what a &amp;quot;table talk role playing game&amp;quot; is? It's an exciting game where a Game Master creates a story scenario, describes the situation to the players, and the player try to act their character (role-play). But you can't play unless you have a game master who knows the rules and the backdrop for the game world.&lt;br/&gt;Also, it takes a lot of time to play.&lt;br/&gt;So we invented a system that takes just one hour and does not need a game master, and the result is this card game!&lt;br/&gt;You don't need either game master or paper or pens.&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple.&lt;br/&gt;Players use keywords to invent good dialogue, so even players not used to RPGs can play.&lt;br/&gt;This box includes one scneario and a dungeon delving adventure that takes half an hour and that changes every single time. Also included is everything you need to set up your own scenario very easily.&lt;br/&gt;This is your chance to try out a wholly new type of RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
