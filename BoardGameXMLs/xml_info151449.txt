			<description>The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the center section. Movement is controlled by dice. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all pawns to the center space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 8 red, 8 yellow, 8 pink, and 8 blue wood pieces, indicator and black Father Goose figure made of wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
