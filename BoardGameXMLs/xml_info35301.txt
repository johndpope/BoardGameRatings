							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frankfurter Fragen</name>
									
			<description>Frankfurter Fragen is a stand-alone extension to &amp;quot;Frankfurt - das Spiel zur Stadt&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 300 question cards with about 700 questions about Frankfurt trivia. They are printed on both sides, the front being blue with symbols consisting of a short question/answer and the back being red with a more detailed reply.&lt;br/&gt;The front also has special questions and remarks for the original game which do not apply when playing the extension only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's 2 ways of playing&lt;br/&gt;1) being the first to collect 10 cards&lt;br/&gt;2) being the first to collect 5 cards with identical symbols on the front&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latter can take ages even if you have some die-hard locals around. It is published in German only as the target lies on natives and newly inhabitants who want to know more about their city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
