							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Famous Zombies</name>
									
			<description>Taken from Kickstarter page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dead have risen from their graves and their only desire is to devour brains of the living.  Sure, it's fun to tell your friends you killed a zombie.  But it's even better to add &amp;quot;Oh, you may have heard of him.&amp;quot;  That's why these zombies are famous.  Will they keep coming back? Most definitely. Will humanity survive? Not even close. But if you can take out a few of the better know walking dead along the way, then you could win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use cards to place player tokens on different spaces.  Placing them on the main board allows players to search for and use weapons to kill and drive back zombies.  The trap area allows your tokens to electrocute or blow up zombies that wander across the board.  Intel spaces allow players to draw additional cards.  The more cards that are drawn, the faster the zombies come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies are constantly springing up and slowly moving toward the brains on the main board.  When they reach them, players lose player tokens.  Players may regain player tokens by using cards to recruit new allies from the &amp;quot;Eaten&amp;quot; space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies will come in waves.  Sometimes they give you time to set up your strategy, and sometimes they emerge so quickly and in such large numbers that you must take action immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famous Zombies is a victory point based game that can be learned quickly and has enough choices to make strategy the most important factor in winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
