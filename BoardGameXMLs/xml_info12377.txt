							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ultimate Baseball Trivia Board Game</name>
									
			<description>From the instruction booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name suggests, this is a trivia game for baseball fans who want to test their knowledge about America's first pastime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game does focus primarily on MLB teams and players, it also includes questions on baseball history, international baseball, minor league baseball, and other professional baseball leagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One feature, which many people appreciate, is the 'rookie' category for novice baseball fans.  This allows everyone to play and have a chance at winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
