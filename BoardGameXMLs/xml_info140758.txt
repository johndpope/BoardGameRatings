							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sepulchral Swaths of Tanoth-Gha</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third in our line of Gothic Grimoires, The Sepulchral Swaths of Tanoth-Gha unfolds the lore of an elder cult devoted to primordial things venerated in the dawn ages of the humanoid races, when civilizations now thought ancient were not yet born, or taking their first halting steps of infancy. As enlightenment and the younger faiths arose, these Elder Things lurked still in forgotten places in the lone lands, waiting for the unfortunate or the foolish to call upon them again. Sepulchral Swaths of Tanoth-Gha is an ideal complement to a Gothic Adventure Path or any game where characters wander across a lost and ancient ruin holding cultic rites and lore best left forgotten, including 5 new feats like Bind the Ancient Dead and Bones of the Earth, 6 new spells from accursed monolith to primeval interdiction, and a pair of new monster templates: the fossilized skeleton and mummified zombie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Jason Nelson with the Legendary Games design team of Neil Spicer, Greg A. Vaughan, Clinton J. Boomer, Matt Goodall, Jim Groves, Russ Taylor, and Clark Peterson. Who better to provide you with alternate magical books, spells, and rules for your Adventure Path campaign than the very writers of those adventures themselves? Answer: no one. Legendary Games' Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail. Legendary Games combines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design, hyperlinked internally and to online Pathfinder resources for easy interactive reference, and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this 8-page gothic-themed magical accessory and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
