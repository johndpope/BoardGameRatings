			<description>As the night falls upon Diamyo Hoki's Han the townsfolk gradually retire to their beds for the night.  You have waited for this chance for a long time.  The moment that you can extract revenge upon the tyrannical Diamyo and benefit from his vast amount of wealth at the same time.  It won't be easy, not only will you be trying to avoid the Diamyo's detection, but you will also be competing against the other thieves in the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you escape with the tyrant's treasure or will you succumb to public execution in the morning? Only you can make the difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the role of a Makura Sagashi &amp;ndash; directly translated as a pillow searcher, a wandering thief that stole the valuables from under people's pillows as they slept.  It is your task to explore the houses and steal as much as you can, avoiding the detection of the Diamyo and his loyal servants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a fast-paced simultaneous card play, players compete to steal the most ryo (gold pieces) and other valuables from the Diamyo's property.  Players score points for each piece of treasure they capture and lose points if they take detection cards.  The game is straightforward, adjustable and contains a level of unpredictability that keeps it interesting across multiple plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
