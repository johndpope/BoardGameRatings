							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Great Hall</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hall is the centerpiece of a noble mans castle. Great Hall in this regard means simply that it is a large room. A room that is quite multifunctional. The lord of the house might receive guests here or he could use it to celebrate religious or mundane festivals. The room also serves as a dining hall, both for the noble and his servants. At night members of the household might even make their bed on this rooms floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The room boats only few decorations. A simple shield boasting the lords banner hangs over a large fireplace embedded in one of the rooms long walls and a number of ornate lanterns serve to illuminate the rest of the room. The floor of the room is tiled with easy to clean granite in two colors for the most part. Only a small part of the floor is inlaid with a mosaic of colored glass. The tables and benches are simple and sturdy. By far the most impressive piece of furniture is the lords throne, flanked by a much smaller but cushioned wooden chair for the lords consort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two doorways lead into the room, the large steel reinforced main doors of the hall leading out into the antechamber and a much smaller but equally reinforced door behind the throne leading to the chambers of the nobles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
