			<description>Think Trunk is the perfect group and party game.  Its unique game play allows for everyone to be involved on every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 different categories on each card: Think It, Number It, Act It, Prefer It, and Wing It.  All 5 categories encompass and expand on current games on the market but are adapted for multi-player input without teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to get to the end and a single round takes 20-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
