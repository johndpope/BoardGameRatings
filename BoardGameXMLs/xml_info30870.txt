			<description>The object of the game is to be the first player to fly their four UFO's back from outer space and land them on Planet Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you cover your eyes with the mask provided while another player moves the large UFO round the board. As it moves it &amp;quot;beeps&amp;quot; and you need to identify where it landed. If you guess right then you can move your UFOs and &amp;quot;ZAP&amp;quot; another player back to outer space. If you get it wrong then the other players get a free move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not quite as easy as it sounds (especially if your hearing isn't that good) and you can also &amp;quot;freeze other ufo's by landing on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
