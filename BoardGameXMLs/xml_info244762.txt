							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Khazan&#039;s Tower Puzzle</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Puzzle on the door of Khazan's Tower is fun. But the illustration in Curse of Strahd is small, dark, not that detailed, and very simple - the stick figures even have heads on them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made some really great resources for you to run this fun encounter. Who doesn't love making their PCs dance around like fools? Maybe Rahadin is watching from the trees and laughing his purple ass off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use this resource for everything a DM needs to run this particular encounter very easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use of this resources requires Curse of Strahd; this is distributed as a ZIP archive containing several PDF and JPG files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
