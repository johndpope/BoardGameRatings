			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep South by Daylight is a Live Action Role Playing (LARP) game. Each player in the game is given a character to portray. Each character has its own goals and personality. In this game there are no winners or losers. Though some characters may have &amp;quot;goals&amp;quot;, actual success at attaining the goals is no reflection on the player's ability. (For example, an actor is playing Shakespeare's Hamlet rather poorly if by the end of his performance the tragic prince were still alive...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a world of dark conspiracies, based loosely on The X Files and the World of Darkness Hunters Hunted (Mortals in the World of Darkness).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pelham, South Carolina, in the 1990s. A quiet little town, east of Greenville. A small Christian cult, The Church of the Eucharist is set up on an old tobacco farm, where they practice Communion with real blood - claiming that the story of the last supper was not meant to be metaphorical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
