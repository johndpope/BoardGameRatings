							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gamma World D6</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This intriguing adaptation of TSR's Gamma World uses a streamlined version of West End Games' D6 mechanics.  Characters have Stats and Skills.  Difficult and opposed actions are rolled against a Difficulty Number.  Die rolls of 6 &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot; into another additive roll.  Characters also can earn and spend Luck Points to influence narrative action.  Combat works essentially the same way except there are several special situations which provide modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have four Stats (Dexterity, Knowledge, Perception, and Strength) among which they divide a 12d6 dice pool.  Stats must start with 2d6 to 4d6 allocated.  Characters have a separate pool of 7d6 to allocate among selected Skills, which must range from 1d6 to 2d6 at creation.  Characters also have mutations which do various oddball things--some even are useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
