							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gothic Worlds</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gothic Worlds presents a setting which begins as a mundane, Medieval world much like our own history.  Then a source of magic is introduced and humanity begins to tap into it to alter history and events.  The game proposes only one race--humans.  Characters select Classes which guide their development.  The game provides these Classes:  Archer, Barbarian, Black Mage, Blue Mage, Green Mage, Knight, Red Mage, and White Mage.  Each color of Mage aligns with a &amp;quot;school&amp;quot; or sphere of magic.  Characters also have Fortune Points which are gained and spent during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses standard d6 but proposes a special use called d6% where 2d6 of differing colors re rolled and one is used for the tens position and one for the ones position, yielding a discontinuous 2-digit number from 11, 12, 13...to 64, 65, 66.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved by using a character's Combat Stat with a multiplier and trying to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; this with d6%; the &amp;quot;to hit&amp;quot; roll also determines hit location if it is successful.  The game includes a magic system keyed to Class, equipment lists, and a character sheet with hit locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
