			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales from the Wild Blue Yonder: Chapter III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Scurlock is dead. His estranged children have returned home to Ilysium for the funeral and disbursement of the estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However &amp;mdash; There is little left; the manor servant, Jedmund, has collected the last 82 crowns in a small coffer, and with it only a shabby coach and two withered horses, the family crest and swords, a portrait of a strange woman, and Lord Scurlock&amp;rsquo;s prized hunting rifle (hidden away from prying eyes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other attendees at the funeral are Lord Scurlock&amp;rsquo;s creditors. They hover about the manor like vultures, eager to recoup some measure of their losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Viceroy Skein has come to collect his bribe for withholding certain unpleasant facts from public knowledge. He expects the children to continue the payments. He is owed 14 crowns and 5 crowns per month ongoing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Narcus Kerp is owed for delivery of &amp;ldquo;medicines&amp;rdquo; that helped ease the tortured mind of Lord Scurlock in his final years. He is owed 6 crowns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Constable Tume is soliciting the tax payment on the manor. 67 crowns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mister Bailey of the Fox &amp;amp; Anchor kindly asks for the stable fees for the coach and horses: 11 crowns for the past six months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mister Plom demands the regular &amp;ldquo;protection&amp;rdquo; payment to the local goblin crime boss, Kudger. 1 crown per week (you owe 16 already).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Magistrate Holpine, a city judge, discreetly informs you that Lord Scurlock owes him certain trivial deeds and paperwork as a result of a gentleman&amp;rsquo;s wager on a game of cards. It will take but a moment to retrieve them from the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Milvoy Ollum, the priest who is about to perform the rites, is due 1 gold crown for his service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Petrice Sevoy, the esteemed artist, is completing a portrait of Lord Scurlock and lacks only the final payment of 2 crowns to deliver it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Addition &amp;mdash; Lord Scurlock&amp;rsquo;s half-brother, Alward, is snooping about the house, looking to claim anything that looks valuable. &amp;ldquo;My brother would have wanted me to have this,&amp;rdquo; he mumbles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will they pay? Who decides?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What entanglements remain from Lord Scurlock&amp;rsquo;s nefarious life, and who will turn them to their advantage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
