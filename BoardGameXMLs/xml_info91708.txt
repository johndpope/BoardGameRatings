			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backyard Baseball 2004 is another in the Backyard Baseball series in which children can create and manage their own baseball team while challenging computer-made teams of various skill levels. &lt;br/&gt;Backyard Baseball 2004 follows the other Backyard Baseball games in style and gameplay, including MLB players in their cartoony child form and allowing a host of powerups and trick plays that compliment the game type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's installment is unique in that it was only published for the GameCube console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
