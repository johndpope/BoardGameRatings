			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A budget graphical text adventure game. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For years the tiny island of St. Malcolm had basked in the Caribbean sunshine, cut off from civilisation save for an old T.V set owned by the chief. The population became obsessed with the game of cricket, almost to the point of fanaticism. It was with relish then that the islanders agreed to a tour from the U.K. Unkown to them however the British Government had discovered that St. Malcolm was in fact rich in a certain natural resource, Guano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was this which had prompted the tour and it was the minister who was to accompany that tour who souqht to qain the rights to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are manager of the team picked to visit the island. It should be a tour like any other and make a pleasant break from the rigours of the British winter. What could go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Part 1, you must guide your team to the St. Malcolm Cricket Ground, then in Part 2, you must play the match itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is your big chance to steer your lads to victory and earn your place in cricketing history. Good luck to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need it!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
