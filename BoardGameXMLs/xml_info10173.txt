			<description>Mix all the Turtles (letters down) leaving them on the table within reach of all players. The Turtles are then in the &amp;quot;POOL&amp;quot;. To decide who plays first, each player selects on Turtle. Lowest alphabetically plays first. Turtles are then returned to the &amp;quot;POOL&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player selects any five Turtles from the &amp;quot;POOL&amp;quot; and without looking at the letters places them Turtle head forward on the shelf of the TURN-TURTLE (tile  stand). The TURN-TURTLE is then tipped and pushed slowly forward by the player thus flipping the TURTLES onto the table and revealing the 5 letters which were selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player tries to get the most points possible from each turn by arranging any or all of the five letters so that they spell different words. Add the letter value of each word to make the total score value for each turn. Bonus points are scored if the letters don't need to be rearranged or if a five letter word can be scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player's turn, score the total, return all five Turtles to the &amp;quot;POOL&amp;quot; (letters down) mix and pass the TURN-TURTLE to the next player to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;A new, exciting word-game combining luck, imagination and spelling vocabulary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Turtle is played on any smooth surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get the highest total score by forming words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has the same number of turns during a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
