							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwarfs!?</name>
									
			<description>'Dwarfs!?' is, surprisingly enough, a game about Dwarfs! As the new overseer, your job is to manage small colonies of the buggers, trying to make them as successful as possible before meeting their inevitable doom! Sounds easy enough, eh? &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, these Dwarfs are not the silly, dolled up versions in mithril armor we see on television. They are the real deal: greedy, confused and terribly drunk. In order to succeed, you'll have to bribe them, blow them up and send them flying in cannons!&lt;br/&gt;'Dwarfs!?' offers an addictive, fast paced arcade-like experience, with plenty of difficulties and game modes to play around in! In this game, your own Dwarfs double as your greatest asset and worst threat. They explore for you, they mine for you and they fight for you -- but if you don't keep an eye on them, they'll do what they do best: die for you and take everyone else with them! Nothing in 'Dwarfs!?' is free, though. To force your 'loyal subjects' to do your bidding, you must cough up the gold. The same gold that might save your beard when someone, somewhere disturbs a Spider Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
