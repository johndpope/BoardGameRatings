			<description>HyperCribbage is Cribbage with a special board and wildcards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board adds four five-hole &amp;quot;dead zones&amp;quot;. A player who ends in a dead zone is not allowed to count any single scoring event more than the holes remaining to the final hole. (A player can score normally from the final hole.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck also includes Jokers, which may count as any card. Their value can change between pegging and counting out the hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variant, HyperCribbage-7, includes seven card hands and cribs (and much larger maximum scoring combinations), and is played twice around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Cribbage, players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards.  Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.  The winner is the first person to peg 121 or more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
