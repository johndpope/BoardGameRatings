			<description>Geek Fight takes place in a convention setting where you, the Geek Fight player, might run into a hairy anime character wearing thigh-high boots and an ill-fitting sports bra moments after being detained by a Stormtrooper demanding to see your credentials. You can also expect to encounter any and all of the stereotypical convention characters, vendors, swag, items, and crazy events that appear at conventions, or &amp;quot;cons.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geek Fight has already seen its second release with the help of the Angry video Game Nerd and the Nostalgia Critic, with a third release coming around the bend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the fact that the production of the cards is partially funded by advertisements from other geeky companies as well as the lack of a randomized packaging element, Geek Fight is one of the most wallet friendly games in the CCG (with that first &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; meaning customizable and not collectible) market today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geek Fight: All of the Strategy, None of the Bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
