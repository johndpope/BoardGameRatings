							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 24 x 30 inch Battlemap of a War Room, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If intelligence is right, this chateau fort contains a war room key to all enemy communication and tactical coordination in the area. If we can secure it and capture the enemy officers, we should be able to completely confuse and paralyze enemy forces all along this front. We have our orders men, let&amp;rsquo;s take this castle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Sarge? Did we bring a battering ram sir?&amp;rdquo; [Laughter from the squad]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something like that.&amp;rdquo; [Hands him a dynamite bundle] &amp;ldquo;Thanks for volunteering private.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its time for war! Every general needs a war room to keep track of the units under his command. Whether it is used as a base for meeting with your superiors or an enemy command center to take over in a military campaign, it makes a sublime stage for a pulp action military game. The room can also be used as a war room monitoring conflagrations that flare up around the world for the League of Nations or United Nations for a game focusing more on diplomacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Room is a single room, internal view map of a military command center featuring a large table with a world map of Earth for the use of tracking troop movements as well as desk telephones to relay that information and orders to men in the field. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world map of Earth could easily be replaced, just print out a different world map and place it over the center table instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Room is intended for use in modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decapitate the Enemy: A fortified enemy castle is being used as a base for an enemy war room communicating and relaying tactical data to units in the vicinity. Bombardment with bombers has proven ineffectual, as flak guns have been placed in castle towers, the courtyard, and anywhere else with enough space and a view of the skies above. Heavy tanks have been placed at the front of the gate. They don&amp;rsquo;t have enough gas to move much, but the combination of their cannons and the flaks won&amp;rsquo;t let armor get anywhere near the place. Heavy enemy activity in the area also hampers ground forces moving artillery into an entrenched nearby position where it can bombard the castle from afar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters are a special forces team that have been &amp;ldquo;volunteered&amp;rdquo; for the dubious honor of being dropped behind enemy lines with the task of finding a way into the castle from the rear, sneaking into the castle, and then securing the war room and capturing the enemy officers to completely decapitate the enemy command and control in the area. The hope is this will break enemy morale forcing them to retreat from the region or surrender as they are cut off from support due to uncoordinated unit movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters are given a wide array of special weapons to choose from including flamethrowers, heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades, dynamite, sniper rifles, submachine guns, petrol bombs, or anything else they can think of. They also have a radio to call in air support as a distraction when they attempt to enter the enemy base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maps that work well with this scenario include our Western Keep for the aboveground castle, The Cellar (as the basement area just before getting to the War Room for a good old shootout), and finally the War Room where they must subdue the enemy officers through any means at their disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
