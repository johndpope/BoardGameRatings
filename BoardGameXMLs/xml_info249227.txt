							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wasteland Wanderers: Post-Apocalyptic Themed Classes For Fifth Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring a touch of class to a savage world. &lt;br/&gt;Wasteland Wanderers presents six all-new and modified classes designed to suit Post-Apocalyptic campaign worlds and pre-published settings. You could also find homes for these classes and their archetypes in modern, futuristic, or even fantasy settings with minimal conversion effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wasteland Wanderers contains 30 pages of classes and archetypes including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Savage, a class based on the SRD's Barbarian with post-apocalyptic appropriate archetypes including the Implacable Hunter, the Mad Gunner, and the Survivor.&lt;br/&gt;    The Scientist, a new class which focuses on intellect and expertise. Archetypes include the Chem Cook, the Engineer, and the Programmer. &lt;br/&gt;    The Scoundrel, a class based on the SRD's Rogue with post-apocalyptic appropriate archetypes including the Con Artist, the Hitman, and a nonmagical variant of the Thief. &lt;br/&gt;    The Scout, a new class that fills a niche similar to the SRD's Ranger. These wilderness experts rely on their Instinct to enhance their fortunes, and wield a signature weapon known as their Old Reliable. Archetypes include the Beast Hunter, the Bounty Hunter, and the Guerilla.&lt;br/&gt;    The Shepherd, a new class that fills a niche similar to the SRD's Bard. They are political leaders, officers, and other inspiring figures. They use their Command to deal psychic damage, restore hit points, and charm or frighten foes. With their Comrades' Bond, nearby allies who are adjacent to each other can choose to suffer damage on each other's behalf. Archetypes include the Chronicler, the Commander, the Regent, and the Tyrant.&lt;br/&gt;    The Soldier, a class based on the SRD's Fighter with post-apocalyptic appropriate archetypes including the Fist Fighter, the Pit Fighter, and the Sharpshooter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
