			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of 100 different nutritional supplements that could be found by players, whether from looting an appropriate venue, such as a health food shop, after an apocalyptic event, or simply used as scene dressing during a normal adventure. In the former case, they may prove to be very useful if the setting uses a sufficient degree of realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplements have details on how they are obtained and what they are used for (Note: These uses are for entertainment purposes only; if you want to use supplements, consult an appropriate professional!). Supplements may be combined and used together, and can be found in many different forms, such as tablets, capsules, caplets and powders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;57. Lemon Balm (Medicinal herb, used to relief mild anxiety symptoms, aid sleep and mild digestive complaints such as flatulence and bloating)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
