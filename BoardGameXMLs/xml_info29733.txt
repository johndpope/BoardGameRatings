			<description>From the box: A mad game of well-mannered monster mayhem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Gargoyle has a strange collection of pets. They are some of the weirdest looking creatures you have ever seen. General Gargoyle sometimes has a bit of trouble controlling his crazy creatures - it's the third time this week that the monsters have sneaked out, and the General has enlisted your help to catch them all, for which he is offering a reward!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So catch as many monsters as you can! But beware, the reward that the General is offering is extremely generous, so others will be trying to capture the monsters too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
