			<description>For Tyler Scindere, a lowlife thug-for-pay, his most recent unsavory job may be his last. The victim of a double-cross, Tyler has become a living science experiment, caught in a perpetual hell of pain, hallucinations, and despair. But just as time loses its meaning and Tyler begins to lose his mind, a sliver of hope appears... from an unlikely ally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Screams from Within is a fixed 60 card Asylum Pack that contains 20 different never-before-seen cards based on the dark mythos of master horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, designed to augment existing decks and add variety to the Call of Cthulhu metagame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this cycle is part five of a gripping new short story by Nate French. In the last installment, Erin Morai was trapped in a supernatural menagerie of horrifying beasts, surviving on revolting scraps and subject to mind-bending psychological experiments. Now, we return to the plight of her kidnapper, Tyler Scindere. With his eyes ripped from their sockets, Scindere is horrified by the fact that he is still able to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrender your mind to the will of your captors...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a stand-alone deck; you must have additional Call of Cthulhu LCG cards to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
