			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game about how money began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pink Pebbles takes players back to a world without money.  Players begin as primitive farmers, trying to produce everything they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there's an entrepreneur in every crowd - and some of the players soon begin to barter, trying to swap extra things they've made.  The successful players become specialists and store owners.  That's where the pink pebbles come in.  Any good store needs some form of money....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the most pink pebbles with at least two stores at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
