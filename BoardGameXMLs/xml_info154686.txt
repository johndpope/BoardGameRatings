			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantastic Heroes &amp;amp; Witchery is a simulacrum of the well known role-playing game that features fighters, clerics and magic-users prowling mysterious dungeons, and combating dragons to take their treasures. It is not a clone of a particular edition, but a combination of several editions, to which were added a lot of options. In fact, if you are already acquainted with a previous version of the game, this one is very similar, and thus you already know the rules. As such, most adventures published for earlier editions of the game or its clones, are usable with Fantastic Heroes &amp;amp; Witchery, as well as spells, monsters, game master's manuals and supplements, plus related campaign settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
