			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mischievous spirits of the forests called Kitsune have enraptured and bedeviled the Tatakama&amp;rsquo;s mortal men and women for centuries. Kitsune begin their lives as ordinary field foxes, but those who are clever and survive fifty years of thefts, chases and daring exploits undergo a startling transformation. As the first moon&amp;rsquo;s light of their fiftieth year touches the fox, its fur recedes, revealing milk white skin, its paws become larcenous hands and its thoughts become those of a human&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kitsune like nothing better than tempting priests from their vows, dragging heroes on tavern crawls lasting weeks, and otherwise thumbing their noses at stodgy human laws and custom. Though mischievous and more than a little greedy, Kitsune enjoy the company of humans, and often spend decades among human friends and lovers. Most are fairly good hearted, and will take time out from their schemes and carousing to put an end to predatory oni they encounter. Kitsune have always protected humanity, whether or not humans want this protection, and consider their thefts to be fair repayment for their courage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
