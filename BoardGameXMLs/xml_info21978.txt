			<description>Taken from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Played with gloriously illustrated Character and Prompt cards and a variety of quotations from Shakespeare.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a light game of memory and card collection requiring a familiarity with Shakespeare's plays.  It is best suited to play after a dinner party.  Match Prompt and Character cards to your Quotation cards to create sets.  The first to match all their cards into sets wins.  There are 30 sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two levels of difficulty, which give different methods of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The easy method requires players to complete a Shakespeare quote by filling in the missing word(s) on a Quote card, from a Prompt card and matching them to a Character card.  The mechanics of acquiring cards is similar to the children's card game Go Fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game the mechanics are similar to Happy Families but a good knowledge of Shakespeare is required to get you the cards you desire.  If attempting to obtain a Quote card from another player one has to recite the quote in full and be &amp;quot;Dead Letter Perfect&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both types of game the mechanics may well be based on children's games, but it is unlikely to appeal to children due to the subject matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
