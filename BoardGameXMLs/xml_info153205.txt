			<description>Mazemaster is a 2-4 player game where stone, zombies, dragons and even physics are merely obstacles to be surpassed as you build, fight and wend your way through a maze of your own construction in order to claim the legendary Relic. Starting from the very edge of the mountain, you &amp;ndash; a mage on a mission &amp;ndash; must use your powers not only to make your way to the centre, but also to impede and slow down your opponents through myriads of magical trickery - rotating their mazes into dead ends, burning their caverns, or even outright destroying what they create - all in order to ensure that the only wizard making it to the centre is you and you alone. But beware, not only do you have to make it to the centre, you have to make it out again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With up to 3 other mages trying to stop you, that may not be such an easy feat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for Mazemaster are simple. At the beginning of every turn, players select up to three action cards they wish to use once the turn begins. These could be anything from as simple as move and build to cards that allow a player to rotate other player&amp;rsquo;s maze tiles, teleport them across unbridgeable gaps or even to destroy their path altogether. Each player, when selecting the actions they are going to take, can&amp;rsquo;t just think about what they plan to do; they also have to remember to try and slow down any player that may be ahead of them, or even preparing for a dastardly piece of magical trickery coming their way from an opponent, even as they try to make their way to the centre of the map, wherein lies the relic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaching the relic, however, isn&amp;rsquo;t the end; your wizard has his powerful new weapon, but he needs to get out of the mountain in order to understand how to use it! And chances are, if you reached it first, your fellow players may not be too keen on letting you escape so easily!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
