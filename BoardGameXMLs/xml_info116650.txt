			<description>Evening Star is a vector graphics Train Simulation type game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Amstrad CPC. This game is the sequel to Southern Belle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to successfully get the &amp;quot;Evening Star&amp;quot; from Bath to its destination Bournemouth on the old Somerset and Dorset line. The objectives are keeping to the tight timetable, earning points for safety and economy, and obeying signals. Stops are made at stations along your route to pick up passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically the game was an improvement on the sister game &amp;quot;Southern Belle&amp;quot;. There were lots more curves included along the line, along with additional lineside buildings and features. Also, the steepness of the gradients was much improved, though this was only because the Somerset and Dorset line was much hillier than the Brighton line. However, the gameplay remained pretty much identical to that of &amp;quot;Southern Belle&amp;quot;, and the two games were similar enough for the casual gamer to mistake one game for the other. That said, the average railway enthusiast was able to see the improvements which were featured on &amp;quot;Evening Star&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Evening Star (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
