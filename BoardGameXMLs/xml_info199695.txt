							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yon Paradox</name>
									
			<description>Yon Paradox ​is a first-person action-puzzle videogame based on a time machine which, at regular intervals rewinds the time, without changing the player location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At every time jump a new yourself will be born​, and he&amp;rsquo;ll replicate all the actions you previously did. The player objective is to solve mini-puzzles in order to collect &amp;ldquo;YonGears&amp;rdquo;, required to fix the faulty virtual dimension, which is causing the recurrent time rewinds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In doing so, the player needs to avoid being detected from his alter egos​to not cause mortal space time paradoxes, creating a sort of &amp;ldquo;multiplayer against yourself&amp;rdquo;. As the game progresses, multiple alter-egos will be present at the same time, gradually increasing the difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is able to freely move in the 3D space, and he can also grab or activate objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has to reach the final room​where he can stop the faulty time-machine, that is causing the dimension to time-rewind every 3 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In doing so, he has to collect enough​YonGears ​to unlock the doors which grant access to various sections of the virtual dimension, to reach the final room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every 3 minutes​(or 2 ad medium difficulty, and 1 at hard), a time-rewind occurs​. When this happens, the player location is preserved, but the time goes back to the beginning. A new clone of the player is generated​, which will repeat all of his actions, as he did previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will have to avoid to be seen from his clones​at all cost, or he will cause a mortal time-space paradox, causing the game over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To obtain YonGears, the player has to solve little puzzles. Every puzzle solved will give a YonGear as reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
