							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The KEY to Effective  Meetings</name>
									
			<description>The game introduces the learners to  hands on experience by role-playing as a participant in a meeting. Learners will be able to identify the functions, requirements, and characteristics of effective meetings. If used as part of school curriculum, the game would be played after the learners were introduced to the topic and key elements of an effective meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to leave one of their colored Keys in all six Meeting Rooms, gets to advance to the Executive Board Room and is crowned the winner. Along the way the players rely on a good roll of the die and their knowledge of effective meeting roles. Chips are collected and may be traded in for the opportunity to advance to a Meeting Room. If the player answers their Meeting Room Card question correctly, they get to leave one of their colored keys in that Meeting Room. Players must watch out for Surprise spaces. Surprise Cards may require them to lose a chip or lose a turn. Surprise Cards may also reward the player by gaining an extra chip or roll of the die. If a player lands on a Meeting Content space, they must answer a Content Card question correctly to get a playing chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
