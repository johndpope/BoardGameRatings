							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seas of Chaos</name>
									
			<description>Tiamat, the sea God of Chaos, is displeased. Fishermen and sailors used to pay homage to Taimat in turn for fair seas and little trouble. However, the sailors have grown comfortable and neglected to respect Tiamat. In an effort to regain the control she once had, Tiamat has entrapped random sailors in her ever-changing seas of chaos. Forcing these sailors to turn to a life of piracy, they will have to navigate ever changing seas, explore ocean, plunder treasure and fight each other to survive! Only the most successful and rich sailor turned pirate will be set free from her chaotic world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each start with a simple vessel and gradually gain stats to build their vessel in different categories to develop their own strategy to win. Players can upgrade their speed, hull size, defense, and attack. The more treasure you collect, you advance your Pirate Rating. The first player to a Pirate Rating of five, triggers game end. The winner is the player with the highest value of treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is modular. The modular hexagonal tiles consist of different islands and treasure that need to be discovered to come into play. There are islands that contain treasure, repair docks, Merchant ports where you can buy Merchant cards to help you on your travels, or empty islands that complicate your sailing. There are also open ocean tiles and whirlpools. Whirlpools also give you cards, of which most have negative effects on your ship or others. The games starts with everyone on the main island. Once a player starts sailing, they discover the modular game tiles as them move. The tiles are pulled at random from a shuffled deck to keep the gameboard different for every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While a player navigates the treacherous waters, they are on the lookout for treasure. Once a player finds their treasure, they will plunder it from an island, and bring it back to the starting Island in which they will bury the treasure for safe keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
