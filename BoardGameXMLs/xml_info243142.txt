			<description>Craits (sometimes spelled Crates or Creights) is a card game played by anywhere between two and five players. It was invented in the 1970s in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is derived from Crazy Eights; in fact, the name Craits is derived from Crazy Eights itself. Craits is similar to the marketed game Uno, which has its own specialized deck, and many cards assume the functions of Uno's specialized cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. When it is your turn, you may play a card from your hand that matches either the suit or the rank of the most recent card played. If you cannot (or choose not to ) play, you draw instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many cards have additional effects, such as forcing other players to draw, reversing the direction of play, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
