			<description>Checkered Flag is similar in nature to Formula-1 and Speed Circuit.  Players choose their cars speed on a dashboard and move one space for every 20 miles per hour.  The same dashboard is used to track fuel usage, tire wear and brake wear.  Players also have a small hand of five cards that provide certain benefits when played.  Unlike the other two games, Checkered Flag simulates stock car racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that speeds are more constant in stock car racing, there are only three speed choices; 60, 120 and 180 miles per hour.  At the beginning of the race and after a pit stop, cars start off at 60.  In the two turns, the maximum speed is 120.  The turns drive the primary choices available, as some lanes provide a shorter path than others.  The choice lanes have a cost in fuel usage or tire wear.  The first car to complete three laps wins the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
