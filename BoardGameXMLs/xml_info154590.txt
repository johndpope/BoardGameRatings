			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;This is a short supplement for the Covert Ops role-playing game. It can be used with the setting provided in brief within the core rulebook (SECTOR) or can be used in any setting you desire. Since this supplement is settingless, it uses the generic term &amp;ldquo;Command&amp;rdquo; to refer to the player operatives&amp;rsquo; organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using this optional supplement, starting operatives have a more defined role and responsibility within a team. Additionally, it provides for a way to glue together some of the perhaps underused features in the GM Operations Manual, tying them in specific ways to operatives based on their skillset. It also provides an avenue for operatives to have code numbers like secret agents found in cinema.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
