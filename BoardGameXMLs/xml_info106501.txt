							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghoulash: The Last Game on Earth Board Game</name>
									
			<description>You live in a world that has become infested with a mysterious green, glowing substance called Malectoplasm. When activated by the presence of a living being, the Malectoplasm grows and morphs into the deadly, soulless creature of destruction known as a Ghoul!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're one of an intrepid band of courageous Ghoul Hunters, setting out to find and destroy the Ghouls before they can attack and kill innocent humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the world of GHOULASH: The Last Game on Earth, the game of intense adventure and challenging strategies that drops you into a dangerous arena where every decision you make could be your last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your quest to locate and destroy the malevolent Ghouls, you'll fall into deep Holes, be crushed by deadly Debris and struggle to find First-Aid Kits before you die from your wounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Ghoul Battle brings Victory Points if you kill the Ghoul or wounds if you're defeated. The first player to 10 Victory Points wins! Take too many wounds from the Ghouls, however, and you're dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the identities of characters from the GHOULASH Adventures series of short stories and web comics. These scientists, soldiers and Ghoul Hunters are members of the Aberration Deterrent and Eradication Forces (ADEF). Each character possesses unique advantages that help the player during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are won with the use of Value cards; you attempt to outmatch the Ghoul's strength with your own. Beware, however: Your opponents can challenge you in your battles and throw obstacles in your path!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four two-sided game tiles can be arranged in hundreds of configurations, ensuring that no two adventures are ever the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding to the adventure are Scenarios, special adventure conditions that can be incorporated into the game to add additional obstacles, weapons and strategies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
