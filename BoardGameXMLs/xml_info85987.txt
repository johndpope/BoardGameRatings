			<description>David Robinson Supreme Court is a Sega Genesis video game that received lukewarm praise during its release in the early 1990s. The name is based on former NBA player David Robinson and features four different fictional teams from the United States of America. This game was developed with the help of the late Mark Haigh-Hutchinson from the United Kingdom. In Japan, this game was released as David Robinson Basketball (デビッド・ロビンソン バスケットボール)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three modes: exhibition, playoffs, and role-playing mode. Winning the role-playing mode allows the player to play against an all-star team of players chosen by David Robinson himself. The view is diagonal with all directions of the Sega Genesis controller being used. David Robinson was in his prime when the game was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the game was not released without major bugs. When playing in a tournament, using too many timeouts could freeze the game. This would require a hard reset in order to restart the game. Despite using David Robinson's name and using most of rules of basketball, a legitimate license from the NBA was never granted. All players and teams are fictional and the coaches and the league commissioner are nameless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;David Robinson's Supreme Court&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
