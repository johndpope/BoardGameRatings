			<description>An Icehouse battle of wizards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T&amp;ouml;framenn is an Icehouse game for two players, requiring stackable Icehouse pyramids and a chessboard. Each player will also need one coin or other marker for use as an Archmage token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one stash of 15 pyramids, five small, five medium, and five large. However, unlike other Icehouse games each player's stash may use any number of colors. (Both players may even have some pyramids of matching colors!) Multiple colors are almost always desirable, but no color has an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules Link&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
