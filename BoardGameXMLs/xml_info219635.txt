							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wrath of Solrac Votan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;52 pages of full-color photographs, maps, illustrations and details of the Pyramids of Mexico, UFOs in flight over the Pyramids, details of alien spacecraft, space drugs, the Mexican Army, subterranean dinosaurs and a massive cyst beneath the Mexican Pyramid plateau. For Labyrinth Lord/Mutant Future Free AD&amp;amp;D retro-clone. An adventure for 2-5 modern characters level 9-20 totaling 40-45 levels (Sample characters with full equipment included). June 20th, 2016 A.D.: Over 3,000 tourists are killed at Teotihuacan by a blinding, searing light. The bodies remain bleaching in the sun, unable to be recovered by authorities. What is the mystery of Teotihuacan and its strange ziggurats dedicated to Solrac Votan??? On June 20th as over 3,000 visitors crowded the Avenue of the Dead of the Teotihuacan, the solar god of the Votan &amp;ndash; Solrac Votan &amp;ndash; returned in a burning, incinerating intervention. Solrac Votan, god of the Votans, immediately inhabited the Temple of the Sun in its lower chambers and began his cosmic countdown: in exactly 6 months Solrac Votan will burst from the ziggurat and rampage across the Earth, destroying it with the additional powers he has meanwhile gained. With the solar intervention of Solrac Votan on the Avenue of the Dead at Teotihuacan on the June 20th solstice, Mexican military authorities established a 6 mile radius cordon perimeter around the site. No one will be allowed to enter this cordon except the player character party who have been assembled secretly by the Mexican government to penetrate the site and discover what is going on. The characters will be allowed to penetrate this military cordon freely to attempt to enter the various pyramidal step ziggurats that dot the site of Teotihuacan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
