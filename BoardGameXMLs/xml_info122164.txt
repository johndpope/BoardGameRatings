							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Veno&#039;s Aviation Race O&#039;er Land and Sea</name>
									
			<description>An early C20th magazine advertising insert for Veno's cough cure, featuring a board game. All playing pieces have to be cut out and pasted to card. The pieces are all types of flying machine, a Veno, Farman, Latham, Wright and Zeppelin. I didn't know there was a plane called a Veno but obviously the publishers decided this was an opportunity too good to miss and thus made an aviation-linked game.&lt;br/&gt;The spinner with &amp;lsquo;hand&amp;rsquo; pointer must be assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take off from Manchester and 20 squares later, you return to Manchester. The first to arrive on Square 20, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
