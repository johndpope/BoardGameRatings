							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nightstalker of Markesh</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Markesh was founded eighty-five years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It began when Agelmund Greybeard built his castle where the Annis River joins the mighty Mithil River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agelmund Greybeard was a strong, energetic man. He was also an ambitious man.  Serving in the King&amp;rsquo;s army did little to satisfy his hunger for adventure and fame.  Being born into the lower middle class gave him little hope of ever rising higher than the rank of captain, even though he was one of the most gifted men in the realm in the art of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Greybeard could take it no longer, he struck out on his own to find riches and wonders.  He took with him a dozen good men from is company and they traveled west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
