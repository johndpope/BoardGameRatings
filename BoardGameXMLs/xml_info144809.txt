							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armored: The Art of War</name>
									
			<description>Armored: The Art of War is a card game based on accurate US Army doctrine.  All aspects of military decision making processes will be encompassed; combat troops to medics, logistics and even finance will add intricate layers to the game for advanced players and quick combat bonuses described in detail for beginners. With smooth game play and tactical decision making, you will enter the world of the military commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even with its military structure, Armored will appeal to all those who have no military experience and just enjoy card games.  Whether you enjoy creating multiple decks, each with their own playing style or just having your primary deck that dominates your opponents - Armored will engage you.  From the beginning steps of creating your deck and identifying your playing style to the actual battle, all your favorite card game experiences are still there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card, one asset is shown along with the accurate information for that vehicle, weapon system, troop or other asset such as stats and associated military symbology. Much like other card games, Armored is played with 'Attack' and 'Defense' stats. Specific to military requirements of movement and weapons, 'Range' and 'Weight' have been added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armored can be played with 2 or more players on a tabletop or map. Each player has a minimum of three rows that are active within the game. It is within these rows that assets are introduced and maneuvered onto the playing field. Columns have been included to create a grid structure required as assets advance, retreat and evade their opponent. The majority of the individuals who will play Armored will use standard approaches based on deck preference and card stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
