							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walled City of Vandosia</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the seat of power in the Duchy of Starryshade! This large city is where the Archduke Meldor Gantrius IV rules his land. A walled city on the bay, Vandosia is bustling with activity. A busy seaport sits down the road from the fortified city with regional farmers coming into town every day. Many former adventurers call the city home and training guilds are available for those levelling up. While &amp;ldquo;mostly&amp;rdquo; safe this city is not without adventure, especially with the massive sewer system below the streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Duchy of Starryshade Campaign. It is useful for any level of adventuring party.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a setting in your campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
