			<description>Nice little 'Stacking Game' by a small game company that specialized in 'wooden games'. Game consists of 48 round wooden sticks and a die. Beginning of the game all wooden pieces lie next to each other flat on the table. On his turn a player has to roll the die and put the rolled number of wooden pieces from either end on top of the others. If this causes some sticks to &amp;quot;roll away&amp;quot; etc. the player collects one penalty stick that scores negative points according to its color. Once a player reaches a certain number of points the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
