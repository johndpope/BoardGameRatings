							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diabolik: il Colpo Perfetto</name>
									
			<description>Diabolik - il Colpo Perfetto is a board game based on an Italian comic series about a master thief.  The players assume the roles of characters on opposing sides in this game.  On one side are the title character, Diabolik, and his sidekick/wife, Eva Kant.  On the other are Dane and his criminal gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the players in control of Diabolik and Kant is to steal one of the objects on the board and escape unscathed.  Dane and his gang are to prevent the theft and capture the thieves.  The object of theft is randomly chosen (drawing a Mission card) at the start and kept secret from the criminals.  Players can play cards to help themselves or impede their opponents, e.g. deploying and disarming traps.  The die makes movement and the effects of certain cards random affairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a side has won by achieving its objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
