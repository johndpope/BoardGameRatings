							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Match Day II</name>
									
			<description>Match Day II is a football sports game part of the Match Day series released for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MSX and Commodore 64 platforms. It was created in 1987 by Jon Ritman with graphics by Bernie Drummond and music and sound by Guy Stevens (except for the Commodore version, that was a line by line conversion to the extent made by John Darnell).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controls consist of four directions (allowing eight directions including diagonals) and a shot button. Each team has seven players, including goalkeeper and there are league and cup options available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is highly addictive due to its difficulty level, the complete control over ball direction, power and elevation (using a Diamond Deflection System), and the importance of tactics and player positioning over the field (barging if necessary), which makes it challenging to break strong defences. Was the first game to use a kickometer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Match Day II,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
