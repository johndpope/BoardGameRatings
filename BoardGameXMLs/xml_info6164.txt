							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Quest Card Game: Battle Arena</name>
									
			<description>Based off the Dragon Quest series of video games. This is basically a variant on the classic card game, War. Each card has 4 monsters printed on it, one each of four different colors. The dealer shouts out the color for the round, and everyone plays their card; the highest number in that color wins the round and the cards. You play out 7 fights in a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get 1 point for each fight you win. Before each round, you predict how many fights you'll win. If you end up being correct, you'll get 10 bonus points for the round. You can play to a set number of rounds or until a set number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
