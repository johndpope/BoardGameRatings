			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players aim to score as many points as possible by crossing existing lines of the opponent on an 8x8 board. Each player starts at one edge of the board (the starting field is the second to the right).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player can draw in his colour a straight line crossing orthogonally one or two fields, or a bent line (one field crossed - corner on the next field - one field crossed). Spaces with corners or crossed both vertically and horizontally can't be crossed anymore. For each enemy line crossed a player scores one point. If one player's line can't be continued, they can start from another &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; square at their edge of the board. Play goes on until all players have used up their eight possible starting fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
