			<description>&amp;quot;In 1819 Simon Bolivar led his army across the Andes and began the campaign to liberate Colombia (New Granada) from Spanish rule.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;He achieved his goal with the decisive battle of Boyaca. Simon Bolivar's rebel army launched a surprise attack which cut the royalist army in half as they crossed a bridge. The Spanish were routed, opening the road to Bogota. Battle of Boyaca Day is celebrated in Colombia every August 7.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniatures wargame is intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base, except for commanders which are mounted singly. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Units portrayed in the game include infantry, cavalry, militia, rifles, and cannon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
