			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Outsmart other corporate wheeler dealers and avoid bankruptcy! Capitalize on the ups and downs of a fluctuating economy! Climb the corporate ladder and become a megabucks big shot!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll and move around the game board buying chairs in various companies or triggering a range of events such as Depression, Inflation, Boom and Bust.  Interestingly, the game time is set at the beginning.  The winner is the player with the most cash on hand combined with the current value of the various chairs of each company they're on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an Australian game and most of the companies are either Australian or multi-national.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
