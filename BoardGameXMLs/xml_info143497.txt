			<description>A circus-themed roll-and-move game with a memory element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to reach the finish space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a racing course consisting of coloured spaces, each showing one of 10 different symbols. 10 chips show the same symbols on one side. The chips are randomly distributed in the middle of the board, face down. Each player gets a pawn, which they place at the start space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the colour die. The active player moves his/her pawn to the next space of that colour. Then he/she has to turn over one of the chips. If it shows the same symbol as the space this player's pawn is currently on, they get to stay. If it is a different symbol, they have to move back to the space with that symbol.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the finish space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
