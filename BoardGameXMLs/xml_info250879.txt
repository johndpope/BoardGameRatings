			<description>Movies is a card game for 2 to 4 players in which you take control of a film producing company, competing with each other to produce the best releases and the most awarded movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you risk your money on that particular starring couple or will you rely on more versatile secondary actors? It&amp;rsquo;s for you to choose how you will be remembered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years are simulated during the game, one year per round, which are then divided in trimesters or turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every trimester players may:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Buy an Actor or a Director card on the table, paying a variable cost that depends on few factors.&lt;br/&gt;     Buy or sell a Studio, which allows the player to produce more movies.&lt;br/&gt;     Buy or sell Screenplays, to a maximum of five at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has two Actors and one Director he finds suitable for a particular Screenplay he may produce a movie, which can last between 1 and 3 years. When the end of the year comes, players may premiere the movies that finished production. Players calculate the income of each premiered movie and the number of awards it receives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the game is a combination of how many credits a player has at the end and the awards he received for his premiered movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
