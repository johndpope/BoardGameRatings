			<description>Beach Maze comes in a canvas bag.  The roll-up board has to be set up to play: stretch the canvas board over the provided sticks and legs, and it makes a little table that not only stands up well on the beach, it actually requires sand to stand up well as it's a little wobbly on its own...  The pieces are all wooden, and there are no cards to lose or get wet - it really does play well at the beach.  (You can just lay the canvas board flat on your gaming table if not at the beach.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has four baby turtles, just hatched, which must get to the sea.  These start on your edge of the board, on little cracked-egg spaces.  First player to get all four turtles off the board wins.  (The sea is represented by a space at the center of the board, a little disconcerting ...)  Each turn you roll one die and move any one turtle the number showing, with no backtracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other wooden pieces on the board are dunes.  You cannot cross a dune: you have to land on one exactly.  In so doing, you remove it from the board and must place it on some other space.  Your best option, of course, is somewhere that blocks your opponent ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on an opponent's turtle sends it back to a start space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of the dune pieces have crabs on the back, which can be used in an optional rule.  (Crabs are the enemies of newly hatched baby turtles ...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
