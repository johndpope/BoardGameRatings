			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build amazing relationships between your heroes and NPCs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Relationships takes the expanded relationship rules introduced in Ultimate Relationships from Legendary Games and brings them to glorious life for players of the official published Far East Adventure Path for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. In this product you will find detailed relationship links for each of the four primary NPCs that accompany the PCs on their long journey to the Eastern Kingdoms, one each for the Caravan Master, Destined Empress, Elven Protector, and Mystic Seer, complete with boons, affinity notes, gifts and interactions, and dynamically interactive relationship ranks for each character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides a fantastic model for constructing relationship ranks, affinities, and more in your own campaign, even if you're not using the Far East Adventure Path. Any campaign is a long journey physically and metaphorically, for the inner journey that each character takes along the way can help them progress and evolve into someone different than they were at the beginning. With Imperial Relationships, your PCs can forge deep and lasting connections with the characters they meet along their journey together. With their lives and fates intertwined, your game will never be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
