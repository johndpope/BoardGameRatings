							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>A fast two-player abstract strategy stacking game with a theme and a twist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Designer&amp;rsquo;s note: Alchemy was created as a simple game to thank the gamer community and fans of Symbol. Alchemy is played with one player&amp;rsquo;s basic set of pieces from Symbol, and thus provides a clever way to determine first player for a game of Symbol or can be played as a separate stand alone game for those who want a quick match that is easy to learn, almost impossible to solve, fun, and mathematically very interesting; though a new and unique game, Alchemy shares some ideas and mechanics with other stacking strategy games and members of the NIM family of games.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players represent dueling alchemists trying to make chemical reactions with the Aristotelian elements (earth, water, air, fire), and a fifth, unstable element of destruction.  Alchemists want to create gold, but they never could figure out how to create gold, so instead the players are fighting over a single gold coin by alternating turns making new combinations of elements.  When on a player&amp;rsquo;s turn no new combinations are possible, that player loses the round.  The first player to win two rounds in a row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
