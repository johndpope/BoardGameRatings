			<description>This game of &amp;quot;life, buddies and love&amp;quot; very loosely ties into a Swedish comic of the same name aimed at pre-teens. Before playing, all players write down their answers to some &amp;quot;embarrassing question&amp;quot; and these are placed in an envelope. During play, the roll of a die and movement of a communal piece determines what happens in a round. Activities include charades (get points for making the other players guess which persona you're acting out a particular scene as), trivia (everyone can get a point for answering a true-or-false question), a personal question (you get a point just for giving an answer), nothing (because there's nothing like losing your turn), and arbitrary events such as gaining points or losing your next turn (because there's nothing like effectively losing two turns). Once someone has 19 points they win and get to look at the answers in the envelope before anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
