							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crown: City of the Fallen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different themes in Crown, but some are more important than others. These themes bring a certain flavor and mood to the city and help define its citizens. The GM should feel free to introduce new themes to the city and game as he sees fit, but these will hopefully provide him with some inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crown is a home of adventurers and it could be argued that they are indeed the reason why the city is so prosperous. They serve the city and the Queen, and must pay a monthly due to the coffers of Crownmeet Castle, which helps maintain the Crown Watch and the great castle. In return the adventurers become a free people, who are very rarely, if ever, bothered by the Watch and always welcome at Crownmeet. Sometimes they are even invited by Queen Alayarra herself.&lt;br/&gt;Adventures are easily found throughout this magnificent city, and can be as exotic as hunting down a strange bird that has escaped from the Arcane Tower, to stopping a gang of thieves who are terrorizing one of the wards. But the party will never be alone, and at the many inns and taverns, they meet other adventurers and share stories, perhaps exchanging gear and important information that will eventually lead to new adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Faith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people believe that Crown is a city with little or no faith, but this is not true. One could even argue that the city has become more faithful and devoted with the Great Banishment of the Forgotten Gods, which forced the people to see the gods as they really were, although their faces continue to remain hidden in the shadows. Adventurers, champions and devoted is constantly searching for the answers that will help bring the gods back to the surface where they will hopefully heal the broken heart of the Crownfolk. These seekers find all the answers they seek below the surface, in mighty Tal Vorglath, a place that might even prove to be a little too dangerous even for an experienced band of adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Intrigue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crown is a city of free people, as long as they do not oppose the Queen too strongly that is, and there are many factions that constantly vie for power. This makes Crown the ideal setting for a campaign of intrigue, as nobles are constantly fighting each other in the secret, hoping to gain even greater wealth and power. But the nobles are not the only ones who thrive on intrigue, the planetouched races and wererats are playing this game as well, establishing their bases above ground as well as below. You never know what lurks in the corners, and perhaps there is nothing innocent about a feast held at Crownmeet Castle, as the shadows start their deadly dance. In a game of intrigue, a smile may prove to be as lethal as any poisonous dagger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Secrets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shaedarsil was built on a foundation of secrets, and many of these remain undiscovered even so many years after its fall. There are some people, who have dedicated their entire lives to uncover these, but it may not prove to be such an easy task. Searching for these secrets often means going into Tal Vorglath and the dungeons below the old temple sites, which may have deadly consequences. But there are more secrets to be found in Crown, both above and below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
