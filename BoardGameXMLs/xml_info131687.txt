			<description>There was a small country called Verdite surrounded by a deep forest, encircled by fog and whirling winds. In ancient days, when a great battle was fought and many were dying, Verdite was saved by a person who then disappeared into the forest. Only the forest's drifting fog knew who this person was... The citizens called their savior the Dragon of the Forest and built a sanctuary and honored this person there. Eventually, only a legend remained and the Sanctuary was changed into the Royal Graveyard and all was silent. But, the legend says, &amp;quot;Someday the Dragon of the Forest shall return, bearing Magical Artifacts.&amp;quot; However, the time has not yet come and the Sanctuary sleeps deeply...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;King's Field&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
