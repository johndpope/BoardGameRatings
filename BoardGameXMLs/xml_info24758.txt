			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4th Quarter Touchdown Football challenges your ability to work as teammates, while providing you with the entertainment of a board game. Set up as teams to challenge your opponents with fast action game play. By matching the game cards and moving down the field, your objective is to outscore your opponents before time runs out. Each player will lay their cards on the board and try to match, when a successful match is made the board is cleared and the attempt on an offensive advance is made for a second consecutive match. The yardage cards provided will move you forward for the quick score, or move you backward for loss yardages. But watch out for the turnovers, these cards could allow your opponents to score. Watch as the anticipation mounts as each passing card chooses the fate of your team and your record&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes playing board, 64 playing cards, 40 home/away yardage cards, two game pieces, 100 score sheets, and a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
