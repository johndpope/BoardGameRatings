			<description>A simple dice rolling race around Australia in the immediate post-Federation period (1910s). Start in any state/federal capital. Roll one die to move. Get an extra roll if you land on a state/federal capital (square space). Lose a turn if you land on other towns (large circles). Return to you starting city on an exact roll to win. If a roll would land you on an already-occupied space, you don't move, and lose that turn.  &lt;br/&gt;The map shows the Northern Territory as still belonging to South Australia (not the Commonwealth, to whom it was handed oer in 1911). The space for Canberra is named simply 'Federal Capital', and not 'Canberra'. This suggests a date for the game of c.1903-1910. &lt;br/&gt;There are two known versions of the game, one featuring an illustration of a brown Wright flyer, and a later edition (probably immediately post-WWI) featuring an illustration of a red and yellow racing biplane. The game boards are otherwise identical, the map not being updated, only the aeroplane illustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
