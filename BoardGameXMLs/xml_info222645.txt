			<description>Guts and Glory is about ordinary people competing in extraordinary challenges of life and death!  Several possible game modes are planned, but the first is a &amp;quot;survival racing experience.&amp;quot;  Players will select from a wide variety of vehicles, including realistic bicycles, poorly built cars, and rocket-powered homemade contraptions.  They&amp;rsquo;ll race to the finish line dodging all sorts of hazards, including sawblade windmills, giant wrecking balls, medieval cannons and crazy turrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each vehicle is completely physics-driven, with 100% ragdoll riders, realtime dismemberment, and vehicle damage.  This means that every turn, every crash, and every death is unique&amp;mdash;and often results in hilarious scenarios!  Severed limbs spray blood all over nearby characters and the environment as you struggle to hang on and reach the finish line.  Vehicles get dented, smashed and lose parts.  Wheels can be popped or just knocked off completely.  Determined players on tough tracks will find themselves hobbling across the finish line bloodied, missing limbs, stuck full of arrows, on a smashed vehicle only one hit away from being incapacitated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CURRENT &amp;amp; PLANNED FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;Physics-driven vehicles with dynamic damage and destruction&lt;br/&gt;100% ragdoll riders, with realtime dismemberment, blood and guts everywhere&lt;br/&gt;Destructible props and environments: smash through windows, thin walls, fences, barrels, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Level Editor and Level Sharing, with Steam Workshop integration&lt;br/&gt;AI Pedestrians that wander around, run away screaming, and die in hilarious fashions&lt;br/&gt;AI Enemies that chase you down with hell-bent fury&lt;br/&gt;Loads of Hazards: cannons, explosives, wrecking balls, circular saws and so much more&lt;br/&gt;Special Items: Mega Fans, Turbo Boosters, Zero Gravity Fields, and more&lt;br/&gt;Power-Ups: Boost Refills, Invincibility, and other surprises to come&lt;br/&gt;10 Unique Vehicles and their associated Heroes&lt;br/&gt;100 Official Tracks, spread across 10 Themed Maps, including other biomes&lt;br/&gt;Time of Day System: night races, glaring sun, or possibly even realtime changes during the race&lt;br/&gt;Steam Integration: Leaderboards, Achievements, Workshop, etc.&lt;br/&gt;You can see all the most current features at the Steam Store page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
