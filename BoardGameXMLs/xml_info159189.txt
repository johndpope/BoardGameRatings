							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cossacks II: Battle for Europe</name>
									
			<description>The Cossacks 2: Battle for Europe expansion pack was released in June 2006. It is a stand alone game, eliminating the need for the original version. Major changes to the game are to the Battle for Europe mode. At least 7 new provinces have been added to expand the map, in order to allow greater playability as well as to accommodate 3 new nations: Spain, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Confederation of the Rhine. A number of new historical battles were also added: Borodino, Leipzig and Waterloo, as well as campaigns played from the perspective of some of the great powers of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cossacks II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
