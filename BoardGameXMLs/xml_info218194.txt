			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penguin SLAP! is a last-man standing, penguin-slapping, family-friendly card game! Players assume the roll of penguins who slap each other with fish! (Slapping in the sense of playing a card, not physically slapping your opponents or the table) The last penguin holding fish is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 2 decks of cards, Penguin Personas cards and fish cards. Each player assumes the roll of one of the Penguin Personas cards. These personas are comical and give them special abilities in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 different colors (or suits) of fish cards. Red fish contain attack cards, yellow fish are counter-attack cards, blue fish help you draw more cards, and green fish are items and equipment. The fish cards are colored on both sides so you can see what color (or suit) of fish your opponents have, but you don't know exactly what *kinds* of fish they have. (Is that a red SLAP fish, or a red STEAL fish?) Each player also has two randomly-shuffled draw piles to choose from, so they can strategically pick which colored fish to draw depending on what's available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns catching and slapping each other with fish, but have to be careful! Their opponent could counter their slap back to them, increasing it's power! With 4 different colors of fish you can strategically build your hand to defend or attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
