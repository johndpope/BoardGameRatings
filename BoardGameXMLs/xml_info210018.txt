							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn is a science fantasy supplement for Dungeon World that combines the flavours of Johnstone&amp;rsquo;s Adventures on Dungeon Planet and the characters from Jackson Tegu&amp;rsquo;s Monsterhearts expansion, the Second Skins, into 368 full colour digest-sized pages, with dozens of illustrations, including art by Chiara Di Francia, George Cotronis, Iolanda Zanfardino, Jakub Rebelka, James Fenner, Jon Cairns, Nate Marcel, and Taylor Winder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn, Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Second Skins take to the stars in an epic tale of adventure, romance, and rivalry. Surrounded by devoted friends and perfidious foes, Space Wurm and Moonicorn wrestle for control over the fate of the galaxy. The future is in your hands. How will it end, and what will it cost you? Whose side are you on?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring six new Dungeon World character classes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Wurm, the most important person in the galaxy, bar none. And yet, there is more that lies outside your power than within it. Will you conquer the universe, or see it fall before your foes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Moonicorn, a rebel and a revolutionary. Those who despise your integrity are out there hunting for you. Can you make your dreams a reality, or will you have to watch it all come crashing down?&lt;br/&gt;    The Lover, the third point of a romantic triangle with Space Wurm and Moonicorn. Is this what true love is, or just a fleeting dream?&lt;br/&gt;    The Mogul, a master of industry. You&amp;rsquo;re not the boss of everything, but you&amp;rsquo;re the boss of your thing.&lt;br/&gt;    The Other, a visitor from far away. Can you find a place in this new world, or will you just lose your heart again?&lt;br/&gt;    The Spy, a double agent, a saboteur, a wolf in sheep&amp;rsquo;s clothing. Does anyone knows where your true allegiance lies? Do you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;and seven fronts, with four dangers each, for the GM to create the world and their antagonists from: aliens, cybernetics, the Imperial throne, interstellar travel, religion, the secret police, and the spice. Each game has three fronts that must be defeated in order to win. Who will reach their goal first and secure the future they are fighting for, Space Wurm or Moonicorn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Wurm and Moonicorn are rivals, fighting over the future of galactic civilization. Will they let the universe crumble around them while they duke it out? Will they band together against the outside forces trying to ruin everything? Which one will betray the other first, in order to secure the future they believe in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other PCs move between them, choosing sides or not, trying to mediate and reach consensus, or feeding the flames so they can watch it all burn. But neither Space Wurm nor Moonicorn can succeed alone. In order to win, they need the support of the other PCs. What will they do to win their loyalty? What&amp;mdash;and who&amp;mdash;will they sacrifice in order to come out on top?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn moves Dungeon World away from typical adventuring parties and us-against-the-dungeon situations, in favour of more intrigue, more politics, and more interpersonal conflict between the PCs. You&amp;rsquo;ll need your laser swords to defeat the alien invaders, but you&amp;rsquo;ll need something more to win over their hearts and minds. Each of the new character classes are there to promote narratives of interpersonal drama, political intrigue, and social change. They give the players reasons to experience the shifting allegiances of competing rivals, to win each other over and then turn against each other, again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's still Dungeon World, just with an expanded pallette, and more dimensions to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t commit to a long-term campaign, fear not! There are quick play rules for running one shot games of Space Wurm vs. Moonicorn, in the same style as Battle Between the Worlds. Quick play versions of the six Dungeon World character classes are joined by seven more classes: the Alien Queen, the Creature from the Ghoul Star, This Planet&amp;rsquo;s Messiah, the Serpent Princess, Space Ghost, the Star Vampire, and the Void Rat. Or use the characters from Battle Between the Worlds, these rules are fully compatibl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
