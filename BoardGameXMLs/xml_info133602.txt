			<description>Zomboozle: To throw someone to a zombie so that you can get away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zomboozle is a card game with a Euro chassis but a fun, sci-fi feel for two to five players that has players as neighbor captains in a zombie- and alien-ravaged world who are trying to become the Governor of Fornia (which is all that's left of California) by most effectively managing who gets in and out of their neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players attract human survivors to their neighborhood, then venture into The Wild to draw a new card. When a new card is selected, another player is dealt a card through a &amp;quot;Gifting&amp;quot; process. Thus, players must choose wisely when they select a card because they may be giving others a good card, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midway through the game, players score for the humans in their neighborhood &amp;ndash; counting themselves and dividing that number into The Human Alliance (people who reject the alien's attack) and the Neoxenophiliacs (those who embrace the extraterrestrials) &amp;ndash; while also scoring for having the fewest aliens and zombies in their little fiefdoms. Scoring happens again at the end of the game, with the winning player gaining the prestigious role of Governor of Fornia. (Okay, it's not that prestigious.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zomboozle is notable for being the first game with the &amp;quot;Gifting Mechanism&amp;quot;. When you draft a card, someone else gets a card as a result. The location of the card on a tableau or the information on the card might govern how the distribution occurs. This mechanism is in two other proposed games from 3Sided Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
