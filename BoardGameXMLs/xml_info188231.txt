			<description>Rise of the Gods is an expansion for Tides of Infamy, a mythological universe with a pirate theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rise of the Gods the Forge of the Gods has been awakened and with it the Ore of the Gods has started to flow.  Temples from which the Gods of the Seas derive their power are nearly complete.  Help complete construction by offering up the Ore of the Gods as tribute at a Temple of your choice to gain favor among the Sea Gods.  Use your otherworldly support to increase your acts of piracy as the most infamous Pirate of the ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Gods adds the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Acts of Piracy (Cards)&lt;br/&gt;     Power of the Gods (Cards)&lt;br/&gt;     Sea Monster (minifigure)&lt;br/&gt;     More Map Tiles&lt;br/&gt;     More Pirate Luck Cards&lt;br/&gt;     More Pirate Ships - can play up to 6 players (or 8 players with Kickstarter Exclusive edition of Tides of Infamy) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acts of Piracy are tasks taken on by Pirates that upon successful completion yield Marks of Infamy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Cards are received by paying tribute at a Sea God Temple. They award special abilities to your Pirate Ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sea Monster roams the board (using the same mechanic as the Ghost Ship in Tides of Infamy) engaging in battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
