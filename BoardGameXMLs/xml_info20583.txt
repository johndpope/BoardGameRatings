			<description>From the author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The rise of feudalism saw the continuation and subsequent peak in the rise of the armored cavalryman as masters of the battlefield. Most systems were centered around this element of the army. Battles such as Hastings tended to confirm their supremacy. By the fourteenth century there appeared in various nations trained infantrymen in numbers greater than previously hitherto. Battles such as Courtrai and Crecy were the first of many battles in which the infantry were to play increasingly decisive roles. Thus we see how the feudal system of castles and knights gave way to missiles and trained infantry. By 1500 gunpowder weapons were establishing a supremacy of their own, subsequent armies became balanced professional forces which are outside the scope of these rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance is a set of medieval 25mm miniature gaming rules that provides melee and ranged weapon attacks, terrain effects, leader rules, visibility and detection, unit formations, and morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
