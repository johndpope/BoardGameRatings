			<description>The game of picking, flicking and eating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your disgusting friends are sitting around picking your noses. That&amp;rsquo;s boring, so you decide to start flicking those little nasties at each other. That can get tiresome and kick up quite the appetite, so in between flicking you gotta eat a few to keep up your strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards from the Pick It! pile and decide whether they want to eat the good boogers (green) or flick the bad ones (red). Games are short and fast. To win, be the first player to eat enough green boogers or the last player standing, if you get too many red boogers you will be eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
