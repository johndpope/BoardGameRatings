			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can our heroes escape from the Clutches of the Crimson Emperor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adamant Entertainment is proud to present the fourth chapter in our first Serial Adventure, Crimson Emperor. Part of the Thrilling Tales line of pulp products for modern D20, the Serial Adventure is a five-part extended campaign, written by Walt Ciechanowski, and intended for a group of 1 to 3 player-characters of 10th through 12th level. The five weekly chapters of the Crimson Emperor can be played as parts of a larger story arc, or as stand-alone adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters uncovered a conspiracy by the mythical Crimson Emperor to control American mob bosses and influence the Presidential election. Their investigation led them to Tibet, where they discovered a mysterious chemical weapon that has wiped out an entire village. Unfortunately, they now find themselves captured by the Crimson Emperor's army!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
