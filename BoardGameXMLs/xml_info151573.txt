							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters: the Dog Soldier</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DragonCyclopedia Monsters: the Dog Soldier offers a new antagonist to throw at heroes in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&amp;reg; The dog soldier is a person who has been enslaved by the power of a cursed mask into being a mindlessly loyal warrior to his master. A truly evil villain may have many dog soldiers, each a dangerous monster as well as a victim of that same villain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are rules for the cursed mask that creates dog soldiers, and rules for freeing them from its grip, as well as three feats that can only be learned by a character who was once enthralled by the mask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
