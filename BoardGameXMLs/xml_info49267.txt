			<description>Planeto is a fun and entertaining family game that allows the players to learn about environmental issues. The game is a promotional item published by Agfa-Gevaert N.V. as a part of their environmental campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Planeto, the players are frogs that are trying to collect a set of ten picture cards and win the game. They do this by rolling a die and moving on the board in either direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture cards are gained by landing on a particular space and answering an environmentally themed trivia question correctly. The questions are multiple choices with three options. Answering the question incorrectly forces the player to discard an already collected picture card. Landing on other spaces allows the players to roll the die again or forces them to skip a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include a simpler variant for younger players that exludes the trivia cards from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planeto components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;1 board&lt;br/&gt;4 frog pawns&lt;br/&gt;40 picture cards&lt;br/&gt;220 trivia cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
