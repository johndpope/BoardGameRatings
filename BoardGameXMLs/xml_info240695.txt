							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zooloretto: Castor</name>
									
			<description>A promo expansion for Zooloretto. This promo was given out at the 2017 Ludo-Outaouais con. The promo is only available in French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion consists of one 1 tile with a beaver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the normal rules for Zooloretto, except:&lt;br/&gt;The first player to fill his 6-space enclosure gets the Beaver's enclosure as a bonus and place it below his zoo near his barn. This player keeps the Beaver's enclosure until the end of the game and cannot put any other tiles on it. The Beaver enclosure allows the player to move up to three animal tiles from one or more trucks to his barn as a commercial operation. This action does not cost him anything, but it can only be done once during the game. The player then receives a coin from the bank for each tile thus moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
