			<description>Coliseum of the Gods is a standalone card game suitable for two-to-eight players, aged 12 years and up. The game thrusts you into the arena as a powerful champion ready to do battle and destroy any opponents that stand in your way. A single game is designed to have variable lengths, ranging from ten minutes or up to an hour. It&amp;rsquo;s a competitive blast that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for play in between tournament rounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the normal rules for each card type, every card has a value. Once per turn, you're able to attack by discarding any card in your hand. The defending player then discards any numbers of cards. If the value of your attack is higher than the combined value of the defense, the defending player loses a portion of their health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
