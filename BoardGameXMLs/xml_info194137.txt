							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amazons vs Valkyries: The Amazon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Daughters of Aries and the Daughters of Odin&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mythic World of Chaos and War&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this file:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Banneret prestige class featuring the battle dance special ability. &lt;br/&gt;    The Amazon advanced class featuring the battle mastery and bloodlust abilities.  &lt;br/&gt;    Spell List for the Banneret &lt;br/&gt;    The Amazon's Special Mount (Pegasus) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history, culture, and social structure of the Amazon society is briefly outlined in this supplement along with details on a typical Amazon warrior's role as a member of an adventuring group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While anyone living in the Amazon nation is technically an Amazon, this supplement details the rules for the elite Amazon warriors, sometimes known as True Amazons, or Amazon Champions. These warrior women are light, fast fighters with wilderness skills and a deep affinity for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To become a True Amazon and gain a pegasus as a bonded mount, a character must first become a banneret and serve in the Amazon army as a sergeant, lieutenant, commander, or special operative. She must also carry the Hippolyta bloodline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bannerets and Amazons have an alignment restriction and a code of conduct which they must follow. Being the daughters of War and followers of Nature, they are often chaotic and sometimes evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up this supplement today and discover a whole new world of hyper-violence and debauchery; a high-magic, mythological world of Romans and Persians, Egyptians and Greeks where two legendary warrior cults are locked in an epic, endless clash of total war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
