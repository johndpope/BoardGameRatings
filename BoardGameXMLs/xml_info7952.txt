							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flat Cat</name>
									
			<description>Flat Cat  Parker Brothers. 1978. A children's game for ages 6-12. In this game, there are four tracks leading up toward Bowser's doghouse. Players (cats) move up the tracks toward the doghouse in order to get to the canary nesting on the top of the doghouse. For every space a cat moves, he/she must turn the chimney of the doghouse. Turn too many times, and Brutus shoots out of the doghouse and flattens your cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flat cat is a take off on games like Dynamite Shack, which was released in 1968. Basically, it's a &amp;quot;scare the pants off of you when the dog unexpectedly shoots out of the doghouse&amp;quot; game or suspense and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
