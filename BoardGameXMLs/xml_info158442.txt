							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tacky, Tawdry and Tasteless</name>
									
			<description>subtitle&lt;br/&gt;the Reality Show RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;Tacky. Tawdry. Tasteless. All of these words accurately sum up the &amp;ldquo;reality show&amp;rdquo; genre. Yet people continue to flock to their televisions in droves to tune in on the exploits of their favorite dysfunctional celebrities, outlandish &amp;ldquo;Guidos&amp;rdquo;, child pageant debutantes, or whatever other personalities are being shoved down our collective throats by the networks on any given day. Love it or hate it, this brand of trash TV has captured the imaginations of millions and continues to thrive despite all the negativity of the critics and late- night TV show hosts during their monologues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roleplaying game allows us to celebrate these train wrecks that have seemingly entranced the world with their flamboyance, sleaziness and willingness to blatantly wallow in their own debauchery. You and your friends will create your own &amp;ldquo;show&amp;rdquo; and play it out, trying desperately to get ratings! Will your show find its way to the top of the dung heap or will it get lost in the muck with the rest of the drivel? Only time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
