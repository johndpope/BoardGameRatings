			<description>Operation D-Day is a solitaire game of Combat in Europe during World War II. The player assumes the role of a commander of an Infantry Rifle Company during an Allied Amphibious Landing Operation. As the Company Commander, you are responsible for securing your Sector of Advance by successfully taking and holding key objectives with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE &lt;br/&gt;The objective of Operation D-Day is to successfully take and secure an number of key objectives and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the Allied Forces. Once all Objectives have been secured or the Campaign Deck is exhausted, the Campaign is considered over. The Player must then total his VP and compare this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: Operation D-Day is a fun and fast solitaire game filled with lots of action and replay value. If you enjoyed movies like &amp;quot;Saving Private Ryan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Band of Brothers&amp;quot;, or D-Day, you will enjoy this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
