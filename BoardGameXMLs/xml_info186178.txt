							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iconoclast: The World</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the dawn of the 22nd Century. Democracy has failed, having long since been replaced by a corporate mentality. Americorp and Eurocorp, on the verge of their second war over natural resources, are no longer the powers they once were. Globalization has led to a dispersal of resources and power. Money is the ultimate equalizer, and the ultimate goal; so much so that the value of the individual citizen has been all but erased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no names now. There are only faces that pass each other by, like whispers on a foggy night. You are only what they have in their file, a value hastily scribbled in a column in a long-forgotten database, a mere calculation. You don't have feelings. You don't have any worth other than what you can do for them. You are not a person. You aren't even a character. You are an object. A thing. You are an icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iconoclast World is presented as a series of HTML pages with several major text divisions, including:  World Main, Background, Timeline, New Aurora, Genotypes, Stories, and Weapons.  Additionally, these maps are provided:  Old America, PacNorwest, Texarkansas, Amerindia, and Damaged Cities.  Although the setting could arguable be used with any RPG system, it is closely tied into the F.O.R.G.E. System presented on the same site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N.B.  There exists an Iconoclast MUD (online Multi-User Dungeon) that is very similar to the RPG version of the game.  Even though they are both accessed via the same entry page, they are not the same thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
