			<description>Lake Ridden is a story-driven, first-person puzzle game! A thrilling supernatural adventure where you unravel a mysterious past, trying to find your sister. Luckily, you are not alone...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Marie, a 13-year-old girl and the year is 1988. The warm summer is giving way to the first signs of autumn. Reluctantly, you join your younger sister and her friends for one last camping weekend in the wilderness of Maine. It was going just great, but the second night by the sizzling campfire, an argument with your sister ended with her running off into the forest. While searching for her, you stumble upon an old forgotten estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To solve the mystery, and ultimately find your sister, you must find clues, solve tricky puzzles and communicate with former residents. Lake Ridden has a playtime of 6-9 hours and will cost 19,99USD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
