			<description>KNIGHT CLUB Is a 2-4 player action platform-fighting game THAT Brings traditional fighting game elements into an unlocked, free form movement playstyle. Equip your favorite armaments and do battle against your friends locally or online!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight Club has a traditional fighting game health system, and a not so traditional stock (lives) system. The name of the game is to deplete your opponents health, which will make them lose a stock, and respawn from the top of the screen.  Players are able to run, jump, dash, and air dash around the stage. All of these movement options are simple and easy to perform, but offer a bit of nuance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat in Knight Club is fairly straight forward, but has a lot of underlying mechanics at work.â€‹ Players pick a weapon when selecting their character, and based on that weapon they have access to different attacks. For the most part, all weapons follow the same control scheme. You press the attack button and the direction you want to attack in to perform an attack that will attack in that direction. Up + Attack results in an upward angled attack that is good for attacking opponents above you, where as left or right + attack, and down + attack, will perform an attack in those directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight Club features four game modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versus&lt;br/&gt;The core of Knight Club. Master your weapon and do battle against friend and foe alike in this highly competitive game mode. The name of the game is to KO your opponents and be the last man, or last team, standing. Before the match starts you will be able to adjust the time limit, and number of stocks each player has before they are knocked out of the match. This is Knight Club in its purest form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party Time&lt;br/&gt;Not in a competitive mood? Check out party time! everyone does double damage so matches fly by, perfect for passing the controller around the party. This mode has all of the same rules and options as Versus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of the Hill&lt;br/&gt;A classic mode in any competitive game! In King of the Hill you will try to keep your enemies out of a score zone while trying to rack up points. Stand your ground and dominate! When playing as a team, the points you gain are not added together! Use this to your advantage to have a roaming attacker and a zone defender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Royalty&lt;br/&gt;Someone has to rule. Why not you? In this affluent game of hot potato, players must pick up and hold onto a crown for as long as possible! Dodge, dash, and juke your way to victory! Just like in King of the Hill, team points are not cumulative. Coordinate with your team to have a designated Crown Holder and a body guard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
