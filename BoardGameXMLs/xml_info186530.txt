			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Matchmaker, players have distinct roles.  Two players are Destined Lovers.  The remaining characters take turns playing Cupid and Everyone Else in the World.  Cupid tries to get the Destined Lovers together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In secret, the Destined Lovers make up three things about themselves:  What do we have in common?; What one thing could you do that would turn me off forever?; A way to introduce yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cupid then frames the scene and play proceeds with shared narration.  If Cupid gets stuck, irritated, or exhausted, then the scene ends and somebody else plays Cupid.  Whenever Cupid introduces an NPC, somebody else plays the NPC.  The Destined Lovers also may introduce NPCs, and somebody else plays them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If some narrative impasse is reached then everybody secretly notes a possible resolution on a slip of paper and puts it into a hat.  Once everybody has tossed in a resolution, a random one is drawn from the hat--that becomes reality, and play proceeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
