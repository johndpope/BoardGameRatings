			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War in Europe - Windows Edition is a computer moderated simulation of the European Theater of Operations in World War II, based on the board game of the same name. Players control ground, air, sea, strategic forces, production and politics in order to change or simulate the events of World War II.  The game features brigade to corps-sized ground units, fleets of surface ships, U-Boats, transports, and amphibious assault ships, and tactical and strategic airpower. There is no &amp;quot;computer player&amp;quot; in the game.  Players make all critical decisions, including when and on whom to declare war, planning campaign strategy, and executing sweeping movements, &amp;quot;blitzkriegs,&amp;quot; bombing raids, airborne drops and amphibious assaults.&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a full-featured editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Addendum:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there is no computer opponent (AI), the program does enforce the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;This is a computerized version of SPI's boardgame War in Europe (1976).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
