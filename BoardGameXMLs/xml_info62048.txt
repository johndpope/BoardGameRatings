			<description>Cards are drawn which contain adjectives used to describe the character of someone. One player is chosen and the other players have to rate that player with regard to the adjective: 1, 2 or 3 (below average, average, above average). They put their markers into a pot and the player in question has to guess the overall result, the closer he or she gets, the more points are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
