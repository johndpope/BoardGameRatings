							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Berlin-Stadtspiel</name>
									
			<description>A promotional game published by the Berlin Senate's public relations office, this is a simple game where players move around the town on a replica of a 1914 city map, collecting picture cards as they go. The most valuable set of cards wins. Movement can be along streets (slow) or using the underground/suburban railway. The game is historically interesting as it still shows the city divided by the Berlin Wall into Wast (Soviet) and West sectors, with only a few dedicated transit points between the two, a state of affairs that lasted from August 1961 to November 1989.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
