							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Welcome to Tihi</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vacation From Hell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the anonymous letter arrives announcing the characters have won an all expenses paid vacation to the remote, exotic, tropical island of Tihi, everyone is too excited to think twice. Maybe no one remembers entering any contests, or even hearing the name before... but it's FREE! Who can say no?! Of course, after the demon spider-crabs attack, the jellyfish men rise from the ocean and the evil priest tags the PC's as human sacrifices to raise an ancient super-evil demi-god from the bottom of the sea, the whole thing might start to sound a little too good to be true - but by then it's too late. The only way off Tihi is to unravel the mystery of the Prophecy, recover an eery artifact with a life of its own and rescue the mysterious hermit who has the answers, all before the the Awakening (whatever that is) is complete. They sure as heck didn't mention any of THIS in the brochure...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome To Tihi is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 33pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
