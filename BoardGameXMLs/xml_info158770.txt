			<description>From the publisher's Web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed for Both Power and Sailboaters... &amp;quot;Who's The Skipper&amp;quot; is mobile fun for boaters of all ages ... unique game design combines luck, strategy and boating knowledge enabling novice to compete with even the most experienced avid seaman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Boater's Game... built on 500 basic to in-depth &amp;quot;Nauti-Bender&amp;quot; questions, designed to determine Who's The Skipper! Boat handling... docking... navigation... these are just some of the seamanship topics waiting to challenge you. Plus, keep a sharp lookout for those beguiling &amp;quot;Murphy Cards&amp;quot; that will have everyone in &amp;quot;knots&amp;quot;... and may turn even the saltiest &amp;quot;Captain&amp;quot; into a galley slave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're in the cockpit, dockside or by the fireplace... whether you're a novice, intermediate or experienced yachtsman... or whether it's a boating day or not... you can be at the helm with Who's The Skipper, an enjoyable and fun way to learn (or reinforce) your sailing and seamanship skills!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
