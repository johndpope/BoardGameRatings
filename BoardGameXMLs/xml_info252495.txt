			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seminar begins with a PowerPoint presentation. Cheerful animations and cool sound effects will be added to help employees understand the message about the need for increased synergy in the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representatives from each department of the company can look forward to spending a wonderful week with a cornucopia of innovative team-building tasks to increase team skills and break the ice between the different departments. There will also be an opportunity to learn to think out-of-the-box, to better manage mission critical assignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the seminar is complete, employee performance will be evaluated and the management - in collaboration with the external consultant - will consider the need for outsourcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaktiv - a scenario for people who hate their jobs and their colleagues more than you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(prejudices about office environments are an advantage, but not a requirement)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as three PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     8-page scenario overview&lt;br/&gt;     13-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;     13-page print-and-play handouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
