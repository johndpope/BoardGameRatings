							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Greenlock</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F or hundreds of years heroes descending into the depths of the earth have eventually come face to face with the blind and savage fury of the Grimlock. Unknown to many, the Grimlock have travelled far and wide in search of its sight, including to the tall forests of the world above. While the Greenlock has never found his vision, he has adapted to his new home, where he rules with a savage anger that threatens the woodland creatures who share it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The humanoid ahead has a green and brown mottled skin, and a shaggy coat of brown hair. He could be a painted primitive human, but where his eyes should be only empty sockets remain. He wields a spear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
