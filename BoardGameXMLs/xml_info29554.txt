			<description>extrapolation from description in &amp;quot;Play the Game&amp;quot; by Brian Love;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game for 2 to 6 players, divided into teams. Order of play is determined by a roll of the dice. Each team of two mountaineers move based on their choice of which mountaineer will use the die roll on each turn. Only one can move per turn. Different obstacles and hazards occur along the way making the climb difficult to finish. Both mountaineers must reach the summit by exact roll in order to win the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
