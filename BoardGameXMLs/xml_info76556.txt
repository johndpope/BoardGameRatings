There are fines and rewards on the different spaces in the game.  Landing on spaces 4, 20 or 29 causes the player to lose a turn. If you land on space 30 (Poor Lady) you must promise to buy her gloves. You move to space #30 and pay a token into the pool.In addition you can, on your turn, place the money bags on any of the servant spaces. When opponents land on those spaces they must add a token to the pool in the center of the board.
