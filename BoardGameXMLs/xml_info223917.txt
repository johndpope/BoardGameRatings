							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicken Run</name>
									
			<description>Chicken Run is a simple collection game that takes strategy,  a little bit of luck, and a whole lot of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the facts: There&amp;rsquo;s chickens, roosters, and feed. Each player tries to pair four chickens of the same color along with a rooster and feed to complete a Chicken Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is fast paced&amp;ndash; compete against other players to fill your chicken coops and complete your runs- the first to reach ten points wins. But watch out for action cards though as other players can steal or eat your chickens right from your coop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Chicken Run is simple, it is full of energy and excitement that develops as players attack one another with varmints, protect their coops from attacks with guard dogs, and trade with other players for the cards they need to complete a Chicken Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
