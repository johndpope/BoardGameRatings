			<description>The board looks very similar to a Malefiz-board and it also has barricade-fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in Pass, players start in 2-4 corners of the board and must move to the opposite corner, so that the playing pieces move all in different directions. And the barricades are active only when the first token has landed on it. Passing these barricades in handled differently to Malefiz also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, Pass looks more like a Malefiz variant than an absolutely new game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
