			<description>The maker Orofun Games of Littleton, CO calls this &amp;quot;The Oil Investment Game of Today.&amp;quot; The object of the game is to earn the most money in a preset period of time. This is primarily achieved by income received from producing oil wells. The winner is the first player to collect $20 million dollars, or the one with the most money after time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is divided into 4 areas; Knife River, Apache Run, Big Muddy &amp;amp; Black Basin. Players roll the dice and travel around the board clockwise. As the player moves around the board, they collect oil lease cards and begin drilling for oil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As play continues, the players collect pay day, which grows based on the amount of producing oil wells. They also can experience wells running dry, leases expiring, and they can purchase insurance. New years begin, they can face windfall profit taxes, receive golden oil drop cards, refinery bonuses, go bankrupt, and they may make deals amongst each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
