			<description>It's not easy keeping a family close, especially when everyone can shift between their DEAD and ALIVE states at will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this quirky take on the fundamentals of game theory, players need to agree to meet in the land of the dead or the land of the living. If they cannot, they lose. If they can, they win. The twist is - if 1 family member is able to betray the rest, they win big, and the others lose big.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborate, debate, investigate... be the one who discards all their cards first by cheating your way between the land of the dead and the land of the living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
