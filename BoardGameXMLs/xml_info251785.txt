			<description>In Run Animals, Run! (生き残れ！動物たち！), which is subtitled &amp;quot;Zoo of Depression&amp;quot;, players represent various animal species in Taiwan, fighting for survival in the forest while facing the threat of human destruction. Players try to complete their individual missions to score points, and the game ends when a player has reached 20 points (thereby winning the game) or when a player's graveyard is filled or their species goes extinct, at which point players compare point totals to see who has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
