			<description>(The game has been released and is available for free to download online.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creators of Ascension and Magic: The Gathering have joined forces to create a revolutionary digital trading card game -- SolForge combines the strategy and depth of a traditional trading card game experience with the convenience of online and mobile gaming. Players will be able to experience Solforge absolutely free and can grow their collection just by playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You construct your play deck before hand, but your hand cycles through, more similar to a deck building game. SolForge is differentiated in that every time you play a creature, its leveled up version also goes into your discard pile. Since you typically play two out of five cards per turn, this adds some subtlety to what you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SolForge currently supports building your own decks to play against your friends, compete in online tournaments, and automatching with players. Future development will allow you to explore a rich fantasy world in a single-player campaign mode in which your actions can affect the direction of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SolForge is a free-to-play digital collectable strategy game that combines all the depth of a traditional trading card game experience with the convenience of online and mobile gaming. In SolForge, you take on the role of a Forgeborn, one of the select few who can wield the magic of the SolForge itself. You collect cards and use them to construct decks with ferocious creatures, imposing structures, and powerful spells to battle AI opponents in the single-player campaign mode or test your skills against other players in the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of a game of SolForge is to reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s health from one hundred to zero. How you do this - whether by attacking quickly with a swarm of creatures or playing defense until you have a single unstoppable monster - is really up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
