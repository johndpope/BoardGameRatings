			<description>A roll and move game where each player assumes a political role in the former USSR. The goal is to move around the board and collect enough years experience to advance to the next career path. The player who makes it into a career in the Kremlin wins. Players try to avoid losing years or being sent to Siberia as they hinder career advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
