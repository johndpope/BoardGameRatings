			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rings &amp;amp; Rogues is a roleplaying game of urban fantasy and swashbuckling action. In this game, players take on the role of individuals in the city of Skonn and narrate their adventures. One player serves as the Game Master, or GM, and uses the rules to help determine the resolution of conflicts. This avoids the classic problem of childhood cops-and-robbers games, wherein one player screams &amp;quot;Missed me!&amp;quot; and another says &amp;quot;No! You're dead!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rings &amp;amp; Rogues was written for the 24 Hour RPG challenge, but because of the author's procrastination most of it was written in one hour. I'm sure it shows. This is the reason why it's in .txt format; I didn't have time to port it over to a .pdf. The setting is based on a previous short story of mine, &amp;quot;Nornring&amp;quot;, which takes place in a town just outside of Skonn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
