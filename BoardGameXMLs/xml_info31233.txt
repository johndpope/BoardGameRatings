							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shabbos is Coming!</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's game published in Hebrew and English which has a religious theme focusing on preparation for Shabbos or Shabbat, which in Judaism is the Sabbath day (day of rest).  The game is similar to a chutes and ladders style game, with players moving up ladders and down slides to move from the bottom to the top of the board.  The board uses religious imagery to connect this journey to appropriate preparation for the Sabbath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
