			<description>Dear Diary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best things in life are free. Other people's things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- I think it's a shame that Doctor Goettsch owns so many nice things, but never has the time to use them. It's almost like I'm doing him a favor when I borrow his golf clubs. Now at least he knows they're getting some use. And if he ever actually needs them, he knows where to find me. I'm sleeping on the floor at Anthony's house. He's a Gambler, and he's got the best leftovers in town! And those silk suits he never wears are almost all my size. Tomorrow I should figure out where he keeps the keys to that car he never drives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freeloader is a game celebrating the glorious pastime of living off other people's success. Players spend the game roaming the neighborhood, doing favors for their &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; in exchange for great loaner stuff like the Doctor's Car, the Artist's clothes, or the Waitress' leftover food. To win the game you have to collect Food, Clothing, and Shelter before the deck runs out. It's all worth points, and whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freeloader is the best of what Cheapass Games does: a simple, entertaining board game with decent strategy and a rock-bottom price tag. The game was designed by James Ernest and illustrated by Cheyenne Wright, and it's a total hoot. But hey, don't just take our word for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borrow it from your friends and play it for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    2003 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
