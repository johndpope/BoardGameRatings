			<description>From rules page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max-It is a unique dice game played with a special set of five dice. Three regular d6s and two &amp;quot;function&amp;quot; dice, each of which has two Plus (positive) signs, two Minus (negative) signs and two Times (multiplication) signs. Game play involves rolling and re-rolling the dice, and grouping them in various combinations to produce the most desired results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into three rounds, each with a different objective. A round consists of three turns and a Max-It roll for each player. A Max-It roll uses only two dice, one regular and one function, and may cause a scoring upset. After three rounds, each player takes a final Max-It roll. The player with the highest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 1 - Players try for high positive scores.&lt;br/&gt;Round 2 - Players try for high negative scores.&lt;br/&gt;Round 3 - Players try for the greatest difference between two dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include 5 dice (3 regular and 2 function), dice cup, instructions and players' score pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
