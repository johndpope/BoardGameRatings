			<description>From the back of the box (US Game Gear edition)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mad Machine has shut down the Enchanted Mansion toy factory. Massive barricades have been set up blocking off all contact with the outside world. The only thing the MAd Amchine didn't count on was resistence from a corageous wooden toy - Woody Pop. Join Woody as he clashes with mechanized forces ad nearly impossible barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for rebounds, ricochets and bounding action as Woody Pop transforms into a brick smashing hero. But be on your guard, certain bricks release evil toy soldiers and wind-up robots that wreak havoc with your quest. Blast through 50 levels of non-stop action in your mission to come face to face with the Mad Machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
