							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3D Block Game</name>
									
			<description>The game has 18 &amp;quot;Tetris&amp;quot;shaped blocks and a little square boardgame, 3 hexes by 3.&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with an electronic buzzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it's your turn, you press the buzzer.  The buzzer will tell you which block you have to take, this by describing the colour of the block.&lt;br/&gt;You take that block and put it on the board, when you did that, you push the buzzer again, which will tell the next player which block he has to pick and place.  &lt;br/&gt;When putting the block on the board you only have a certain amount of time (8, 10 or 12 seconds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By putting the blocks on the board you'll create a tower, when it's your turn you must succeed putting the block on the board or on another piece already placed on the board and by doing so trying not to turn over the tower.&lt;br/&gt;If the tower falls, that player is excluded from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play on untill there's one player left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;source: user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
