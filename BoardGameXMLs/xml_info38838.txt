			<description>Game for teams - designed for schools - with a basic &amp;quot;watery&amp;quot; theme: the Italian name means literally &amp;quot;river of words&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The targets are Ages 7 - 12 students, but the game is also playable by families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player should be the game master: a teacher, or a member of the family.&lt;br/&gt;The goal for each team is to score enough points to reach the final case of a &amp;quot;scoring river&amp;quot; with a marker. &lt;br/&gt;To gain points, each team must find a word which contains the syllable indicated by game master, gaining more points for longer words.&lt;br/&gt;If the word is related to water, or better to potable water and its saving, points scored will be doubled.&lt;br/&gt;It's possible to use opponents' position on the &amp;quot;scoring river&amp;quot; to jump over them, and there are also some special bonus cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, it's a roll and move game, but the &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot; is replaced by inventive and knowledge of a language.&lt;br/&gt;You can also choose different &amp;quot;themes&amp;quot; or languages to make the players learn something different or think about a different environmental-social problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available in Italian and English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
