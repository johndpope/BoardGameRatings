							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Society</name>
									
			<description>A pretty complicated game considering it was produced in 1874. The Game of Society is written on 55 cards (22 red (virtues), 13 black (vices) and 20 green (neutral) in 4 letters A B C D which stand for Angles, Britons, Celts and Danes the principle components of the Anglo-Saxon race. 2,4, or 6 can play. If played in teams the teams are either 2 or 3 person teams. Deal 7 cards to each player. The top card, called the Providence is then turned over. This determines trumps for that round. if the trump does not suit the person to the left of the dealer that person may say &amp;quot;NOLO&amp;quot; in which case two more cards are dealt to each player and a second Providence card is turned over which must remain trumps for the round, if the card does suit the player he calls &amp;quot;VOLO&amp;quot; and the hand begins. The cards have names on them that relate to their rank in the  suit. Names like Benevolence, Christian, Industry, Press, Villain, Education, Intemperance, Virtues, Man in Home, Woman in home, Debt etc. These cards have value which determines which card wins the trick. Some cards reduce the value of a trick and therefore wind up resulting in a negative valued trick. Virtue cards are positive and vice cards are negatively valued, neutrals are just that and are worth zero. Object is to be the first to get to 7 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
