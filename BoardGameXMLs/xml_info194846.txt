			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game utilizes an existing system (Signature) that has been modified for the setting.  The game as submitted is complete, however.  The setting is a complicated series of Spheres - alternate multiverses.  Each sphere has a suite of Nine Worlds, each of which is in a different state of development.  Much of the game, published in several lengthy forum posts, is devoted to establishing the setting parameters.  Characters are able to move between the Nine World and between the various Spheres using magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published as a series of forum posts and, a few days later, several shorter &amp;quot;errata&amp;quot; posts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
