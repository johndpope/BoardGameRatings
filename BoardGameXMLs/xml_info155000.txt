							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">February 2014: North of Tri County</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The generally affluent and/or college town of Tri County lies in stark contrast with their neighbors to the north. Lodazal is home to some residual wealth from Tri County, producing an anomaly of socioeconomic status - the wealthy redneck&amp;hellip; or so the people of Tri County would believe. Separated from each other by a long, winding highway through a mountain grade, few from Tri County dared stop at Lodazal&amp;hellip; admittedly whose most lasting notable feature is a mental hospital&amp;hellip; but now, they pass through in droves when the outbreak hits Tri County and begins to lay waste to their precious historical town. Lodazalians greeted the refugees with open arms, until they began to bring with them their high-class prejudice to add additional strain the burden of so many refugees placed on local resources. Things came to a head when a fire broke out in the mountain pass, effectively sealing Lodazal from Tri County with a wall of flame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some continued to flee north, further up the state, where their fate was determined by the road, but some stayed and fought as a wave of undead came through the burning grade from Tri County towards the town of Lodazal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a series of scenarios that take place north of Tri County called Lodazal. A character is free to accomplish multiple objectives as described in the Outbreak: Undead - Gamemaster&amp;rsquo;s Companion to earn SP, but there are a few Objectives that are unique to this setting that earn a greater amount of SP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
