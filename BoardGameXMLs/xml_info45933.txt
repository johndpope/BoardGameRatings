			<description>One of the most famous of the early RPGs, Bunnies &amp;amp; Burrows had a hard time being taken seriously, but did introduce many ideas now common in RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Corrected:] Bunnies &amp;amp; Burrows (B&amp;amp;B) is a role-playing game (RPG) inspired by the novel Watership Down. Published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1976, the game centered around intelligent rabbits. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, and the first to have detailed martial arts and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second printing of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official GURPS supplement in 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As rabbits, player characters are faced with dangers mirroring those in the real world. The only true &amp;quot;monsters&amp;quot; in the game are humans, but there are many predators and natural hazards. The characters' position in the food chain promotes an emphasis on role-playing and problem solving over combat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bunnies_&amp;amp;_Burrows,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
