			<description>WABA&lt;br/&gt;The players try to connect opposing sides of the gameboard. There's a two player and a three player version. Two players each have 40 pieces, three players each have 30 pieces. &lt;br/&gt;The first move for each player is to place a piece on the startline. From that position a continuous line is to be formed. After the first move players may place a piece on every field on the board that is unoccupied by a piece of the adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;When all pieces have been played and no line connecting the opposing sides of the board is formed, the game ends in a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WABEN-HALMA&lt;br/&gt;Waben-Halma is a two player game. Each has 15 pieces to be placed in the 'Waben-triangle' at the base of the board. The object is to be the first player to have moved all 15 pieces in the starttriangle of the opponent. The rules of this game are exactly like Halma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DREIER-WABEN&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for two or three players. Each players has 15 pieces. Every turn one piece is to be placed on the board. The object is to be the player who has formed the largest number of triangle formations on the board. Such triangle formations contain three pieces of the same colour in pyramid form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WABEN-BILDER&lt;br/&gt;Waben-Bilder is a game of shape building. Each player tries to form a certain figure (a flower, house, key etc.) on the board. The first to complete such a figure wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
