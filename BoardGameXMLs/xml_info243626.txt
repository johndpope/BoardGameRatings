							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Warden</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wardens are exceptionally tough defenders of the wild. Not only does each warden type gain a bonus effect or ability while using the defend move, they have a pool of Might points that let them more reliably dish out damage, reduce damage suffered, better overcome attacks and effects physically, and compel enemies to face them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most of our classes, as you level up you can branch out in various ways: you can become even tougher with barkskin and stoneskin, get even more out of defend with force of nature, guardian form, and warden&amp;rsquo;s shield, dish out more damage with crushing might and devastating might, and recover even faster with wellspring of life and renewal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some moves require at least one point of Might left, so you'll need to manage it carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also other tricks and abilities you can pick up (some of which are restricted to specific warden types), such as causing an earthquake, getting spirits to watch your back, fly, and spread out your healing abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout (so we could fit all of the advanced moves on the back).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized PDFs, one in color, the other in black and white to make it easier to print at home. They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The warden class (which includes 24 advanced moves)&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons, armor, and magic items&lt;br/&gt;    A Director's Cut with questions to ask yourself when rolling up a warden, explanations/clarifications for some of the moves, two more warden types, and three extra advanced moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
