			<description>&amp;quot;Gensō Suikoden Card Stories​ (幻想水滸伝カードストーリーズ) is a spin-off title of the Suikoden franchise by Konami which includes both a Game Boy Advance game and a physical collectible card game. Both were released in the fall of 2001 in Japan, neither have been translated into other languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other areas of the Suikoden franchise, in which the storyline is a major element of gameplay, Card Stories focuses mainly on the card battles themselves and less on the plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the cards feature characters who appear in both Suikoden and Suikoden II of Konami's role-playing game series. Several cards also feature characters who would later go on to appear in Suikoden III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GBA game retells the story of Suikoden II with a few changes to how they transpire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Suikoden_Card_Stories,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
