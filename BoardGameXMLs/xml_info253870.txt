			<description>Repel Boarders is a co-operative game for 2 to 6 players, you can take control of any number of the crew under Cpt Frank Smith in either one of the 9 included missions or if you prefer you can design your own!  Although it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to play the missions in order, should players wish to do so, a short narrative campaign is included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gain weapons and armour from the chests scattered about the rooms on-board in your attempt to defeat the forces of space pirates that are attacking your ship.  Missions have different objectives ranging from simply surviving a massive rush of pirates or escorting a VIP, to securing and defending vital parts of your ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you take on the role of a marine and attack the enemy head on or the role of medic or engineer and assist your fellow players in staying alive as wave after wave of blood thirsty pirates swarm the ship.  Maybe you are the voice of command and as captain organise the others to follow you.  Perhaps you want nothing more than 2 really big guns and a singular purpose and take the role of the robot.  Maybe you are stealthy and tactical and can take on the pirates with nothing more than a chefs cleaver?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each crew character starts with 3 action points which they can then spend freely on either moving, combat (melee or ranged) or on a special action, though only one special action maybe completed per person per turn.  Special actions include healing, repairing doors, searching chests and trading etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters gain further actions and special abilities as the &amp;quot;Alert Level&amp;quot; on-board ship increases.  While players start with a modicum of gear as play progresses they may pick up and trade items to suit either their own play style or that of the persona of the crew member they are playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to design your own campaign where you keep the items on your character and progress through your own customer scenarios?  This is entirely possible with Repel Boarders modular double sided game tiles, corridor tiles and board connectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
