							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gloop</name>
									
			<description>Gloop is a domino-like strategy game for 2-8 players, using special Gloop tiles. The Gloop tiles are a set of 91 square tiles that show every unique way that paths can be drawn between pairs of points on each tile side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start by randomly drawing six tiles into their hand, and placing a pair of matching tiles in the centre. Players then take turns either: 1) forming tiles from their hand into matching 2x2 patterns, 2) matching one of their 2x2 patterns with the central pattern, or 3) drawing a random tile into their hand. The game is won by the player who has no remaining tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gloop tiles also allow a number of interesting puzzles, such as finding the greatest number of tiles that pack to form a single closed path, packing all 91 tiles into a 7x13 rectangle with the smallest or greatest number of paths, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
