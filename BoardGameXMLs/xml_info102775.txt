							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bombers Over Europe</name>
									
			<description>An old war game made during or after World War II. The game is a simple dice game where up to four players moving a playing piece towards an enemy city. Each player is allowed ten raids to the objectives of their choice, with the highest score tabulated at the end of the game declared a winner. If a playing piece lands on a black square during a raid, the piece is removed from the board and that turn is lost. The high ratio of black squares (40 out of a possible 179 spaces) is a depressingly accurate reflection of the high casualties facing wartime bomber crews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original wartime edition was printed in brown on thin beige cardstock, while the post-war version had a glossier red board with black squares. Both versions fold out to a size 16&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot;. The coloured playing pieces are made from 1/4&amp;quot; painted wooden dowel and the die is wooden as well. Game instructions are printed on the face of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
