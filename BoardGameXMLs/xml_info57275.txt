			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember that slogan they used to use to entice young sprouts like us into the service, before the recent unpleasantness reinstituted the draft? &amp;ldquo;Join the army and see the world,&amp;rdquo; wasn't it? At least this time we get to go someplace warm, looking for a fallen star.&lt;br/&gt;Seems this Soviet weather satellite decided it was time to come down and picked one of the most remote, out-of-the-way locales to land in that I've ever seen (and I've seen some weird ones lately). The question of where we were going wasn't foremost on our minds, though. Why was what we wanted to know. What was so flamin' important about some commie satellite?&lt;br/&gt;Here's the answer we got, verbatim: &amp;ldquo;Because that little electronic box recorded every action of the war-every nuclear strike, as well as the most current and up-to-date information on wind patterns and radiation spread over the whole damn world, not to mention ozone dispersion and other weather data. Whoever has this satellite will be years ahead of the other nations in terms of knowing the extent of the climatic changes coming up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;As it turned out, the most important question, which none of us asked, was &amp;ldquo;Who?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Satellite Down, the characters get to take a trip to sunny Baja California, where they must retrieve some date cassettes from a weather/recon satellite that managed to record the weather patterns of the last three years. Whoever has the information on those tapes will be able to forecast the effects of the climatic changes caused by the war-and be better able to survive them. The only thing standing in their way is a do-it-yourself messiah and a few hundred fanatic followers.&lt;br/&gt;Satellite Down contains all the information a referee needs to conduct the adventure, including maps, building floor plans, and historical background on the satellite and the religious community which has recovered it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
