			<description>A Trap the Cap adaption - 2 different games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of a die, this game uses a spinning top to reach results between 1 and 6. The game board has two sides. Side 1 is a standard &amp;quot;Trap the Cap&amp;quot; game with an altered game board. Side 2 uses different rules. Each space shows the first part of a mathematical expression, which is completed by the result of the spinning top. The amount of the whole expression is the number of spaces the cap can move forward. This game can be played like &amp;quot;Pachisi&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Trap the Cap&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1: Be the first catching all other caps/acting by turns &lt;br/&gt;Board is entered on an 'A'-space. Players move their &amp;quot;caps&amp;quot; around the board according spinner. If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his/her cap on top of the stack. The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board. Caps on spaces with an 'F' or matching color can't be caught. Ending on a 'F'-space all captured caps must be released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2: More like Pachisi (kicking out other ones), but additionally players must perform one of the 4 basic arithmetic operations (according spinner &amp;amp; space) moving their meeples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
