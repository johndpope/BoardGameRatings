							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scarney 3000</name>
									
			<description>Another member of the Farkel family (along with Cosmic Wimpout), Scarney 3000 uses 5 dice upon which the 2 and the 5 have been replaced with the word &amp;quot;Scarney&amp;quot;.  Points are scored for rolling Scarneys or for rolling 3 or more of a kind on one roll, but you're not allowed to score your roll until (a) you've collected at least 200 points for this series of rolls and (b) you've rolled at least one Scarney.  If you can't (or choose not to) score your current roll, you must re-roll all non-scoring dice, or all 5 dice if they're all used in scoring (e.g., a Scarney and four 3s).  First player or team to 3000 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
