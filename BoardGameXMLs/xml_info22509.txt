			<description>Four Battles of Army Group South consists of four completely separate regimental/divisional level games, each with its own 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; five-color map, unit counters and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All four games use a set of Standard Rules derived from Panzergruppe Guderian as the basic core game rules.  Each game then, has it's own set of Exclusive rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kiev: The Battle of Encirclement, 1941, is a simulation of the German Blitzkrieg campaign from 29 August to 26 September 1941.  It ended with the largest encirclement in history: 665,000 Soviets were destroyed; 3718 guns and 884 armored fighting vehicles captured; and the remains of the great Soviet prewar army of April 1941 was finished as a fighting force.&lt;br/&gt;2 days per turn, 5 miles / 8 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rostov: The First Soviet Counter-Attack, 1941, depicts the German drive across the Donets Basin in the fall of 1941.  Army Group South, accompanied by various Axis-Allied Armies, attempted to seize the valuable communications junction at Rostov and establish bridgeheads across the Donets and lower Don rivers.  In the fighting around Rostov, the Germans suffered their first strategic setback in their campaign against Russia, as the Soviet Army drove the German mechanized spearhead from this vital area. &lt;br/&gt;2 days per turn, 10.5 miles / 17 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Star: The Soviet Winter Offensive, 1943, the Soviet offensive towards Kharkov and Dnepr in February 1943 and the German counterattack that followed.  Strong Soviet forces attempted to take Kharkov and sweep to the south and west, cutting off all of Army Group Don.  Von Manstein formulated a daring counter-operation that called for the aggressive use of all available Panzer reserves. &lt;br/&gt;5 days per turn, 6.5 miles / 10.5 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Korsun: The German Pocket on the Dniepr, 1944, depicts the battle of the encirclement - known to the Soviets as the Korsun Pocket and to the Germans as the Cherkassy Pocket - fought in late January and early February 1944, the largest German pocket since Stalingrad, only half the trapped German soldiers escape. &lt;br/&gt;2 days per turn, 4.6 miles / 7.5 kilometers per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last in the series of SPI Quads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Four 17 x 22&amp;quot; five-color mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed countersheets (800 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;Two 8-page Army Group South Standard Rules rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;Two 4-page Army Group South Charts &amp;amp; Tables booklets&lt;br/&gt;Four 4-page game specific rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page AGS Historical Background booklet&lt;br/&gt;One 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 3 - 4 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
