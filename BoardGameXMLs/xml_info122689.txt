			<description>High noon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dirt crunches underneath your boots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweat drips slowly down your brow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your fingers twitch as you reach for your gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A split second later your opponent lies on the ground, lifeless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You advance to the final round of the Dodgecity Gunfight contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Wild Guns! The first gunslinger card game for two or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out smart, out shoot and out play your opponent in this fast-paced, high action card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this game review from Father Geek!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Wild Guns:&lt;br/&gt;Each player acts as a Wild West Gunslinger, with a Gunslinger character card placed face up in front of him, each with unique skills and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play of Wild Guns is quite simple. Each player has a hand of Gun cards and Run cards. In a two player game each player starts with six Gun cards and six Run cards. During the game the players place one Gun card and one Run card facedown in front of him. The other player does the same. When both players have their cards facedown on the table the player with First Shot reveals his Gun card, while is opponent reveals his Run card. Then compare the cards to ensure a shot can be made. If player A reveals a Head Shot Gun Card and Player B Reveals a Crouch Run Card - the attack from player A cannot be made, the Run card avoids his shot. The play proceeds to player B as he reveals his Gun card to compare to player A's Run card. If player B reveals a Chest Shot Gun Card and player A reveals a Jump Run Card, he jumps into the shot! Player B gets to make a shot and rolls the dice, as indicated on the Gun card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After rolling he compares the numbers rolled his Gunslinger card and dishes out the damage to player A!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one or both Gunslingers are dead, with zero health left! The goal of Wild Guns is to be the last Gunslinger standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for a party game? Wild Guns is a great party game and can play with up to ten players. Watch out, this is when the bullets fly and the Gunslingers drop dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
