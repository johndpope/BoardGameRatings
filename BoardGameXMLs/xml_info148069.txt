							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Asylum</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map product is 5 full color 32 x 30 inch levels of a Victorian Asylum, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this is such a large map and includes the VTT files, be warned this is a 95 meg download and 60 pages to print for the whole building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Prepare the patient for experimentation. Cover story? Another suicide. Most unfortunate. Now to unravel the secrets of the body and mind.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The asylum is a five level Victorian style mansion converted into an institution to hold indefinitely the mentally disturbed. The five levels include a basement, three main floors, and an attic each with multiple rooms. This product includes the image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The asylum can be used in Victorian era games to modern pulp games with a bent towards the Horror side of those genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excerpt from Savage Insider Issue #9:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nestled quietly 25 miles southwest of Rochester, New York sits the lair of a madman. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always a madman&amp;rsquo;s lair; it was once a large, prominent asylum for the psychotically challenged. Some may call it a home for crazies, but the doctors who resided there considered it an opportunity to test new theories and treatment for the curing of psychosis. This was 24 years ago as the facility was shutdown in 1875 and only the echoes of its past remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Asylum is designed to be placed into any setting based in the Victorian era or utilizing Victorian styling. It is fantasy horror and the applicable setting should have some type of emphasis on horror. If running the adventure in a setting likeJudgement Day where the Player Characters are hunters of supernatural beings, they have been assigned to investigate the goings on outside of Rochester after receiving reports of mutated human sightings during the kidnappings. The goal of the team is simple: eradicate the threat at all costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If The Asylum is being placed in an investigative setting, the Player Characters will be assigned to investigate the sighting, in a similar fashion, but their goal should be one of extreme caution. Unaware of the dangers that lie ahead, the Player Characters may wish to monitor the asylum and find an occult spell to handle whatever beings lurk inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure to be continued in Savage Insider Issue #9&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
