			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cocoron is a side scrolling platform game for the Famicom. The game has a whimsical theme centered around dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lets you create your own characters from a mix and match assortment of parts. The body parts contain ninja, robot, alien, monster, ghost, knight, hero, and a final question mark category with things like smiley face heads and tank tread bodies. Some body parts allow you to fly (wings, jetpack), some allow you to float on water (a boat hull body), and others jump high or have more defense. You are also allowed to choose from a variety of projectile attacks such as baseballs, boomerangs, shurikens, pencils, crystals, flowers, parasols, and music notes. Each attack has it's own pattern, speed, and damage. The attacks are also powered up by collecting items during the game; each attack having it's own upgrade path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a level selection map with 5 areas to go to and additionally your house in the center. When you choose an area to go to you don't simply start there like in most games (such as Mega Man). You travel there through a number of transition screens which change depending on where you started from. The 5 areas are: Milk Sea (containing a pirate ship); the Fairy Forest (where you fight a beautiful fairy queen); Star Hill (jump on clouds and fight the moon as a boss); Ice-Fire Mountain (where the ice dragon has captured Santa Claus); and Trump Castle (where you fight a set of playing cards for a boss). Each of these levels contains a strange assortment of enemies including: flying pandas with beach balls; reindeer heads mounted on walls; dancing cows; and many other crazy creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
