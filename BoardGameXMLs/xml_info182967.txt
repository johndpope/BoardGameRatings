			<description>The Glitterati of Bear Valley Hills are at an awards after-party, someone says the wrong thing, then the cakes start flying! Whoever comes out the other end cleanest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bun Fight is a board game in which players move between tables laden with various cakes to grab and hurl at their rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player has a number of actions enabling them to move to a table, grab a cake, push a cake in someone's face (close combat), or hurl it at someone (ranged). &amp;quot;Sweet Surprise&amp;quot; cards may be played at any time by any player, adding effects or helping players avoid/recover from trouble. Cakes (Just Desserts) cause Splat and Stun, and the player with the fewest Splat when the last cake is grabbed wins. Stun causes a player to miss actions but can be avoided by either dropping a cake or discarding Sweet Surprise cards if preferred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
