The residents of MYSTERY MANSION try to put all the blame on the Snodgits, those cute mischievous little creatures who always seem to be up to something. Who has stolen the ice-cream from the fridge? Who spilled ink on the new carpet? The Snodgits!&lt;br/&gt;Of cause the world's most famous detectives such as Inspector Clousteau, Padlock Holmes and Miss Marbles to name but a few all dismiss this excuse as nonsense and have gathered at MYSTERY MANSION to solve the mysteries.
