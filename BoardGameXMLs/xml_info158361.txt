			<description>This ancient game was played in the 18th century by noble families in the city of Bern in Switzerland. Although it all but disappeared in the 20th century, it has survived thanks to an enthusiast who was one of the last remaining connoisseurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patricius is some kind of &amp;quot;bingo meets freecell&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this abstract game, players are trying to form four stacks of numbers starting with 1 and going up to 16. However, the numbered tiles are drawn randomly and players will have to store the numbers in five columns until they are able to place them on a stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players play with the same draw, and when all the tiles have been drawn, whoever has made the highest stacks is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
