			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character is a Game Master's tool for tabletop roleplaying&lt;br/&gt;games, a mini game you can use to add depth to non-player characters, from brand new ones you're introducing for the first time or for established characters that you want to flesh out, to add some history and give motivations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot IS Character can help steer you into new directions with characters. If you find yourself in a bit of a rut with NPCs, especially ones that act as antagonists to your party of player characters, then this game is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this item is developed as a generic, universal tool to assist during game master preparation, it also was entered into the Solitaire RPG Challenge as a standalone &amp;quot;game&amp;quot;.  It is intended for solitaire use prior to play; it helps to generate unique and distinctive non-player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
