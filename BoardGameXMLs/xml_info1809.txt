			<description>Fasten your seat belt and tell your navigator to hold on for his life! RALLY! is a fast playing board game of pedal-to-the-floor cross-country racing.  Players compete to reach the finish line with the most points, which are earned by driving fast between course checkpoints.  Unfortunately, the faster you drive, the greater chance that you'll damage your car.  If you damage it too much, it'll conk out on you before you reach the finish lines.  A good driver knows when to push it and when to hold back.  RALLY! features nail-biting finishes and quick action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drive fast.  Crash Hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
