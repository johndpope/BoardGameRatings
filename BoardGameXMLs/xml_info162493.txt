			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Design a tour that will see as many of the battle/military sights (marked on the map with circles and handwritten numbers) as possible without running the tour group ragged so they can enjoy it. So you can compare the level of enjoyment each itinerary possesses, each sight is given a number from 1 to 10 (number assignments explained in other folder).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect counters that represent the sights and add up the assigned point numbers. On the back of the Day Record Chart (DRC) are examples of previously played itineraries, so you can compare how you did. Bonuses and penalties for free time, too much driving and random events add to your total point score.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally a solitaire game, there is a competitive version with a group arriving at the same location getting fewer points, but rolling on the CRT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
