There they uncover one of the Malchort&amp;rsquo;s most deadly secrets, a colossal biomechanical death-machine in the shape of a great prehistoric beast known as a Doom Golem. The PCs must figure out how to reactivate the machine and return to the surface through the Sink. Emerging in the center of the Great City, they face off against the Trypus Academy&amp;rsquo;s own mecha-kaiju death-machine in an epic battle that threatens to smash the city to rubble&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure ends The Great City: The Sinking series. It can be played as part of the series, or as a stand-alone adventure. It was designed using the Pathfinder RPG System and intended to be played with a group of 11th-level Player Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
