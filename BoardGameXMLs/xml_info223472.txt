			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Days: Atlantis is a cooperative, dungeon crawler deckbuilding game for 3 players. You have been called upon as champions of New Atlantis to save the city from Armageddon. Lost knowledge capable of redeeming the city is kept in a sacred, ancient tome affixed with multiple seals. Each player assumes the role of 1 of 3 characters with unique classes-- Warrior, Witch, or Wizard. Your quest is to break each seal, which binds the ancient tome, in order to reveal the mystical knowledge and save New Atlantis from catastrophe. But it isn't easy. To break each seal, the party must leave the safety of the city and travel to a dangerous land to vanquish the evil inhabitants within. Only then, can the seals be broken,the book read, and New Atlantis restored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games may be played from 1 to 5 seals, each seal taking about an hour each.  Each seal contains 5 enemies.  When injured by an enemy, players add a wound card to the top of their deck.  Each class has a certain number of cards and abilities that must be played each turn, and the party is defeated if any player is forced to play a wound.  Special abilities and attacks require charges from crystals, the major Atlantean power source.  Loot and experience are awarded after each battle which can be used to upgrade weapons, crystals, and cards within each player's deck. After each seal is completed, the party can return to Atlantis to receive special benefits such as removing all wounds of one color from their deck, trading in loot, and recharging all of their crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
