			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'IT'S A 5 ALARM FUN FILLED RIOT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lickety-split! Quick! Quick!&lt;br/&gt;Before the mouse comes down the stick!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'IDEA OF THE GAME - The object is to get 4 of the same cards before the mouse slides down the pole. This is done by drawing &amp;amp; passing cards just as fast as you can. Watch the mouse and try to guess which number he will point to when he lands because cards of that number become &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot;.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box measures 12&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 22&amp;quot; high firehouse backdrop (thick die cut card with period illustrations) is supported by a plastic base (which also serves as the spinner) and a red plastic roof; a metal rod connects the plastic roof to the center of the spinner.  A plastic mouse attached to a small doughnut shaped piece of plastic is slid onto the top of the metal rod and positioned to commence each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spinner is used to designate 'wild' cards and to keep track of scores and round number. Players are dealt 5 cards; these are made of thick cardstock and are numbered 1-12, with 4 of each number. The mouse is nudged and set on its way. Players attempt to get as many of the same cards as they can by drawing &amp;amp; passing before the mouse reaches the spinner base. Only 5 cards may be held at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the mouse reaches the spinner below, cards are compared.  The segment which is occupied by the nose of the mouse becomes 'wild', so players can use cards of this number to enhance their hand.  The winner of the hand is the player with the highest number of identical cards, or the holder of the best cards if 2 or more players have an identical number of similar cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 12 rounds of play, the WINNER is the player who has won the most hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
