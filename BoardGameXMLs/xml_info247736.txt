			<description>PICKLE PICKLE PEPPER is a casual push-your-luck micro-game...which is a whole bunch of industry jargon that translates to, &amp;quot;This simple game turns a small number of components into a ridiculous amount of fun!&amp;quot; Designed to be playable by almost anyone in a very short period of time (5 to 15 minutes, on average), PICKLE PICKLE PEPPER is the perfect filler game, the perfect family game, and the perfect warm-up, cool-down, and/or in-between game for those marathon gaming days! It's also portable and fits in your pocket, so you can play it virtually anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put plainly, PICKLE PICKLE PEPPER is the perfect pastime for people with a passion for point-based pick-up play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(In this game, alliteration is part of the fun, so get used to it.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basics are simple. Players start their turn by shuffling the whole deck, then pledging how many cards they intend to draw; that's your Pickle Pledge. If you're able to draw a number of pickles equal to your pledge amount without drawing a pepper, you can choose to stop and bank your Pickle Points. However, if you're feeling bold, you can push your luck (which we call a Pickle Push). While you're pushing, pickle cards are worth twice as many points, but if you draw a pepper card, you not only score zero points this turn, you lose some of the points you've already banked! Once your turn is over, pass the deck to the next player and repeat. The first player to bank a total of 20 Pickle Points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
