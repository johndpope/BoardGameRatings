							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FrontierSpace Player&#039;s Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the stars in a distant galaxy there exists a region of densely populated habitable worlds. It is here your story begins, a place commonly called &amp;quot;the frontier&amp;quot; where people dwell and tales unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galactic Federation's power now wanes as corporations rise to fill the void left behind by the loss of their protection and authority. Citizens push on against adversity and defy the obviousness of their limitations. They live their lives doing work for the large interstellar corporations and governments. They huddle around spaceports and seek passage to the next system. They fight and they love and they die... but above all else, despite the vastness, despite the isolation, despite the dirt and the dust and the danger... the frontier is alive. And that's what makes it worth fighting for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player's Handbook is the essential sourcebook for every FrontierSpace role player. Contained in this book you'll find all the rules you need for creating, training, equipping, playing, and developing your character. This is a companion volume to the Referee's Handbook, available soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FrontierSpace is built upon the foundation of the d00lite system, the same game engine used to power BareBones Fantasy and Covert Ops roleplaying games. Years of feedback and continued game system development has evolved this product into something that flows at the game table while getting out of the way of a good story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
