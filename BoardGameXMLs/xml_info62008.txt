			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last, a study of one of the most-loved, most misunderstood, yet most irascible and loyal RuneQuest creatures of all: the Duck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of our Quester's Guides explores the life and lifestyle of Duck, explaining why they can be so bitter, what their true loves and ideals really are, and the motivation behind this highly loyal and fierce species. Within this RuneQuest supplement, you can discover their intense attitudes towards family and friends, their gods and cults, secrets of their courting and magic, how and why they feel insulted, their sayings, their weapons, and even their favourite sports and games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there's more: did you think all Duck are the same? Then find out about the different breeds of Duck, from the Barnacle Goose to the Forest Duck and even the handsome Harlequin. What do Duck think about trolls? About dwarves and wyrmkin? Find out all this - and more - in this packed sourcebook and, most importantly, find out why you should never call a Duck a duck...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete with guidelines on generating and playing Duck characters, full rules for playing a tabletop game of Duckbob, a Duck scenario ('Three Duck'), numerous new spells, this is a sourcebook every RuneQuest player has been waiting for. Long-neglected, Duck now come to life with the detail and background provided in this RuneQuest OGL supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
