			<description>A fast game about spaceships movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players move their spaceships, each one with different speed and try to reach the orbital station. In each turn every player can rotate some parts of the board for trying to delay the movement of the other player, causing him to waste useful time, trying to regain the path that leads to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first that moves all of his spaceships to the orbital station wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
