							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrabble Brand Turntiles</name>
									
			<description>Turntiles is a Scrabble brand game for ages 8 to adult. Played without a board, players have one minute to use their 7 large double-sided wooden tiles to form words crossword-style. Point values for letters are the same as Scrabble. A player may change an opponent's previous word by turning over a tile from that word and adding at least one new letter from his/her tiles. Contents include a drawstring bag with 61 tiles and 1-minute timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
