			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This shop is designed for anyone who wants to provide scholars, wizards, nobles, lore masters etc. with a full-fledged library resource. The shop is best suited for a large city that houses educational facilities and several factions of nobles and political parties. In the following pages you'll find the personalities who run the shop, several example tomes, assorted grimoires, as well as the layout of the shop itself and some interesting tidbits to make the shop truly come alive as a place your players want to visit again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
