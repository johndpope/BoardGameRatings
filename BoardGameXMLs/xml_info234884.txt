							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Birthday, Cayley</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All she wanted for her birthday was some time alone with her friends, drinking and playing games. But Cayley Morrow picked the wrong weekend to use the family cabin. The first night, it was just strange noises that unnerved all the guests. But somewhere along the second day Cayley went missing. And then the truck wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start. And the cell service died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s a long trek back down the mountain to a pay phone&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
