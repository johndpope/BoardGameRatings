							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creature Weekly Volume 6</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Octavirate Games presents Creature Weekly, a pack of new monsters available for download each Wednesday. Need new challenges, adversaries and allies? We have you covered. Each entry is illustrated and features variant rules support and genre adjustment information so you can easily fit the creatures into your campaign, whether it is set in the wilds of a medieval empire, the streets of a modern metropolis or the depths of far-flung space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume Six features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Dhaka. These small (relatively) near-dragons are relatively weak at first, but their natural inclination to uncover more draconic power as they grow older makes them an excellent adversary or ally. Includes a dhaka NPC and information for playing dhaka characters.&lt;br/&gt;     The Mox, a gigantic, land-walking octopus-like predator with lashing tentacles, a toxic ink cloud and a razor-sharp beak.&lt;br/&gt;     The Orlin, a player-ready race that represents the genetic equilibrium of the goblinoid races. They are a serious competitor for mankind's position as the dominant species of the planet and their mixed linage gives them advantages other species lack. Includes four new gods.&lt;br/&gt;     The Thanal, militant keepers of the planar balance of power. They're true neutral and are out to make sure that no other alignment gets the upper hand in the war for the soul of the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;     The Xores, a breed of earth elemental which straddle the line between elemental and living creature. Usable as monsters or as a player race. Includes a write-up for their chief deity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
