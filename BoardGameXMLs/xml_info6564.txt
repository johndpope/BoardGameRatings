							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">007 James Bond: You Only Live Twice</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box; &amp;quot;Aboard 'Little Nellie' the one-man flying machine, James Bond travels to the volcano where suspicious events have been reported. Suddenly the mission turns into a deadly fight, where every second counts as you struggle to outwit the enemy helicopters emerging from a hidden opening in the volcano!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview: A recreation of the air combat scene from the same movie one player plays James Bond moving around the board seeking to destroy his opponents with a vast array of arms (machine guns, missiles, rockets, flamethrower, and air mines) while the opponent with his four helicopters tries to blow up &amp;quot;Little Nellie&amp;quot; with machine guns. The board is dot/line spaces over a painting of a volcano where some dots are high elevation and some are low elevation making it easier and harder to hit your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
