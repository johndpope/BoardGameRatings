							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Western Front: The Liberation of Europe 1944-1945</name>
									
			<description>From the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WESTERN FRONT: THE LIBERATION OF EUROPE 1944-45 simulates the titanic clash between the Allies and the last of Hitler&amp;rsquo;s unbroken might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may play either the Axis or Allied forces against the computer, or select the two player option against a human opponent.  As supreme commander, you direct division or corps-level movement and combat operations, order air missions, and control the production of war materials in your factories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In WESTERN FRONT you issue strategic level orders to division and corps-sized units. Division-sized units are comprised of single divisions or brigades, which in turn are built of smaller support sub-units such as battalions, batteries or companies. Support sub-units have only one type of equipment assigned to them. Other support sub-units may also be assigned to division-sized units. Corps-sized units may have several divisionsized units in addition to support sub-units. When you examine units and view combat results, you see your assets and combat results at the level of individual planes, vehicles, guns, and infantry squads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WESTERN FRONT map is based on an invisible hex-grid system. In the full-map Overlord scenario, the map spans the entire theater of operations, from England in the west to past Berlin in the east, and spanning the entire front from Hamburg to Italy. In the scenarios, the map is confined to either the Western European or Italian theaters. Each hex is 10 miles across and each turn represents 4 days of real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
