							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mountain Pass</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every adventure needs a world map and this is your chance to get one. This is the third generic world map I'm releasing here on RPGNOW. This map however is a bit different from the other world maps. This is a map of a mountain pass with some locations placed out, like a ruined fort, a village etc. It's the perfect map if you want a more localized map of an area where some chain of events, adventures will take place. You can also use this map in combination with other maps that either I or others have made, or maps you have done yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have deliberately left out all names so that you can make the map work in any world or campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is in a panorama size but the length of the map is the same size as a standing letter format. After printing it you have to cut away the white parts of the paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map comes in both a metric and miles version, both in colour and black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
