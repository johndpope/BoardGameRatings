							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Divine Blood: The Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world has been changing at a rapid pace and no one has really noticed. Not the scientists inventing the high tech wonders, nor the soldiers that use them. Not the Demons in their brimstone, or the Gods in the heavens. Not even those who seek to bring change are aware of how things are progressing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone is moving about their lives as if the world is stable and everything is going as it is expected to. The world is stirring into a hurricane of change, and no one can predict completely what the end result of this will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people in the most position to see what is happening are spending their time chasing or creating symptoms of the overall problem. Soldiers and spies exchange fire and secrets in isolated battlefields away from the public eye. Exorcists chase paranatural beasts and ease the passing of ghosts. Demons and Gods continue to stare at each other across a gulf of past war and scattered rogues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look at it from the outside, where you sit with this tome in your hands or on your computer's screen. Take a sip from the cup in front of you, perhaps some hot tea with a twist of lemon. Can you see where the problem is? Do you know how to fix? Will you try?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
