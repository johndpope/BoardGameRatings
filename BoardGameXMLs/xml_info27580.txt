			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;You have heard of a man called Jesus of Nazareth who is performing many amazing miracles; you want to find Him to become one of His disciples.  The object of this game is to seek for Jesus in order to answer three questions: (1) Where is He? (2) What is He doing? (3) Who is with Him?  The first player to answer these three questions correctly wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
