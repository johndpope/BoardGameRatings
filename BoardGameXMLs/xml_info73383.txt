							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lure of the Temptress</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Lure of the Temptress is a fantasy point-and-click adventure game created by Revolution Software, published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment, and initially released in 1992 for Atari ST, DOS and Amiga systems. This was the first game developed by Revolution Software and was the debut for their own in-house developed Virtual Theatre game engine, which Revolution used in the subsequent games Beneath a Steel Sky and the Broken Sword series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lure of the Temptress, the player takes on the role of a young peasant named Diermot. He was most recently employed as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night, the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting the king's services to help stamp out a rebellion in the remote village of Turnvale. As the king's men depart on their horses to ride to the rescue, Diermot&amp;rsquo;s pony follows them, and he is unwittingly dragged along to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale, they are confronted not by an ordinary peasant revolt, but rather by a band of fierce, inhuman mercenaries - the man-eating Skorl, led by a young and beautiful enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated in the battle and the king is killed. In the process, Diermot is flung from his mount and winds up on the ground unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and toss him into the local dungeon, where the player starts the game, and Diermot begins his quest to rid Turnvale of Selena's evil tyranny.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lure_of_the_Temptress,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
