			<description>Understanding the concept of respect and developing the ability to show respect in a variety of situations are vital for success in school and throughout life. Circle of Respect&amp;reg; is an educational game specifically designed to teach students (1) the guiding principle that showing respect is the best way to receive respect, and (2) specific ways that they can show respect in four important areas of their lives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Classmates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Family&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As illustrated by the large circle in the center of the board, players learn to identify the situations in which showing respect is important. Issues such as respecting differences and respecting the environment are included. The game is careful not to equate respect with obedience. The players learn that it is acceptable to disagree (including with parents and with adults at school) as long as it is done in a respectful way. Cards demonstrate respectful ways of disagreeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
