			<description>Swedish game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dogs take on the cats in the back alleys. One player takes control of the dogs (six of them), the other the cats (equal amount). The players then take turns rolling the dice, moving their animals across the board. If your animal finishes its move on top of one of the opponent's you have won that fight and the loser is removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gets his animals knocked out first loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
