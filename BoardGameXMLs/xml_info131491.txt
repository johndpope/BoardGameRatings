			<description>Subtitle: The Dark Lore Quest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call To Adventure (CTA) is a role-playing game in the classical mould - Players portray a band of adventurers who face foes and hazards in a magical land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTA sets out to provide a fast and fun fantasy gaming system. As such CTA is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cinematic but strategic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Crunchy but streamlined - quick and simple to learn and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Character-centric but meta-plot driven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Open, any power available to the GM is available to the players and vice-versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Balanced. All characters are as effective as their level suggests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creative, imagination and invention are encouraged rather than stifled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each PC has been called to adventure for some highly important personal reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
