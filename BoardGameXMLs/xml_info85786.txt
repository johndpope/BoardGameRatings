							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blaze The Cat: Fire &amp; Safety Rescue Game</name>
									
			<description>This is an educational game designed for children ages 5 and older. The game &amp;quot;teaches children and families about different types of fire equipment and their uses. Additionally and most importantly it shows that it is always better to be a Team Player.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each kid is represented by a Blaze The Cat firefighter token. The board represents a 10 story building with 8 rooms or stairways on each floor. The players race to the roof and then jump into the rescue helicopter. The first player to reach the top is the winner but all of the children board the chopper at the end of the game... nobody dies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are intended to teach lessons about courtesy, safety, and the things firefighters do in an emergency. Players roll dice and draw cards to move during a turn. Some reading will be required unless a parent or older child reads the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 4 tokens, 70 cards, a die, a colorful board, and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
