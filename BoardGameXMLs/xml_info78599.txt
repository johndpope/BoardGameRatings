			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Castle Adventure is a Dungeon Adventure. It lacks a backstory, but it is soon discovered that the player is locked within a Castle and must fight many fiends as well as solve various puzzles in order to find his way to freedom. High scores are attained by finding as much treasure as possible, and are recorded for later viewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally released in 1984 under the name Castle Adventure, and was later illegally released under the name Golden Wombat in Keystone Software's Swords and Sorcery compilation in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
