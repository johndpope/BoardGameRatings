			<description>A trivia game about pop music. Each turn a player rolls the dice and moves his pawn. The square on which he lands determines the category of the question he has to answer.&lt;br/&gt;The person who has to ask the question has three question cards. He selects one of those and asks the question. If the question is answered correctly, the player gets points (depending on the difficulty of the question). The game ends when a player has reached the end of the track. The player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
