			<description>This game requires one standard deck of cards and only a very small play space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a solitaire card game where the goal is to keep scoring &amp;quot;hits&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players deal one card at a time, counting from 1 to 13 as they do so. When the rank of a card matches the number counted, it is removed. When a player reaches the end, they start again where they left off, until all cards are removed. If a player goes through the deck twice without scoring a hit the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
