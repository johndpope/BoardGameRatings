			<description>Don't Quote Me - Deluxe Edition is a trivia game where players are given quote (along with other possible hints) and are given points for giving the name of the person who said the quote.  Partial credit is given depending on how many hints were needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Quote Me - Deluxe Edition differs slightly from Don't Quote Me - Original Edition in that the former comes with 120 themed question cards whereas the latter comes with 25 &amp;quot;strategy cards&amp;quot; (both come with pentagonal quote cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
