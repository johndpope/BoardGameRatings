			<description>Descriprion from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One For All... Well, you know the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Savvy and Steel takes the player back to 17th Century Europe. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s heard of the Three Musketeers and the Cardinal&amp;rsquo;s Guard, and yes, By Savvy and Steel will work for that, but we&amp;rsquo;ve taken it a bit farther. How far? Glad you asked! Instead of tying you into Paris of the Musketeers we let you travel the countryside in a generic country called Edenstein. It&amp;rsquo;s based on the Europe of the 17th Century and it could be France or England if you want, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have the choice, it&amp;rsquo;s your story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In By Savvy and Steel you can choose to be a Guardsman, Rogue, or Civilian. Civilian? Yes, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t want to be a Civilian but you could be if you wanted to. So why are they there? Because it&amp;rsquo;s not all about dueling every day, in *By Savvy and Steel*, it&amp;rsquo;s about the adventure and Civilians make for good story lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe you have to rescue a kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Noble. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to be a Highwayman and rob coaches. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the story and that&amp;rsquo;s what* By Savvy and Steel* is about, the story, your story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In By Savvy and Steel you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A complete area to adventure in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Multiple scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A variety of Classes for you to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A fun and interactive Dueling system (well it is in the Musketeers time period!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A light book keeping campaign to track your character&amp;rsquo;s progress and link your adventures together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve received a message from the King. He requires your services but there&amp;rsquo;s still time for a mug of ale if you hurry. As you enter the Drunken Stallion, a foot is extended and causes you to trip into another man. With a curse he turns on you and tries to slap your face. You grab his hand, and he pulls away. You see him grab the hilt of his sword. &amp;ldquo;You sir, are an oafish pig and I demand an apology or satisfaction! &amp;ldquo;, he shouts. The tavern is suddenly quiet. Which will it be? Do you risk looking foolish in front of all, or do you accept his challenge. And who was it that tripped you? Welcome to &amp;hellip; By Savvy and Steel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
