							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King&#039;s Dilemma</name>
									
			<description>The King's Dilemma is a unique, narrative and interactive experience with a sort of deck-building mechanism at its core that features several branching storylines leading to many possible finales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players represent the various factions that lead the government of the kingdom: merchants, scholars, priests, etc. Players draw cards from the common deck and experience the game story unfold. Each card they draw poses a problem the council has to solve on the king's behalf. As members of the King's inner circle, the players' decisions shape the story of the game and determine the fate of the kingdom. They have to discuss, bargain, and take decisions that will affect the history of the realm by causing cards to be removed from the deck permanently or adding new cards to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to keep the kingdom going while also trying to advantage their own faction. This power struggle may lead the kingdom into war, famine, or riot &amp;mdash; or it could generate wealth and well-being. It will depend on your choices! The thing is, each decision has consequences, and what is good for the kingdom as a whole may be bad for your faction. Will you act for the greater good, or think for yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
