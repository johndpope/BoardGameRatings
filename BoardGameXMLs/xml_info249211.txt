			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So your adventurer carries a lantern and oil, right?  Ever ask where the oil came from?  Probably a whale.  Ever think about those whales and how the oil gets out of the ocean and into your lantern?  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, you should.  Whaling is one of the most epic adventures your character may ever participate in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a player or a game master, you are always looking for new ideas, but you are also looking for things that make your tasks easier.  This edition has literally tons of information (&amp;lsquo;cause whales are so big, get it?).  OK, it may not be a laugh a minute riot, but we&amp;rsquo;re talking through whales, whaling, ships, ports, sailors, captains, harpooners, and everything else you need to consider.  We even get into what the sailors make depending on how many whales they catch.  Oh, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget the issues of fighting sea monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Player and Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 14 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 37 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
