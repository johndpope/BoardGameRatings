							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemy Bazaar</name>
									
			<description>In the worker movement game Alchemy Bazaar, 2-5 players are rival alchemists who jointly own a growing bazaar of alchemical shops. Each round, new shop tiles are added to the bazaar, and the players then take turns moving their apprentices around the various shops to collect coins, alchemical ingredients, formulas and special actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each apprentice can move to one adjacent shop for free, after which the player can pay a coin to have the apprentice move to another adjacent shop, then two coins for another shop, and so on. Once an apprentice is finished moving, the shop where the apprentice ends it turn is unavailable for other apprentices to use, but other apprentices may move through that shop freely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formulas can be completed with certain combinations of ingredients, resulting in the alchemist gaining wisdom (by drawing wisdom cards). Each player also has a secret goal card, which will give bonus points at the end of the game. The player with the most wisdom and bonus points at the end of the game is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
