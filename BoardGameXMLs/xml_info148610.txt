							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WWII: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>September 1, 1939 &amp;ndash; For the second time in the 20th century, the world is at war. With the invasion of Poland by Germany, Europe plunges into war a mere 20 years after the end of The Great War, now to be known as World War I. Just over two years later, in December of 1941, the other half of the globe joins the war as Japan declares war on the United States and the British Commonwealth and tears through Western Pacific territories with astonishing ease. Will you save the free world as the Allies, or conquer it as the Axis?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WWII: The Card Game is a 2 player card game that pits the Axis against the Allied Powers in the Second World War. WWII: The Card Game is a constructed deck game in which both players construct their own deck before the game begins and then use their deck to wage war on their opponent. During the game, players build their resources and deploy military units to take control of locations by defeating their opponent&amp;rsquo;s units in battle. By winning battles and controlling key strategic locations around the world, players cause their opponent to lose cards from their deck. The first player to empty their opponent&amp;rsquo;s deck is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
