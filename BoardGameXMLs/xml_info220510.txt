			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possessed by the Spirits of the Ages, to seek out a new Destiny!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the millennia, the powerful souls of ancestors who achieved great (or infamous) deeds have sought to make their mark from Beyond, entering into the bodies of willing- or cursed- mortals.  These mortals are known as &amp;ldquo;Vessels&amp;rdquo; and can take on, by channeling, the spirits and powers of such intriguing and varied beings as the Babbling Priest, Blinded Warlord, Disturbed Captain, Hobbled Lictor, Unhearing Criminal or the Withered Sage! The Vessel class is a hybrid class of the &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo; class (from Purple Duck Games) and the revelatory Oracle!  With spells to use and many abilities to fit the personality to the situation- or travel in spirit form beyond the stars- the new Hybrid Classes: Vessel from Purple Duck Games is a fascinating addition to class choice for your table.  Hybrid Classes: Vessel has all you need to play the new class; ability charts, the Primal Vessel archetype to bring out the primitive elementalist in you, four new Vessel feats, and all the favored class bonuses for races introduced in the Lands of Porphyra campaign setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
