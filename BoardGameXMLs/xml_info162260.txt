			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;In a nondescript dwelling, down a dusty hallway, past rooms of unclear purpose, there is a door... a door that looks like many others, except for the ancient maroon tint of the aged wood, and, of course, the glowing runes emblazoned on the stones that make up the door-frame. Should you know its purpose, should you know the correct sequence to touch those runes, you might gain entry to a Storeroom of wonders, shelves and bins and racks beyond counting. Place your torch in the rusty sconce, and enter...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Purple Storeroom is a series of tightly-focused supplements that cover topics that do not fit into our larger offerings. They are the pieces that just don&amp;rsquo;t fit anywhere else or they are the little things we work on to take a break from bigger projects like Purple Mountain, Legendary Treasures, or Lands of Porphyra. They have been stored here for safe keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all had it happen. You want to create a specific type of character but to get the abilities you want you are forced to level dip to gain what you want. In the meantime some other abilities you possess in your primary class are never used. There needs to be a better way. This product came about from my discussions with Patricia Willenborg about the scarcity of the poison use class ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do alternate class abilities work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     To take an alternate class ability, you must give up a class ability of the same level when you level up or retrain.&lt;br/&gt;     Bonus feats and divine auras are not considered class abilities for the purpose of these rules.&lt;br/&gt;     Spellcasters may give up a level of spellcasting progression to gain alternate class abilities if they wish.&lt;br/&gt;     All substitutions made are subject to GM&amp;rsquo;s approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
