			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever allowed a player to pick up an item you were using as set decoration, only to have him spring the &amp;quot;how much can I sell this black candle for?&amp;quot; zinger when you least expected it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be ready for your looters with the Kaiser's Bazaar. This no frills, printer-friendly book is the first in a series designed to provide hard-working GMs and their more mercantile players with an exhaustive listing of hundreds of goods and services that might be available in a town, city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to keep pricing consistant, hopefully halting arguments, and providing a means to manage some control over the distribution wealth to players, all while providing them with new outlets for spending their developing fortunes. These listings can also serve as suitable alternative 'treasure' listings, providing GMs with a variety of new items to stock private chambers, homes, trade caravans, traveler's trunks or any number of locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
