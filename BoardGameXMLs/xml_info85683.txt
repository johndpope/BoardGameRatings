			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a mystery-themed adventure game exclusively for the Nintendo DS. The game is set around Sissel, a man who wakes up to the unfortunate realization that he is dead and that he has no idea how he died. While coming to grips with his newly freed ghost form, Sissel discovers that he can travel back in time up to four minutes before a person&amp;rsquo;s death and change the events that caused it. He decides to use his powers to prevent others from suffering a fate similar to his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is innovative in that Sissel cannot interact directly with any of the people he is trying to help. He can, however, indirectly affect them by animating the objects around them in order to prevent their deaths. There are over 100 objects to interact with in the game. Each stage provides a recently deceased person, and the player must rewind to before the death and prevent it before the four minutes expire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
