			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where there is a need for greater detail regarding Magic, Psionics, or Super Powers, the Powers Module is it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powers are broken down by Province and within the Province; Attack, Defense, and Advantage. These last three are rated by die type similar to an Ability Pool or Specialization and is generally known as a Power Die. It is attached to a specific Ability Pool and when used, rolled in addition to the Ability Pool and Specialization to determine the success of any conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Province is the general theme of the power &amp;ndash; Pyromancy, Summoning, Super Strength, Telepathy, and so on. Province describes roughly what the power is capable of, and what, if any are the limits. When on the offensive with a Province, the player rolls the Attack Die, and similarly, if the Province is being used to shield, roll the Defense Die. All other uses of the Province rolls the Advantage Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These dice are bought at the same cost as Ability Pools. The Scale determines the number of starting points. Attack, Defense, and Advantage need not have any dice assigned and simply indicates where the character&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses lay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
