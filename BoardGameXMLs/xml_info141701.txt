			<description>&amp;quot;The gameplay for Injustice: Gods Among Us involves one-on-one matches within a two-dimensional plane, although characters and backgrounds are rendered in a three-dimensional fashion. Each match consists of one round; however, each player has two health bars. The game uses a four-button control layout of light, medium, and heavy attacks, alongside a &amp;quot;character trait&amp;quot; button that activates a unique ability or attack designed to showcase each character. For instance, Superman's trait provides a temporary stat boost, while Batman's trait summons a swarm of robotic bats. Ed Boon, the creative director of NetherRealm Studios, stated that characters roughly fall into two categories: &amp;quot;power characters&amp;quot;, who rely on brute strength and innate abilities, and &amp;quot;gadget characters&amp;quot;, who use weapons, items, and other external mechanisms to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stages, based on locations such as the Batcave, Watchtower, and Fortress of Solitude, feature interactive environments and multiple tiers. Successfully connecting a heavy attack near the edges of the stage will launch the opponent into another part of the level. Each arena contains objects that the characters utilize differently depending on their class. For example, a gadget character like Batman can fire projectiles at a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman can pick up the same car and smash his enemies with it. Players will have the option to turn off interactive elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During combat, players charge their &amp;quot;super meters&amp;quot; by performing combos or getting hit by the opponent. Portions of the super meter can be used for performing enhanced special moves or countering enemy moves. With a full meter, players can unleash their strongest special attack. Players may also expend meter to compete in wager battles, dubbed the Clash system, which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting meter. A clash may be used to interrupt an opponent during a combo, and each player can only use it once after losing their first health bar. During the sequence, both players commit portions of their meter in secret, with the highest bidder winning the clash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story mode will be split into several chapters. As the narrative plays out, the player will swap between different characters. Minigames, such as quick time events, will also be incorporated into the story. The outcome of these minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional features include Battle Mode, comparable to the traditional arcade ladder, Versus Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer will include &amp;quot;King of the Hill&amp;quot;, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight, and a two-player online practice mode. Playing through any of the game's modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points that may be used to unlock alternate costumes, icons, achievements, and other rewards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbadges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Injustice Fan - Regime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Injustice Fan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
