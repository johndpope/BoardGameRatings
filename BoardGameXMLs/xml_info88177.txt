							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Larn</name>
									
			<description>Larn is a roguelike computer game authored by Noah Morgan in 1986 for the UNIX operating system. Morgan's original version of Larn remains part of the NetBSD games collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Larn is one of the shorter roguelike games. It can take many hours and tens or even hundreds of thousands of game turns to win a game of NetHack or ADOM, but Larn can reasonably be completed in one play session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Larn is one of the first roguelike games to feature a persistent home level&amp;mdash;in this case, a town. In addition to the player's residence, the town offers a bank, a shop, a trading post, a school, a tax administration office, and entrances to two dungeons, one of which is called a volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Larn is for the player to traverse a dungeon in search of a potion that will cure his ailing daughter of 'dianthroritis'. This quest is time-limited, measured in 'mobuls'. Apart from the main dungeon's ten levels, three additional levels are located beneath a volcanic shaft. To obtain the sought-after potion, the player must first acquire adequate experience, power, and gold. Larn increases in difficulty each time finished, making it harder for players to perform in-game actions, such as destroying walls or statues. Larn also requires the player pay a tax in subsequent games based on the amount of money in the player's possession when the game was last won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Larn (computer game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
