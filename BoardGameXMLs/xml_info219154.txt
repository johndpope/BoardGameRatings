							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Goat King</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an entire village&amp;rsquo;s goats disappear overnight, there can be but one explanation. When a siren, deep-throated bleating sounds from the hills, the goats answer the cry of their king. A Goat King is a mysterious creature that traipses through the world, calling its kin from their bondage in human settlements. Goats and men alike can hear their calls for miles, and goats will go to any length to free themselves and flee into the woods to join their King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A beast the size of a draft horse, verging on some two thousand pounds, combining aspects of goat and dragon. It has a long, reptilian, bisected tail and an odd wattle like a dragon&amp;rsquo;s wings, with multicolored horns and a flickering serpent&amp;rsquo;s tongue. Otherwise, its body is much like a goat&amp;rsquo;s - absent the front legs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capable of living on near any sustenance due to its roiling stomach fluids, the Goat King can also exhale those fluids in a searing cloud of toxic gas to kill its foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goats summoned to their king undergo a slow, insidious transformation. Over the course of a few days with the creature, they slowly gain a malign intelligence - rising to the pseudo-awareness of the King itself. Reports from distant lands even say that those creatures which spend enough time - months or years - with the king slowly transform into foul Goat-Men, building a society which is a cruel mockery of a human one. Slaying the goat king immediately reverses the transformation and frees the goats, which usually return to their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
