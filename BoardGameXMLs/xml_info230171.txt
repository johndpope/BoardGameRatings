			<description>This house is pretty haunted. Looks like you better start cleaning up the joint by getting rid of ghosts. But wait Aren't you a ghost? In that case, get these ghost hunters outta here! I don't&lt;br/&gt;know, you all look the same to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cause of Death: Ghost is a 4-9 player hidden role drafting card game. The object of the game is to have the most points by the end of the game. Points are earned at the end of each round by accomplishing the goal(s) of the character you drafted. The game ends after the final round. Play as many rounds as there are players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
