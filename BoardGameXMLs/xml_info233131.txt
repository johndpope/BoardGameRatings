			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Party game for the rude and well-read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that the only thing better than reading a book is pretending you've read it at a party. So gather some friends, some booze, and play Papercuts, a party game for the rude and well-read. To play, the Editor reads a question card, and the Writers submit their funniest answer cards for the Editor to choose from. Then, everyone complains about how no one will publish their genius novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Papercuts is compatible with Cards Against Humanity and other similar games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
