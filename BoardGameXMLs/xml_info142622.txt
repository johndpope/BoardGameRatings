			<description>Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program contains two versions of LIFE. The first option allows you to set up a patter[n] and watch the resulting life patterns unfold according to Conway's standard Life rules... but at the amazing rate of 100 generations per minute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second option is the Battle of LIFE game... using the full brilliance of Leo Christopherson's TRS-80 graphics... plus the exciting addition of sound! Watch as the characters talk and move with sound effects!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four life forms (biped, triped, uniped and quadruped) allow up to four players to participate. Each player chooses his lifeform (numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively) and places up to six of them at various locations on the grid represented by the numbers. Players may put all six on the grid in one turn or (more fairly) players take turns putting one of their lifeforms at a time on the grid. For two players, each player may take one lifeform or each may take two different ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each 5 generations, play is stopped to allow each player to add two more of their lifeforms to the grid. Play is then continued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
