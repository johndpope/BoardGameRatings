							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Viking Sen So</name>
									
			<description>Yes, you are a Viking! Your fierce flying attacks are legendary. Leading with your Axe, you force your foe to give way or pay the price. Not many understand or appreciate the power of a sharp axe, now is the time for you to show them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Viking brings the Hand Axe, Shield and War Axe to Sen So.  If you like being aggressive and keeping your foes at bay, the Viking is perfect for you.  The Viking is a single player set that can be played against any of the Sen So variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sen So game system uses a unique set of octagon cards and card holders. Players have to set (program) actions before their current action is revealed. All players reveal actions together. This provides fast play for even large numbers of players.  Game scoring provides balance and keeps the leaders on their toes. Players are required to choose their weapons and abilities for each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
