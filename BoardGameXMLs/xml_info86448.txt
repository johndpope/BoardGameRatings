			<description>Let's Build a Village is a cooperative game where players work together to clear the wilderness of monsters.  As areas are cleared, the players can build houses and sell the houses to villagers.  When the village is complete and all the player heroes are healed, the game ends.  The &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot; is considered to be the player having the most gold when the village is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players explore the wilderness by playing tiles.  Each tile has a monster that the player must fight to the death.  When four adjacent tiles are placed next to each other as a square, the player can build a house and attract villagers.  During a player's turn, the player can take three actions including moving tile to tile to explore, digging for gold, building a house, selling a house to a village, or healing wounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's Build a Village represents an game improvised on the fly by a seven year old girl.  She invented the game because she had left over 1&amp;quot; x 1&amp;quot; ceramic tiles from a second grade project.  Naturally, Dad helped a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
