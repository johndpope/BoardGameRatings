It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1533; Stage One: Abram Bussiere; Stage Two: Richie Janukowicz; Stage Three: Ant Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a story-telling game of charm, greed and friendly rivalry for 3 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is amass more Tokens than other players by using descriptive story elements to narrate how your character overcomes conflicts and obstacles on their road to financial glory, while attempting to cause as many issues for the other players by laying problems in their path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thematically interaction between characters should be modelled on the portrayals of Captain Jack Sparrow, Captain Barbossa et al from the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise, though any setting is possible and indeed appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
