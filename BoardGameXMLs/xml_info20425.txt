			<description>THE BIG BREAKFAST GAME is a 60 or 90 minute (dependant on the number of players) themed on the UK Channel 4 TV Series The Big Breakfast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is divided into 8 areas which are visited by the players based on spinning the spinner.  On arriving at the designated area players have to complete an activity in a manner similar to the items featured on the TV show:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNAP CACKLE POP - A memory game in which players have 30 seconds to memorise 14 items on a list and a further 30 seconds to recall them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHOSE WASHING LINE - The player has to guess the identity of someone from clues read from a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ON THE BED - A player must convey the identity of someone to the other players without using any of the words written on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONE LUMP OR TWO - A drawing game in which players try to reproduce the picture on a card with their eyes shut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CRUNCH - Players perform silly actions as described on a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOWN YOUR DOORSTEP - Players must guess where they are from the description on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EGG ON YOUR FACE - Players must mime or impersonate the individual on the card for 30 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INVENTION CORNER - Players must attempt to answer general knowledge questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points, in the form of breakfast items (sausage, tea, marmalade, egg, toast ...) are awarded for succesful completion of activities.  After a predetermined time (60 minutes for 4 or less players, 90 for 5 or 6 players) the game ends.  The winner is the player with the biggest breakfast (i.e. the one with the greatest number of points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
