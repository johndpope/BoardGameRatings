							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Devil, John Moulton</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere out there is your quarry. The one that you&amp;rsquo;ve been hunting across the vast desert of the American West. The one who showed you how to bind a demon to your soul. John Moulton. Murderer, bank robber, outlaw and demon summoning warlock. The man they call &amp;lsquo;The Devil John&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve gathered together a posse. Each of your posse is also seeking the same sorcerous bandit that you are. Some of you are seeking vengeance. Some are seeking redemption. Some just want to collect the sizable bounty on Moulton&amp;rsquo;s head. Each says that they want Devil John dead. Some of them might even be telling the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;re gonna ride with them, seeking out Moulton. Each town you ride into finds your quarry&amp;rsquo;s henchmen and minions. They&amp;rsquo;re losers and deadbeats who sold their souls for peanuts. But each one is going to bring you a little bit closer to the your final goal. Kill enough and you might find your way up to the man himself. Then, there will be a reckoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Devil John Moulton is a tabletop roleplaying game designed for one gamemaster and 2-5 player characters. You can run a game in a single sitting, but it is best suited to being a few sessions long, perhaps meeting 2 to 5 times for a few hours each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
