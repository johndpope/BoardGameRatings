							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tapping Out</name>
									
			<description>Players take turns using a plastic hammer to tap the center of a concave board topped by plastic pylons.  The object is to have the least amount of pylons fall off the board on your turn.  However, at least one pylon must be knocked off as a result of your tap.  The player with the least amount of total pylons to fall off by the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
