			<description>Babel 5 comes from a small Japanese publishing firm. The set consists of 30 large dice and 15 small dice, and five molded towers which are placed on tiles. At each turn, the players throws two large and one small dice. The dice must be placed on the corresponding numbered towers. A 6 can be placed on any tower. &lt;br/&gt;  If a tower topples over, the player keeps the dice and calculates a score based on a scoring chart.&lt;br/&gt;  When all the dice have been thrown and the scores calculated, the player with the lowest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
