			<description>Mauseschlau &amp;amp; B&amp;auml;renstark: Deutschland entdecken is a roll-and-move and trivia game in which children learn about Germany and its sixteen states. In fact, the box contains two different games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) B&amp;auml;renstarkes Reisespiel (ages 5 and up)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this roll-and-move game players visit the regional capital cities. The first player to reach a city wins the state's coat of arms (chips that are placed on designated spaces on the board). Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll in the direction of their choice. If they reach a yellow space with a red border, they get to take the coat of arms of that federal state. Some cities can also be reached by train or plane, but to use these, the player first has to earn a train or plane action chip. Action chips are collected by landing on action spaces. Apart from train or plane tickets, there are also action chips that gain or lose you a turn or win you a coat of arms. The game ends when all coats of arms have been collected. The player with the most coats of arms wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Mauseschlaue Wissenstour (ages 7 and up)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this game is to collect as many cards and coats of arms as possible. Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawn according to the result of the die roll. If they land on an orange space, one of the other players takes a card and reads the tasks. If the active player succeeds in answering the question or performing the action, she wins the card. Each card also displays the coat of arms of a state. When a player has won two cards assigned to the same state, she gets to take the coat of arms chip of that state as well. Coat of arms chips that other players have won can be taken from them if a player collects more cards about the same state than its current owner. The game ends after one or two rounds (players' choice) as soon as a player reaches her starting space. The player with the highest number of points &amp;ndash; with a card being worth one point, and a coat of arms two &amp;ndash; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
