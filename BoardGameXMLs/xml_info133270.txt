			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of Volley, Bayonet, and Glory 'Battalion Scale' as a suggested set of rules for this period came about as Frank Chadwick and Greg Novak discussed how to portray the Spanish American War. It is a 'modern' war in that the majority of the weapons will be used to usher in the First World War. Yet on the other hand it is one of the last black powder wars of the 19th Century. As this war did not last long enough to evolve tactics of its own, and was in many ways a rerun of the American Civil War in regard to the American Army, they decided to treat it as the end point of the Volley, Bayonet, &amp;amp; Glory rules, and offer a two volume supplement for those rules as part of this booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume Two Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A Miniatures Campaign for Western Cuba&lt;br/&gt;    The Uniforms of the Spanish Army&lt;br/&gt;    The Uniforms of the American Army&lt;br/&gt;    The Uniforms of the Cuban Army&lt;br/&gt;    Volley, Bayonet, &amp;amp; Glory for the Spanish American War&lt;br/&gt;    Las Guasimas &amp;amp; El Caney Scenario's &amp;amp; Orders of Battle for Volley, Bayonet, &amp;amp; Glory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
