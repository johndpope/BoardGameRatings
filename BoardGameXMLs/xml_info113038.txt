			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Why a game based totally on skills?  In most other games you have a list of only a few stats. How can everything in life be accounted for by a few stats? The score in agility shows your ability to run, draw, juggle, and cheat at cards.  How can these all be linked to one score?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People who are good jugglers are not necessarily good artists as well. So to fix this general ambiguity of abilities here it is, SOUPS, the skill based system.  This system also trades complex rules for the long list of skills.&lt;br/&gt;Another great thing about this type of system is its compatibility with any others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
