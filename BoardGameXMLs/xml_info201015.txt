			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WANNA BE A GOD?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If so, then look no further. We&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered! The Universim has been designed from the ground up to offer a very different take on your typical God Game. At its core, it offers all of the juicy features that long-time fans of the genre have come to know and love. But, this isn&amp;rsquo;t just a simple genre revival, it&amp;rsquo;s a reinvention! Take control of a dynamic, evolving gameplay experience as you advance your civilization from stone to the stars above. The fates of entire planets rest in your hands. With an AI that makes dynamic decisions, and a world that is forever changing, the possibilities are endless. So, what will it be? Will you guide your people towards prosperity, or merely watch as they descend into ruin? This is your power. This is the power of a god!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
