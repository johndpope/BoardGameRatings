			<description>The Ward is the second installment in the 9 Clues crime series, set in the 1950s America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young detective and her partner arrive on a lonely, rain-soaked island that houses an insane asylum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island is separated from the rest of society by freezing waters and constant, brutal storms. Upon their arrival, the detectives witness one of the hospital&amp;rsquo;s therapists falling out of the window to his death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly after starting their investigation, they learn that much darker things are going on at Mnemosyne Asylum. No one is willing to speak of the devastating fire, which engulfed the hospital four years ago, or the victims who died. The fact that the staff does everything they can in order to obscure the asylum&amp;rsquo;s story, makes everything even more suspicious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each clue uncovered only raises new questions. Who killed Doctor Crow? What caused one of the asylum&amp;rsquo;s male staff to lose his mind? Who is Zed Rascov? What connects the doctor&amp;rsquo;s death to the name of the little girl, Ginger, carved into the wood-paneled wall of his office?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
