							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Oil</name>
									
			<description>This exclusively equipped pre-war boardgame simulates the exploration of oil fields and the drilling for oil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the box lid says: Suspense - Exitement - Speculation !!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents are a lot of drilling rigs, oil tanks and game pawns, all made of wood in 6 different colours. Add a lot of company shares and money chips made of thick cardboard and you have a heavy game !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay was really good for its time, it's driven by an extremely large spinner (10 x 10 inches with 32 segments)and the amount of risk the players may take in drilling and how much shares they deal out to minimize their losses but on the other side also their wins. &lt;br/&gt;It's up to your feeling to find a good balance for all this !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
