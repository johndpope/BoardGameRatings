							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big, Bad Hunters</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big, Bad Hunters is a detective story set in a twisted fairy-tale world.  In this first of three adventures, the characters must find out who poisoned Gretel's cake.  En route, they run into many of the classic fairy-tale characters, but they may not be quite what the players were expecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is simple and easy to grasp for new players.  Character stats are based on adjectives - characters can be quick, very enchanting or terribly vulgar.  The magic of the game is scenery-based - wizards can enchant trees to grab at their enemies, or control the wind to frighten them.  Fudge dice are used in an all-new ways to make Gambits. Players can roll as many dice as they please (or none at all).  The more they roll the better their chances of success, but the worse the consequences for failure become if they lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
