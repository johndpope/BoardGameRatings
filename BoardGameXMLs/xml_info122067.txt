			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical post-apocalyptic adventure game in which an combat android investigates the sewers of a destroyed city in search of a doomsday weapon. The game is icon-driven. The back of the box says (translated from French):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;July 26, 2194, 4 years after the beginning of the third world war, a nuclear bomb detonates over Chicago, destroying the last remnants of earth civilization. A new life begins: these wastelands become the ground over which a neverending war between mutants and survivors rages. The war would have already been lost by the last human if they had not created SDAW, a perfect android.&lt;br/&gt;He's their only chance of defeating the mutants and create a new world. Alas, the mutants are also preparing for the final battle: on March 24, 2245 they deploy a new weapon of horrifying power.&lt;br/&gt;SDAW's mission is to infiltrate the sewers where the weapon is kept, and destroy it. But what if it's already too late?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
