			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting with Fire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am a brenner, a mental with the power to control fire. By using pyrokinesis I can warm a cold room, light a candle, or singe the hair off your head from a hundred yards away. If you&amp;rsquo;ve managed to ignite my temper, I can also roast you with a mere thought. It may not be legal to do that, but my kind often find themselves on the wrong end of the law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to find lucrative work using my destructive talents, but I&amp;rsquo;m more than just a stack of kindling waiting for a spark. Most people take my kind to be one-trick ponies, but I enjoy welding, picking lots, driving fast, and long walks on the beach as much as the next person. I may be hired to set people on fire, but my other skills are what set me apart from brainless thugs with giant guns.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psi-punk Archetypes: Brenner is the first of a line of sourcebooks for Psi-punk, a Fudge Cyberpunk RPG. Brenners are masters of pyrokinesis which gives them the ability to control fire with their minds. This supplement provides further insight into the archetype and offers suggestions for skill selections, Gifts, Faults, and Gear that would be useful to any brenner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
