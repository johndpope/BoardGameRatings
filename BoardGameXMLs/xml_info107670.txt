			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Day of Hope is a quick-start guide to using the custom card system for Jurassic Ancestry.  The first half of the book contains rules needed to get started.  The last half of the book is an adventure where the PCs are asked to escort a scientist to the Prime Minister of Britain (when trouble ensues).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this small adventure, players can use any 1 of the 4 pre-generated characters available (or any character's they create using the Core Rulebook) to play through and try out the unique Critical Bar system as well as help DM's become accustom to the new system of DM-ing. Keep in mind not a lot of detail has been put into developing the Pregenerated Characters as Joker's Playground is a firm believer in the use of custom&lt;br/&gt;made characters tuned to the players thoughts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
