Its addictive qualities go way beyond your standard card game. Get hooked today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Developer's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Astral Masters combines the best features of the computer game Astral Tournament and collectible card games while dispensing with the &amp;quot;collectible&amp;quot; part. Two players compete, each fighting against the other by casting various spells and summoning fantastic creatures. You can play either against the computer (both in single games and in tournaments) or against other people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is easy to learn and does not require previous knowledge of other card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Main game parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is represented in-game by a mage having three main characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of them is Life. A mage begins a duel having a certain amount of Life which will vary higher or lower during the course of the match. If at any moment the mage's life drops to zero or less, he is considered defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second main parameter is Astral Power, which in a nutshell determines your mage's magical prowess. Higher Astral Power means your mage will be able to cast higher cost spells. Each player begins the game with their amount of Astral power equal to zero. As a result of the players' actions each turn, Astral Power will generally increase over the course of the duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third main parameter is Mana, and it is directly related to Astral Power. At the beginning of each turn Mana is reset to equal the mage's current Astral Power. Basically any action the player takes requires him to expend a certain amount of Mana. If there isn't enough Mana for the action it can not be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Cards and their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a deck of cards and at the beginning of the duel, and is delt a hand from his respective deck. In the process of playing he gets one more card at the beginning of each turn. Also the player can receive cards as an effect of different spells and some creatures' abilities. Maximum number of cards you can have in the hand is 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards can be of two types: creatures and spells. Each card has a Mana cost. Creatures summoned by the player to the battlefield will stay and fight to the death, while spells cause a certain immediate impact on the game situation. When a player summons a creature or spell, the respective card must be played from his hand. Otherwise, play of cards is only limited by the amount of Mana available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides using cards for summoning creatures/spells, players can sacrifice one card per turn. The sacrificed card is discarded from the player's hand and both Astral Power and Mana are increased by 1. I.e. during the duel the player constantly makes a choice between which cards to discard so as to build up Astral Power and which cards to use to play against the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Creatures, slots and attack process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each creature has two stats: Attack Strength and Life. If the creature attacks any opposing creature, that defending creature's life is reduced by the attack strength of the attacking creature. If the creature's life is reduced to 0, the creature dies. Each player has 6 creature slots that can hold summoned creatures. If all the slots are full the player can't summon any more creatures - he can only cast spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a player's turn, all deployed creatures he controls attack the enemy. Each creature attacks separately. Enemy creatures in opposing slots absorb any damage from these attacks. However, if the creature attacks an empty slot, the attack directly injures the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Creatures' abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many creatures possess various abilities. There are three kinds of abilities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Permanent abilities. These abilities are always active, regardless of what else happens in the game. For example, Wall of Peace decreases the attack of all enemy's creatures by 1. This effect is active all the time while Wall of Peace remains in the game.&lt;br/&gt;    * Trigger Abilities. These abilities are triggered automatically when a particular event occurs, such as when a card is gained, a creature is deployed or a spell is cast. For example, Astral Chaneller increases the controlling mage's Astral Power by 1 each time a freindly creature with a Mana cost of 4 or greater is summoned into play.&lt;br/&gt;    * Secondary Abilities. These abilities are only activated if the creature's owner pays the necessary amount of Mana. Such abilities can be used only once per turn for each creature. For example, for 1 Mana the Elven Archer can conduct a ranged attack against any enemy creature and inflict 4 damage points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website. with a lot of editing for grammar and clarity!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
