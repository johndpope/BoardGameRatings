			<description>Guerra de mitos XIII: Era Mortal expands Myths at war, a card game set in a fantastic world where different mythologies coexist. It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each installment increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 165 cards split with Celtic mithology and some Heroes out from Mythsgate (one of GDM Releases for 2018)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Era Mortal&amp;quot; is the second expansion of the fouth age of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in Guerra de Mitos (Myths at War) needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each installment increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&amp;rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
