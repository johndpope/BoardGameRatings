							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 â€“ Sopwith Snipe</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sopwith Snipe was a British single-seat biplane fighter of the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Snipe was not a fast aircraft, even by the standards of its time, but its excellent climb and maneuverability made it a good match for contemporary German fighters and it was selected as the standard post-war single seat RAF fighter. It was flown by a number of famous aces such as William George Barker, Alexander Kazakov and Grigoriy Sapozhnikov. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
