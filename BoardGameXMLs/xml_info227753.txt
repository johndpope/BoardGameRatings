			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Arise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure and danger await you across the many worlds of the Aethera system, and when adventure calls, heroes must rise to the occasion. In Aetheric Heroes you will find 10 richly detailed and masterfully designed characters ready for use in the Aethera Campaign Setting or your own Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign. Each hero's personal relationships and backstory are connected to the lore and events of the campaign setting, allowing you to explore Aethera in even greater depth! Use these heroes as ready-to-use player characters, allies or enemies, rivals or cohorts. This book contains two characters for each of the five races of the Aethera Campaign Setting: erahhi, human, infused, okanta, and phalanx! Plus, you'll find new Aethera rules material like Unholstering Strike and the aether soldier fighter archetype! Your Aetheric Heroes include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Aleta, infused wizard (spell sage)&lt;br/&gt;    Arakhu, okanta cavalier (aethership pilot)&lt;br/&gt;    Chapter, phalanx cantor&lt;br/&gt;    Chernardra, okanta shaman (speaker for the past)&lt;br/&gt;    Erryn, human hunter (tech bonded)&lt;br/&gt;    Hauyne, phalanx unchained rogue (snoop)&lt;br/&gt;    Kasara, human fighter (aether soldier)&lt;br/&gt;    Oemathra, erahthi alchemist&lt;br/&gt;    Surestra, infused brawler&lt;br/&gt;    Tillannieh, erahthi hydrokineticist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built using the 20-point-buy method, these characters are not just piles of statistics. Each one is as much about story as combat, with robust links built in to each other as well as the Aethera Campaign Setting, though every one easily stands on its own in any setting where magic and machines meet noir intrigue with a touch of cosmic horror. The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&amp;rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Aetheric Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines. If you are looking for some fantastic characters for your sci-fi/fantasy campaign, grab this 48-page character collection today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
