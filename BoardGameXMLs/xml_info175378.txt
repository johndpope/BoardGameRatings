			<description>Be the first to lay all your stair parts on the gameboard to win! A simple color and recognition game for younger kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets stair parts in different lenghts (10 with 2 players, 7 with 3 and 6 with 4). Spinn the color wheel and put one of your stair parts on the matching stair on the game board with exactly two persons step on it. It is possible that you can't place a any of your stair parts (no matching size, not able to match exactly two persons, not enough free space on the chosen stair). If so, you must collect all stair parts from the chosen stair. The player who has placed sucessfully all of his stair parts is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
