			<description>From the inside of the lid:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Object of the game is to make as many words as possible from the ten (10) letters obtained by spinning the wheels&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of markers and a mini-roulette wheel of the same color. Each hole on the wheel corresponds to two letters of the alphabet and a number.  The board is divided into quadrants, each having a color matching a wheel and a hole where the wheel sets into. Players play only on their like-colored quadrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each quadrant shows an alphabet list.  Players spin their own wheels 5 times to get a set of 10 letters, marked with a disk on the board.  When the 10 letters are obtained, the sand timer is flipped and players race to make the most words from their letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game advertised 6 games total that can be played.  However, the main game, described above, requires some skill.  The other 5 (including one using the numbers on the wheels) are completely luck driven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
