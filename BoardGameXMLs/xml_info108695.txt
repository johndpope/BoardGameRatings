							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Balyna Discbat Cricket</name>
									
			<description>A variation of the classic cricket action game. Small plastic fielders, a mechanism to allow batting, another one to allow bowling, a ball and a field made up of different run areas. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t get much simpler. Sister product of Balyna Football. Both games were designed to be a competitor to Subbuteo's cricket and football games.&lt;br/&gt;In many ways the game is quite surreal, with the bowler being represented by an aluminim funnel from which the fielding team bowls the ball. The batsman is a counter weight which is held by a piece of cotton by the player. When the ball is bowled, the batsman releases the counter weight and, depending on the angle can play a variety of shots. Great scoreboard too, but completely useless as the scoreboard is metal and the score numbers cardboard. They fall apart far too quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
