			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a New Kind of Mythic Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your character&amp;rsquo;s mythic path tells you about the kinds of abilities in which he specializes, and perhaps even gives some clue as to his ultimate mythic destiny, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about where he came from, and what made him mythic in the first place. For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment explores the draconic heritage, and characters whose mythic power comes from the majestic and terrifying creatures known as dragons. Whether you can trace your ancestry back to a powerful and terrible great wyrm, you act as a favored agent for such  creature, or you simply serve as a focal point for the powers of a draconic totem, this mythi heritage allows you to tap into the incredible power of dragons. The book includes 17 new mythic abilities, all of which are part of the draconic mythic heritage. In addition to timeless draconic powers like breath weapons, leathery wings, and scales that turn aside both blades and spells, these abilities also include such powers as the ability to sniff out treasures, empower draconic sorcerer blood, and grow more powerful with age, just as ancient dragons do. Harness the power and majesty of dragons for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
