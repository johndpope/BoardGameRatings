							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Loona: Port of Intrigue</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Stones of Peace to the Port of Intrigue...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Loona, the Port of Intrigue: a completely detailed fantasy port town for D&amp;amp;D campaign play. From the pens of Phil Thompson and Ed Greenwood, one of the best-known D&amp;amp;D writers of all time, comes this richly detailed setting. Loona is the trade center of the nearby city of Geanavue: the Stones of Peace - but the politics and alliances of this den of thieves is even more dangerous for the unwary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter this ramshackle, lawless chaos where sailors brawl, rats scuttle, and death comes quietly in the night. Beware of thieves' and assassins' guilds, dark conspiracies and religions, and seedy merchant cabals, as you become tangled in the webs of intrigue that run through this colorful port town. Join fully developed guilds and societies, and side with prominent powers and enigmas, or ready your weapons and attempt to explore the town on your own. But beware - sometimes the local rumors are even more terrifying than they appear, and death is only one dark alley away. Welcome to Loona, adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loona can be used either as a 'home base' or simply as a stopover in your campaign. From the salty Dock District to the Bowery to the better-kept Master's District and all those in between, this sourcebook presents a firm foundation for years of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all Kenzer and Company products, this supplement was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details so you can spend less time flipping pages and more time gaming. Being a DM has never been so easy, or so much fun! Here's some of what you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 96 pages of useful background, maps, rumors, adventure hooks, a full glossary, artwork and campaign details: no fluff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Over 100 NPC profiles and statistics, including all of the major players in town, and most of the minor ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Loona also comes packed with nearly 100,000 words detailing inns, taverns, guilds, nobles and more, as well as several pages of maps of Loona and the surrounding countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All done in the quality you've come to expect from Kenzer and Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although easily converted for use in any campaign setting, this book is designed for use of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons v3.5 rules with the Kingdoms of Kalamar - a realistic, dynamic world where complex political alliances mix with marauding bands of humanoids, and medieval technology and culture come faces to face with magic and the fantastic. Whatever type of adventure you seek, you can find it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
