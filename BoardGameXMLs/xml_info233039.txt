			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Planet 0419, players compete as 4 space exploration/mining companies trying to explore a new, far away planet and gather as many resources from it as they can. The players also need to get back to Earth as fast as possible in order to get their items to be the novelty and sell for more money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet 0419 is a tile-placement/hand management game in which the players use crew members (cards from their hand) to explore an Earth-like alien planet by drawing and laying down tiles. The tile might feature a resources, or just be plain terrain. If a tile has resources, players use crew members to mine them or possibly steal them from other players. During a game of Planet 0419, players are trying to use their crew members efficiently as possible because once they are used, they cannot be used again. Once a player has as many resources as they want, they try to leave the planet with players doing this first getting bonus points and players leaving later getting penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
