			<description>What&amp;rsquo;s up? Jr. is a fast paced game where all players will have to create a crazy fun story using the elements shown on the game cards (castle, car, etc.). During the game, the different action cards will force you to continue the story using mime, challenge your peers or even introduce yourself into the story. Once the cards have been dealt, one by one you will place a card face up, telling a story that includes the image on the card. The story should be logical but can be as crazy as your imagination allows. But you must be aware of the action cards, as you could have to change direction, duel, tell the story with mime, etc. Will you be able to end the story?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
