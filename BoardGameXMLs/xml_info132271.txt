			<description>Historical card game, featuring episodes in the life of the Pilgrim Fathers on their arrival in the 'New World'. The cards are divided into 4 suits of 13 cards and numbered A through D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 52 cards are dealt completely out to any amount of players.  The player to the left of the dealer goes first and must begin by placing a card numbered either 1 or 13.  If the player cannot set a card of that number down then he or she receives a penalty point places a counter in the Pool) and play moves on to the next person.  This player can lay a 1 or 13 card down of any letter or may lay a 2 on a 1 or a 12 on a 13 on a matching letter, if the first person was able to set a card down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue to set cards down by the sequence of numbers on matching letters going forward or backward.  If any players are unable then penalty points are given and play moves on.  Once the Lettered series gets to 1-6 and 8-13, the 7 is placed to complete the series (only once the 6 and 8 are both played can the 7 be placed across).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all their cards, wins the round and scores one point for every card held in all the opponent's hands. The first player to get 15 points, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
