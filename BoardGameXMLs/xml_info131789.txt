							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deadly Seven</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deadly Seven is a modern-era supernatural horror adventure that pits the characters against seven unwitting servants of hell. The players will have to contend with a variety of threats both direct and indirect ranging from drive-by shootings and murderous psychopaths to rogue hackers, misguided zealots, and the demonically possessed. As each encounter draws them deeper into the grip of evil, they&amp;rsquo;ll have to find the connection between their seemingly unrelated opponents to find the sinister mastermind manipulating events behind the scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-part adventure, The Deadly Seven can be played as an extended campaign or as 7-8 independent scenarios ranging from all-out action to tense investigations. Each segment is designed to be incorporated into an ongoing story but the story also works if you play straight through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deadly Seven is suitable for any modern urban setting that includes paranormal activity. It can also be a great way to introduce the paranormal into an otherwise-mundane campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deadly Seven is also a sourcebook on demons and the theology of demonic possession, outlining the various stages of &amp;ndash; and rules for &amp;ndash; possession and exorcism. These sections can be printed out as player hand-outs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     150 pages of text + 30 pages of character stats + 21 pages of maps&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color, Fully Illustrated, Multi-Layered PDF&lt;br/&gt;     7+ Individual Adventure Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;     5 Multi-Page Maps Including Offices, Homes, &amp;amp; Neighborhoods.&lt;br/&gt;     2 Sets of Clue Cards for player hand-outs.&lt;br/&gt;     3 System Compatibility&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains adult situations. May not be appropriate for individuals under 17.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
