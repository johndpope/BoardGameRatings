			<description>Napoleon returned to power from Elba to find the Great Powers of Europe united against him. Realizing that he was massively outnumbered, he decided his best chance was to attack first and try to take out some of his adversaries before they could combine and descend on France. He chose to move against the English and the Prussians in Belgium. Furthermore, he thought that he could achieve a political victory if he could capture Brussels. The Waterloo Campaign is a small-scale, fast-play game that simulates the historical events of June, 1815 which ended the career of Napoleon Bonaparte. The goal of the game is to recreate the problems faced by Napoleon at the operational level and perhaps achieve a better result than arguably the greatest general in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Small Scale, Quick Play Microgame&lt;br/&gt;    * Only 28 Unit Counters&lt;br/&gt;    * Colorful Game Map 8 1/2 x 11&lt;br/&gt;    * Operational Level Play&lt;br/&gt;    * Four-Page Rules Booklet&lt;br/&gt;    * Game Play Sheet&lt;br/&gt;    * Counter Sheet To Cut Out&lt;br/&gt;    * Solitaire Play Level: HIGH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from site)&lt;br/&gt;Full Game: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.whitedoggames.com/pnpgames.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.whitedoggames.com/pnpgames.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
