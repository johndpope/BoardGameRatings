							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom of Toads: Mythic Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run Amok Games' highest-level adventure, reinvented with mythic proportions! This new edition of 2013's &amp;quot;Kingdom of Toads&amp;quot; contains updated threats to challenge mythic PCs, new treasures, updated art, and pregenerated PCs bearing mythic power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curse will echo in legends: in one dire moment, each man, woman, and child in the Kingdom of Kelwyk was transformed into a simple toad. Only the king's advisor, displaced from his body on an astral sojourn at the time of the curse, retains enough of his mind to summon aid. Could the rival County of Stonevale be behind this affliction? Or has Kelwyk's decades-old foe, the vile witch Vakelna, wrought her vengeance at last? The world's greatest champions are urgently needed to unravel the mystery of the Kingdom of Toads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom of Toads: Mythic Edition is an adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game of legendary scope and suitable for any campaign world. Presented for PCs of 17th or 18th level with 7 or 8 mythic tiers, and specifically designed to accommodate the varied and spectacular powers of high-level mythic PCs, this adventure also includes notes and statistics for scaling challenges to PCs of lower or higher level. &amp;quot;Kingdom of Toads: Mythic Edition&amp;quot; is written by Ron Lundeen and illustrated by Jeff Strand and Blake Wilkie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
