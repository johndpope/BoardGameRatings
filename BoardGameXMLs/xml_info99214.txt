			<description>A set collection game with some of the finest card illustrations. 72 cards making 24 pictures cut into three parts.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given 12 counters. Everyone now puts 5 counters into the 'Pool' and receives cards, leaving half the pack as a 'reserve'.&lt;br/&gt;The player sitting left of the dealer starts and must play the first card of any set, if he has one. The next player plays a second card to the set started by the player to his right, if he has such a card. And so on, until a full set of three cards is revealed. The player playing the third part of the set (actually, called a trick in the rules), and must now start a new set if he can. There are penalties for a player not playing a card when he should or if the wrong picture is completed and so on. If you genuinely cannot play a card, you draw a card from the reserve.&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, for a game of this age, you can score bonus points for certain tricks or negative bonuses for some tricks.&lt;br/&gt;For example, completing the Baby set takes 5 counters from the pool and one counter from every other player, or completing the Horse Omnibus set pays three counters into the pool, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;The player taking the most tricks when all 24 sets have been completed takes the remaining counters in the pool and the player now with the most counters, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
