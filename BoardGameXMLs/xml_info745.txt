							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War of Resistance</name>
									
			<description>War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which cronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.&lt;br/&gt;The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.&lt;br/&gt;War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    One rules booklet.&lt;br/&gt;    Two Orders of Battle booklets. One for the Japanese and one for the Chinese orders of battle.&lt;br/&gt;    A Battle Scenarios Booklet&lt;br/&gt;    Four &amp;quot;full-sized&amp;quot; maps (Maps G1 thru G4) and 2 &amp;quot;half&amp;quot; maps (Maps G5 and G6).&lt;br/&gt;    Two map overlays&lt;br/&gt;    8 counter sheets (CS G1 - CS G7)&lt;br/&gt;    A set of charts &lt;br/&gt;    Two six-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
