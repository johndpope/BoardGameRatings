			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Identity Pursuit is a game that uses the concept of archetypes to challenge you and your fellow players to look more closely at how you see yourselves and each other.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins by placing a pawn on the starting square and drawing four cards, each of which names and describes and archetype such as &amp;quot;mother&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;adventurer.&amp;quot;  Three cards are kept and the fourth, which the player least identifies with, is placed face-up in front of the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player either chooses a card from his/her hand or one of the face-up cards from another player and finds the corresponding question with multiple choice answers in a booklet.  The player reads the question without comment and then chooses his or her answer and records it secret with the &amp;quot;players choice wheel.&amp;quot;  The other players may then discuss the question and then provide their answers to the question.  Finally, the current player reads the definition of the archetype and the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; answer (i.e. the one that corresponds best to the archetype).  The current player then moves his or her pawn on the track a number or spaces depending on how well his/her answer matches the other players' answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After playing a card from his/her hand, the current player then draws another card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the end of the track wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
