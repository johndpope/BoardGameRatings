			<description>A new market has opened in the city square. Great business opportunity awaits the most enterprising merchants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will be the richest of the square (the winner), in the end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a trader, each player on their turn can open new stalls (place one or more stall-tiles) following the strict municipal rules or bring new customers to the market (move a customer). In the city, customers have a somewhat extravagant and habitual behavior: they always walk straight ahead until they meet stalls, then they always turn around counterclockwise; they buy clothes and shoes in any order, but only vegetables or fish after buying vegetables, and only other fish, after they buying fish. Obviously customers buy only products that are on their shopping list.&lt;br/&gt; Try to open your stalls in strategic position and keep an eye on price trends: the best selling goods will be more expensive in the next rounds. But stalls of a goods type can inflate that goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, beware of thieves, workers, policeman and many other characters that could benefit (or damage) your (or opponents) business: You have action disks that can be spent to pick-up and/or use special actions of such characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful to plan your actions in time, as the market is divided into phases, marked by the opening of increasingly modern stalls: during the game the old stalls will be scrapped. When all the stalls are exhausted or when at least one of the goods has reached the maximum price, the market will be closed and the game will be over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
