			<description>This self-published game uses a system similar to that in Win, Place &amp; Show to simulate a series of horse races.  Each player is required to bet within certain minimums and maximums, with only the winning horse for each race paying out.  The winner is the player with the most cash at the end of the series of races (usually six or nine).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
