							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dignity</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Dignity is a human relations board game which seeks to portray the frustrations of people in the ghettos. The object of the game is to reach a square called Dignity. To get there, a player, who is given five cards and $100, tries to avoid Shanty Town, Housing Projects, Skid Row and other unpleasant places. A shortcut through Uncle Tom's Limbo precludes playing Freedom Move cards, generally helpful in the game. There is another shortcut through the University, but that costs $2000, which is difficult to acquire. Players will encounter setbacks as well as unexpected opportunities to reach Dignity.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials: Game board, cards, play money, accessories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
