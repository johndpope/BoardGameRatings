			<description>In-app description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atari's final football game for the Atari 2600, featuring updated plays and a perspective view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Football offers 3-D football action. On screen you get a full view of the field from above and behind the offensive team. And you control the action as the players line up, kick, run, pass and score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play Super Football on any one of four game levels. As you advance to higher levels, game play lasts longer and the action heats up. You'll even select formations and patterns to run the game your way. To win, your five-player team has to score more points than your opponent's, with touchdowns, extra points, and field goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During game play, the clock runs continuously. There are no time-outs, fumbles penalties, safeties, or running out of bounds in Super Football, so your game continues uninterrupted while you rack up points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Super Football, it's nonstop gridiron action until the final whistle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
