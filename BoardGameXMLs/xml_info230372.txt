			<description>A One-Round Living Jungle Tournament for All Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malatra, the Living Jungle, a wild and savage land where untamed creatures roam free and humans and demi-humans come together in tribes for protection, mutual survival, and a sense of family. An untold number of tribes cover the lands of the Living Jungle, each located across the known world of the Nubari - the dominant race of humans that populate the land. Some tribes and races live together in harmony, while others have been bitter enemies for generations. This is the world of the Living Jungle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of you are a hero of Malatra, associated formally or loosely with one or more of the tribes of the Living Jungle. Your tribal chief comes to you one evening after the sunset and meal, &amp;quot;Young one, a messenger has come into the village this evening. I have spoken to them and the news they bring is terrible. Great earth shakes have almost destroyed the Jengi village. The village elders are injured and their witch doctor almost dead. They need help badly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your chief tells you a tale based in the village of another time, when great heroes came to assist your village during times of trouble, and how the village has never forgotten those heroes. Children have been named after them, and the tales are still told by the evening fires. He then asks if you would take the journey to the tribal village of Jengi.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
