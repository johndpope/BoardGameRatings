			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will save Starlight City?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Residents are going missing in one of the swankier city districts, West Starlight. Someone or something is up to no good and Starlight City's leaders have turned to capeNET, to find heroes, also known as Capes, and put an end to the abductions plaguing the city.&lt;br/&gt;The Blood Saga Logo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BLOOD SAGA is one part city guidebook, detailing the fourteen different and distinct districts that Starlight City has to offer. Additionally, each district offers several events that can be used to help expand the included adventure and to make Starlight City your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second half of THE BLOOD SAGA features a branching path of discovery as the heroic Capes track down the menace behind the abductions and their true, nefarious goals. In addition to a full adventure, which can be used with the city book to create an ongoing campaign, the book includes four pregenerated characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BLOOD SAGA makes use of ICONS Superpowered Roleplaying and does occasionally reference other books, such as ICONS Great Power, ICONS A to Z, and ICONS Adversaries. It is entirely possible to play using only the core ICONS book, however the other books help to maximize the play experience for everyone involved and are well worth the purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
