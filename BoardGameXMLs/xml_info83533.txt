			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;In Kobolds Ate My Baby! Third Edition, you become Kobolds (short, furry cannon-fodder with a penchant for gluttony and mayhem).  Your mission is to steal babies from the nearby towns, so that King Torg (ALL HAIL KING TORG!) can have them for dinner.  Along the way you'll learn forbidden magick, battle blood-thirsty chickens, worship The Big Red God, get killed by Random Horrible Deaths(TM), and cook your friends for dinner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completely revised and updated to use the BEER ENGINE! Bear and Pretzels Role-Playing Game System, KAMB3E is faster, funnier, and easier to use than previous editions.  This book has everything that you need to get started, including: kobold generation rules, a quick and easy rules engine, magick spells and other gear that Kobolds have stolen, a starter adventure, and a slew of absolutely ridiculous House Rules!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
