			<description>A Trip Through Story Book Land With Mother Goose. The players are visiting Story Book Land where they will meet and read all about their Story Book friends such as Mother Goose, Jack Be Nimble, Humpty Dumpty and many others. They move along the path by use of the spinner. When they meet Mother Goose on the path, they must turn the knob on top of the Candy Tower. When they turn the knob, Humpty, who has been sitting on the wall watching them will either remain where he is, or flip off the wall. If Humpty falls off the wall, the player must go back to the nearest black space with a red arrow. The first player to complete the trip through Story Book Land is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
