							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Scared Soppet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever been scared? Being scared can be fun if you're watching a scary movie or telling scary tales. There are also plenty of times that being scared is no fun at all! What do you think is scary? If someone you knew was scared, what could you do to help?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all been scared at one time or another. It can be fun if you're on a roller coaster or watching a scary movie. There are other times though when it is no fun at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different people find different things scary. Some people are scared of monsters; others are scared of things that may not be scary to you and I. We'll take a look at what it's like to be scared, and see what we can do help our friends when they're scared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a group of kids, it's a great way to see that everyone is afraid of something. With the use of their Soppets, they can talk about and act out these fears behind the safety of a sock puppet, each taking turns helping each other out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For individual children who may have experienced traumatic incidents in their lives, it's a chance to address these incidents with their parents, caregivers and behavioral health professionals. Role playing through these incidents with the guidance of someone they trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
