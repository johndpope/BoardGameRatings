							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cauldron Supplierâ€™s Guidebook, Volume 3</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the mysterious and often dark practices of the arcane is enough to keep the feeble minded and cowardly at bay a truly enterprising adventurer has a bold enough heart to journey into the darkened markets of foul mysticism, especially if the adventurer in question happens to know a bit about wizardry his self.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cauldron Supplier&amp;rsquo;s Guidebook is not an instruction regarding the arts of magical practice but rather a listing of commodities deemed valuable by those who engage in witches&amp;rsquo; brews, alchemical formulas, potion craft, and experimental spell craft. Scattered across the following pages are the descriptions and listings for over two dozen items that may prove to be profitable for a supplier daring enough to deal in the ingredients of the arcane. A bit too spooky for the barbarian who shuns all forms of practiced magic, but extremely resourceful for the cunning individual who wishes to make a few extra coins off their dungeon crawling, forest wrecking, monster slaying expeditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
