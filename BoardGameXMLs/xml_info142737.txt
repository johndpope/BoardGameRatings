			<description>Two players have eight pieces each, called &amp;quot;Kibs.&amp;quot;  In the first phase, they take turns placing pieces on a five by seven board (with the center node missing), trying to form a &amp;quot;KIBIK&amp;quot; (four pieces in a row).  A KIBIK allows a player to remove an opponent's piece.  After all pieces are placed, the second phase begins where players are allowed to slide pieces and make more KIBIKs.  When a player is reduced to four pieces a jumping move is allowed.  The player to first remove five of the opponent's pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
