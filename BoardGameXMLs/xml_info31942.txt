			<description>This game is a derivative of Shut the Box and is also called Help Thy Neighbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is supplied with a number card with the numbers 2 through 12 printed on it. Players start by placing a chip in the kitty or ante or some other predetermined amount. As each player rolls the dice they cover the corresponding number on their board much like bingo. If a 7 is thrown, the player loses a turn unless it is their first throw. In which case all players put a chip in the kitty and the player keeps throwing dice and covering numbers on their board or their neighbor's boards if he/she cannot use them until another 7 is thrown. The player who covers all their numbers wins and wins the chips in the kitty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
