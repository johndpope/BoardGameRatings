							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Tournament</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Tournament is played on a rectangular board; situated in its center are thirteen circles arranged in a star-shaped pattern, with one circle in the center (the safety spot,) surrounded on all sides by six more circles, and with another six circles spread out evenly around that.  On either long end of the board is a triangle comprised of six circles, three on each outer end (the Bases,) narrowing toward the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three pieces of varying colors called Knights which start the game on each player's Bases, and whose movements are determined by the spinning of a teetotum in a hole on the bottom of the game's box.  Currently there is no photo or record online to describe in what combination of colors the pieces were made, nor the teetotum.  Players do not take turns moving; they spin the teetotum to see which colors come up, and determine who moves and for how many spaces based on its outcome.  Knights always move towards the opponent's side of the board, unless no move is available, in which case they must move backward.  Knights may jump opponent's Knights, sending the opponent's piece back to one of its Bases.  The center safety spot prevents any occupying Knight from being jumped.  To win the game, a player must move all three of his Knights onto the opponent's Bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
