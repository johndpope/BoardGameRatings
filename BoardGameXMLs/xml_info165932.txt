Inside them, unknown creatures (&amp;hellip; Aliens) are gathered and plot on how to take control of the lands and ultimately extract the planet's energy &amp;ndash; that would be the end of all life.

Supported and guided by their nation, they must enter the Cube where the Aliens' Queen (a mysterious woman by the name of Lady Godiva) is and stop her! But the task seems overwhelming&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is going to win the fight for Sylia?&lt;br/&gt;Will the land thrive or will the Aliens gain its energy and destroy every life form in the process?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A huge and stand-alone adventure&lt;br/&gt;     Bright, colorful and original graphics&lt;br/&gt;     30+ characters&lt;br/&gt;     20+ sidequests&lt;br/&gt;     100+ skills&lt;br/&gt;     Plenty of items including 16 relics and artifacts&lt;br/&gt;     Questbook&lt;br/&gt;     Change Party System&lt;br/&gt;     Options Menu&lt;br/&gt;     Configurable Battle Speed&lt;br/&gt;     Adjustable Difficulty&lt;br/&gt;     Visible Monsters&lt;br/&gt;     Multiple Endings&lt;br/&gt;     Fly a Balloon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
