							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Queen Mary Steaming Round Great Britain</name>
									
			<description>Players select plastic ships and begin their travel route around Great Britain by placing them on the board at London No. 1. After arranging starting-order, each player rolls the dice and advances their ship along the route corresponding to the number revealed by the throw. When the throw of the dice brings a player's ship exactly onto an obstacle or meets with other trouble, the player must do as directed. The first player to reach Chatham wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
