			<description>Operation Kadesh: The 1956 Suez Crisis, depicts the 1956 conflict between Israel and Egypt, with the possibility of additional Arab countries entering the conflict. The level of world tension escalated dramatically when France and Britain used the conflict as a pretext to seize the Suez Canal, recently nationalized by the new Egyptian President, Gamal Abdul Nasser. Players first conduct a series of card plays that determine both sides war footing and diplomatic standing before the outbreak of hostilities. Battles in the 1956 Mid-East War that eventually breaks out are resolved on 1 or 2 maps representing the major battlefields of the war (the Sinai and the Jordanian West Bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, the Israelis won a crushing military victory, capturing the entire Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. The French and British were able to take control of Port Said and other installations along the Northern end of the Suez Canal only after intense fighting, but not before Egypt sunk dozens of blocking ships were sunk along the waterway. The Israeli victory and tenuous Allied control of the Suez Canal, however, were short-lived as both the US and USSR united in their opposition to the war and compelled the invading forces to withdraw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 High Flying Dice Games edition features all new graphics by Bruce Yearian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: variable - 1 day or 1 week&lt;br/&gt;Hex: West Bank 5 miles/8 kilometers - Sinai 10 miles/16 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Regiment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 8.5x11&amp;quot; full color map &lt;br/&gt;Two 11x14&amp;quot; full color maps&lt;br/&gt;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (140 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&lt;br/&gt;One 16-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Six pages of Event playing cards (48 cards, 6 are blank)&lt;br/&gt;Four Player Aid Charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player Provided: One D6, One D10, One Opaque container&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
