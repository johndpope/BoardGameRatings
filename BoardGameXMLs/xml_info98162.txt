							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hexic 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sequel to the original Hexic is very similar. Both games involve rotating groups of three colored hex pieces in order to to make new groups of three identically colored hexes. That will remove that group of three hexes from the board. More pieces can be removed by using star hexes. The player must beware of bombs when they arrive on-screen. A Starflower piece is formed when you create a ring of six hexes. A black pearl is created by making a ring of six Starflowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexic 2 adds some new pieces: Emeralds are formed by making a line of five identically colored hexes, Rubies are formed by making a line of five Starflowers. The major new addition is Battle Mode. Here the board is divided in half and as each player clears clusters they fill a well on their respective side. When a player's well is full they can unleash a powerful attack that interferes with their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
