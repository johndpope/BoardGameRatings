							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Icar (Version 4 Beta)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting of Icar is a space opera science fiction, set in the far future where a benevolent, autocratic Imperium protects the human race from a rarely-seen race of killer robots called the Droids. With the Droid advance curbed, human occupied space is a trove of opportunity for the Characters to explore. There are no intelligent alien species, travel between the stars is commonplace, friendly robots called Automatons live somewhere between slaves and family members; and a virtual reality internet called Gaia is the backbone of civilisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a single session, Characters will be exploring long deserted colonies, abandoned spacecraft, starting bar fights, hacking into corporate files, escaping colonies invaded by Droids and zipping between the stars. As the Characters grow they will choose bionics or powered armour, wield more powerful weapons and even own their own spacecraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of Icar are intended to be cinematic, based on using ten-sided dice (D10), two ten-sided dice can be rolled to produce a percentile (a number out of 100 or D100), or a single hundred-sided die (D100) can be used. Common sense should reign over rulings, keep things fast and if a player comes up with an idea that improves fun at the table, go with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a description of the core mechanics, a section describing the broader Galaxy according to Icar, an example campaign setting called Scavengers, Equipment and Technology, Gamesmaster section, and a series of resources, such as Character sheets and quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note: Since 2012 Elements has been merged with the other books to form a complete ruleset in one book. The tag &amp;quot;Elements&amp;quot; has been dropped and it is simply called Icar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
