							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carnivores Cityscape</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The plot expands upon the original storyline told throughout the main Carnivores series, this time pitting humans and dinosaurs in a battle for survival. The story follows the exploits of DinoCorp and their intent on providing its customers with the most unique hunting experience. The company stumbled on a planet filled with dinosaurs remarkably similar to those used to be found on earth, thus allowing the wealthy to travel to the planet to hunt such extraordinary beasts. After a series of unfortunate events the hunters' interest started to diminish and profits quickly plummeted. DinoCorp was forced to rethink their strategy, therefore creating a project with the idea of bringing these amazing creatures to the attention of a broader audience. A large scientific vessel was then commissioned to transport a sizeable array of dinosaur species, the ship's purpose was to visit all earth colonies, exhibiting the creatures to the public creating more revenue in return. Everything ran smoothly until the transport ship, named DinoCorp VII, crashed on the outskirts of a distant earth colony. With the dinosaurs now running rampant, DinoCorp was forced to hire agents in order to eliminate the threat and save the city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivores_Cityscape Carnivores Cityscape]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
