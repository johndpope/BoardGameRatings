							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sudoku: Tactics</name>
									
			<description>In Sudoku: Tactics, players take turns drawing 1-5 number tiles and place them in any order to complete rows, columns and 3x3 sub-grids following the rules of Sudoku. Each completion scores one point, and the tiles in the completed areas are removed and returned to the tile pile.  If a player is unable to legally place a number, a &amp;quot;Sudoku Jam&amp;quot; occurs; all tiles with that number are returned to the pile and the previous player scores a point.  Since the board is never entirely filled up, the game is played to an arbitrary number of points or time limit agreed to in advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to other Blue Panther products, the box, nine-piece board, scoreboard and 81 tiles are all laser-etched wood.  The board pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The game also comes with a printed paper instruction sheet and five pairs of plastic cubes to mark player scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
