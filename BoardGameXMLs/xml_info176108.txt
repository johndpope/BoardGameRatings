			<description>Masters of Football is a unique board game in which you are a club manager who needs to deal with all aspects of &amp;ldquo;the beautiful game&amp;rdquo;, inside and outside the pitch. Your objective is to win the championship !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to manage your budget and build your team from scratch, as well as fight for the 3 points in each match by taking control of the team for attack and defence, picking the best tactics and using every trick in the book to win the championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple different managers, unique players and versatile action cards (strategy, evolution, anti-football and the dreaded corruption cards) make every game different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masters of Football uses a match mechanism based on a custom dice algorithm that keeps the results realistic according to the teams strengths with just the right amount of unpredictability, also designed to allow a fast pace during matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
