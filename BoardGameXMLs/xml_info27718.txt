							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swim Quest</name>
									
			<description>Swim Quest was conceived as a board game that could be incorporated into swimming practices. It is designed to be constructed from waterproof materials, including a dry-erase board for keeping score. A spinner governs how many spaces the players move their pieces around a conventional track. The pieces are in thematic shapes: diver, freestyle, stopwatch, and pair of fins. Spaces on the board contain instructions for swimming activities, to be performed by the player who lands on the space (e.g., &amp;quot;4 laps, freestyle&amp;quot;). Some spaces have other instructions, such as &amp;quot;Go back 1 space&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Do 20 crunches.&amp;quot; Swim Quest has been awarded US Patent number 7125016B1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
