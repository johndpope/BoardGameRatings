			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1985. Punk is alive, but it's mutated, and there's been enough time for goths to reinvent themselves at least once. Ronald Reagan's second term of office brings us crack cocaine and Nintendo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And at any minute, nuclear fire could rain down on everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the cracks of this world, there are monsters. Vampires and werewolves and angels. Faeries and ogres, elementals and more. Dear me...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of these creatures, a Pretender. You pose as human. Maybe you were a human, once... and maybe you weren't. Maybe you're something unique, like a vampire that never died, half living and half undead. Perhaps you're something more &amp;quot;common&amp;quot;, like a demon trying to ensnare human souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been published in four (minor) variations--a first draft, from early 2003, a completed HTML version from late 2003, the same completed version in PDF, and a version published in The No Press RPG Anthology (2004).  The versions are quite similar in content but vary in formatting and art.  The free 2003 HTML and PDF versions were withdrawn upon publication of the anthologized version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
