			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Winnie the Pooh Peek-a-boo is an entertaining memory game for very young children. Children from the age of three can play along. Peek through the holes and try to remember which of the covers hide goodies belonging to Pooh's friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect the most cards and win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme: Winnie the Pooh theme with pretty much all of the main characters involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play: The game starts with 30 tiles all open (!). Then the 6 covers, which all have 1-3 peek holes in them, are place over 6 of the tiles, and the person placing them names the tiles. Then the next player starts, throwing a die with 6 colors, and guessing what lies under the tile with the cover of that color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: To get as many guesses right as possible. Each correct guess gets you that tile. The player with most tiles at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
