							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Martial Action II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Your Fighting Style?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that there are really two ways to go about playing Pathfinder and similar d20 games: you can be a spellcaster, and have all kinds of crazy options to choose from, or you can be a more mundane, martial character, and, well&amp;hellip;not. Sure, barbarians get rage powers and paladins can smite evil, and if you devote a bunch of feats to it you might get a couple of nifty tricks like two-weapon fighting or spring attacking, but at the end of the day most mundane characters spend their combat rounds doing full attack after full attack, and eventually that gets a little stale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancerâ€™s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action provided a potential solution to this state of affairs by providing such characters with numerous options for fun, dynamic, and exciting things to do in combat in the form of martial techniques, which allow such characters to make meaningful decisions and unleash fun and exciting (but still decidedly mundane) special attacks, maneuvers, and abilities in combat. The martial action point system gives players a great level of control over how they use their martial techniques, and with over 50 feats granting access to different martial action techniques, there were plenty to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all good things, however, people wanted more of martial action, and that&amp;rsquo;s where A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action II comes in. This book has everything you need to use the martial action system, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the original, and once again provides over 50 new martial techniques, plus no less than 5 full character classes, each of which is associated with a specific style of martial action. Crush any opponent one-one-one with the Iron Ram style, or confuse and disorient him with the Graceful Swallow style. You can outmaneuver foes with Flowing River techniques, or if that&amp;rsquo;s not your style, turn to the Infinite Shadow style to exploit your foe&amp;rsquo;s weaknesses, or the well-rounded and inward-focused Golden Soul style. Whatever your fighting style, A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action II is designed to be able to easily provide value to existing characters of any level, while at the same time rewarding those who devote themselves to martial action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
