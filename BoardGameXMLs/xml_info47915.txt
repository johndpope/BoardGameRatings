							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faces of Evil: The Fiends</name>
									
			<description>I've seen it happen too many times. A berk finds out how much damage it takes to kill a fiend and figures that's all he needs. Then he heads off to the Lower Planes - and is never heard from again. When will these leatherheads learn? The fiends aren't just lists of numbers. They're creatures that think, eat, dream, breed, struggle, and evolve - in short, creatures that live. They're part of a larger society of political treachery and desperate survival, a culture of disturbing aesthetics and violent beliefs. And only a blood who studies it all has a hope of ducking the fiends, defeating them - or just understanding them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 96-page PLANESCAPE accessory, written for players and Dungeon Masters of all levels, is the ultimate guide to the fiends of the Lower Planes - the malevolent monsters that wage the Blood War, terrorize mortals, and befoul the multiverse. But whereas other guides focus on statistics and combat, Faces of Evil delves into the physiology of the fiends, exploring the dark forces that shape every detail of their lives. How are they born? What do they eat? How do they deal with others? And just what makes them so - well fiendish?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faces of Evil is a must for any AD&amp;amp;D campaign that features these vile creatures of death and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
