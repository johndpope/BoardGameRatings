			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of modern Exodus fear and distrust psionic powers and those with it.  The psion&amp;rsquo;s ability to read or even control minds without even the scant visible trappings of wizardry - the wilder&amp;rsquo;s unpredictable and spontaneous destructive powers - these mind-spawned mysteries are the stuff of nightmares for common folk from the Wyldlands of Bal to the deserts of Cordel.  Even the widely respected, psionics-using Janissaries of the Imperial Alliance have not been able to dispel such superstitious fears - perhaps because the superstitions are all too often justified. Eventually, the Imperial Alliance with the help of Imperial Senate created an organization to address those fears - and to bring to heel those mentalists who misused their gifts. Thus was born Section Omega - the Imperial Alliance&amp;rsquo;s regulatory and investigatory body for psionic affairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History of Section Omega, Section Omega today and Section Omega Headquarters&lt;br/&gt;     Section Omega Membership and Methods&lt;br/&gt;     Section Omega Against Monsters, in the Outer World and in the Shadows&lt;br/&gt;     New Prestige Class: Id Hunter and Psychic Overseer&lt;br/&gt;     Magic and Psionic Items including Id Weapons, Psychic Halo and Psychic Restrains&lt;br/&gt;     Over 25 Feats including Crystal Psiweapon, Enhanced Psi-Like Abilities, Layered Psionic Defense, Psionic Deflection, Psionic Rejuvenation and Vampire Mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
