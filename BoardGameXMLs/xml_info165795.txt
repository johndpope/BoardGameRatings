			<description>Memory game.  Cards are placed on the board face-down. These are 'Guests' at the party. A die is used for movement. You may go backwards or forwards. If a player lands on a guest card, they can guess its name. If correct, they take a chip in the appropriate colour. Whether guessed correctly or not, the card is revealed to all the players and players must remember which guest is where. Things get more difficult if the ghost Kasimir is revealed. He is a pest and all the guest cards are taken up, shuffled and then put on the board again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to get five different colour chips, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
