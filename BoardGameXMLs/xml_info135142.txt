			<description>The board represents the &amp;quot;Mare Nostra&amp;quot; with its coasts, and grid for navigation of vessels.&lt;br/&gt;You choose to start a journey of racing, with its ports of departure and arrival. At each turn you move a weathervane with your breath (you are Eole!), This will determine your ability to progress and depending on the wind direction, your trip can be upgraded or penalized.&lt;br/&gt;During the game, each player has the option, but one single time, to change the direction of the wind with the help of special cards.&lt;br/&gt;The first arriving safely wins the race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
