							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Non-Combat Magical Items Deck</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is based on ongoing series of Non-Combat Magical Items from the Master Of Dungeons blog. Players love to receive magic items, and it's a great way to reward players for beating a dungeon, defeating a foe, or saving a village. However, too many magical +2 Lance of Goblin Explosion's can leave a party overpowered. This is especially true now in the world of Fifth Edition &amp;quot;Bounded Accuracy&amp;quot;. There are 32 cards in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some DMs have introduced something called &amp;quot;Mundane Magical Items&amp;quot; to their tables. These items aren't as strong as some of the glimmering, vibrating swords of the past, but they are still usually aimed towards a strong combat utility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've decided to take things a different direction at my table. In a magical world filled with dragons, genies, and portals to another dimension, I believe that there would be items that don't feel most at home on the battlefield. These items need not be only trivial magical implements like self-writing quills, or mirrors to help a dwarf with his self-esteem, they can rival the power of their magical sword and bow brethren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added disclaimer, I don't refer to these items as &amp;quot;Non-Combat Magical Items&amp;quot; in front of my players. The title isn't so much a rule as it is a design philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards can be given to your players when they find an item, and can also be shuffled to add randomness to your loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just because these aren't weapons or armour doesn't mean they aren't powerful, there are exceptionally strong items in here, like a sacrificial dagger that allows a user to absorb the powers of a dead god, or an amulet that prevents aging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
