			<description>A game for very young children. Each kid moves its meeple through a garden, trying to get rid of vegetable cards. When a card is drawn, the player moves 1 to 3 squares, depending on the number of vegetables on the card. Moves can be blocked by other players or the edge of the board, in which case no card can be used. Whoever can get rid of all cards first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
