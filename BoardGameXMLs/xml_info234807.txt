							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Our Lost Way</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Our Lost Way, the characters are settlers in America&amp;rsquo;s expanding western frontier between 1815 and 1850. Living off the land, the characters explore an untamed frontier. But this is not easy. The empty plains are unforgiving and the characters must carve out a living in the unforgiving landscape. Each day brings new problems and challenges to solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a unique way to play Praxis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game begins, the characters have just finished building a meager homestead in a new community, out West. From there, the game explores the trials and tribulations of the homesteaders. But each character has her own goals and expectations, which could cause the entire &amp;lsquo;experiment&amp;rsquo; to fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Praxis is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters into dramatic situations and is based on the principles of the Protocol game system. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start-points, roles, plot twists, and finales. Praxis does not play like a traditional roleplaying game. It does not require a gamemaster. There is no script. No endpoint. No cumbersome or extraneous mechanics detracting from the story. An entire epic can be played in under four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
