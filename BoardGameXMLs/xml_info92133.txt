			<description>The object of the game is to correctly answer questions in specific categories. Firstly set a time limit for the game or decide to play for a certain number of cards. The first player spins the spinner to determine which category of question they should answer on that turn. The Random Choice space on the spinner means the player can choose a category. The player to their left then takes a card from the question pile and asks the question, if guessed correctly the player marks it down on their score pad and gets another question. Once they answer wrongly play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
