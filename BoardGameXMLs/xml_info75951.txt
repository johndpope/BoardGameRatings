			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2: Gas Pump Girls Meet the Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X! (also known as Leather Goddesses 2 or LGOP2) is a graphic adventure game written by Steve Meretzky and published by Activision in 1992 under the Infocom label. LGOP2 is the sequel to the 1986 interactive fiction game Leather Goddesses of Phobos, also written by Meretzky. LGOP2 featured full-screen graphics and a point-and-click interface instead of Infocom's text parser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the original Leather Goddesses of Phobos, the titular Goddesses suffered a humiliating defeat in 1936 at the hands of an Earthling from Ohio. Now it's 1958, and astronomers have recently discovered &amp;quot;Planet X&amp;quot;, the tenth planet in our solar system. The desert town of Atom City, Nevada doesn't contain much besides a military base, nuclear power plant and gas station. But one night the sleepy town witnesses a spaceship that crash-lands with a single survivor: Barth, the &amp;quot;Pulsating Inconvenience&amp;quot; from the world known as Planet X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Leather Goddesses have invaded Planet X and forced its inhabitants to become sex slaves. Barth has fled to Earth in a desperate effort to find humans who can help free his planet. The player can play as any of three characters: Barth (the alien), Zeke (the gas station owner), or Lydia (daughter of the astronomer who &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; Planet X).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
