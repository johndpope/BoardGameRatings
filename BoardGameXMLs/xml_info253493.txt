			<description>This window pattern card is a fan made expansion for the Sagrada boardgame, featuring level 5 and 6 patterns.&lt;br/&gt;We are listening to you asking why this card has the name &amp;quot;RiaCon&amp;quot;... Allright, allright, you win. We will tell you the story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Portugal - similar to other countries - we have annual conventions to play boardgames with people from everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;We belong to the boardgamers group of Aveiro, a city that is known as Portugal's Venice :)&lt;br/&gt;This city is well known for it's river named &amp;quot;Ria de Aveiro&amp;quot;, an arm from the sea that passes through the city.&lt;br/&gt;That's the reason why this convention is named RiaCon and the card received the name by inheritance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As volunteers in RiaCon we had the crazy ideia of designing one card to Sagrada to mark the difference in this event.&lt;br/&gt;In this way, we could encourage the participants that didn't knew Sagrada to try it out and the ones that already knew the game to play it once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we are sharing it with you and we hope that you enjoy playing with this expansion as much as we do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
