			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEMBERS: Threat Report #09: Motherboard (leader), Threat Report #11: Digital Demon, Threat Report #14: Heavy Metal, Threat Report #10: Pulse, Threat Report #12: Rez, and Threat Report #13: Sister Steel.&lt;br/&gt;BASE OF OPERATIONS: Emerald City&lt;br/&gt;MOTIVATION: Self Preservation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cybertribe (or simply &amp;ldquo;the Tribe&amp;rdquo; as they often refer to themselves) began as a rescue effort. While researching a variety of neurological problems in an attempt to save her own life, Motherboard came across several young people who were essentially prisoners in their own bodies. The plight of these individuals resonated with her and she liberated them from the facilities in which they were housed, then gave them the means to interact with the world around them. Digital Demon, Pulse, and Rez, similar to Motherboard, have bodies kept safely in medical pods while highly advanced technology lets them roam free outside of those bodies. Both Sister Steel and Heavy Metal were rescued by Motherboard before she discovered the Hard Light Interactive Construct (HLIC) technology the others use and have decided to retain their cybernetic and robotic shells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the relatively short time the Tribe has been active, they&amp;rsquo;ve built a reputation among the tech-criminal community as thieves of the first order, able to get into practically anywhere and steal what they want. They&amp;rsquo;ve also managed to make allies among other &amp;ldquo;victims&amp;rdquo; of corporate and government callousness, and helped fund some social initiatives from behind layers of shell companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tribe&amp;rsquo;s problems are about to escalate. Motherboard stole the technological know-how she used to help Pulse, Digital Demon, and Rez from a secret government program. The schematics and other files belonged to a rogue black-ops outfit, an outfit with a strong anti-extraterrestrial stance and the technology to pose a threat. They have figured out the connection between the Tribe&amp;rsquo;s technology and their own computer breaches and intend to terminate the problem with extreme prejudice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
