			<description>&amp;quot;Find yourself in this game of guesswork!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains 80 cards, each with the name and brief description of a location, real or fictional.&lt;br/&gt;One player looks at a card, and the player whose turn it is must ask yes or no questions to work out where they are, for example &amp;quot;Am I in a famous building?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may guess where they are as many times as they like, but have a 2 minute time limit. If they successfully guess within that time, they keep the card. If not, it is discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most cards at the end of the agreed number of rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
