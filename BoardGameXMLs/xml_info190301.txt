			<description>Chemical Spill is a chemistry based drafting card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemicals are spilled and each player gets 10 cards each. They are allowed to 'cleanup' one card before the rest are washed to the next player for the next round. Each round players select one card from the cards passed to them and continue to pass until all cards are chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use the elements they have chosen to create molecules. Different molecules score different amounts of points (as seen on the scoring cards). Any elements that have not been made into molecules cost you points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round users tally the molecules in their hand.  After three rounds the person with most points wins!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
