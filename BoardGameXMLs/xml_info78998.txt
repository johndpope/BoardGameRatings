							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monuments of Mars</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Monuments of Mars is a third-person puzzle platform  video game developed by Scenario Software and published by Apogee Software. The game consists of four 20-level episodes, the first episode being shareware, the rest being commercial software. It is based on the FAST (Fluid Animation Software Technology) CGA game engine from Arctic Adventure and Pharaoh's Tomb, developed by Todd Replogle, and later published by Apogee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player controls an astronaut who must navigate through twenty levels on the planet Mars to finish the game. Most levels require the player to enter a door to advance to the next level, but earlier levels have the player simply move to the opposite side of the screen. The player has the capability to jump and shoot with a gun. This is useful to operate switches which open doors or turn off obstacles. A unique point to this game is that the player has no limit of lives. A player may restart a level as many times as necessary. If a player can collect the letters in the word &amp;quot;MARS&amp;quot; scattered throughout the level in order, a large bonus is added to the player's score.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Monuments of Mars , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
