			<description>The game consists of 30 theme cards for the Tomot Original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives seven cards of the original game and a theme card is drawn face-up on the table.&lt;br/&gt;There are several themes like: Geography, Sports, Games etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player must give a word beginning with a letter from his card and related to the face-up theme-card. An answer can be given only once throughout that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when one player has given answer for each card from his hand. Then he scores a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player must take an additional card, if He does not have words or he is too slow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After several rounds the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
