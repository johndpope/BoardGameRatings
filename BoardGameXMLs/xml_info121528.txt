			<description>One Night Only is a game for 3 to 5 players who each take the role of a Band in their humble beginnings and guide them to the heights of Fame. Players choose actions to increase of Band's confidence so they will be able to play larger and larger gigs - thus gathering more and more Fame (and Money). Next they will bid Cash to hire a Bookie who will use his prestige to get the Bands gigs. Players can even play gigs together as Headliner and Opener. At the end of the game, whoever has the highest Fame, is the Winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
