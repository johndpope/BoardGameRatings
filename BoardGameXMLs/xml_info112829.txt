			<description>Super RBI Baseball is a North America-exclusive video game that was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is official licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association; offering 700 actual baseball players from the 1994 Major League Baseball season in addition to 28 teams. There are six modes to play: exhibition, Home Run Derby, defense practice, playoffs, league (in which teams play every other team in succession just like in NBA Jam), and Game Breaker (which allows players to change the course of Major League Baseball history).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The authentic-looking stadiums are contrasted with the cartoon-like graphics. However, the stadiums are altered from their MLB counterparts due to copyright issues. Jack Buck provides a play-by-play analysis of the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super RBI Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
