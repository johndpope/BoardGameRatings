			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms of Adventure: Fantasy (LARP), the official rule book, is provided online as a FLASH presentation that allows viewers to hyperlink to specific topics or to thumb through page-by-page.  The book also can be downloaded as a traditional PDF.  Finally, the book text (without illustrations) is almost entirely reproduced in online HTML pages, organized by topic.  The book has very high production values, excellent layout, and is richly illustrated with color photographs of past events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules cover character creation (background, race, class, skills), magic (arcane, bardic, divine, runic, shamanic), special skills (alchemy, poison craft, stealth, locks, traps), and combat.  The game uses &amp;quot;boffer&amp;quot; style combat with armor, shields, and weapons.  The rule book includes good instruction on how to manufacture safer boffer weapons, including arrows, and also on spell packets.  A special section is devoted to orientation for new players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
