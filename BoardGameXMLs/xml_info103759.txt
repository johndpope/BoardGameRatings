							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Election Night</name>
									
			<description>The titanic struggle between Red &amp;amp; Blue in 21st century American politics is recreated in all its glory in Election Night, a board game that allows players to feel the roar of the crowds, experience the steely-nerved debate appearence, and enjoy the satisfaction of a political campaign well fought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game, players decide what their stand will be on the issues: either leaning to the left, rolling to the right, or sticking to the center on each of five issues: the Economy, Social Issues, the Military, Taxes and the Environment. These positions influence where they can hope to win votes. The more right-wing they are, for example, the easier it will be to rally voters in the South and Frontier states; if they choose a centrist platform, the more likely that Swing State voters are to join the cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players choose whether to campaign, claiming votes ahead of the election; strategize, directing the flow of the contest in their favor; or advertise, swaying voters with a carefully crafted message. And no two games will likely be the same, as cards-in-hand suggest paths to follow and the constantly changing News Cycle shines a fickle light on one of fifteen possible issue positions, meaning that timing and clever play are everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game simulates the modern American presidential campaign, with a home-stretch, flip-flops (and resulting attack ads), gaffes during debates, red-meat speeches, polling, &amp;quot;fire-in-the-belly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;robo calls&amp;quot; and much more.  All cards appear in both the Democratic and Republican player's deck, the two sides are evenly balanced, and the electoral map is tuned to the latest census numbers that will be in place for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
