			<description>The game board is a house that is puzzled together. All things have to be sorted in the right room. In three games, the game expanded vocabulary and teach children to play together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board consists of a colorful puzzle with a turntable in the middle. In total there are 6 rooms and each room has a different color. The game includes small slices with objects. On these disks are pictures of objects. These objects belong each to one specific room of the house. This can be checked at the back of the disk: Ex. the kitchen is shown as red and all disks that belong in the kitchen have a red back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the vocabulary around the house is practiced in different games. One game it is cooperative: The players then play against the slob. Does the turntable in the attic? Then you can slob a place ahead. Does the arrow shows to another room? Then all the players together look at an object out of this room. When they indicate a correct disc, they can put it away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are all discs put away before the slob is on the last box? Then you all won the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
