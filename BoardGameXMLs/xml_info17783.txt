							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flitzpuck</name>
									
			<description>A wooden dexterity game that is a German variation on Sjoelen.  Each player has six wooden pucks in their color.  The object of the game is to use the elastic band on your side of the game to fire pucks through the hole and onto your opponent's side of the game.  The first player to clear their side of the board of pucks wins, or alternatively, the first player to get their six pucks over to the other side wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is very similar to Le Passe-Trappe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
