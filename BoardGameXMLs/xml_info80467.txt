							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alternate Reality: The Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternate Reality: The Dungeon, by Philip Price, is the sequel to the RPG AR: The City. Originally designed as a single game, the publisher Datasoft split it into a sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon featured improved graphics and gameplay over the original, and featured an extensive 4-level dungeon to explore. The game was from a first-person 3-d dungeon perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alternate Reality series was originally conceived to have many further sequels which delved further into the storyline, but these were never fully developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
