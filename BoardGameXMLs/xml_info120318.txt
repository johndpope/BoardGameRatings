			<description>Play as a pirate, Captain of your own ship! Your goal is to obtain the most gold: the pirating way! In game you will: obtain precious treasures, hold prisoners captive, blast your opponents with cannons, and board enemy ships to steal their booty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C&amp;amp;C uses a unique cannon combat mechanic where players must find or trade for gunpowder and ammunition in order to fire their cannons.  Players can use cannonballs to sink enemy ships, chain-shot to make players lose turns (to repair their masts!), or grapeshot to clear the opponent's deck of crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crew are used for boarding enemy ships to steal their cargo.  Crew can be equipped with pistols, muskets, rapiers, or cutlasses in order to increase their chance of success.  If victorious, crew are able to steal cards from the opposing player, whether that be supplies or gold.   Treasure cards will trade hands multiple times before the next Port! card is found where the players can take a breather before the next round of raids and cannon bombardments begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a dice and card game that relies heavily on luck.  In this sense, its best suited for casual gamers who are looking for a medium length game (30-60 minutes) that has excitement in every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes rules, two D6 dice, and 136 poker-size cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
