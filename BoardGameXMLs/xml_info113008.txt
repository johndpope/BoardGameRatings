			<description>Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make Trax is a maze game similar to Sega's Head On and Namco's Pac-Man, in which the player controls a paintbrush and must paint the entire layout in order to advance to the next stage. Two fish &amp;mdash; one yellow, the other light blue &amp;mdash; emerge from separate aquariums to pursue the paintbrush around the board, and if either of the fish succeeds in making contact with the paintbrush, the player loses one of three lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player may use two &amp;quot;rollers&amp;quot; to attack the fish. The rollers are located on two overpasses, one vertical in its orientation, the other horizontal. To utilize a roller, the player positions the paintbrush on the forward end of the roller, waits for either or both of the fish to approach, then pushes the paintbrush along the roller, attacking the fish. The fish is removed from the maze for a few seconds, then returns to one of the aquariums and resumes its pursuit of the paintbrush. Killing fish in this manner scores bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third character, appearing to be an animal or human figure depending on the level, may enter the maze and leave tracks that must be painted over in order for the board to be completed. The player can limit the damage by running over the figure, which not only stops further tracks from being left but also awards the player a score, which progressively increases as more boards are cleared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Make Trax&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
