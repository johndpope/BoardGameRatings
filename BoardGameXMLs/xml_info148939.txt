							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Night in Deepwail Manor</name>
									
			<description>A Night in Deepwail Manor is a short and simple push-your-luck game for 1 or 2 players playable in 5-15 minutes that uses only a small deck of 29 custom cards as well as 4 double-sided character cards. The player (or players) will control two children who explore the creepy Deepwail Manor on a dare and face eerie locations and dangerous encounters as they venture deeper into the mansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, a new card is revealed and played from the deck. Encounter cards take effect immediately, but the effect on Location cards only takes place if there's a location with the same name in the discard pile. Each location is worth a number of Exploration Points, and the goal of the game is to make it out of the manor with the maximum number of Exploration points. But be careful! As soon as both characters are terrified, the game is over and the player or players will lose all their points! With cards that test your decision making and four characters with different abilities, A Night in Deepwail Manor is the perfect game to play on a train ride, during a lunch break or around a campfire... if you dare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
