							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Underworld Oracle (Volume 2, Issue 1 - 1979)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that Underworld Oracle changed both its format (A5 to A4) and numbering sequence (simple numbering to Volume, Issue) with this issue.  Articles and artwork are uncredited, but cover art is by Phil Alexander as usual, and content is likely all by Lou Nisbet.  This was the final issue of Underworld Oracle and was the only one to feature four colour printing on the front and back.  It is probably the rarest issue (the first six issues went through multiple printings).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Page 2...Editorial, Opinions, News&lt;br/&gt;Page 3...A Warrior's Dream (short story)&lt;br/&gt;Page 4...Halls of Testing - Tumblers (map)&lt;br/&gt;Page 5...Halls of Testing - Tumblers (dungeon description)&lt;br/&gt;Page 6...Fantasy Chess&lt;br/&gt;Page 7...Swords and Sorcery (SPI game review), Trolls (cartoon)&lt;br/&gt;Page 8...C&amp;amp;S Sourcebook (Chivalry and Sorcery supplement review)&lt;br/&gt;Page 9...Storm Lords (new D&amp;amp;D class)&lt;br/&gt;Page 13..Advertisement for Advance Guard miniatures&lt;br/&gt;Page 14..The Oracle (new D&amp;amp;D monsters)&lt;br/&gt;Page 15..The Fantasy Nation - Its History (campaign description)&lt;br/&gt;Page 16..Tables for The Fantasy Nation&lt;br/&gt;Page 18..Advertisements (Science Fiction bookshop, Oracle minis)&lt;br/&gt;Page 19..Contact (Letters to the editor), subscription details&lt;br/&gt;Page 20..As told by the sage - Lyamel (short story)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
