			<description>(from DriveThruCards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you sure that you can trust your friends and family?  Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time to put them to the test.  That&amp;rsquo;s Beez Wax challenges a person&amp;rsquo;s integrity as well as their ability to cover up a lie.  Player&amp;rsquo;s take turns laying cards face down in sequential order in an effort to empty their hand.  Those caught lying will get buried by &amp;ldquo;The Hive.&amp;rdquo;  Those falsely accused will experience sweet redemption.  The player who avoids the &amp;ldquo;Stinger&amp;rdquo; and tastes the sweet nectar of victory will be forever known as King or Queen Bee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has won a round, all other players must add up the point values of the cards remaining in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the lowest score after 5 rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
