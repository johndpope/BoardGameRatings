							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shell Beach</name>
									
			<description>Shell Beach is a treasure trove to the Hermit Crabs that live there, and the bravest crabs scramble between waves to collect the most desirable seashells to bring to the Market.  Some shells are even big enough to make a home out of!  Each player is a daring hermit crab scrapping seashells for sale, trying to upgrade their own shell, keeping one eye on the competition, and even taking each other&amp;rsquo;s old shells.  Make the most of each tide, before the Market closes for the season!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shell Beach is played over a series of Rounds, which have a Collection Phase, where cards are dealt and drafted, and a Market Phase, where sets are sold and special shells can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sets of shell cards can be turned into the Market for tokens, but the biggest ones can be lived in by the Crabs, which will allow them to carry more and better sets back to market.  There are also 4 Magic Seashells that hypnotize a crab into abandoning their home shell, initiating a unique new game mechanic based on real-life crab behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the market runs out of tokens, each player remaining finishes the current round and the winner is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
