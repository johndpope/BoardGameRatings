							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rrrunter vom Bock!</name>
									
			<description>The goal of Rrrunter vom Bock! is to occupy the center space (bock) with a meeple. The meeples move according to the roll of a die. Whenever a player gets a meeple on the bock, he gets a coin from the cash box and the meeple which previously occupied the bock, is eliminated from the game. Meeples which pass space 17 are also eliminated. Each player has 4 meeples. The player of the last meeple to occupy the bock, gets the rest of the coins in the cash box and wins the game. Meeples which get thrown out by other meeples can be brought back into the game again, if they are not thrown out by other meeples of the same color. If a meeple has passed the bock it can be brought back to the starting Point, if it gets on Space 13 or 17 (or is thrown out by an opposing meeple). The game was published in the 1930s and 40s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
