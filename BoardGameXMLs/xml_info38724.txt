			<description>The Rigelian Wars 2146-3705 represents the series of wars fought between the expanding Rigelian Empire and the collapsing Altair-Mizar Dynasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a series of &amp;quot;mini-games&amp;quot; which are referred to as &amp;quot;wars&amp;quot;. Each of these consists of an indefinite number of turns. Separating the wars are special &amp;quot;peace periods&amp;quot; during which construction of new ships and redistribution of forces takes place. The turns within the wars consist of movement and combat phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rigelian Wars is an amateur early DTP (mimeograph) that contains a 4 piece (8.5 x 11) map, two strips of unmounted counters, and 6 pages of rules. Three scenarios, low-complexity, fairly standard wargame mechanics, production, warp (and hyper-warp) movement, ground units, and a Cobalt Bomb that destroys everything in the target hex!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
