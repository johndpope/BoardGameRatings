			<description>This is an old game in which players use letter tiles to spell the phrase &amp;quot;BUTTON, BUTTON, WHO HAS THE BUTTON?&amp;quot; The tiles contain all the letters in this phrase (including extras), the punctuation marks (commas and question mark), blank tiles (which are useless), and a tile with a picture of a button on it. The tiles are shuffled and dealt evenly to all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you play as many tiles as you can to spell out the phrase line-by-line. If you don't have a play, you may draw a tile from the player on your left, and should this tile be the desired letter, you may place it and continue playing from your hand. Points are scored as a line is completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word &amp;quot;BUTTON,&amp;quot; together with the comma makes up the first (and second) line, and scores 10 points for the player playing the comma. The words &amp;quot;WHO&amp;quot; &amp;quot;HAS&amp;quot; &amp;quot;THE&amp;quot; make up the third, forth and fifth line, and score 5 points for the player playing the the last letter in each word respectively. The word &amp;quot;BUTTON?&amp;quot; makes up the sixth line and scores 10 points to the player playing the question mark. The tile with the picture of a button makes up the seventh line and is worth 20 points. The first player to score 100 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
