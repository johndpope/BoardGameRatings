							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Qube</name>
									
			<description>Space Qube is a voxel based retro style shooting game which also allows the players to create everything they can image in the game using voxel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can enjoy the game while explore their creativity and share their creations with friends and community. The game is simple but fun, the players control the space ship, flying toilet(?) or anything that players created to shoot as many aliens as possible to get highest score. Of course there are some power-ups for the players to increase the weapon power, speed, etc. There are also variety bosses waiting ahead, destroy them to get higher score and rewards. There is no annoying virtual pad on the screen, the players just tilt the iPhone/iPad to control the space ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop contains a voxel model editor and browser. With browser, the players can browse through the voxel models they have created or the voxel models uploaded by other players. The players can also download, rate other player's voxel models, modify them then use them to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
