			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware the viscous villainy of&amp;hellip; Pitch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Rogue, Pitch is a tricky criminal to fight in close quarters, and he knows it.. Pitch is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitch&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;quot; to indicate that his powers seem to be a natural ability triggered by extreme circumstances. He is massive, strong, and his body is coated in a tarry substance that both protects him from harm and clings to anything it touches. He has learned to take advantage of this goop in his criminal exploits, making him an &amp;ldquo;untouchable&amp;rdquo; powerhouse on the streets. His interests in street racing and get-rich-quick schemes may put him at odds with heroes who protect the streets from dangerous threats in their city, while his poor choices and refusal to reform might bring him back into their neighborhood time and time again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
