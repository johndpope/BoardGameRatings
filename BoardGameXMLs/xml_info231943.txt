							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy: Mirrors in the Ruins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You call this a wasteland? Perhaps in your eyes. But what you see as ruins is the only home we&amp;rsquo;ve ever known. We can teach you how to survive here: how to let it change you as it changed us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirrors in the Ruins reverses Legacy&amp;rsquo;s normal perspective, giving players and GMs the chance to see the wasteland from the local&amp;rsquo;s point of view. They may seem monstrous or bizarre, but this is their world now. Will humanity welcome their new kin, or push the world into another cataclysm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirrors in the Ruins includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Four new Family playbooks and four new Character playbooks: synthetic machines, aquatic reavers, alien technologists, and savage uplifts.&lt;br/&gt;    New systems for vehicles, hostile environments, and factions.&lt;br/&gt;    A new stat for Families: Sleight governs espionage, secret deals and conspiracy.&lt;br/&gt;    Mega-Projects: colossal workings that may take many ages to build and change the world forever.&lt;br/&gt;    Advice on how to use these new playbooks and system in your game, and bring them together with material from Legacy: Life Among the Ruins and Echoes of the Fall. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
