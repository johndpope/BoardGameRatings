							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Hat Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a parody of the Fleet Captain&amp;rsquo;s Gold Hat Championship at Origins. The game reflects the final four rounds, although players could agree ahead of time to play all seven rounds (or any number of rounds). Each player draws opponents and plays various cards on themselves or the other players in an attempt to reach the gold hat before anyone else. The game is intended for 4-6 players and is extremely tongue-in-cheek, concentrating more on the humorous aspects of the game instead of the serious. It is not the intent of the designers or publishers to insult anyone but only to provide an entertaining distraction between four hour long tournament games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
