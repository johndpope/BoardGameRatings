							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rituals of the Faeries</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enchanted Magic of the Fair Folk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occult rituals, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, bring magic to the masses, with lengthy and difficult to perform magical rites which can be performed even by non-spellcasters, but which come with a cost, as well as the risk for terrible backlash to occur for those who meddle in things they do not understand. Unlike traditional spells, only a handful of occult rituals made it into that book however, which begs the question of what other strange and unknowable rituals might be lurking about in obscure tomes lost to history and memory. Tomes like this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a collection of 10 brand new occult rituals for use in your game, all of which are thematically linked to faeries and the folklore surrounding them. Presented in the guise of a fictitious tome that player characters might stumble across, the book also includes a flavorful introductory section that can be read aloud or handed out to players, and suggestions for how to incorporate the book into your game. The rituals in this book allow players (or nefarious NPCs) to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bottle the dreams of sleeping creatures and consume them at a later time.&lt;br/&gt;    Attend the court of a faerie noble (at the caster&amp;rsquo;s own risk).&lt;br/&gt;    Create special dusts and ointments that allow one to see through glamers or even fly.&lt;br/&gt;    Steal the appearance of another creature, allowing you to take their place as a changeling.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
