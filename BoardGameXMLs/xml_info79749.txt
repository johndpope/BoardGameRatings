			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This superb simulation contains three games that are designed to challenge all Civil War fans -- regardless of wargaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Introductory game uses simplified rules and options and easy-to-use joystick control to let the novice player jump right into the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intermediate Game serves as a stepping stone to the Advanced Game, where complex decisions and intricate rules create an incredibly detailed and realistic simulation that will satisfy even the most veteran of wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses an improved version of the critically acclaimed game system first seen in SSI's GETTYSBURG: The Turning Point. The Battle of Shiloh is faithfully re-created in 15 turns. All brigades historically present at the battle are included, as are the Federal gunboats Lexington and Tyler. The 30x30 square-grid battlefield (also provided as a 4-color mapboard) accurately reflects the terrain around Shiloh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant refinement is the ability to switch between a strategic and tactical display anytime during play. Another is the inclusion of special morale rules for &amp;quot;green,&amp;quot; untried troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generals Grant and Johnston actually appear in the game as army/corps commanders. They can be injured -- or killed (as Johnston was in the real battle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During solitaire play, the computer can direct either or both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Dave Landrey and Chuck Kroegel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
