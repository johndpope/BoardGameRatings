			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construct Craftsmanship&lt;br/&gt;Every adventurer has heard of that most fearsome of foes, the Golem. Long the guardians of the most formidable ancient tombs, mystic temples, and arcane towers, these mighty creatures are loyal and steadfast servants, outlasting their masters as they tirelessly stand vigil. Considered to be the pinnacle of magical item creation, most Constructs are far beyond the skills of all but the most advanced of casters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, Constructs are no longer the domain of the most puissant of wizards and clerics alone. While the Golems of legend remain beyond reach for a time, homemade servants can attend even average spellcasters. Author Scott Carter presents a new set of rules for building Constructs at lower levels, as well as modifying and adapting constructs and golems found in the Monster Manual and other sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system presented here is not meant as a replacement for the standard system of magic item creation, but as an alternative or supplementary system. The 101 series is all about options and choices. Entire campaigns can be run around the options presented in this book, from finding the right materials for your construct to gaining entry to certain organizations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
