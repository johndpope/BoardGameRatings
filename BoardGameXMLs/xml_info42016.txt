			<description>Egyptian Flood, a card game for 2-6 players featuring city building and destroying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed and ideas by: Benjamin Sperling (Gurken Games), James Casey, Byron Grimes, Erik Lechak, Craig Somerton, August Larson, Jay LaFountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions:&lt;br/&gt;You need these items to play:&lt;br/&gt;10 Farm cards, 10 Floods, 7 Settlements, 6 Kingdoms, 5 Pyramids, 6 Soldiers, 7 Riches, 4 Anubises, 4 Sandstorms, 5 Harvests.&lt;br/&gt;Some kind of coins for gold, different color tokens for each player, and another type of token to represent damage to buildings (solider damage and flood damage).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of cards should be shuffled and each player is dealt four cards from the central deck.  Choose one player to go first and have each player chooses his or her color.  All players take 3 gold from the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player draws one card and plays a card from their hand.  That player does what the card says, then the turn ends and the next player begins their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when no one is able to play any further cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning: &lt;br/&gt;Each player earns 1 victory point for each gold they have plus 2 victory points for each pyramid they control.  The highest total wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoy this game.  It was a collaborative effort of the above designers and idea people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
