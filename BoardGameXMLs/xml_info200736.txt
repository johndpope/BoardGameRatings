							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perfect Women</name>
									
			<description>Perfect Woman is a game inspired by the ubiquitous personality questionnaires featured in women&amp;rsquo;s magazines and the female roles they define. There are so many such roles emphasizing aspects of family, career, experience, sex and more. But these can not possibly characterize the depth and complexity of a woman&amp;rsquo;s life. Perfect Woman uses these stereotypes as building blocks for you to be your OWN perfect woman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
