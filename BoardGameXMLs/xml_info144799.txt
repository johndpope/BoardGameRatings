							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ancestral Crypt</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A casual observer would not be able to guess at the true age of this well cared for structure. They would have an easier time determining the purpose it serves. Surrounding a pool of clear water and the magnificent statue at its center this roofed colonnade has been built to serve as a graveyard for an elven clan with a distinctive ancestor worshiping cult. Built from fine black and white marble it is a symbol for their strong ties to their ancestors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrounding the pool of warm water, fed by an underground hot spring, and in between the columns stand hundreds of large but simple, sealed clay urns containing the bones and ashes of the clans most esteemed ancestors as well as grave gifts. Scattered among the urns is a small number of wooden benches where those seeking to commune with their ancestors can rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
