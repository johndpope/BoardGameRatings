							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orbit: Rocket Race 5000</name>
									
			<description>The object of Orbit is to be the first to play all the cards from your hand you receive 7 cards at the beginning, 120 in total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a turn in Orbit is easy: it consists of playing a card [on the board] and taking any interactions that may result from playing this card alternatively, you may pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards must touch at least one other card along the sido or the top. The card that is played must also match all the cards it touches with the same color and/or black, which is wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
