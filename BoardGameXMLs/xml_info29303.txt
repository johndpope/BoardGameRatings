							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aunty Ruth&#039;s Apples</name>
									
			<description>Aunty Ruth sends us into her orchards to gather apples. Fill the boxes and bring them to her little store by the highway, where lots of people stop by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different apples to pick -- some for eating, for making cider &amp;amp; juice, for baking, and for sauces. Each player spins to see from which orchard to pick apples. But watch out for the wormy ones or those chewed up by deer. When everyone has had a turn at the spinner, we help to fill as many of the different boxes as we can with the apples we picked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;35 cards &lt;br/&gt;1 spinner &lt;br/&gt;store charts &lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
