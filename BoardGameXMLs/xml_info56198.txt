			<description>In Sovereignty!! the king has died leaving no heir to the throne.  You are a noble who sees this as an opportunity to grab power.  In order to place yourself on the throne, you will have to win the support of the people, gather valuable resources, collect taxes, raise an army, and finally obtain tactical information on your opponent. The player who uses their skills at bribery, sabotage, and brute force the most effectively will capture the throne!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played over 4 rounds with opponents competing to claim 6 objective cards per round.  To do this each player places a card face down at each of the objectives.  When all cards are placed there is a showdown where players claim their gained obectives.  New objectives are then drawn, hands are refreshed, and the next round begins!  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed as an alternate version of the card game War with shorter game lengths and addition of decision making.  After a redo in March 2010 it is now a set collection game with 5 varying types of objectives with 7 cards of each type (3x standard card, 1x +1 bonus, 1x +2 bonus, 1x +3 bonus, and 1x +1 per card of this type).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
