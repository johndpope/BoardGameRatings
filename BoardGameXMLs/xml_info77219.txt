Cards are worth varying amount of points depending on the difficulty of the question.  The player with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interactive medical knowledge quiz.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      A side-splitting medical quiz game complete with bone and organ stickers to place on a fold-out body diagram.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Thrilling life or death situations, and the chance to prod and poke real live patients.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Discover whether you are destined to be a brilliant brain surgeon or a half-witted hypochondriac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     52 quiz cards&lt;br/&gt;      fold-out body diagram&lt;br/&gt;      wallet containing 12 stick-on body parts&lt;br/&gt;      32-page concertina book, with bonus questions, quiz answers, score assessment, suggestions for alternative careers, and gory after-dinner medical facts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
