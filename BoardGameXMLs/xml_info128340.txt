							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mandate Archive: The Imago Dei</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paladins of the Long Silence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every synthetic mind is bent on mankind's destruction. Some have a higher purpose, a nobler war to wage in the darkness between stars. Open this free supplement for the equally free Stars Without Number RPG to learn the truth about the enigmatic Imago Dei and their unending crusade to defend worlds ignorant of their very existence. As humanity is the image of God, so the Imago Dei is the shadow of His red right hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from their little-known history, you'll find specifications for their bleeding-edge ship hulls. Included are seven sample Imago Dei warships for your own campaign, whether found as derelict plunder, seized by fanatics, or threatening the PCs' homeworld with the guns of a heretical Shepherd Fleet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
