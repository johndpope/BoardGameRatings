							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Golf Rules Game</name>
									
			<description>The Golf Rules Game is an educational game that lets you train your knowledge on the rules of golf. It was published by now defunct Swedish company Spo Games AB. Two versions (editions) were made: one in Swedish and one in English. Both carried the English name. The publishing company thought it would be an easy way to learn the golf rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially the idea was to release new question-and-answer cards every fourth year (since the rules of golf are updated every fourth year internationally) but it is unknown whether this ever materialised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
