			<description>From Wikipedia: Gauntlet III: The Final Quest is a home computer game by U.S. Gold and Tengen it was released in 1991. Besides the standard four main Gauntlet characters: Thor, Thyra, Merlin, and Questor, four new playable characters were available: Petras, a rock man; Dracolis, a lizard man; Blizzard, an ice man; and Neptune a Merman. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective and includes a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an original game with a isometric projection type view that would later be used in Gauntlet Legends and other Gauntlet games made after Legends. Its view is much like that of Solstice. The player walks around various areas of each kingdom, passing from one area to the next, forest areas and castle dungeons, with logs, tables and other obstacles blocking the player's path, creating a maze-like area. Each area has at least one doorway or pathway to the next. At times certain things must be done in order to advance into the next area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other elements from the series also make an appearance, such as potions that make enemies disappear or weaken them, food (both good and poisonous), invincibility amulets, and treasure chests, some of which can contain traps or other items the player would need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gauntlet III: The Final Quest,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
