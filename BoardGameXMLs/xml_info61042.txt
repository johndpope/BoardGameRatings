			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second American Civil War began just after 10 am CST on January 22, 2061. A historic, highly controversial abortion clinic on Ogalada Sioux reservation land was wiped off the map, and it&amp;rsquo;s RAINBOW Liberty defenders were slaughtered by a post-human terrorist codenamed Life Tank.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-wikipedia.mesh, circa 2107&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Soldier&amp;rsquo;s Book of Shadows&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each woman must be free to make her own choice; no man may safely decide for her; she must give life gladly to be able to give it well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-C. Gasquoine Hartley, The Truth About Women (1913)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closed: The Manual of Pro-Life Tactical Doctrine&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Outside the comfort zone, the spirit of murder grew, unchecked by those called to establish the law of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-Neal Horsley, circa 2000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the year 2107, less than two decades after the Treaty of Boston brought 30 years of savage sectarian violence and civil war to a close. America struggles to rise from the ashes of the Abortion War, while the rival Lifer and Choicer factions build their own unique cultures from what&amp;rsquo;s left. The differences between pro-life and pro-choice, between liberal and conservative, between Christian and Pagan, have been sharpened to a killing edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherverse America is the core sourcebook for the Otherverse America campaign setting, and is divided into multiple sections with each describing a specific faction; their goals, tactics, gear, heroes and villains. This sourcebook describes Otherverse America as a military sci-fi setting, and provides a battle-field look at the setting&amp;rsquo;s history and soldier&amp;rsquo;s eye view of its core conflicts. Other sections provide an in-depth look at civilian life in the Otherverse, daily life within the Lifer or Choicer military, and provides suggestion for building powerful, post-human soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 320 page sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    More than a dozen new starting occupations including the Spider-farm Hobbyist,   the Coven-guard, Neo-Witch Midwife, Closer and Vindicator Advanced Classes,    as well as a new 10 level Powered Hero Basic Class.&lt;br/&gt;    New Player Species unique to Otherverse America.&lt;br/&gt;    Complete rules for genetic engineering, including civilian non-combat genetic engineering!&lt;br/&gt;    Object Philosophies: A new type of mental weapon that can transform ordinary men and women into super-humans thanks to will power alone.&lt;br/&gt;    Comprehensive equipment files for both factions, from guns to vehicles to new suits of Powered Armor.&lt;br/&gt;    A comprehensive overview of the world&amp;rsquo;s civilian culture, from arts and entertainment to sexuality and family life.&lt;br/&gt;    More than a 100 Otherverse specific plot hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
