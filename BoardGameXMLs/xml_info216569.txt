							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Krampus: A Monster for 5th Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krampus is a devil who once a year is unleashed into the world to kidnap as many wicked children as he can stuff into his basket and carry them back to the frigid netherworld that is his home to serve as slaves. He appears at a different place each year on the night of the Winter Solstice and works his evil until dawn, when he disappears with whatever victims he has managed to capture by then. He also accompanies St. Nicholas in the lands where he is active. While the saint rewards good children with presents, however, Krampus gives bad ones lumps of coal and threatens to return the following year and drag them off to Hell if they do not mend their ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This publication contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A detailed description for Krampus.&lt;br/&gt;     Complete 5th Edition statistics for this fiendish monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
