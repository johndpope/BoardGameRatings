							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cave Beast&#039;s Hoard (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder/3.5 Compatible Adventure for 3-5 PCs of level 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Woodwall is a small but thriving forest village. Originating as a simple wilderness trade outpost, it has grown into a modest city and bustling center of commerce that feeds, houses and supplies forest travelers of every sort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s all changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every wilderness has threats. Every forest has dangers that stalk about in the night to prey upon unwary wanderers. But the wilds surrounding Woodwall are home to something even more dangerous, causing the town&amp;rsquo;s growth to grind to a halt as more and more people go missing and are never heard from again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some say a gang of common thieves has made a home in the forest. Others say a monster is gobbling people up. Some even suspect a young dragon is killing merchants to start its own hoard. No one can agree on the details, because no one has seen the so-called &amp;ldquo;Cave Beast&amp;rdquo; and lived to tell the tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are the weary city&amp;rsquo;s new best hope. If they can uncover the truth about the string of killings, find the beast&amp;rsquo;s lair and put an end to the threat, the city of Woodwall will be forever grateful. And more than that, the Cave Beast&amp;rsquo;s hoard will be theirs for the taking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in &amp;ldquo;The Cave Beast&amp;rsquo;s Hoard&amp;rdquo;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Map of Telonel Keep by Jonathan Nelson&lt;br/&gt;     Cover art and monster illustration by Cody Lathim&lt;br/&gt;     New monster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
