							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventurer Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure has arrived!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing is said about all adventurers: They are lucky. They have survived many hours of training and tough encounters. An adventurer always strikes her enemies in the right place and side-steps traps at just the right moment. Adventurers seem to defy death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amora Game presents the second installment in the Supporting Roles product line: &amp;quot;Adventurers.&amp;quot; The adventurer is a class built on diverse training that you select while progressing in levels, with a combination of feats and teamwork feats. This class also features abilities that are driven by a luck pool. Luck is the only way to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes one base class and nine feats fueled by &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; (and that can be selected by other classes as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
