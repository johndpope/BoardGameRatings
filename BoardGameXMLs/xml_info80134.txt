			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Dominique Sumner suggested the idea of including a used bookstore as a possible freebie location, I was immediately sold on the idea. I tend to frequent the used bookstores located near my home and I tend to check out one or two when I&amp;rsquo;m away on vacation. One never knows what they might find in such places, making every trip to such a real life adventure in itself! As for the interests of gaming, a used bookstore offers a great deal of potential for the GM. Such a place could be a front for illegal or sinister activities, or it might be a friendly place where the heroes can stop in to gain possible clues about the ongoing activities of the city. In the least, the layout of the &lt;br/&gt;bookstore offers a new public place where yet another battle may erupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The layout of the bookstore is a wee bit different than the previous freebie offerings. The careful reader will note that unlike the other previous action maps, the presence of a parking lot has been removed. Such change was intentional. While the bookstore might possibly located in a separate building resting on its own lot, many of these shops are usually nestled in the confines of a small shopping center or along a back street series of urban brownstone. Another feature that is different from many of the prior freebies is the brevity of the product. This was also intentional. The shop should be fairly small and overloading with details detracts from the shop&amp;rsquo;s flexibility of different uses.  &lt;br/&gt; Game On! &lt;br/&gt;Dave Woodrum and Stacy Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
