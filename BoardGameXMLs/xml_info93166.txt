			<description>From &amp;quot;The Score&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Worst Four Days in Gaming&lt;br/&gt;Maybe you go to GenCon to get lost in deviant fantasies. Maybe you go to GenCon to be the very first person to get the Hot New Game. Or maybe you go to kill the pain of your mundane and boring life by spending way too much money on games that no one will play with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever your reason for going, let&amp;rsquo;s face it. It&amp;rsquo;s four days and three nights, no sleep, lots of caffeine, and more booze. Combine that with 30,000 nerds with poor social skills and easily-provoked nerd rage, and GenCon is just a fiasco waiting to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From author description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After I recovered from the sleep deprivation and mild insanity that always results from attending GenCon, it occured to me that GenCon would make a perfect playset. Think about it, tons of nerds with no sleep, lots of booze and/or caffeine, and easily-provoked nerd rage are just a fiasco waiting to happen. So here for your Fiasco enjoyment is GenCon: The Worst Four Days In Gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
