							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Messianic</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prophecies abound in the cultures of all races of one who will come and lead the people to greatness. This enigmatic figure is often nothing more than a myth, although an important one, providing the hope of glory and prosperity to even the most downtrodden of peoples. But every few millennia or so, the myth becomes reality, and a true messiah is born. Touched by the gods, a messianic creature is a paragon of all that a race holds dear, and he exists only to be the voice and direction of his people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Messiahs of good-aligned races are bastions of holiness and virtue, and often usher in a golden age of prosperity and peace for their people. Conversely, messiahs of those that dwell in darkness become a blight upon the nations of all other races, leading their people to brutal conquest after brutal conquest. But whatever the moral outlook of a messiah, he commands the utmost loyalty of his people, and they would do anything, even sacrifice their own lives, to help achieve his aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackdyrge's Templates - Messianic contains 9 pages of new d20 material and includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An introduction by Blackdyrge&lt;br/&gt;     The messianic template&lt;br/&gt;     Iconic monster #1 - The Chosen of Set&lt;br/&gt;     Iconic monster #2 - Hethvarag Doomfrost, a messianic frost giant blackguard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
