							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The War of the Worlds: Japan</name>
									
			<description>The War of the Worlds is a solitaire board game that puts you in command of the Human forces in a desperate attempt to defend Earth against the invading Martian Tripods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you plan and carry out the Human side of the war, the game system commands the Martian forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War of the Worlds is a solitaire, low complexity board game. Each games takes only an hour or so to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan possessed a small but well-trained military at the time. To reflect this, their Units cost a little more, but also have a better chance to carry out their orders. Their smaller geographical area makes for more intense combat with fewer movement options. The Martians have 3 Tripods in each Wave. Japan only pays 3 PP to build Harbors, and only pay 1 PP to move Units during the Production step. Battles in Japan will be close-in, intense, and highly mobile. Overall, the game will have a frantic feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
