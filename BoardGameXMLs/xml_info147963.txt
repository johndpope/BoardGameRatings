							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">18th Century Corvette</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full color floorplan 48 x 20 inch, of two 18th Century Corvettes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains twelve, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the hex grid overlay on one side and one ship on each side side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: as the one ship is on the back of the other, if you want to use both at the same time in the Printed Card version, you will need to buy two copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Davy Jones&amp;rsquo; Locker for far too long without company. Kill them all and take their ship for the ghost armada!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes the top deck only of two ships, an eighteenth century corvette and a ghost ship based on that corvette. This product includes image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT). The area around the ship has been left blank for the PDF file to save on ink for printing at home. For the Print on Demand (POD) file, this surrounding area is replaced with water. Visually, the corvette looks like it was just commissioned and sailing out of the port with clean white sails. This is contrasted with the ghost ship that is sailing with tattered brown sails. The blackened deck is rotting with several holes in the hull and the planks appear to be warped by an endless time at sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is intended for use in pirate themed or colonial games. It can also be used in most fantasy settings as well as long as that fantasy setting includes cannons (both ships have six cannons on the top deck). The ghost ship also fits well in Horror themed games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is perfect for a fight between the Player Characters controlling the corvette and a sailor crew facing off against a zombified or ghost captain controlling his ghost ship and a skeletal crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A twist on this is the corvette suddenly appears alongside the group during a brewing storm. The ghostly ship is a derelict mirror of the Player Character&amp;rsquo;s own ship. Its crew is composed of zombies that appear as rotting corpses that bear the same faces as the crew. The ghastly captain has the same face as the captain of the group&amp;rsquo;s vessel. He warns them of a fate worse than death if they do not heed his advice. Turn back from the storm and return from whence you came else you suffer the same fate. If the Player Characters do not turn back, the fierce storm causes their vessel to shake violently from side to side. When the storm ends, the mists part, and they find themselves transported to a ghost ship graveyard. Ghost ships and crews are everywhere. They spring into action when they sense the living approach. The Player Characters need to find a way out or else suffer the same fate as the other denizens&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
