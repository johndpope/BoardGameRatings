							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fungals</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring Ertha's Realm just got a whole lot slimier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungals are one of the strangest creatures ever seen in the Hearthlands. Widely regarded as crop stealing pests, they are usually attacked on sight. Most citizens believe they are a primitive and barbaric race. While it is certainly true they lack any form of technology and complex society, they are a fascinating race, and one not to be underestimated when aroused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement explores fungal culture. Sections on anatomy, social structure, culture, and warfare explain the essence of the fungal race, while stats are provided for every known type of fungal, as well as a plethora of mundane fungi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
