							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beatmania IIDX 10th Style</name>
									
			<description>beatmania IIDX 10th Style is the 10th game in the beatmania IIDX series of music video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core gameplay remains the same on 10th Style. The previous flashing 7 difficulty level was replaced with a difficulty level of 8. In addition, an animated particle effect now occurs if a full combo is scored on a song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;e-Amusement support was extended on 10th Style, now being able to sort songs in folders based on whether they have been cleared in various ways. These include Failed, Cleared, Easy Clear (for songs played with the Easy modifier), and Full Combo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The home version was released in Japan on November 17, 2005 for the PlayStation 2. It contained several exclusive songs and previews from Happy Sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beatmania IIDX 10th Style&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
