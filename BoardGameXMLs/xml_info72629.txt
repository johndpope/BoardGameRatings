							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Ninja 3</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third (and currently last) installment in System 3's successful puzzle/combat adventure game series The Last Ninja. Last Ninja 3 featured the same type of gameplay as earlier games, with a combination of exploring, puzzle-solving and combat. However, the foes were more resilient than in earlier games, and didn't stay defeated in the same way as they had done in the previous two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Ninja 3 was developed for the Commodore 64, and was rumoured to, apart from the normal tap and floppy versions, be released as a cartridge, just as the Ninja Remix had been. This cartridge release was however notoriously hard to get, despite pre-orders, and has been so elusive that fans now doubt a cartridge version ever existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was also, together with the previous two games, released for the Wii virtual console, but Last Ninja 3 was discontinued in Europe due to an unfixable bug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Mark Cale: producer&lt;br/&gt;Tim Best: design&lt;br/&gt;Dave Collins: program (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Robin Levy: graphics&lt;br/&gt;Paul Docherty: graphics&lt;br/&gt;Gyu Jeffries: graphics&lt;br/&gt;Reyn Ouwehand: music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
