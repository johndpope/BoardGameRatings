			<description>Salnave's war is Military, Economic and Political game that represents the event that occurred in Haiti form 1867 to 1870.  The period of Haitian history called Salnave&amp;rsquo;s war by some and The War of the Cacos by others saw Haiti split into three competing states and both brilliant naval strategies and inept anti-insurgency campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of the game is to provide the simple rules, short to medium playing times, indirect player interaction and abstract physical components of a Euro-game and the simulation of strategic combat of a war game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a Euro-game approach to simulate the interplay of economics, politics, and military action. This approach is tied to the specific places, personalities, and events of the Caco War to present a compelling way to play out the flow of this intriguing part of history. There are three major modes of play that allow players to follow the events of the war in close historical order, more loosely, or only as a general backdrop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
