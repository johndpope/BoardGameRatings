							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SFX Skills: Hermetic Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its time for a change!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hermetic Alchemy finds its codified origins,and its name, in the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. The art of traditional, hermetic, alchemy is the act of transmutation - the changing one thing or substance into another. While most consider alchemy to be a secularist science or doctrine, entirely separate from faith or religious leanings, the greatest teachings of Hermes Trismegistus lead inexorably toward questions on the very nature of being and the transmutation of the human soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFX Skills: Hermetic Alchemy is the third installment in the SFX Skills series, which details a new highly adaptable system of FX for modern (and fantasy) d20 role playing. Based within the feat and skill structures common to most d20 systems, SFX Skills are easily added to almost any game with a minimum of adjustments. SFX Skills also offer the ability to run both &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; magic games, even games consisting of elements of each, using the same system. SFX Skills: Hermetic Alchemy is a self-contained toolkit for adding the hermetic magical tradition of alchemy to your game, including rules for using SFX Skills, feats for controlling their access, and a new Background for scholars of occult lore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFX Skills: Hermetic Alchemy was designed to be flexible and scalable for characters of 1st to 20th level, while maintaining a strong thematic focus that keeps Hermetic Alchemy from becoming &amp;ldquo;just another magic system&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
