			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dalreans are a race of sentient, mobile plants. If a treant is a thinking tree, a Dalrean is a thinking flower, and indeed, the spellcasters of this race are noted for their astonishing floral &amp;lsquo;spellbuds.&amp;rsquo; Dalreans, who live exceedingly long lives, are closely tied to the natural cycles of Exodus. Dalreans are extremely social creatures, with a culture rooted in constant spore communication. A Dalrean patch is invariably tranquil and united, and under normal circumstances, individuals within it are likewise the most calm and sociable of creatures. A Dalrean separated from the society of its kind becomes morose and nervous, and a Dalrean deprived of even the substitute company of other intelligent creatures may become severely, even dangerously, unbalanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play the Dalrean as PC Race including Personality and Relations.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus an all new Dalrean Paragon Class&lt;br/&gt;     All New Cavian Feats including Plantsense and Dalrean Toughness.&lt;br/&gt;     and a blank Dalrean Character Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
