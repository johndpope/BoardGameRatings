			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutant is a Pac-Man clone in which you control a creature with huge jaws. You lose a life by coming in contact with one of the four mutants that roam around the maze. However, you have a cloaking shield that will allow you to harmlessly pass the mutants. The cloaking shield is tied to an energy gauge and once it is depleted you won't be able to use it again until you've cleared the maze. There are also four touch plates that will make the mutants incorporeal for a short time. The game has only one maze that repeats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
