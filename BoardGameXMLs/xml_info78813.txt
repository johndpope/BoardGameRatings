			<description>&amp;quot;Arctic Adventure is a platform game written for MS-DOS, published by Apogee Software. It is the sequel to Pharaoh's Tomb. The protagonist, Nevada Smith, is an archaeologist searching for a Viking treasure in the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arctic Adventure was distributed as shareware. It consists of four episodes (named Volume 1 to 4), with only the first episode distributed as shareware, and the rest available commercially. Each level consists of a single room, and there are 20 levels in each episode. The game includes a map screen that gives some flexibility into the order in which the levels can be played.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Arctic Adventure %28video game%29 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
