							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harden #23: Charcoaler</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noran of Faloran's charcoaling camp is in Bujdel Forest, a league or so across the Horka River from Harden Castle in Melderyn. Noran is a shrewd businessman and an expert in woodlore and timbercraft. He has had a license to harvest timber for charcoal in Bujdel Forest for many years. He is a skilled forager and keen waterfowler on Elierna Bog, and some suspect him of being a poacher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article is a location expansion intended for use with the Harden Castle article (COL #5718). It describes the charcoaler and his camp. Full-color plans of the camp are included, along with several adventure hooks the GM can use to bring the location into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
