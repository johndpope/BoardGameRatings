							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Not a Creature Was Stirring</name>
									
			<description>A D&amp;amp;D 5e introductory adventure made for two to five level one characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the night of the winter solstice. The small logging town Ambershandy begins putting its young to sleep awaiting the festivities and celebration of &amp;lsquo;morrow. While the town&amp;rsquo;s glow begins to darken with the rising of the moon a malevolent creature makes his way through the empty streets, cloven feet and cold hands silently leave presents under evergreen trees nestled in the corners of rooms dimly lit with the glow of burning fireplaces. Once a present rests under each tree in each home the creature, Superstitious Mark, makes his way back to his cabin high in the mountains where he will gleefully await the screams that are sure to come from the small town of Ambershandy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
