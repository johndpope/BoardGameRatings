							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Worm in Paradise</name>
									
			<description>The trilogy's final installment is a departure from the previous games. It &amp;quot;evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9's own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word vocabulary, a very highly advanced English input, memory enhancing-text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated type-ahead, and multi-tasking so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hundred years after the arrival of colonists aboard the Snowball 9, planet Eden has become home to half a billion people. In this paradise run by robots there is no crime, no taxes, no unemployment, and no freedom. The population lives in domed &amp;quot;megapolis,&amp;quot; and perhaps due to the war that took place during Return to Eden, there is no contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of flying saucers keeps the population afraid from going outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he wakes up. It was only a simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available under the reign of the third Kim. This &amp;quot;Garden of Eden as a prison&amp;quot; allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, The Worm in Paradise , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
