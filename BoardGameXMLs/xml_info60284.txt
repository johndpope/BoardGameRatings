							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mission Commander</name>
									
			<description>The game is designed to challenge players by testing their knowledge on a variety of information bases related to the U.S. space program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Mission Commander is to complete a lunar mission without losing your ship (or the lives of your crew). Players maintain their missions, their equipment and their lives by accumulating and conserving energy along the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy is gained through the accumulation of energy points, which are earned by answering questions during the mission. Questions are provided by a deck of playing cards which are placed on the board prior to the start of each game. As a general rule, correct answers to questions gain energy, while incorrect answers will lose energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete his or her mission with the minimum required amount of energy points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Board&lt;br/&gt;     One 4-sided die&lt;br/&gt;     One 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;     Four game tokens (different colors)&lt;br/&gt;     One deck of question cards (80 cards total)&lt;br/&gt;     One set of Mission Commander documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Rules and Questions &amp;amp; Answer Keys)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
