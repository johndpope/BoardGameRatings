			<description>Tired of &amp;quot;Tic-Tac-Toe&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hangman&amp;quot;? Try Pencil Football (a.k.a. Airport Football)! It's a paper and pencil game for 1 or 2 players simulating a game of American Football. All you need to play is something to write on and something to write with. That means it's free!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 4 quarters. Each quarter consists of a player taking a turn on offense and on defense. Offense always starts at their opponent's 35 yard line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offense: You have 4 downs to score. Write the appropriate letters in a 6-digit code to represent your play:&lt;br/&gt;Run = three 'R's &lt;br/&gt;Pass = two 'P's&lt;br/&gt;Hail-Mary = three 'P's&lt;br/&gt;Field Goal = one, two, or three 'F's (depending on field position: &amp;gt;30, 10 - 30, &amp;lt;10 yard line)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defense: Without seeing your opponent's play, choose 3 distinct numbers between 1 and 6. These are the left-to-right digits in the offense's play that you block this down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A run is successful and moves the offense 10 yards if at least two 'R's are unblocked. &lt;br/&gt;A pass is successful and moves the offense 20 yards if both 'P's are unblocked.&lt;br/&gt;A hail-mary is successful and results in an instant touchdown if all 3 'P's are unblocked.&lt;br/&gt;A field goal is successful if at least 1 'F' is unblocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you score a touchdown you can attempt a field goal from the 5 yard line or attempt a 2-point conversion from the 5 yard line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
