							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">They Call Him Guff</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success breeds contempt, and Guff has recently been cursed with that particular problem. Guff and his band of miscreants enjoy the fruits of their labor and look now for the next big thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Call Him Guff is designed to be played in only an hour or two. It is a short adventure that includes a bandit encounter in a small cottage. Intended for the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades Role Playing Game, it is easy enought to convert to any system. It is designed for 4-6 characters of 4th-6th level. The fewer characters, the higher level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
