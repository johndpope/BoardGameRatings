			<description>Oktawars is the official prequel of Oktagrid.&lt;br/&gt;In the box you'll find over 60 pawns, towers, sheets, dices, special tokens and a wooden modular board, a quick reference sheet and, obviously, the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's see the story of the game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, there were eight Mages.&lt;br/&gt;They lived on the Island of An, ruling eight realms, and battling each other in small skirmishes...&lt;br/&gt;A great war seemed unavoidable...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To avoid the great, final battle, Pedramor the White, Keeper of Peace and  Master of Light, begins to create a powerful artifact, a boardgame named Oktagrid: if activated, every attack spell will be immediately countered, depriving all the Mages of their primary offensive weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, before the activation of the Oktagrid, two Mages are suddenly killed.&lt;br/&gt;Raksha the Red spreads war all over the land, trying to dominate the entire island, and someone steal the artifact from Pedramor's tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mages begins a desperate fight one against each other, trying to find and activate or destroy the Oktagrid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take place of the six remaining Mages, to try to save - or conquer - the Island of An.&lt;br/&gt;The game has a multiple-level strategy: winning battles is important as taking the control of strategic areas, and even the search for the Oktagrid takes a heavy role, since the activation or the destruction of the artifact is the only way to end the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Mage has his special abilities and spells: each wizard fights in a personal way, being selfish and destructive, or protecting and aiding his troops, or even focusing in teleporting soldiers or making them walk underwater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has very original mechanics and a unique setting; game rules are easy to learn but challenging to master in the most effective way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
