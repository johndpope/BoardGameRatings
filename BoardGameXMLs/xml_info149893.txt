			<description>In Perspective of Mirrors, players take on the roles of intelligence directors utilizing various assets to complete espionage operations and score Information Points. Players use the Espionage cards to alter the landscape and achieve goals. Assets are utilized in the field to seek clues and information vital to success. Operations are the missions handed to you from above that need to be completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being in the right place at the right time can make the difference between success and failure. When states spy on states, not only are the proper assets required to be in the right place at the right time, but also with the right support. It takes a skillful mastermind to direct your nation&amp;rsquo;s assets in a manner that is beneficial to your missions but also confounding to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
