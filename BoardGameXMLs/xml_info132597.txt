			<description>A children's game based on Mauri Kunnas' version of R.L. Stevenson's Treasure Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have five cards, each of which shows three types of treasure items. The game board has three rotating wheels with the pictures of treasure, and they must be aligned so that the combinations in the cards are shown on the board. On each turn, player gets to rotate the wheels 1&amp;ndash;3 steps, depending on a die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the active player has rotated the wheels, all players check if the combinations in their treasure cards show up on the board. If they do, players can discard the matching cards. Whoever gets rid of her cards first, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
