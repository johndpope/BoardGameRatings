							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombicide Survivor: Fred the Trader</name>
									
			<description>Fred used to be a mathematical genius with intuition and an aggressive instinct.  Trading was second nature for him, and while he regretted some of his decisions, he enjoyed his job a lot.  Still, he felt something missing, a thirst his huge bonuses could not quench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the zombies came, changed his world, and brought him the answer.  A predator at heart, Fred needed real action to feel alive.  He was the first on the trading floor to understand what was going on and what he needed to do.  Fred was the only one to get out alive.  His real life had just begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fred is an optional promotional survivor available to those that raise an extra amount on their pledge for the Zombicide Season Two Kickstarter campaign. A zombie version (Zombivor) will also be included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
