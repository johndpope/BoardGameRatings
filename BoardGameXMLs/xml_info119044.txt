							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whispers of Death: A Sourcebook for Assassin Characters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murderous whispers heard in the dead of night, a poisoned arrow fired upon it's target through the busy streets of the city, a dark figure that seems to emerge from the shadows behind it's prey, the unannounced guest that slips poison into his host's wine, and the warrior who uses deception to deal death blows upon his enemies. These are the many faces of the assassin. Within the pages of this book you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Five new prestige classes for assassins covering mastery in the different assassin styles.&lt;br/&gt;     New feats designed for assassin characters.&lt;br/&gt;     New assassin and shadowblade spells.&lt;br/&gt;     New paths: Class combinations that outline career paths for assassin characters to take.&lt;br/&gt;     Four detailed assassin guilds.&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment, weapons, and armor for assassin characters.&lt;br/&gt;     Assassin-specific magical items.&lt;br/&gt;     Assassin Styles: techniques assassins can learn without taking levels in additional prestige classes.&lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for compensating assassin characters who complete jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
