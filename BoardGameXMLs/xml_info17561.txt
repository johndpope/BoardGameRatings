			<description>In PROSPEKTOR, two to seven players try to make their way as explorers and prospectors traveling throughout the Solar system. Buy, outfit, and board ships, space stations, and space mills to become the richest prospector. It is not enough to find the raw materials. You have to bring them back to Earth and sell them successfully. This is only possible if there is a supply line (i.e. an uninterrupted orbital line from the raw material world back to Earth). Robot shuttles on the planets and asteroids carry the resources to the orbiting ships/stations at a rendezvous point. From there, a transfer to Earth is only possible when a supply line is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set-up as a row of cards with each representing a planet in our Solar system. Each card/planet shows orbital paths for player travel and shows available resources which can change throughout the game - ore, biomass, energy, and water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game includes:&lt;br/&gt;91 playing cards&lt;br/&gt;7 cards to cut and use as playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designers suggest using 10mm dice as playing pieces, as only three are necessary for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
