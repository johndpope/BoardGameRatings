			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listen to my words and heed them well, usurper. Your place is among the dead...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange things are afoot on the sorcerous island of Truillon. Wet floorboards and shadowy spectres suggest that the drowned Archmage has returned from the dead. Has he come to test the worthiness of his successor, or is it revenge that has called him back from his watery grave? Armed with only a strong heart and a handful of spells, the apprentice Osric must find the answers - otherwise his master is surely doomed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read carefully, for as Osric faces the dark sorceries of one who is pledged to the Great Powers of Chaos, you too must prepare yourself for a heroic venture into the world of magic. Then take the first steps on the road to becoming a Hero by testing your worth as a wizard with an exiting solo scenario designed to accompany the HeroQuest game. Can you survive the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book actually is a 3-in-1 offer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a great story to read&lt;br/&gt;     Solo Adventure for HeroQuest&lt;br/&gt;     Gamebook Solo Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
