							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myassari, Patron of Birth and Decay</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who, or What, is Myassari?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At what moment does a crumbling stone pillar&amp;rsquo;s existence pass from aged into ruin?  How many wrinkles on a baker&amp;rsquo;s brow does it require for him to be named olden?  Why may the dancing tongues of flame strengthen the bonds of metal, yet sear those between flesh and bone?  These questions are only three of the many which Myassari, the stenographer of birth and decay, holds secret within her boundless codex.  Voyaging between the planes of non-existence, she summons one element at a time to study; carefully observing and documenting its every physical variance during a repetitious cycle of birth, decay, and rebirth.  Because of her full understanding of human childbirth, many midwives and healers honor Myassari by wearing a ruby feather brooch for good fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Myassari must converse with material beings, she takes on the appearance of a weatherworn harpy, whose heated feathers dance and flicker like flame driven by a bellows.  Those who wish to form a bond with Myassari must first be catalogued by the scrupulous patron.  After crying out her name upon a blazing pyre, the PC must survive the torment of a ceaseless cycle of life and death within her vacant dimension for a full week.  Having been beaten and tempered on the anvil of time, PCs bound to Myassari are requested to make offerings of rare and valuable materials to be studied by their patron, until she's documented the phases of each object and being within the multidimensional universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witness the birth of a new DCC RPG Patron!  Myassari, the stenographer of birth and decay, the silent observer, the deity of midwifery and time, is now ready for your ungrateful worship! All with her bearing blessed by the Dark Master himself!  Download the full, 25 page patron, complete with taints, spells, and lore, on RPGNow for FREE or Pay-what-you-want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by myself, Julian Bernick, and illustrated by Trevor Hartman, this patron was conceived and developed after her initial name-drop in &amp;ldquo;Cast Tower of the Blood Moon Rises!&amp;rdquo;  Bring her into your next DCC RPG session!  But&amp;hellip; why, you ask?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to turn a treacherous demon-lord into a plump babe and raise him as your own son?  Have you ever wanted to shroud a fellow adventurer within the mucusy secretions of a healing membrane to lessen his pains?  Have you ever wanted to summon a phoenix built of boulders to smash in the brains of your foes (or allies)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THEN KISS HER TALONS AND BEG FOR MYASSARI&amp;rsquo;S MERCY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
