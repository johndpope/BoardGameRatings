			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your partner have just been assigned a case and you only have so long to get to the bottom of it. You work together (mostly) figure out what happened and Whodunit. Most of all, you want to help change your partner&amp;rsquo;s way of thinking and approaching cases in the future. Players aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to directly discuss the case. At its core, this game is about exploring the two characters and the shades of grey in their morality. The crime or mystery is just a vehicle to explore the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primarily for two players, additional participants assume the (usually short-lived) roles of accessory characters in the developing narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
