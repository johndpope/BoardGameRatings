			<description>A card game simulating drivers in an apocalyptic future; where raiders and bandits roam the land, taking what they want by sheer force or through brute intimidation.  The players are wanderers; drivers of cars that have been modified to help them endure the perils &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; as they travel the highways between fortified villages and settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by one or more players. Ideally, the game is intended to be played by &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; players but works fine as a solo game. In a multi-player game, the individuals can work together, or against each, or as teams if they have enough players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic component is a standard deck of 52 cards, a token to show the drivers movement across the cards, and two 1d6 to keep track of the drivers two stats: health/speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is trying to get his driver across a wasteland of broken roads, and marauding bandits.  The cards themselves are used as the road, modifiers during movement, and combat against marauders or other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card suite and face value will determine the type and strength of encounters the driver will face along the road,  The driver will in turn use their hand of cards to control the speed of their vehicle as well as the strength of their attack and defense.   During a co-op game, the drivers can use their cards to help friendly drivers fight off marauders or control their driving reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed as part of the Traditional Card Game design contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/421774/page/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/421774/page/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
