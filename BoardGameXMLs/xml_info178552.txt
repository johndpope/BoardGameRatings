							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tiger&#039;s Song</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the 5th edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the steaming jungles of the east, the Feathered City rises like a jewel from the lush forests. An important stop on many aerial trade routes, the skies above the city are filled with griffons, rocs, and airships from the far corners of the world. But your adventure takes you to the very belly of this exotic city. Forced into the service of a night hag, you must help her find and eliminate her enemy - a demon with no name, that rules from the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a mystery adventure for characters level 5-10, and optimized for a party of 5 level 7 characters. It takes about 10 hours, or two sessions, to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be warned - this isn't an adventure for the faint of heart! It contains horror elements that may be too graphic some players, and even worse - this adventure packs an old school punch. Teamwork and caution are needed to survive long enough to hear the Tiger's Song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
