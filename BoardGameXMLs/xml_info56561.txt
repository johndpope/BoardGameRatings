							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heretics &amp; Outsiders</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Threats to Crown and Soul &lt;br/&gt;The Known Worlds are rife with those who refuse to follow the social order. Whether practicing their rebellion in private or fomenting public revolt, these malcontents threaten the powers-that-be. Heretics refuse to follow the Church's doctrines of proper faith, and so risk their own souls and those of others through their example. Psychics plot to overthrow mundane humanity -- or worse, attempt to force psychic awakening on others through the mysterious Sathra Effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not only humanity's soul that is so threatened, however, for its very right to rule itself is challenged by the potential power of the alien Vau Hegemony. The incursions of the metamorphic Symbiots threaten to warp peoples' own bodies. What's more, barbaric human star-nations lust after the riches of the Known Worlds -- or wish to forcibly convert their citizens to false faiths. Amidst these dangers, is it any wonder the stars darken before such sin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heretics &amp;amp; Outsiders is the second volume in the Secret Societies series. Sir Chamon Mazarin, the Emperor's spymaster, presents new dossiers on heretical cults, underground psychic covens and foreign intelligence agencies -- including Vau infiltrators and Symbiot insurgents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are d20 System rules for new occult powers, tools of the spy trade, and two new prestige classes: The Dervish and the Master Spy. These rules require the use of the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Players Handbook, Third Edition, published by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
