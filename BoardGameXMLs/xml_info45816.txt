			<description>A dice and card game based on the RUNEQUEST runes. Designed for 3-10 players, PANTHEONS gets better the more people that play. Appropriate for the entire family, ages 10 and up.&lt;br/&gt;Six specialty dice&lt;br/&gt;163 card deck&lt;br/&gt;Scoresheets&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Scenario folder and charts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice and cards show 32 different RUNEQUEST runes which regulate play. Each player represents a Deity. Each player has unique play abilities and victory conditions. The object is to outplay your competitor Gods and reach your maximum Attribute points &amp;ndash; thereby ruling the Gloranthan PANTHEON!&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 different Attributes. You begin with one Minor God and may acquire more &amp;ndash; Minor Gods allow you to take Attribute Points from the other Deities. Every turn, each player rolls the dice and draws/plays cards to earn more Points. Cards can be saved to advance questing Heroes to Minor God status or used against your opponents to take Points. Playing time is 1 - 4 hours depending on how many players you have. 3-4 players takes 1-1.5 hours [less for experienced players], while 10 players is more of a party atmosphere that can go for up to 4 hours [again-usually much less for experienced players].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original version of this game was produced in 1984 under License / Permission from Greg Stafford and the CHAOSIUM. Less than 300  were ever printed. Over 250 copies were sold. I have an archive copy &amp;ndash; the last one. Currently, artwork is being prepared for a 25th Anniversary Limited Edition printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
