			<description>This belongs to a series of promotional Monopoly clones featuring local businesses and trivia, published around 1988-1992. As in Monopoly you move around a board collecting &amp;quot;shares&amp;quot; and hope for others to land on your properties, although the specifics are slightly different. Obviously the trivia elements vary from game to game within the series, and there are also some small mechanical variations, e.g. in the composition of event cards and how rent is calculated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though this particular game is not branded as Kunskapsspelet - it encompasses four towns around the lake of Siljan rather than a single town - it is clearly the same design by Knut Helleland, with some others contributing trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
