			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dead rose to outnumber the living, and they hungered for the flesh of those who remained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For months, the characters have struggled to survive in a world that was no longer theirs. Gone were the amenities they once took for granted, replaced by scavenging for even the most basic necessities. Past were the days of being surrounded by thousands of the living and barely noticing. Now were the days when survival meant scanning every shadow, checking around every corner, and taking careful note of the surroundings. Along the way, the characters gathered a group of people that saved their lives as much as the characters saved theirs. They found within the group a determination to survive a world that no longer had a place for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the lives of those people hanging in the balance, the characters enter the final battle against Hell Fuerrie&amp;mdash; a monster more lethal than any ghoul or Rager.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
