			<description>East meets West in Club Zen, a relaxing worker placement game where the goal is to plan out your seven-day working vacation in the most Zen way possible. Manage your work and emotional stress, make new friends, attend exciting events such as hang gliding or rock climbing, collect stones for your personal Zen Garden, or take a nap! How will you spend your time at the 5-star Caribbean resort, Club Zen? The most relaxed or &amp;quot;zen&amp;quot; player at the end of their one week stay will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike traditional resource management and worker placement games, Club Zen encourages players to visit the same locations together, many times for an increased benefit for all players involved. Because of this, the game features a measure of cooperation and meaningful positive interaction, while still having only one winner. The game is a sandbox of strongly thematic and relaxing environments to explore, with each element tuned to both be strategic and evoke a real sense of immersion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
