			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qin is a graphical text adventure game developed by the team behind SRAM I and II (Jacques Hemonic, Serge and Ludovic Hauduc), also published by ERE informatique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in 780 AD in medieval China. The main character is a descendant of the famous architect Liou (the man who designed emperor Tcheng's tomb hundreds of years ago) searching for the mystical secret of Qin, buried&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's character, a descendant of the famous architect Liou (the man who designed emperor Tcheng's tomb hundreds of years ago), after several prophetic dreams, decides to search for the secret of Qin, allegedly buried inside the tomb his forefather built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the SRAM series, Qin uses a text parser for player input, and a mix of graphics and descriptive text. The game world is huge (it uses four floppy sides) and steeped in medieval Chinese culture and mythology: a part of the game involves praying to Wenchen (god of Time) in order to travel in time and meet the character's ancestors. The game graphics are heavily inspired by ancient Chinese paintings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
