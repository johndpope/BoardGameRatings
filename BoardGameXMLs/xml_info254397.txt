			<description>Get Organized is a mafia-based card and dice game.  The goal is to accumulate 100 or more points by collecting &amp;ldquo;Industry Cards.&amp;rdquo;  Each player begins with 1 of each industry card in play (Strip Clubs, Drug Trafficking, Waste Management, Money Laundering, Gambling Ring and Law Enforcement).  Each turn begins with a &amp;ldquo;Collect&amp;rdquo; phase, where the player takes $200 from the &amp;ldquo;stash.&amp;rdquo;  Then there is a &amp;ldquo;Purchase&amp;rdquo; phase, where they player may choose to purchase more industry cards (kept in their hand for now, but not in play) or bullets to attack with.  Next is the &amp;ldquo;Attack&amp;rdquo; phase, where the player can choose to roll dice to &amp;ldquo;shoot the bullets&amp;rdquo; at another player&amp;rsquo;s industry cards.  If a 4+ is rolled, the player takes that card and adds it to his/her industry cards in play.  Finally, there is the &amp;ldquo;Build&amp;rdquo; phase, which is when a player may play one industry card that was purchased earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate 3 of any one industry card in play, &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; that industry and gains the benefits of it (for example, the person who owns the Gambling Ring gets to roll a die during his/her collect phase and collects $100 X the number they roll, in addition to the $200 they already collect).  Every time an industry is taken over, the player who now owns it gets to pull a &amp;ldquo;Good Earner&amp;rdquo; card, which can be saved and used at any time (for example, there is a bullet proof vest, which makes bullets only hit on 5&amp;rsquo;s and 6&amp;rsquo;s for one attack phase).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round, the player with the most industry cards in play (not counting the ones purchased but not played yet) is the &amp;ldquo;Rat.&amp;rdquo;  They must pull a rat card, which almost always has a negative action that must be taken.  The Rat goes first in the next round, which isn&amp;rsquo;t always a good thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each industry card in play is worth 5 points, but once the player owns the industry, all the cards within that industry are worth 10 points for that player.  The game ends when there are one or more players over 100 points at the end of the round (the one with the most points wins).  If someone gets over 100 points in the middle of a round, others can attack that player to reduce their points to less than 100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
