							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Well of Souls</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;From the darkness of the well emanates the haunting moans of the deceased plunderers and defilers who risked everything to learn the secrets below. But you have something they did not: The Tablets of Fate. Through guile and treachery, force and luck, you have jointly acquired these ancient stone tablets, and only with their hieroglyphics dare you hope to circumvent the horrors that lie within the Well of Souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your guide, Farid, stand around a gaping hole in the floor of a mountain cave. A crude pulley and rope system hangs over the hole, and from it dangles a single wooden bucket. Will you brave the depths below in search of fame, fortune and liberation from your downtrodden lives?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a level 0 adventure, but it can be enjoyed with a party of 1st level characters aided by hirelings. It was designed to play in about 4-hours or less, making it ideal for new players, convention play, or even a one-shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
