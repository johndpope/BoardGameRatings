			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dual-system sourcebook for Legend of the Five Rings and Oriental Adventures. Covers high-level campaigns and presents four new paths for character advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All heroes aspire to something greater. Throughout the course of an adventuring career, a samurai might rise through the ranks of his clan, gain great accolades, and perhaps even come to command others. What happens next? Should a character be cast into retirement simply because his duties no longer require him to battle common bandits or deliver the commands of his superiors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book holds the answer to that question. What happens when a samurai steps forth from the common ranks and becomes an influential leader of the Empire? What happens when a warrior becomes a warlord, when a courtier becomes an influential ambassador, when a shugenja becomes a master of his own temple, or when a samurai seeks to create and teach his own techniques?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the Way of the Daimyo, you will find the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New rules for advanced character, including the Warlord, the Ambassador, the Temple Keeper, and the Sensei. These can build on existing characters or be completely new characters, creating new avenues of development for established heroes as well as novices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Updated rules for Glory and Status, allowing characters to more accurately track their positions with Rokugan's complex social system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tips for advanced campaigns. What does a hero do once he's already saved the Empire? Step forward to help rule it, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for creating your own school techniques, or even your own Minor Clan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a dual-system supplement for the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game&amp;trade;, Second Edition, and Rokugan&amp;trade;, the d20 Companion for Legend of the Five Rings. Players and DMs may also find it useful as a source of interesting new feats and abilities for any d20 System campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters running the Second Edition L5R RPG will need a copy of the Legend of the Five Rings Game Master's Guide&amp;trade; and the Player's Guide&amp;trade;. Players need only the Player's Guide&amp;trade;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Masters running d20 System games will need a copy of the Player's Handbook&amp;trade;, the Dungeon Master's Guide&amp;trade;, Oriental Adventures&amp;trade;, and Rokugan. Players will need only a Player's Handbook&amp;trade;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
