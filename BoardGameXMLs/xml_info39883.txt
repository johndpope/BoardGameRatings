			<description>Hullunkuriset ehdokkaat is satirical card game about Finlands presidential election in 1982. Art of the cards is made by most famous Finnish political cartoonist Kari.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is based on card game Hullunkuriset perheet, which is just Finnish version of The Game of Authors. The name Hullunkuriset ehdokkaat means funny candidates. There is only 24 cards (four suits of five cards and four extra cards). These suits represent main parties and their candidates. The extra cards are other known political figures of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is very simple. You just draw a card from the next player and she/he does the same and so on. The winner is the player who gets all cards of one suit and he/she has to shout &amp;quot;Pressa!&amp;quot;, which means that she/he has elected new president of Finland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Game of Authors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
