							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Martial Arts Mayhem, Volume One</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martial Arts Mayhem, Volume One is the first of a two-volume modern d20 System martial arts supplement. It's written by Rich Redman, a designer on the original d20 Modern Roleplaying Game from Wizards of the Coast, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you use Martial Arts Mayhem, Volume One, every melee combat is unique thanks to added customization. Your heroes are no longer limited to the Brawl feat tree, the Combat Martial Arts feat tree, and Defensive Martial Arts. Instead, your heroes can become light-fingered masters of the Deft Touch School. They can confuse and befuddle opponents as masters of Drunken Fighting. Or they can launch powerful, lightning-fast kicks as masters of the Northern Leg School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And because anyone can be members of these schools, your heroes will never know if the old man sweeping the sidewalk is a mere shopkeeper&amp;mdash;or a secret master of Sticky Hands! Even when he takes his combat stance, they cannot be sure whether he knows the Thousand-League Eye technique, or Repulse the Monkey (or both) until it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martial Arts Mayhem maintains the balance between firearms and martial arts found in the d20 Modern Roleplaying Game. We designed it to work with the feats in the d20 Modern game, not to replace them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martial Arts Mayhem, Volume One includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     new feats&lt;br/&gt;     new schools&lt;br/&gt;     new secret techniques&lt;br/&gt;     stats for martial arts weapons&lt;br/&gt;     campaign models complete with NPCs&lt;br/&gt;     new optional rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
