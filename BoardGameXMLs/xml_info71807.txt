			<description>From the website of the publisher: little magnetic strategy game with theme sports: RALLY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel pocket game for two players in which the goal is to be the first to move your three playing pieces (&amp;quot;race cars&amp;quot;) to the other side of &amp;quot;town&amp;quot;. Each of the cars is numbered and you have to get your cars across in reverse order. You either move one car horizontally or vertically. If your opponent ends next to one of your cars, then you can move it to one of the four garage boxes and take its place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
