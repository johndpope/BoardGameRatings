			<description>Players are dealt a hand of ten cards, each of which is a letter of the alphabet worth a number of points (there are also a few wild cards).  Players try to empty their hands by spelling five-letter (or longer) words using their letter cards.  They can also add letters to their own previously played words (although they cannot rearrange the letters):  for example, adding S, ED, or ING to WRECK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players draw two cards and must discard one.  Players may also take letters from the discard pile, but these must be used immediately -- and all discards prior to the one they take must be taken into their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round ends when a player goes out by spelling a word plus having one card to discard.  Points from exposed words are totaled; points from letters held in the hand are subtracted unless they can be dumped into words (which are worth nothing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete game consists of four rounds. Highest point total is the winner.  Note: spelling SHMOOZE is worth 50 points and spelling SHMOOZELED is worth 250 points -- a bit of a balance wrecker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
