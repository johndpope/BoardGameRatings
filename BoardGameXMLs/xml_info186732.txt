							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Olendiak Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Olendiak Fantasy have nine Attributes (Agility, Charisma, Endurance, Health, Intelligence, Mana, Perception, Power, and Strength) that are randomly generated from 2d6+3.  Skills are then purchased from a point pool (they have unequal costs).  The Skill resolution mechanic assigned a numeric penalty to Skill attempts based on the GM-assigned Difficulty of the Skill attempt.  Very easy tasks have no penalty, through Heroic tasks that have a -15 penalty.  When characters make opposed rolls they both make a Skill check.  If both fail, then both fail; if one succeeds, that person succeeds; if both succeed then the attempt is deemed a draw.  Skills can be improved through experience or by training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is handled through a modification of the Skill system.  The game requires a Skill allocation for every weapon category.  Characters engaged in combat roll 3d10, attempting to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; their Skill score to hit.  Weapons do 1d6 + Strength modifier + Weapon damage modifier (which ranges from -1 to 5).  Armors reduce damage on every hit (from 1 to 8), so that it is possible to receive a hit that does no damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A magic system is presented but is not developed enough to use in a game, without substantive GM input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
