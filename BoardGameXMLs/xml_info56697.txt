							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Decados Fiefs</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emperor Alexius has sent his Questing Knights forth to bring back reports from all quarters of the Known Worlds on the state of his empire. The fifth volume surveys the Decados fiefs- the Mantis Worlds of the most Machiavellian of houses, ruled by schemers and spymasters under a cloak of hedonism and decadence. Watch your back amid the steaming jungles of Severus, the irradiated deserts of Cadavus, the ice-cold mountains of Malignatius, and the towering but crumbling Republican towers of Cadavus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each survey volume is a report written by a Questing Knight in a unique voice, and is suitable for both players and gamemasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
