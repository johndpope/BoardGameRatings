			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 1987 mythological platform game the player controls Popolon and Aphrodite after the events of Konami's 1986 fantasy shooter Knightmare. The evil cleric Galious has kidnapped their unborn child Pamperse, and the pair must traverse the monster filled Castle in an attempt to find him. The player must collect and purchase a wide variety of items that improve their abilities and find the 10 hidden Worlds in the Castle. The thrust of the game is to solve puzzles, explore, and defeat the 10 demons that rule the hidden Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character death is permanent, though there is an in game mechanic that can revive each of the characters once per game. However, the game features a save mechanism and the usefulness of a second life bar is often enough to warrant reloading a previous save game in the event of character death. Though there is only a single save point there is an item (obtainable near the outset of the game) that can warp the player to the screen containing the save point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan remake of the MSX game (for PC, Mac, Linux) with a wide variety of graphical/musical options was released as a freeware download circa 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Famicom port is essentially a different game though it has many recognizable elements in common with the MSX game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
