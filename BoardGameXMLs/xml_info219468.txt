			<description>Volcanic Dungeon is a role-playing video game designed by Roy Carnell and Stuart A. Galloway and released by Carnell Software for the ZX Spectrum, Dragon 32/64 and ZX81 computers in 1983. It is a sequel to 1982's Black Crystal and was itself followed by The Wrath of Magra in 1984. The BASIC source code listing of the game is available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;A war between the forces of good and evil has been won by the light, and the dark goddess Lamhar and the Snow Queen were both defeated. But the witch Magra has managed to escape with some of her army into the titular volcanic dungeon, taking with her a captive elfin princess named Edora. The task of a hero known as the Knight of Star Jewel is to hunt down and kill Magra, and to rescue Edora from her glass coffin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Dungeon Volcanic Dungeon]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
