			<description>You have no memories...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't know who you are...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't know where you are...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's all I can tell you right now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grimind is a 2D physics based adventure/platform game with a horror/creepy theme. Grimind casts you into forgotten caves and ancient crypts, without memories. While there you have to demonstrate great manual skills to pass obstacles and solve puzzles to get out of the scary environment and discover what are you doing there alone.  But is it certain ... that you are there ... alone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;- Dynamic gameplay combined with a frightening experience.&lt;br/&gt;- Physics-based gameplay - It gives you the possibility to do whatever you want. Every single dynamic object can be dragged, carried or thrown which gives you enormous freedom.&lt;br/&gt;- Narration - While playing, the character is talking, telling the player what he feels, if he's scared, or what he thinks about the current situation.&lt;br/&gt;- Challenge! - Grimind isn't an easy game, so you can forget about holding just one key and passing through the levels. Besides dexterity and input skills, there are also a large number of logic puzzles to solve. Your brain will be tested and you'll not get bored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
