			<description>An educational game to be used in a classroom environment, published in Flanders. The aim is to learn about city government and local politics.&lt;br/&gt;A cityscape is built up out of roads and buildings. The buildings are sheets of thick paper that are placed upright with plastic stands.&lt;br/&gt;Pupils are members of the city council, representing one of four parties. They must gain votes (represented by meeples) by answering questions on politics in Flanders, and by having their party projects accepted by a council majority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
