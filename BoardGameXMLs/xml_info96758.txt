			<description>Quble &amp;ndash; A Twisting, Turning, Fun Word Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a cross between Boggle and a Rubik's Cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Quble, players have the option to twist and turn the cube to build words in 60-second rounds using letters worth varying point values (point values are indicated on each letter).  The strategy is to search for the most or longest words and accumulate the highest score possible.  Each player must decide how to best allocate their play time between moving the cube or searching and calling out each word with its point value. Typically, a game consists of 2 to 5 rounds of play.  Players compete for the highest score by adding up the letter values for all words appearing anywhere around the cube.  The letters can wrap around the sides of the cube from one face to another and must links diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. In QUBLE JUMBLE and FIRST TO FORTY, scoring may be based upon the length of the word. The more letters in a word, the more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides word game play, QUBLE can also be played as a conventional brain teaser by matching up each face of the puzzle by solid colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook includes 7 variants, mostly in the scoring and win conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
