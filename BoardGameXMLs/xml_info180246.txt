			<description>The Coterie is a headless cooperative tabletop role-playing game where uncommon heroes are pitted against an unfamiliar enemy. Choose your path through dark dungeons while searching for your objectives. Find lost materials and gain favor with the town to upgrade your weapons and armor. Your choices, both small and large, will determine your campaign. Band together with your allies and name your own coterie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Coterie is the last line of defense for the land. The heroes you know are gone. You must stand together, or die alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tile placement system that builds as you play to eliminate setup times. Each game will be different from the last. &lt;br/&gt;     Terrain adds an additional layer of complexity and variation to the game. As regions are discovered, so are their terrains. Terrains are drawn randomly, and can vary each game with each region.&lt;br/&gt;     Backgrounds and skills to mix and match anyway the players wish. Each combination creates a different style of play.&lt;br/&gt;     Limited resources are available. Not everyone will be able to be the plate armor wearing, front-line tank. Choose your equipment to best compliment your background and skill!&lt;br/&gt;     Lasting equipment upgrades for your weapons and/or armor. &lt;br/&gt;     Evolving enemies that gain strength depending on how they are defeated in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
