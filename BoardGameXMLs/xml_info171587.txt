			<description>Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War is a 2014 World War II-era third-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by Gameloft.

The game serves as a sequel to Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes and Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front and it is still set during World War II.  It is part of the Brothers in Arms series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay of Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War is similar to its predecessors, through it differs drastically from Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front, instead the game is played from third-person perspective like the first installment, unlike the first person gameplay of Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front. Player characters can crouch, drive Sherman tanks, throw grenades, use iron sights, reload, change weapons and shoot using virtual buttons on the touchscreen, and can control two vehicles during the game; an M3 Scout Car and an M4A1 Sherman Tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War introduces squads which can be upgraded or changed. They also share the similar features to Frontine Commando 2, another third-person shooter game developed by GLU. The customization for this game has been expanded. The player could customize and upgrade his/her weapon to complement their style of gameplay. Additional weapons such as assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, pistols and knives can be bought from the shop. The player character can freely move across the level with a cover system. The graphics has improved and it features better visuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features side missions in which the players can amp up their experience in order to unlock more weapons. They weren't part of the story and just a challenge. Some enemy soldiers using an anti-air can be found during side missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
