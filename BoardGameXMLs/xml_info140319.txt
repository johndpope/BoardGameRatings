			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ISCHADRA, GRANDMOTHER OF ASSASSINS - CR 14, Advanced Soulbound Doll Assassin  10/Inquisitor 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A horrifying new Infamous Adversary for the Pathfinder RPG!&lt;br/&gt; She wears the guise of a doll, a child-like construct of porcelain and wire, but cold sentience seemingly teems in her empty eye sockets. She stares with an eery mute silence, giving you a moment for your brain to adjust to what it is seeing. A doll given life, bestowed with an ancient weapon of vengeance and purpose. With an inhuman leap her blade buries deep in your throat. As the last of your lifeblood spills her words take form in your mind,  and you know why the Grandmother of Assassins has come.&lt;br/&gt; Infamous Adversaries contains: one ready to use villain, complete with equipment, a rich background including motives, history, personality, network, resources, lair, tactics, morale, advancement options, a quote, plot hooks to easily insert them into your campaign, local lore, full color art and a vibrant description. The Infamous Adversaries characters are designed to challenge an entire party; not just in combat, but also through less direct methods requiring careful planning and confrontation.&lt;br/&gt; Contained within is 26 pages of original TPK content including a full depiction of our Infamous Adversary, plus original short fiction, a new deity (Naelib, Lord of Murder), and faction (The Ebon Hand), several supporting cast characters (ever wonder what a Grandfather of Assassins was like?) and monsters (the all new Spectral Host), plus our personally designed Hero Lab files for use in customizing our characters and content in your campaigns!   &lt;br/&gt; Give your players a reason to hate again. You can blame it on us...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
