			<description>Steeped in the lore of Mistfall and Heart of the Mists, Chronicles of Frost: All That Burns introduces a new villain, a new hero, and a new mode of play: the cooperative campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 110 new cards, All That Burns allows you to play a string of five scenarios, unlock new abilities for your heroes, and face one of the iconic villains of Aestemyr: Sigraed the Mistflame. Face off against a potent flamecaster mage driven insane by her lust for revenge, then corrupted and reforged into a living weapon by the ravenous Mists. Foil her plans to set the world ablaze, desperately fight to loosen her grip on Valskyrr, and finally stand against her in battle as legendary heroes of the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once brought down and redeemed, Sigraed is also a playable hero in All That Burns. Beat the cooperative campaign to add Sigraed to your hero roster, or simply play her from the start. After all, the Mists corrupt all, and their twisting power has made adventurers face shadows of their former comrades &amp;mdash; or even twisted copies of themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
