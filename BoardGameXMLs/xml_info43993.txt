							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Core&#039;s Crusade</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core's Crusade is the core book for Mechanical Dream. The book is split in two halves. One side of the book forms the Dream Aspect, which details the setting of Mechanical Dream. Flipping the book, and opening it from the other side, takes you to the Mechanical Aspect, which tells you about the rules and mechanics of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Inside Front Cover, Dream Side&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dream Aspect&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In dreams, one's senses can be fulfilled.  &lt;br/&gt;As the dream world is granted with life, it becomes real, it exists as its own reality.  &lt;br/&gt;To dream is to be intoxicated, to travel to a place where imagination roams free and where logic fails.  The dreamer feels at home while the sensible thinker is at loss.  Rules are unexistant in this new realm.  A host of emotions replace the laws of reason.  For a dream without emotions is but an empty shell, no matter how beautiful it is.  When we dream for ourselves, there is no need for harsh realism.  &lt;br/&gt;But to share a dream with others, to make an account of it, we have no choice but to relate only what is essential, despite ourselves.  &lt;br/&gt;A dream must not be understood or felt by another, it must be dreamt: the spectator must become the dreamer.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Inside Front Cover, Mechanical Side&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical Aspect&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mechanisms are often perceived as cold and necessary elements.  Still, they exert fascination upon the curious mind.  The gears and working parts of reason struggle to understand their surroundings: the intellect awakens.  &lt;br/&gt;Mechanisms act as the bone structure of meaning.  In the absence of meaning, one must create it: a mechanism, in the pragmatic mind, is just a tool.  In the inquisitive mind, wonders occur as the mechanism comes to life, providing the spirit with great wellbeing.  &lt;br/&gt;How joyous to understand, to marvel before its working, how satisfying the find after such labor! Such gratification is only possible through mechanic: dreams are too permissive.&lt;br/&gt;The source of this mechanical poetry lies in the effort of its motion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
