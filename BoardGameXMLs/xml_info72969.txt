			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elements of Magic is a rules module designed to replace the &amp;quot;fire and forget&amp;quot; spell system of the d20 Core Rules. The d20 spell system, while balanced and usable, is not flexible enough to model the magic users from most fantasy books and movies. Few wizards have ever memorized or prepared a spell, and even fewer forget them immediately afterwards. In the Elements of Magic, each character has only a single spellcasting level, no matter how many types of magic she learns in her career. The Elements of Magic gives characters many times the options of the standard d20 rules. Individual spells are replaced by spell lists. Instead of learning a fireball spell, for example, a mage could learn the Evoke Area Fire spell list, which is very flexible as to its usage and appearance. Nor is the mage limited to fire evocations ? with 20 elements to choose from, she could learn Evoke Area Ice or Lightning, or an even more exotic spell list, such as Imbue Creature with Lava or Shadow. It would take thousands of standard spells to duplicate the effects of the spell lists in this 100 page book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
