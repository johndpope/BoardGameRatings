			<description>Giocagoal was a game manufactured by Atlantic, a firm very well known in Italy during the first half of the 70's for their wide range of 1:72 and 1:32 scale soldiers, tanks, dioramas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occasionally they did something out of the military range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GiocaGoal was a simple simulation of a football game, much smaller and cheaper than Subbuteo. It was sold in boxes that contained just half of the pitch, balls, a complete team, coach, bench, referee and a goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic figures were made by a round and hollow flat base into which the actual figure (different poses according to their role) had to be pressed in. Colours represented teams of the Italian Serie A of the time, so you could buy your favourite team. To play you needed at least two boxes in order to form the complete playing area. The figures were flicked more or less as in Subbuteo. The most used ball was a semi-spheric one, because the round one was too difficult to control properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't remember if there was a set of rules in the box or if we just made our own&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few months later, at the end of 1973, Atlantic published the Super GiocaGoal. Same players, but a larger pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
