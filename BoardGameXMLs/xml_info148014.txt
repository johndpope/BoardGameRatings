							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Study</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Study is a 16 x 20 inch, full color floorplan of a study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product features a small alchemist or magician&amp;rsquo;s study room. Everything a magician or alchemist could want to study potions, magical items, or even brew small batches of alcohol is included. Perfect for magicians seriously interested in study, or who want to relax from their studies for a bit, or both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters can use this product in several ways. It makes a great alchemical lab if a Player Character obtains one in game or as an add-on room for a magician for a Player Character&amp;rsquo;s base of operations. It is an excellent place for the adventurers to meet and greet with a magician or alchemical patron interested in their services or as magician&amp;rsquo;s or alchemist&amp;rsquo;s shop they are visiting to buy potions and magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, it makes for an excellent backdrop for the final battle against a wizard or alchemist nemesis with all his potions, scrolls, and magic available to him at hand making him a serious threat to the Player Characters.  Especially since he knows what the potions and scrolls can do and the Player Characters do not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
