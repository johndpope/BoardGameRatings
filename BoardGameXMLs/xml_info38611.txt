							<name  sortindex="1">Punic Wars: Battle of Cannae (216 BC)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;In the year 216 BC the Second Punic War had become a stalemate. The Romans could not defeat Hannibal's Carthaginian army in the field, and Hannibal could not capture Rome.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Growing impatient, Rome raised a large army and set them under the command of Caius Varro to battle Hannibal. The result was one of the most devastating defeats ever inflicted on an army. Varro was determined that his army would not be outflanked and defeated by Hannibal, as happened at the battle of Trebbia. But Hannibal was one of the greatest generals in military history, and that's exactly what happened. The Romans were encircled and massacred.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt; A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Units portrayed in the game include Commanders, Infantry, Cavalry, and Skirmishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
