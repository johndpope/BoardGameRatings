							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zone</name>
									
			<description>You are the commander of a small squad of tanks. Your tank, marked by a unique color, carries a special payload that must be fired from &amp;quot;The Zone&amp;quot; to disable the enemies communications base. Reach The Zone with your commander, and you win. Capture the enemy commander, and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how do you do it? To reach The Zone, you must navigate the terrain and capture or circumvent enemy tanks. To capture a tank, move your tank into the space it occupies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each space on the board features one of four types of terrain, either dirt, grass, hill, or mud. Each space gives you a different combination of attack and movement range when you move from that space. You can get stuck in the mud with a movement of zero, or blast down a hill with a movement of 2! Your attack range is consistently 1, except for when you have the high vantage point of the hill space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has the feel of a classic strategy game like Othello or Stratego. It's very simple to learn but hard to master. Understanding the terrain and effectively positioning your forces will be the key to your success. Pretty simple, right? Then get moving, Commander!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
