			<description>From the expert designer of fast-play statistical sports games. This one features ice hockey teams and leagues. 20 years of statistics are used, from the early 90's back to the 70's. The intention is to let you play a whole season in an evening or, at the very least, all your favourite team's matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice determine outcomes after rolls are compared to the various charts provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
