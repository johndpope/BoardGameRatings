			<description>Try your skills and match wits with your opponents in this legal fantasia. Have you ever wanted to be an attorney? Now you can be! This game is designed to give you that opportunity. You are the Plaintiff's Attorney -- You are the Plaintiff -- You are the Defendant -- You are the Defense Attorney.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card game in which player's try to build up a successful lawsuit. Players add damage cards to increase the value of their own lawsuit, while playing blocking cards on opponents to contest their suits and reduce the damage award. Each round of play ends when a verdict card is played, and players are awarded the value of their lawsuit at that time. The game ends after the round in which any player's winnings exceed $100,000. The winner is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
