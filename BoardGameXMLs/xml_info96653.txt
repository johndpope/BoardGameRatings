							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">108th Kentucky Derby</name>
									
			<description>A simulation of re-racing the 108th Kentucky Derby. Cards for all 32 horses that were eligible are included. Unusually, this seems to have been published before the real race was run, so the designer suggests that you could run the race more accurately after the horses are entered in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is by rolling dice and then looking at a chart on the back of each horse's card. On the back of the card, each horse has a set of target numbers for each quarter of the track. Dice are rolled and if you roll one of those numbers, the horse advances. If you don't, the horse doesn't move. Eight(8) horses are in each race, the players divide up the 8 horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As 32 horses are provided and only 8 run, you can play a series of 4 races, to use every horse once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
