							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Land of Confusion Volume 2: The Battle for Luneburg Heath</name>
									
			<description>If the &amp;ldquo;balloon had gone up&amp;rdquo; in Cold War Europe during the 1980s an offensive by the Warsaw Pact and Soviet forces across the North German Plain in West Germany would occur. The central sector of the NATO front here was held by the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) supported by West German forces.  The terrain along the frontier with East Germany was dominated by the Luneberg Heath, an area marked by swamps, rivers and forested terrain that favored the defenders. Once through here, however, the terrain opened up to flat land that stretched to the Dutch and Belgian borders. A breakthrough here by the Communist forces would also certainly lead to a collapse of any NATO defense of West Germany, and a likely defeat by the forces of the Free World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts? Learn and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Land of Confusion volume 2: The Battle for Luneburg Heath is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Two (one east, one west) 11 by 17 inch map sections.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    112 un-mounted, double sided units.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One Players&amp;rsquo; Aid Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Eight pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
