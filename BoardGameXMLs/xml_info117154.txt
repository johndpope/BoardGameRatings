							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dora the Explorer: Journey to the Purple Planet</name>
									
			<description>Dora the Explorer video games are designed for preschoolers based on the 2000 Nick Jr. television show Dora the Explorer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dora the Explorer: Journey to the Purple Planet is about Dora and Boots who finds some lost aliens from the purple planet. However, to take them home, she and Boots are required to collect keys to open the space gate, leading to the Saturn planet. The game is unique in that it uses pictures and symbols to communicate rather than words. The object of the game is to capture one of the six explorer stars. Each explorer star has a special power such as the ability to be noisy or the ability to create music. In order to capture the star, the player must complete a hide-and-seek activity. These activities include maze navigation, matching games, side-scrolling race games, a &amp;quot;Frogger&amp;quot;-type game, a complete-the-pattern activity and a song playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dora the Explorer: Journey to the Purple Planet&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
