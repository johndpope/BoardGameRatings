			<description>Star Trek The Next Generation The Final Frontier Action Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ferengi are up to their capitalist ways again. They have overrun the engineering room and are going after the energy matter/anti-matter reaction chamber. They are trying to steal the dilithium crystals to sell on the open market. These crystals are the energy system on the U.S.S. Enterprise. They would secure at least 5000 bars of gold pressed latinum for the Ferengi, and would turn the Starship Enterprise incapable of warp travel. Your mission is to defend the engineering room against the Ferengi and not let them get away with any of the crystals. Your mission is clear...Engage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get your scoops ready to catch the Ferengi as they leave the five Jefferies tube openings, as the phasers are pulled from the matter/anti-matter reaction chamber. Catch a Ferengi and get a piece of your Starship Enterprise. Catch the dilithium crystal by mistake and you loos a piece of your U.S.S. Enterprise. Be first to complete your scoring disk and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
