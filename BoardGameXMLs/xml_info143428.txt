			<description>Documentation accompanying program listing in SoftSide Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is no longer necessary to sit in front of your TV screen on weekends and drool over the pro golfers' pars and birdies. Now you can face the same challenge on your TRS with PROTOUR 80. And with a lot of practice and a little skill you can become a scratch golfer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This links-simulation will generate a different random nine hole course each time you play. Your ball and the tee will be displayed on the left of the screen; and the fairway and green will be constructed towards the right. Each player, in turn, will hit from the tee to the green. After everyone has reached the green, each player will putt out. At the completion of every hole a current scorecard will be displayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accuracy and club selection is very important when you are shooting for the green. If your ball wanders off the fairway or into the sandtrap -- you can expect an erratic second shot. And if you are wild enough to hit the ball off the screen, you will be penalized one stroke and distance; so you will need to hit the ball from your original location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As all golfers know, most rounds are won or lost on the putting green. PROTOUR 80 is no exception. You will find the contour greens more challenging. The green representation will be unique for every player since you are shooting at the cup from different angles. To putt, you need only enter the distance of your shot. In addition to the straight line distance, you'll also have to take into account the contour of the green. A ball going down hill, for instance, will speed up which means that it needs a shorter distance entered as compared to an equivalent level putt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
