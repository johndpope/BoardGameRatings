							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skyfire Tree</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each release for Crawthorne's Catalog of Creatures for the Pathfinder RPG presents a single, new creature for your Pathfinder RPG game, as presented by the famous and retired monster hunter and adventurer, Lord Crawthorne. Each release presents game stats for the new creature, as well as three adventure ideas to help insert them into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may think the most dangerous attack the Skyfire Tree possesses is its bite, based on its massive, sharp teeth filled maw. You would be wrong. A skyfire tree is not only capable of unleashing a deadly electrical blast, but also stealing a victim's thoughts for the purpose of enhancing its own sense of identity. Although not inherently evil, these plant creatures are self-serving and dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
