			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;While it may be a truth universally acknowledged&amp;quot; in Regency England &amp;quot;that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&amp;quot; (for Jane Austen said so, and it must be true), it is also true that the world contained in Jane's books are not all that there is to know of Regency England. In fact, there is a world there that not many are aware of. In parallel with the world that most humans know, there is another world, hidden from the sight of most. Some might call it fey, or fae, and there are many tales in mythology and literature talking of the fae, Oberon, Titania, and things much darker, and sinister. But, since such things cannot be a reality, they were assigned to history as myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are real, however. More real that you can know, and imagine, and once not so long ago, in the world that Jane Austen created, our world, and the world of nightmares and fantastic imaginings collided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is that story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
