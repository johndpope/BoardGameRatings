			<description>Guide the wife of the central character in the original Twisted Lands as she attempts to escape the mental hospital in which she's imprisoned. Twisted Lands: Insomnia offers an unforgettable journey down the sometimes warped paths of the human mind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twisted Lands saga continues in the gripping sequel to the best-selling Twisted Lands: Shadow Town! Steeped in psychological horror, Twisted Lands: Insomnia follows Angel, the wife of the central character in the original game, as she attempts to escape the mental hospital in which she's imprisoned. Players will explore the fragile boundary between what's real and what the mind perceives as they guide Angel on her mystifying quest to remember who she is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players navigate an artfully rendered mansion, a decaying lighthouse, and the ominous corridors of the hospital, a rich and disturbing back-story will emerge that answers questions the first game raised and leads players to a conclusion even more shocking than Shadow Town's. With its well-hidden items, clever puzzles and cunning mini-games, Twisted Lands: Insomnia offers an unforgettable journey down the sometimes warped paths of the human mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
