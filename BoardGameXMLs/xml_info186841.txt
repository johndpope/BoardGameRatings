							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anarcade Deck Building Game: Vector Blue</name>
									
			<description>Travel back to when the arcade was a dark, smoky den of iniquity.  Fame and respect can be bought for only a quarter if you have the skill.  Once you fill up the high score table on a game then you are the king!  Put a quarter on the glass and challenge the champ if you think you've got what it takes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anarcade is a deck building game of stack control. Players play starter cards to earn Coins and buy better cards from the Game stacks. They can also use Coins to Score on the Games. Each player attempts to fill up a High Score table to take control of that game before an opponent can do the same. Once a player takes control of a stack, other players can't touch it. The winner is the first player to control 3 games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vector Blue set is tuned for deep strategy and features vector based retro arcade goodness! Combine with any other Anarcade set to expand the game to up to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
