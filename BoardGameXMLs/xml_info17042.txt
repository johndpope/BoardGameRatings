			<description>This is the original version of Doctor Faust. It is themed as a Schnitzel hunt, or 'paper-chase' around an oval track. The animals chase after a wooden 'fox and cooking pot' piece. Each turn you have 7 points to use for placing a card, moving the fox and moving one of your own two pieces. Cards are placed face down next to the track and another player landing on one must end his turn, reveal the card and move the indicated number of spaces (1,3,5,7 or 9 spaces back, 2,4,6 or 8 spaces forward). &lt;br/&gt;If the fox reaches any player's piece or a player moves his piece up to the fox, a score card is taken. One is also taken each time the fox is moved over one of the two 'fox' spaces on the track. The game ends when the last score card is taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
