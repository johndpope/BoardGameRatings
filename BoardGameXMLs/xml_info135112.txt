			<description>The gameboard has a spiral printed on it. Each player has 2 pawns. One gets a (black) hat on and starts from the inside out. One is unhatted and starts from the outside in. Movement is by a D6. Some places on the board have an arrow them and the playing piece on them is &amp;quot;sucked&amp;quot; to where the arrow points (which is good or bad depending on the intended direction of movement). Players have their choices which pawn to move. The player first succeeding to move each of his/her pawns to the opposide part of the spiral wins.&lt;br/&gt;Additional rules involve the hats - on rolling a 1 a player can remove the hat of another players pawn and place the hat on the spirals inside, the player must go back to retrieve it. When another player has both of his playing pieces started on the board the hats can be swapped, so the pawns must change their movement direction. On a 6 a player takes possession of the neutral black pawn. This possession protects him/her from attacks on his/her hats. When a player gets on a spiral piece where another colours pawn is located the other colour must go back to the inside or outside of the spiral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: game board, die, 8 playing pieces, 5 hats, one neutral black playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
