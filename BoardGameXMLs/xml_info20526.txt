							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monte Carlo</name>
									
			<description>Monte Carlo is one of the most popular forms of Solitaire with a deck of regular playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: one deck (52 cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation: Deal 25 cards into five rows of 5 cards each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To discard all the cards in pairs of the same rank (eg pairs of &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play: &lt;br/&gt;1. Select and discard pairs of cards of the same rank.  Both cards of the pair should be adjacent in a row, a diagonal, or a column.  &lt;br/&gt;2. After discarding all possible pairs, move the remaining cards from right to left and from bottom to top to fill the empty spaces. &lt;br/&gt;3. Deal additional cards from the stock pile to bring the number of cards back to 25. &lt;br/&gt;4. Repeat until no possible pairs can be matched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The amount of cards remaining counts as your minus score.  The game is won if the entire deck is discarded by pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
