			<description>Quirkies is a fast-paced game that mixes art, visual perception and reasoning skills. Players stack matching creature cards in order to create sequences and win Quirkies tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to the left of the dealer goes first and places one card from their hand onto the matching creature on the Quirkies Board Card. As long as the creature type matches, the card may have any color and any pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player succeeds in creating a winning sequence, they may collect a token of their choice and must then play one more card from their hand. Their turn ends after they played that second card, even if they manage to create another winning sequence.&lt;br/&gt;After placing their card(s), the player replenishes their hand back to 6 cards and the turn moves clockwise to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
