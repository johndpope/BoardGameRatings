							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mahou Shojo: Fight Like a Girl!</name>
									
			<description>Mahou Sh≈çjo, meaning Magical Girl, is a turn-based paper card game based off the anime genre with the same name. Two players face off against each other in sparkling combat in order to defeat the other and capture their gems so that their rival cannot transform. Decks span from a number of themes including Nightmares, Daydreams, Sweets, Flowers, the Constellations, and even in the Internet. Playtime is under 20 minutes, which is more than enough time to show your rivals what true (sparkling) pain is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is score three of your rival's gems. Gems are gained when a RIval's Magical Girl's HP reaches zero. To do this, players using a series of spells and abilities (and sometimes a little roleplaying) must engage in battle. As battle is happening, Magical Girls have a limited supply of magic they are able to use. If their magic is drained to zero before their hit points are, they are safe from being defeated. Some Magical Girls will be able to become Grand Magical Girls, which are very powerful for only a short amount of time. The game ends to be short but action packed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
