			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level One: Temple of the Locust Cult is a DCC-Compatible module designed for 1st level heroes. This module is designed to be played in any campaign setting with a mountain containing a megadungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original module by Mark Gedak, DCC conversion/update by Daniel J. Bishop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first level of Purple Mountain is the current home to a cult of the Locust Lord, a demonic entity dedicated to vermin, chasms, and infestations. Twenty years ago, the wizard Iraksed came to the Purple Mountain to discover secrets of transformation into an immortal invertebrate form. His destructive tendencies and ability to manipulate the manamites present in the first level of Purple Mountain earned him the grace of the Locust Lord and Iraksed began the painful process of shedding his mortal form into his current squirming one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently Iraksed and his manamite followers have grown in power and potential for destruction. The manamites have captured and trained a number of vermin, including a throach. The throach, known to the manamites as the Instrument of the Locust Lord, has the ability to implant hosts with its verminous offspring. These offspring eventually tear themselves free of their host. The manamites love both the birth of throach grubs from within the bodies of other sentient races and the screams of their hosts as the larval throach burst free. To supply the throach with a constant supply of hosts, the manamites occasionally venture out of Purple Mountain to capture travellers or nearby villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Purple Mountain series is designed to be the classic megadungeon in every way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
