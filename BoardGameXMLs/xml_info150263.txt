The strange serial killings have rocked the small town bringing a media circus with them. The player characters are playing agents sent to solve the high profile case and take over for the overwhelmed local police force. They search the crime scenes, interview relatives, and try and find a link between the murders. Eventually, the group discovers that everyone murdered so far once worked at an asylum that was closed about twenty years ago. They find a list of people who work at the asylum and discover that only one person who worked at the asylum is left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They rush to the scene, finding evidence of a struggle, but no victim. A car races off into the night and the agents scramble to their vehicles to chase them, leading to the killer&amp;rsquo;s house. The ex-asylum patient runs with the victim to his surgery room. The patient tries to strap down the survivor, use a bone saw to cut their skull open, and remove the brain screaming, &amp;ldquo;You examined my mind for so long, it is high time that I got to see yours!&amp;rdquo; If successful, he places it into a jar of formaldehyde before sealing it. If interrupted by the agents, he uses his bone saw and other surgical tools to cut them apart. After defeating the serial killer, the agents discover that the room has multiple brains in formaldehyde filled jars, one for each of the victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surgical Complications: One of the party members may have lost an arm or leg in a recent firefight and now needs a replacement. A local chop-doc offers cheap biological and mechanical body part replacements. They find the chop-doc through a contact of the party. The group goes to the surgery room and they find it to be a dirty place, but the chop-doc is offering the lowest prices in town&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the leader of a local group of thugs has been hunting this chop-doc for a while, having a seemingly good replacement put in that started malfunctioning a few weeks later. The faulty arm erupted with weapon fire, killing several of his men before they were forced to chop his arm off for their own safety. He wants the chop-doc dead and has sent his thugs to kill him after finding out where his surgery room is located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group finds themselves suddenly under attack from outside through the two southern windows. The chop-doc tells the rest of the group that the surgery won&amp;rsquo;t be completed unless they can buy him some time against the thugs. The chop-doc fixes the arm of the party member while the rest have to hold them off. Thugs also attempt to assault the main door, bringing wicked, rusted machetes with them hoping to exact a special kind of vengeance on the doc. When the surgery is completed, the group needs to finish off the thugs and escape since the cops are sure to be on their way by now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
