			<description>Wiekslag is a abstract tactical game for two till five players. The goal is to place three pawns in a straight row, a so called wiekslag. If a player makes a wiekslag, he may remove one pawn from his opponent. If played with three or more players there are two variants: making a wiekslag (1) you may remove one pawn from one opponent or (2) you may remove one pawn from all other players. The ultimate goal is to stay as the last player on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players start turnbased placing pawns on the board. After all pawns are placed, the players may move one pawn to an adjacent spot on their turn. When someone creates a wiekslag he removes one (or more) pawns permanently from the game. It's not allowed to remove pawns from an existing wiekslag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has only three pawns left, he is allowed to jump with his pawns to any free spot on the board. When a player with three pawns left, loses another pawn, he or she is elliminated from the game. The game ends when there is only one player left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
