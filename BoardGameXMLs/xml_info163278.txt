			<description>Walec Parowy 1914 (Steam Roller 1914) is a war board game, which was released in May 2014 by the Forum of Polish Malopolska Branch Historical Society project The Great War in Malopolska - memory and identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game provides two modes - for two or four players. In both cases, each player takes command of two armies or associations operating. It receives the relevant boards of the army and pools chips and card deck of cards generals of staff. For the game on the board influenced these cards staff, especially the generals who lead our armies into battle. At the beginning of the game we have such a scenario which determines - that is suitable for autumn 1914, during the game we can not change them. Generals have characteristics that affect the gameplay. The most important is an initiative of deciding on the order of execution of commands the army and orders, informing us how many orders we can spread the chips on the board. Cards and indicate how many cards of Staff tighten at the beginning of each turn. These factors can be modified by other cards of Staff, which assign the army (up to 3 cards), putting them on these boards army generals next card. In addition, staff can use the card in a different way - by playing them as an action during your turn or turn another player. The applied procedure allows us to influence the strength and mobility of the army, and thus develop their own, each time another strategy. Cards staff played as stocks allow us to accelerate the arrival of reinforcements such as on the board, or on the contrary force the opponent deploy the neighboring front of any of several units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of six or eight turns, and each of the four phases. The first three are played simultaneously by all players. In the preparation phase we select the appropriate number of cards, we draw card of weather, check supplies, we join the army staff card or change the generals at their stations. In the phase of aviation spread the chips on the board planes that make us the third phase. This is the instruction phase, in which we place our units orders - march, spread, defend, retreat, reorganization, support, or crossing. If the field with our units appeared aircraft orders, we must spread face up - in a transparent manner. It was not until the fourth and final phase of motion play as an initiative of the cards generals - from highest to lowest. We then move orders or spread. If you meet the armies opposing players battle occurs. This is to be decided on the basis of the points of strength and modifiers. The final outcome of the battle can affect tightens card battle. Emotions provide the card with the arrow symbol - they require tightening next card, the count of all modifiers. Thanks to the great happiness we can overcome the enemy an advantage of more mesh than allowed by the cube d6. After all, is not familiar with such episodes of military history. In contrast to the loss of power affects individuals involved in the battle - of course, bears attacking them proportionally more. All the time, we can also use the cards of Staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player (or the site in the case of 4-seater variant), which scores more points wins. Most gain for controlling individual identified in the scenario, cities. The Russian side can further plunder the fields of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary - action is causing the loss of points by Austria. Extra points goes to sometimes get as a result of the great victories or destruction of the enemy army staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
