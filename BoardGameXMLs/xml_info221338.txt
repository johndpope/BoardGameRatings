			<description>Bob Was Hungry is a challenging precision platformer with many levels designed to truly test your platforming skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bobs have been scouring the universe for food for millions of years. For the most part, food had been plentiful and easy to acquire&amp;hellip;planets made entirely of cheese were abundant, and finding one could leave a bob full for a lifetime. However, time has passed, and food has become scarce. Greedy bobs so carelessly ate two or three cheese planets at a time, and now cheese planets are as rare to find as a bob with a full stomach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bobs unable to stumble upon one of the last extremely rare cheese-havens were forced out into the unknown. Now they traverse as many planets as they can in hopes of finding a scrap of food to survive. Unfortunately, their trips are dangerous, and the planets are treacherous. Finding food is not like it used to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as one of these bobs, and it is up to you to find the meal that will finally satisfy your bob&amp;rsquo;s insatiable appetite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play alone, or play online with up to 8-player coop in four frantic multiplayer modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-op: Play with your friends and help one another make it to the end!
