			<description>A traditional trick-taking card game. Each player receives 5 cards. Beginning on dealer's left, each player has one chance to bid for the number of tricks they think they can win, or passes. The winner indicates trumps with the first card led, with standard trick-taking rules thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is 1 pt per trick bid, but a bid of all 5 tricks will be one of (in order):&lt;br/&gt;- Nap (gain 10 points for a win / lose 5 points if you fail)&lt;br/&gt;- Wellington (10 / 10)&lt;br/&gt;- Blucher (10 / 20)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
