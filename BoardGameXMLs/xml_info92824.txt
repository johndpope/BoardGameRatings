			<description>This is a promotional game from Northwest Orient Airlines that his very much like Yahtzee.  The player has three attempts to roll ten dice.  On each attempt they may choose to keep as many dice as they like and only re-roll the rest.  Scoring is done by checking to see where your best poker hand lies.  A player loses a certain amount of points depending on which poker hands they were not able to get after five rounds.  The person with the score closest to zero wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
