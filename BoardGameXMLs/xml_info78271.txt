			<description>User note: Bridge It REQUIRES an NVidia video card to run!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stunning, beautiful world awaits as you take on the challenge of bridging the chasm. Can you solve the puzzles and avert disaster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the picturesque surroundings of sparse deserts and dense forests it is your task to strategically design and construct an engineering masterpiece. Watch in eager anticipation as unsuspecting motorists, heavy freight trains and tourist riverboats approach. Will your solution stand up to the test or will tons of mangled steel be sent plummeting into the river below?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridge It shows off the very latest in cinematic gaming. Based on Chronic Logic's award winning Bridge Construction Set (Pontifex II) and using the Auran Jet 3D engine running on NVIDIA's latest GeForceFX hardware it offers a host of real time effects that surpass many pre-rendered scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
