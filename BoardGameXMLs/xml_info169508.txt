			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You might look like a human, but you are something much, much more, though neither you nor anyone else is quite sure what. Your body burns with a mysterious power, a power that lets you shine as brightly as the sun itself, soar through the sky, and melt through steel with your bare hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some might mistake you for a mere wizard, but you need no books, words, or instruments to draw forth light or fire from within. Others believe that you&amp;rsquo;re an angel, but you&amp;rsquo;re not beholden to the gods: they do not speak to you, and if you act in accordance with their goals it is merely because your desires happen to coincide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the raw power of the stars given earthly form and agency: go forth and show the world what you&amp;rsquo;re made of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    One is a digest-sized, 14-page book laid out like the Dungeon World book. It contains the living star and a behind the scenes look at our design, some expanded explanation of the fiction behind some of the moves, and a few new moves that we couldn't fit on the sheet.&lt;br/&gt;    The other is a 2-page, letter-sized character sheet with custom graphics for you to print out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
