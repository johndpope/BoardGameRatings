							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realm of Empires: Warlords Rising</name>
									
			<description>Guide your fledgling dominion from its beginnings as a single, small village to a massive sprawling empire. Order your peasants to construct new buildings. Grow your village into a town. Research innovations, and recruit the troops you need to defend yourself &amp;ndash; or to go on the attack.&lt;br/&gt;Surrounding your lands are other players seeking to do the same. You can befriend them, form alliances and clans, and work together to strengthen your hold on a hostile landscape. Or you can crush the fools for being in your way &amp;ndash; by word or by sword, the realm is yours to conquer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
