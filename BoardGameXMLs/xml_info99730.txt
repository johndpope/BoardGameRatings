							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Church of Man Ascendant</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tragedy at Waco, Texas, heralded a decade of apocalypse cults. Heaven's Gate and Aum Shinri Kyo grabbed headlines through murder or suicide, but few remember the victimized children of the Church of Man Ascendant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a few months before Waco, in December of 1992, a member of the congregation turned themselves in to Arizona police. Her name was Kelly Cane and she claimed to have killed her own children. Her hands were still covered in their blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The county sheriff opened an investigation and, less than 48 hours later, a SWAT team was storming the Church's rural compound. Most of the congregation barricaded themselves inside the chapel and commited suicide. Their leader, Doctor Thaddeus Baptiste, hanged himself above the altar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children were found in cages, strapped to their beds, or under heavy sedation. An 11 year old boy attacked and killed two SWAT officers before he could be retrained. All exhibited clear signs of mental and physical abuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three surviving adults were arrested. All were convicted and sentenced to terms of at least twenty years. Kelly Cane was found innocent by reason of insanity and commited to an institution. She claims there are two members who escaped capture, but her information is not considered reliable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The children received treatment for their injuries and were placed in foster homes. Their records have been sealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
