							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classes of Starship Destruction</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being part of a starship crew isn't the same as being a generic space traveler. It requires the ability to be flexible, work well as part of a team, manage limited resources and remain calm in the face of unexpected threats. While it is certainly possible for characters to earn spots on a starship crew with more generic class selections, the unique brand of mavericks that master the jobs of a starship crew need their own advanced classes. The six starship crew classes; Commander, Engineering Officer, Helm/Navigation Officer, Medical Officer, Security Officer and Science/Systems Officer; presented are designed to be generic enough to fit any star-going campaign, but remain focused on the skills and abilities of a dedicated starship crew. This 12 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great futuristic d20 Modern campaign including Polymecha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
