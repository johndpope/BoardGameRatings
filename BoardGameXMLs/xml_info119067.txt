							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grinch</name>
									
			<description>The Grinch is a video game based on the film Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The game was released shortly after the film hit theaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the top of Mt. Crumpit, his eye pressed to the telescope, the Grinch observes Whoville. He mumbles something that his dog Max hardly perceives: &amp;quot;I've got it! I have a great idea! This year, the Whos will pay!&amp;quot; The Grinch just despises Christmas and this year, he wants it to end. &amp;quot;That, in fact, is the misanthrope scheme. Build gadgets from blueprints. Halt the holiday theme&amp;quot;. He enters into his spacious cave to decide which of his gadgets he should build first. The Grinch the blueprints include such inventions as the Rotten Egg Launcher, Slime Shooter, Binoculars, Octopus Climbing Device, Rocket Spring, Grinch Copter, and Marine Mobile. He then makes a decision, but before he can get to his gadget, he slips on one of his boxes, resulting in his blueprints getting blown out of his cave. But the Grinch doesn't let this debacle stop him. He takes out his notebook and makes a few schemes that's sure to ruin the fun for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;Or so he thinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Grinch (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
