							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ceville</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;One minute Ceville is a tyrannical despot ruling over the kingdome of Faeryanis, and the next he's a prisoner in his own jail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All's well that end's well? Not likely! The hideously evil Basilius has deep, dark plans for Faeryanis, and he's already got the spells ready to summon demons to help him with his reign of terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ceville and Lilly travel the length and breadth of the kingdom in their efforts to stop the dastardly plan, with the support of an unbelievably vain knight named Ambrosius - but things soon turn out to be a lot tougher than they seemed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wild and wacky adventure in the style of Monkey Island and Shrek!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
