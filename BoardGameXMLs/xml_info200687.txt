			<description>Pants Up!&lt;br/&gt;Who will be the first to fully dress his or her character from top to bottom?&lt;br/&gt;Pants Up! A cheeky card game for the whole family!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start off the game with a butt naked character. The goal is to be the first one to dress your character, starting with the pants and then by stacking 5 different types of clothing of the same season.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each turn, players will draw - from the clean laundry pile - clothes cards, joker cards to help them, attack cards to slow down the other players, or event cards to wreak havoc&amp;hellip; before discarding one card and putting it on the dirty laundry pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first one dressed all the way from the pants to the hat wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 108 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
