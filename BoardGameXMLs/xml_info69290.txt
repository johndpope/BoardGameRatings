			<description>A game of claustrophobic terror and survival in a hostile environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an underground military base, experiments are done in order to create a new biological weapon. Mutations of dangerous infectious agents and other threats are kept there.&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly an accident occurs in a laboratory, releasing a lethal virus all over the place. Some of the first victims already suffer the effects of the new disease, and rise up from the dead, returning to life as zombies hungry for human flesh.&lt;br/&gt;Some survivors still resist the virus, but their time is short. At any time, they can become a feast for the undead, or succumb to the disease and increase the horde of brain-eaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are in the role of some of these survivors, and should explore the site facing the zombies, find the experimental cure and escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare, load your weapons and run! There is only one way out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A summary of the gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters start at the central sector of the board, that is already revealed. The goal is to find the antidote and escape through the hatch in the center of the board. To do this, the players must spend action points to do actions like walk, fight and search.&lt;br/&gt;When a character enters in a unrevealed room, he must take one tile from the pile, and place it adjacent to the room he is coming from, connecting the doors. Then he rolls the encounter dice, that shows if he met zombies, items or nothing.&lt;br/&gt;The fight is conducted by the range and the requirements that each weapon has to kill or hurt the zombies. Then the player rolls a dice and see if the result satisfies those requirements. He can spend action points to add to the result.&lt;br/&gt;The items are managed in the inventory, that shows how many items the character can carry.&lt;br/&gt;When the player choose to search, he takes a card from the correspondent sector pile. It can be items, good or bad events, weapons or the antidote.&lt;br/&gt;When a player finishes his move, then the next player plays with the zombies on the board. He can move and attack with all zombies.&lt;br/&gt;After that, the same player now plays with his human character, an it goes on. When the round is complete, move the players' infection marker. If someone passes the last&lt;br/&gt;mark, he becomes a zombie.&lt;br/&gt;There are some details in the rules about spending action points, fighting, events and items.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to find the cure and get back to the hatch is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
