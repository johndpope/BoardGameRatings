			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HYPeR was intended to be a generic, universal role-playing system that would support magic, super powers, psionics, and high technology.  The author contemplated eight modules but produced only Module A: Basic Rules.  Module A was accompanied by a Character Sheet and a Damage Log.  Module A provides sufficient basic rules to play in any genre as long as the various genre-specific elements are provided by the user.  The rules follow a rigorous format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All tasks are attempted against a Difficult Level ranging from -30 to 100 (15 is an &amp;quot;average task&amp;quot;); the game is played at a Technical Level ranging from 0 to 20 (11 is &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot;).  These are standard for the entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation begins with a concept and demographics, then the selection of a Profession (e.g., class) and the purhcase of Attributes, of which there are ten, from a points pool.  The Awareness Attribute is sub-divided into the five senses with individual scores in each.  Characters also have thirty-three derived attributes, most of which related to combat.  A character's Profession grants access to Skills which have several different types of scores, the basic performance level is purchased from a point pool.  Numerous Skills relate to combat.  Combat is quite complex and supports a wide range of options and supports numerous special situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
