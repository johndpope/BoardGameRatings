							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le jeu des familles Gargouille en bandes dessin√©es</name>
									
			<description>This card game is based on the popular Quebec French-language comic &amp;quot;Gargouille.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to collect the largest number of families (each family is composed of four cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 32 cards are shuffled and distributed as evenly as possible between all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player picks a card in his hand, and asks any opponent if they have a card in the same family. When requesting a card from an opponent, players must specify both the family name and the number of the card. For example, a player might request the third card from the &amp;eacute;clairs family (the &amp;eacute;clairs with three symbols on it). If the opponent has that card, they must give it to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As long as the player gets the cards they asks for, they can continue. For each new card, they request a card from the opponent of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, if the player does not get the requested card, their turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opponent who did not have the requested card becomes the new active player. Play continues until all families have been assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a two player game:&lt;br/&gt;Distribute 10 cards to each player. The remaining cards constitute a stack on the table. If your opponent does not have the card you want, you draw a card from the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
