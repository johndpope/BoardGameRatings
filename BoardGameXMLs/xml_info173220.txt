			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I let this adventure rip a little more than the others. This one is longer in content and not restricted to the one-page format. This allowed me to use a bigger font and add a little more detailed content. This is a low level adventure with a minor artifact at the end. While it is powerful it could easily kill the players. Enjoy the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small mining operation has not picked up their supplies for the past two weeks. The mining operation consists of three individuals; Ted, a human with buck teeth; Chuck, a halfling who owes people money; and Burg, a dwarf who has an endless supply of dirty jokes. Yesterday, Burg was seen running through the fields naked, screaming. A few hours later he was seen running through the fields again. Still naked. Still screaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
