			<description>Despite what the name indicates this Swedish game is a draw-and-guess game. The game consists of a number of cards with words or phrases on them in different categories. The players take turn trying to make a fast sketch illustrating one of the words on a card. All the other participants try to guess and points ar distributed if you guess correct and to the sketching player if someone manages to guess right. You only count the points, there are no pieces on a board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is in many ways similar to Pictionary but without a game board and not played in teams. The categories are (translated from Swedish):&lt;br/&gt;Objects&lt;br/&gt;Verbs&lt;br/&gt;Abstract terms&lt;br/&gt;Names oc Titles&lt;br/&gt;Technical terms&lt;br/&gt;Proverbs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
