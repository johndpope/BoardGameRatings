							<name  sortindex="1">Moscow &#039;41</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Campaigns: Moscow &#039;41</name>
									
			<description>Moscow '41 features the familiar Panzer Campaigns interface and game scale where 1 hex represents 1 km and a 2-hour game turn. The map area encompasses over 150,000 hexes (438 x 385), which is larger than the Kursk Map by almost 1/3rd.  The area covers from 15km north of Kalinin in the north to 80 km south of Tula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 Scenarios are included covering both Fall and Winter fighting with two major Campaign Periods&lt;br/&gt;- 2 Oct until the on set of the muddy weather brought the offensive to a halt.&lt;br/&gt;- 15 Nov until the drive ended on the outskirts of Moscow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign scenarios are included for both time periods as well as smaller scenarios covering specific actions and what if situations. OOB &amp;amp; Scenario editors are included which allow players to customize the game to their desires. There&amp;rsquo;s no limit on the scenarios that can be created and the sub-map feature allows the main map to be &amp;ldquo;chopped&amp;rdquo; up into the specific size that best fits the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
