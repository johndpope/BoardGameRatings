							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coloration</name>
									
			<description>Coloration is played on a 17x17 grid of squares.  Some squares are marked with a circle in one of eight colors; these squares form diagonal lines crossing the board from corner to corner and side to side.  The board's central square is marked with a red diamond. The game includes 154 square tiles: 15 red, 25 orange, 35 yellow, 35 green, 25 blue, 15 violet, and 4 &amp;quot;stopper&amp;quot; tiles, which are half black and half color.  Racks are included for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are placed face down in a &amp;quot;pool.&amp;quot;  Each player draws seven tiles to make his &amp;quot;hand,&amp;quot; and will continuously draw again to maintain a hand of seven.  Players begin placing their tiles on the board, attempting to make &amp;quot;sequences&amp;quot; of colors.  The rules provide for a number of these, including a rainbow sequence, a hot spectrum sequence, a cold spectrum sequence, and more.  These sequences incorporate the existing colors of the board and are governed by still more rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different levels of points are scored for each sequence as players complete their turns.  Play continues until no more sequences are possible; the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
