			<description>This is the workspace for a new game, called &amp;quot;Time and Space,&amp;quot; a project organized by Scott Nicholson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to create a game publicly with the engagement of other BGG members.  Scott provides guidelines, and anyone can contribute parts to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game develops, voting is used to determine what stays in the game and what is removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will remain as a print-and-play game until the point that a publisher acquires it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Property Note: Any contributions made to the game become the property of Scott Nicholson.  Attribution will be made where appropriate. As long as the game is available in print-and-play, anyone will be able to print out and enjoy the game.  Once an agreement is made with a publisher, the print-and-play version may be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Note: This is also part of a research project, and we will be studying the process as it develops.  In any research reports, we will not use the actual user name or handles of any BGG user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
