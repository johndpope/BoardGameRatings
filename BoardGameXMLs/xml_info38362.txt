							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pele&#039;s Perils</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fun, educational game teaches about the Hawaiian culture and the hazards of living on a volcanic island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pictures and arrows show the way to go UP by sharing goodness with others, and the way to go DOWN because of the dangers of the volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player is lucky enough to meet Pele (peh-leh), the goddess of fire, she will uncover a secret passage through a lava tube to the top of the volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, you must be careful! If you get caught in the middle of a lava flow, you may need to be rescued by a helicopter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and mahalo (mah-hah-lo) (thank you) for spreading lots of aloha (ah-lo-hah) (love).&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach Pele (peh-leh) at FINISH is the Winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
