							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Middle Age Crazy</name>
									
			<description>A party game for 'middle age' people.  Questions are asked from one of four categories (work, money, health, an love).  The questions are usually of the 'what if' or 'which would you do' type, and often involve a moral dilemma.  All players secretly write how they would answer the question.  When the answers are all read, points are awarded for correctly guessing the writer.  Bonus points if you have actually experienced the situation in your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
