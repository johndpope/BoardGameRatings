			<description>Sa'vant appears to be a Code 777 or Headbanz light.  Players are dealt a card and without looking at it put it in the holder in front of them, where other players can see it.  Then the play moves clockwise in three &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; where players make guesses about their card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first &amp;quot;set&amp;quot;, players guess as to what position their card may be -- Highest, 2d Highest, 2d Lowest, or Lowest.  In the second set, a player again makes a guess as to what position his or her card may be (and a player may change his or her guess from the first set), and also makes three guesses as to which card he or she may hold.  In the third set, a player makes a guess as to exactly what his or her card is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are determined as thus:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1st Set - 1 point for accurate position guessed&lt;br/&gt;     2nd Set - 1 point for accurate position guessed&lt;br/&gt;         1 point for Exact card held being one of the three guesses&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     3rd Set - 3 points for exact card guessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
