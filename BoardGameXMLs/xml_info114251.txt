			<description>1st &amp;amp; Goal: Southeast Division, an expansion for 1st &amp;amp; Goal, contains 28 dice which make up 4 custom teams. The Dice Football League (DFL) Southeast Division includes the following teams:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Columbia Crocodiles - The Crocodiles enter the league with the 13th ranked running game and the 13th ranked passing game. Coach Al Egatar states, &amp;quot;Our team has a lot of heart. Our boys give it everything they've got. I just wish they had more.&amp;quot; Quarterback, Duane Pipe, remarks, &amp;quot;Coach says we have to leave it all on the field. I don't know what that means.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Raleigh Reapers - The Reapers enter the league with the 15th ranked running game and 23rd ranked passing game. Despite a lackluster offense, the Reapers do have a deadly defense. Coach Harry Grimm states, &amp;quot;We don't put tons of points on the board, but our defense will bury you.&amp;quot; Kicker Doug Graves had this to say: &amp;quot;Settle for three, bring on the D, baby!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Savannah Savages - The Savages enter the league with the 24th ranked running game and the 12th ranked passing game. Despite a weak offense, the Savages have a top ten defense. Coach Brock Lee states, &amp;quot;I get a little steamed at times, but really, we&amp;rsquo;re not as green as we look&amp;quot;. Defensive Lineman Terry Heddoff commented: &amp;quot;Grrr! Arrgh! Grrr! &amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Virginia Beach Valiants - The Valiants enter the league with the 19th ranked running game and the 2nd ranked passing game. In addition to their one-dimensional offense, the Valiants have lower than average defense. Coach Bjorn Toulouse states, &amp;quot;Our offense likes to put the ball in the air. Less fumbles that way.&amp;quot; Quarterback Orin Julius commented: &amp;quot;Passing is like punting. Except we get to keep the ball. Mostly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
