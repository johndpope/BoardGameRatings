			<description>The game consists of syllable cards. Each player has a face-down stack of cards in front of him/her. The players take turns flipping open a card and placing it in the middle of the table. A player who notices that a word can be formed out of the open syllables shouts out the word and can keep the involved cards. At the end of the game, the player with most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second variant of the game lets players flip open two cards (all of which are face-down on the table at the start of the game), check for complete words, then hide one of the cards, so memory becomes a factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the game contains letter cards. One player thinks of a word, shuffles the letter cards and lets the other players find out the original word. The first player to do so gets a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
