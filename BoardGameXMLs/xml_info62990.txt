							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Clash</name>
									
			<description>Space Clash is a non-collectible card game for 2 - 4 interplanetary warlords in which each player chooses one out of four exciting races, each being represented by a well balanced deck of 40 cards featuring unique gameplay, and tries to lead his &lt;br/&gt;race to different ways of victory, be it by total military annihilation of the enemy or by cultural domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Space Clash, many roads lead to victory, the goal being to deplete the opponent's 40 card deck. When a player is required to draw a card from their Supply (deck) but cannot because it is empty, the player immediately loses the game. For each damage a player takes through attacks or card effects, they have to discard the topmost card from their Supply to their Junkyard (discard pile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features the tried and tested &amp;quot;Clash Game System&amp;quot; created by Andreas Propst, which features 3 major characteristics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Deck depletion as the primary win condition.&lt;br/&gt;b) A resource system in which you will be building stacks of resource cards to play your non-Resource cards onto&lt;br/&gt;c) Different Zones for different types of cards with specific implications on the cards, depending on which zone they are in&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build up your industry, construct spaceships to attack your opponents or to defend against enemy attacks, train&lt;br/&gt;personnel like ship crews, researchers, diplomats and spies, research new technology or try to dominate through diplomacy &lt;br/&gt;or dodgy schemes and political intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possibilities in Space Clash are countless...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which race will you choose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The versatile and inventive Terrans, who are able to adapt well to any challenge they might face?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reptilian warrior race of the Skaargans, with their supreme ability to construct, mend and salvage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dodgy and scheming Intrazi, who have perfected the art of telepathy, becoming the masters of secrets?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or the ancient and mysterious Attrayids who are rather passive but excell in gathering wisdom and knowledge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your race and lead it to victory by carefully planning your strategy and making the best use of the their&lt;br/&gt;unique strenghtes and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
