			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mist elves call themselves &amp;lsquo;the daoine&amp;rsquo; and, like grey and wild elves, point to themselves as the true first elves. They are a mystery even to their brethren, combining the arts and traits of most of the sub-races to lend credence to their claims about their origin. Describing themselves as warrior-poets, the daoine are proud and passionate, but there is an almost imperceptible jaded edge to them, as if they were as old as they claim and know that the Age of Elf is soon to give way to the Age of Man. They pursue knowledge with the determination of a grey elf, enjoy song and dance with the abandon of a high elf, ponder their own nature with the depth of a sea elf and respect nature and privacy with the zeal of wood and wild elves. Yet they can also be as sinister as drow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for d20 fantasy games adds an entirely new sub-race to campaigns. Mist elves are a rare and enigmatic race with many inherent differences to their more common kin. Games Masters can use the information provided here to introduce their players to an ancient line of elves they have never before encountered. Alternatively, players may use this supplement to create entirely new characters with a different view on the fantasy world which they inhabit- far more exciting than playing &amp;lsquo;yet another elf&amp;rsquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
