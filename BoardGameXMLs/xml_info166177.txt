			<description>Designer Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am currently on a Sons of Anarchy binge and that inspired me to try to hack Covert Ops to run a game similar to the TV Show. For those that do not know, it is about a Biker gang that tries to keep progress out of their town as well as the usual crimes. It is not a real representation of biker clubs of course but I find it very entertaining and it gave me several Ideas. I wrote the attached together in the last few days. It is still very rough but I would welcome any suggestions, ideas, and feedback before I polish it up further. I am especially interested in your opinion on the new skills and the town and MC rules. I hope you enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;The designer is listed as &amp;quot;Chaosmeister,&amp;quot; but a real name is not given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
