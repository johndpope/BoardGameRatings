			<description>&amp;quot;Truck Dismount (also known as Rekkaturvat) is a computer game made by Jetro Lauha of tAAt. Truck Dismount is a simple stress-reliever, allowing players to release their anger on a 3D stick figure.&lt;br/&gt;The game has no other aim but to cause as much damage to the ragdoll physics man as possible. The figure can interact with ramps, a truck and a wall.&lt;br/&gt;Players can sit the man in the truck, on the cabin, on the very top, or stand him in front of it. The player sets the speed of the truck and where the ramps are located &amp;mdash; if they are to be present at all &amp;mdash; and simply lets the carnage unfold. Players are given points dependent on how much damage they inflict on the stick figure.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_Dismount Truck Dismount]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
