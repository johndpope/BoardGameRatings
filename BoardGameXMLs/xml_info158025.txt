			<description>Melanżeria (Melange) is a card game by Let's Play, intended for parties and social entertainment (usually involving 3 to 8 players), aimed at selecting the real Party Star from among you. Each player receives points at the beginning of the game (their number depends on the number of players), which he has to keep by completing orders. The orders are given by... the other players, who each time choose a person supposed to complete a task. The player who does not succeed, loses a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tasks (presented on 64 cards) include pretending to be someone else, making faces, speaking in funny voices, telling stories, feeding other players with snacks, proposing toasts, drinking, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
