			<description>15mm tabletop game owing a nod to computer games like Rainbow 6 and Counterstrike.  Comes in a box with 11 miniatures, one 128-page book (the rules are about 14 pages - the rest is lists and background), two dice and a tape measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is an action point system with straight d10 rolls used to resolve actions.  Combat is a lengthy process where you have to hit, wound and beat an armor save (yes, it's Warhammer 40k all over again) and then see what injury you delivered. Armor and injury saves are not modified by weapons, so whether you took a hit from a derringer or an anti-material rifle makes no difference to the target - a rather silly outcome, but there you have it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a point buy system, a lengthy compendium of weapons &amp;amp; equipment (many of them with quite unrealistic stats) and a number of light vehicles (civilian models primarily - no tanks or APCs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
