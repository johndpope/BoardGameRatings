			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Toybox is a homage to the cartoons I grew up watching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Toybox incorporates content from Battlechangers: Ironworks and expands on it&amp;hellip; a lot. Heroic transforming Battlechangers are found throughout the Multiverse, and where you can find either of these shapechanging mechanoids, you can find their iconic gear and artifacts. Anthro heroes are as widely dispersed and as iconic as the Battlechangers, so Cosmic Toybox also includes a full assortment of Anthro weapons, armor and magical wonders, including the legendary Omens weapons. Furry heroes can fight alongside totemistic warriors, or imbue mystical weapons and gear so their human allies can borrow some of the best abilities of the animal kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to gear for gigantic robots and half-animal heroes, other pieces of gear in this sourcebook are inspired by other 80s cartoons: from the techno-magical wonders wielded by barbarian heroes and highly trained ninja commandos to the holographic accessories of ultra-tech pop starlets. Often, these new weapons and armor are derived wholly or in part from recovered Technysian technology, or were inspired by a chance encounter with the superhuman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
