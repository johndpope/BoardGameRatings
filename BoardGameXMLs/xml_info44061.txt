							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fight Like a Legend</name>
									
			<description>The first supplement for &amp;AElig;ternal Legends rips open the combat system to include new and variant rules. Send your legend into the thick of battle with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Alternate Combat Rules: This section includes new combat systems that favour simple, fast action over tactical detail. &lt;br/&gt;- Stylized Fighting: Hack the system to add rules for special actions that go above and beyond standard bullets and strikes. &lt;br/&gt;- Fast Injuries: Replace the core game's &amp;quot;stepped pyramid of doom&amp;quot; with hits and conditions that give you a new way to track injuries. &lt;br/&gt;- Social Conflict: Sometimes, words are a Legend's strongest weapons. This section adds detailed rules for giving speeches, intimidating enemies and winning debates. &lt;br/&gt;- Legendary Action: We conclude with Legend-only tactics. Send your enemies running with a single strike or a well-chosen word, or win the day with an unforgettable sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt; Each section is designed to be a separate plug-in for the &amp;AElig;ternal Legends core book. Use them piecemeal or together -- either way, they'll help you customize game play at your table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Requires the &amp;AElig;ternal Legends core book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
