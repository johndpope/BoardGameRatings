			<description>Bouken Jidai Katsugeki Goemon is a Ganbare Goemon game released for the PlayStation 2 on December 21, 2000. This is the third game in the series set in a 3D world, following Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon and Ganbare Goemon: Kuru Nara Koi! Ayashige Ikka no Kuroi Kage. Unlike most of the other games, this game departs from the quirky humor that the franchise is known for, and replaces it with a more serious tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the three-dimensional The Legend of Zelda games with some role-playing game elements, the player assumes the role of Goemon, who is set once again to save Japan. Goemon is able to use a large variety of weapons (including his trademark pipe), as well as equip sub-weapons, items and magic, which can be assigned in 4 hexagons for quick use. Another twist is the addition of a white tiger known as Kotora, whom Goemon can use to attack enemies when he locks on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bōken Jidai Katsugeki Goemon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
