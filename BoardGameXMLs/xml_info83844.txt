			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God Spells contains 50 spells for divine casters. Druids, clerics, paladins and rangers can all find useful tools in this assortment of miracles. Plenty of stunning new spells such as pollen cloud, armor of stone, excommunication, and sorghum's wrath are featured among these pages, and are waiting to enhance your game.  Mass resurrection is always a crowd-pleaser and the deadly tongue of swords is sure to get any enemy's attention!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God Spells also includes many of the divine spells that have appeared in Bloodstone's other titles, all updated to the new 3.5 rules. Classic spells like convalescence, fortify and spirit of the lion have been retooled with the 3.5 version of the core rules and are ready to be added to your game! With the God Spells in their hand, your divine heroes will have all the power they need to achieve their spiritual goals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
