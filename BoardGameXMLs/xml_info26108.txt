			<description>Description of the game from Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jona und der grosse Fisch (Jonah and the Big Fish) is by Uli Geissler and is a game about the story of Jonah. Jonah was given the assignment to travel to Nineveh. There, he is to ensure that the people make up for their mistakes. A difficult assignment for Jonah, who'd love to try and avoid it. In the game, the goal is to bring Jonah to Nineveh with the help of big fish, to save him and to prevent him from fleeing to Tarsis so that God's will can be carried out. All game figures are made of wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
