							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mindz</name>
									
			<description>Mindz is an abstract ostensibly themed around colored rays of light on a mirrored board, but the mechanics are not informed by this (the board is shiny, though).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a set of pieces in different colors, with the color indicating the number of spaces it can move in a turn.  Moves can be made in any combination of directions.  Each player also has a black piece (&amp;quot;black beam of light,&amp;quot; it says here - interesting concept) which starts the game trapped by the opponent.  The object of the game is to free your black piece and bring it to your edge of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included for three and four-player versions.  In each two players team up, and on each team one player plays &lt;br/&gt;attack and the other defense, with somewhat different rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
