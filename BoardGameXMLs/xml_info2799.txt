							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arabian Nightmare: The Kuwait War</name>
									
			<description>Arabian Nightmare: The Kuwait War, was designed and published while the late 1990 events in Kuwait were still unfolding, so in effect it was a near-future game which became an historical game within a few months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has one map and 300 counters. The map covers the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, the eastern part of Iraq and its border with Iran. Turn/Time Scale is 1-3 days per Military Action Segment and 4-6 days per Political Action Segment (a full turn is 2 MAS and 1 PAS, so 6-12 days total).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played using only the Military rules, the Political rules or both sets. There is an Introductory Game as well. There are 7 scenarios including the full campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a medium-high complexity game with many creative mechanisms and special rules. For the experienced wargamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #139.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 1-3 days for Military Action Segments (combat units), 3-6 days for Political Action Segments&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 30 km&lt;br/&gt;Unit: Battalion to Corps, Naval Squadrons, Air Wings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22&amp;quot; X 34&amp;quot; mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;Two countersheet (300 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 28 page Military Game Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;One 12 page Political Game Rules booklet (2nd Folio Edition only)&lt;br/&gt;One 8 page introductory Game Rules booklet (2nd Folio Edition only)&lt;br/&gt;One 12 page Summary Sheet Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
