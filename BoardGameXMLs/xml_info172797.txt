							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D4Core Universal Basic set</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D4Core is a universal, interchangeable Role Playing Game system. This edition is just the basic framework of that system. D4Core is not a rigid set of rules that you must adhere to in order to play. Yes, there are some mechanics to the game that will &amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo; your adventures but for the most part play is open ended and lends itself more towards the use of House Rules(variations to the rules that gaming groups like to play and agree on). There is no wrong way to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D4Core can be used for any setting. Adventures can be set in a fantasy world, a world overrun with flesh eating turkeys, a galaxy far far away, or anywhere else you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D4Core is meant to a fast and easy system for a quick night of gaming, but robust enough to handle a long campaign. The emphasis is on having fun and not get bogged down with complicated rules. As I said before there are some core mechanics, but elements can be mixed, matched, or eliminated based on whatever works for your scenario. A good example is our mini rpg [Angry Flowers!] that is powered by D4Core but only uses some parts of the core rules and is enhanced with elements that are specific to that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
