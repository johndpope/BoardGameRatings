			<description>This game is meant for starting readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a card with pictures and the corresponding word. These words all miss 1 letter, which the players need to find.&lt;br/&gt;Players start their turn by turning over a chip with the number 1 to 3 in one of the colors (red, blue and green). This determines how many letter chips in which color can be turned face up. Any letters which fit on the lotto card can be put on the card. The rest is turned face down again.&lt;br/&gt;As with regular lotto you try to fill your card as quick as possible, with the first to complete his/her card winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards come in 3 different levels, with which you can build up the game as the child(s) improve their reading skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
