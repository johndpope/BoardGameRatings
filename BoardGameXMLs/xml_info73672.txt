			<description>&amp;quot;Feel the Magic: XY/XX, known in Japan as Kimi no Tame nara Shineru (きみのためなら死ねる, lit. I Would Die for You) and in Europe  and Australia as Project Rub, is a minigame  video game compilation developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It was first released in North America, and was later released in Japan, Australia, and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel the Magic: XY/XX was originally announced at E3 2004 under its code name, Project Rub. Then-executive managing director Yuji Naka said the title would place &amp;quot;an emphasis on controls using a Touch Screen, which will allow us to achieved the concept of 'rubbing,' a unique and fun gameplay mechanic made possible by the DS. We will investigate a wide-range of gaming elements unique to DS, so look forward to future Sega titles.&amp;quot; Game details and previews came much later, in October.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It follows the attempts of a young male protagonist to impress a young woman, aided by a group of people known as the &amp;quot;Rub Rabbits&amp;quot; into completing a series of minigames related to the plot. These minigames are all controlled by the touch screen and microphone, and often involve tapping, scribbling, and blowing into the microphone. On February 2, 2006, the game won the &amp;quot;Best Concept&amp;quot; award at the 2006 Imagina Games Awards. Game Informer has named the game one of the top ten weirdest of all time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Project_Rub,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
