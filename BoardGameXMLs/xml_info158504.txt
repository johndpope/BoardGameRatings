			<description>Start your engines and buckle up! It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a bumpy and puzzling ride!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROAD RACE #1&lt;br/&gt;Keep an eye on the shape outlines, your hands on the tiles, and give it some gas! Spin, switch and swap the road sign tiles in front of you to match the sign outlines on the challenge card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are your tiles turned correctly? Then, hit the &amp;ldquo;SPEEEED BUMMMP&amp;rdquo; buzzer to let the other players know that they&amp;rsquo;ve just run into a Speed Bump themselves! If your tiles are correct, you win the round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROAD RACE #2&lt;br/&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve mastered the traffic signs &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re ready to hit the streets! Level 2 requires shifting your brain into high gear. Now, this is the fast track to thinking fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faced with roundabouts, bridges, tunnels, construction zones, ponds, traffic signs, (daisies and one cute frog) &amp;ndash; can you use the very limited, partial-shadow outlines to put your tiles into correct formation? And can you do it without letting up on the accelerator?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;SPEEEED BUMMMP!&amp;rdquo; (Better luck next time. That NASCAR-style drafting - by watching the guy next to you - was not helpful.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rev up the excitement and take the corner toward fun interaction! There&amp;rsquo;s no final lap in sight. Speed Bump sends families cruisin&amp;rsquo; for another lap around &amp;ndash; and another, and another...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speed Bump&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Two fast-paced racing games in one!&lt;br/&gt;    Follow shape and position clues as the road map to your success!&lt;br/&gt;    Develops visual-spatial reasoning, fast thinking, and interaction&lt;br/&gt;    16 double-sided graphic tiles&lt;br/&gt;    50 double-sided challenge cards&lt;br/&gt;    Durable plastic components&lt;br/&gt;    Buzzer Announcer for every, &amp;ldquo;SPEEEED BUMMMP!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;    Fun for a wide range of ages&lt;br/&gt;    Ideal for group play and solitaire play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
