							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rooster Coop</name>
									
			<description>The Rooster coop is a game where the players try to collect their family of chickens. It is done by moving the marker on the board and by sliding the tiles and by that changing their position. The rules are very simple that can be explained in a few minutes, but wining the game is a bit more tricky. The players try to collect their chickens, but at the same time, can try preventing other players from collecting their chickens by changing the positions of the tiles. Fun game for all the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
