You&amp;rsquo;ll have to use all your fighting skills as you take on airborne enemies and massive bosses in the fight for freedom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Sci-Fi Action-Adventure combining aerial and on-foot combat for the first fully 3D third-person shooter experience.&lt;br/&gt;    * Gravity-defying vertical combat system where moving up is the only way to bring your enemies down.&lt;br/&gt;    * Scale walls jumping from surface to surface or sky-jack UFO&amp;rsquo;s while in mid-air using the unique grip system.&lt;br/&gt;    * Explosive hover and rocket pack and special in-air moves allow players to fly with reckless abandon while performing hair-raising stunts and taking down enemies.&lt;br/&gt;    * Take on giant enemies in style using your upgraded weapons and rocket pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
