			<description>Endless Quest #27&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;The secret spellbook of your father, the most powerful wizard in the land, has been stolen by a foul lich and spirited away to the undead creature's castle stronghold.  There may be no stopping the lich's plans to use the spellbook for its own evil purposes, yet you know you must try.  But will even your mysterious, newfound psionic powers be enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to enter the exciting world experienced by the players of the popular DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Game. It is a fantasy world filled with enchanted castles and fearsome monsters. Are YOU brave enough to meet its challenges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other ENDLESS QUEST Books, you can combat secret agents skilled in espionage, journey to the corners of the galaxy, or attempt to survive in a future world ravaged by wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ENDLESS QUEST Book is based on an exciting role-playing game, but you don't need to know the game to enjoy the book. Just make your choices, and accept the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember! Only your choices lead to success in ENDLESS QUEST Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
