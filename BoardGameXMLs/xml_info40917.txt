							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tournament Golf</name>
									
			<description>Tournament Golf consists of an 18-hole course compiled in book form, a club chart, four plastic playing pieces, one pair of dice, and a pad of score sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book which makes up the course is a very large comb-bound journal, where each large page is a hole on the course. The holes have a grid overlay indicating the center shot and yards varying from off center. Illustrations and cartoons often accompany the holes on the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns choosing which club they will use, and rolling 2 normal 6-sided dice. Results of their roll are compared to the game chart- a 7 is an ideal shot. The farther away from the center of the bell curve the die roll indicates, the worse the shank or hook on the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all players are on the fairway, as in normal golf, player order is determined by distance to the green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
