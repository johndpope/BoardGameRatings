			<description>Could you name the UK&amp;rsquo;s 10 longest rivers or 10 most popular brands of chocolate? If not all 10, then how many do you think you could name?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the hit UK TV show presented by Nick Knowles, this is a game of lists, bidding, dares and steals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This highly entertaining, family game will have teams bidding and challenging on how many items they can name from a particular category list but which team will have the courage to hold their nerve and win the valuable places! Test your knowledge and skill and see how many of the ten answers you can name from each list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful though, get an answer wrong and the other players will get a chance to steal! There are also dare cards to be collected along the way that may just help you out but how brave will you be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
