			<description>Who on Earth? is a party game wherein, in each round,  players are each secretly assigned one 'partner' (person to describe) and, after all players answer 3 questions of the form &amp;quot;If your partner was a (garden tool), what would they be?&amp;quot;, all players attempt to guess which players were describing which players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points for correct guessing of who was describing who, and then in a bonus round, the round's lowest scorer turns over a card from a second set of cards with questions of the form &amp;quot;If you use the category of (species of animal) which player would best be described by (sloth)?&amp;quot;.  All players answer secretly what they believe the card-flipper's answer would be, and for each match, both the matching player and the card-flipping low-scorer earns bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially a non-competitive party game, as all the players must play completely honestly for the game to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
