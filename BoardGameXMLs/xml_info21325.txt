			<description>Eco-Force: Guardians of Earth (tm) card games allow 2-4 players to manage their eco-system by adding habitats and animals worth points during their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact cards in the deck may allow other players to cause reduction in another players eco-system during play and thus reduce their total points.  Defense cards are also in play and can reduce or block other players from harming your eco-system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the pre-determined number of rounds, the player with the most points wins the game.  And keep an eye out for that Special Migration....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
