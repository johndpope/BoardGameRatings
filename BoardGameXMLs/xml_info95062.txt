			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Developer of the Open Core System and co-designer of Pulp Fantasy, comes a lighter take on role-playing games...Open Core Quick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced in conjunction by Seraphim Guard and Battlefield Press, Open Core Quick takes the best elements of open content and boils them down to their essence, creating a system that is fast to play, easy to learn, and robust. While intended for at least one experienced gamer, a game master could easily teach the basics of Open Core Quick to inexperienced players in order to create characters and get a game started in minutes, not hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extensively playtested by gaming groups in the United States, the U.K. and Iceland, this game is not just some quickie system released to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While based on the popular Open Core System, this game has been streamlined for ease of play, and designed for player character-centric game play. The characters are the important part of the story and the players are able to mechanically effect play through their choices. While gamers with experience with the Open Core System will be able to play this game with little effort, some conversion will be necessary for characters between the two systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
