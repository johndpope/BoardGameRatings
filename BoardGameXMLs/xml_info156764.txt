			<description>A monopoly-like game in the entourage of a fantasy collectible card game &amp;quot;Berserk&amp;quot;. In addition to the standard property acquisition and collecting payment from opponents, players can fight monsters and develop their characters. Getting on certain cells of the field, players can start a battle with monsters and get treasures, which will improve their fighting skills.  The measure of fighting abilities is the level. Clashes between players are also possible: 2 players need just to be on the same sector. A mechanism of a fight is simple: the opponents roll a D6, add the number to their level value (that can be improved with artifacts) and the highest sum is the winner! In case of a defeat players don't die. The worst that can happen is the loss of a certain amount of money. Most powerful artifacts the player can receive for the victory over the dragon help you to make your rivals go broke, but do not play a critical role: if someone is doing bad he goes bankrupt anyway and prosperous player can afford to lose a couple of hundred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
