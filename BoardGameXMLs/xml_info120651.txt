			<description>From RPG description here on RPGGeek:&lt;br/&gt;The era of anthropomorphic animals has arrived ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOTARUS is a role-playing game where anthropomorphic animals are dominant.  Any time, any place.  It is designed to stage adventures from the dawn of time to the pinnacle of space travel - and anything in between.  Over 90 species, plus many unusual creatures, are described within this book; and an array of equipment and skills are available.  Rare supernatural gifts and abilities are also awaiting discovery for those who dare search for them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOTARUS requires a pencil and paper, a full set of polyhedral dice (four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided, twelve-sided and twenty-sided) and this book to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
