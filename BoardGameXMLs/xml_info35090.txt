							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">This is your town: Parramatta game</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to move around the Australian city of Parramatta and acquire ten destinations cards by moving around the gameboard. The first player to do so, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents of the game box reveal a mounted mapboard showing the cbd (central business district) of Parramatta divided into movement spaces, a pair of six-sided dice, 12 player tokens, a pack of money in different denominations, a pack of surprise cards and a pack of destination cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In preparation, each player is given a $100 cash scrip and a token. Tokens are placed in the locations indicated on the board, as are the shuffled surprise and destination cards. The first destination card is turned face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a turn by rolling the two dice and moving round the board with the object of being first to reach the destination address. A player rolling doubles is allowed to go directly to the destination and claim the card. Each destination card claimed requires a payment of $50. Extra money may be acquired by moving to indicated spaces at a rate of ten times a dice roll (doubled if doubles  are rolled). Spaces marked 'surprise' require a relevant card to be taken by a player and the text is acted upon. A player landing upon another's space may purchase a destination card for $25 from that player or take another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has collected ten destination cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
