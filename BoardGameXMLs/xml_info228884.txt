			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;CABARET CONFIDENTIAL is a 3 player only game from Japan. It uses the mechanic known in Japanese gaming as 'butting', where equal values negate each other and the next player down gains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player acts as an owner of a Cabaret, and headhunts dancers. Dancers have three needs: Fame, Money and Love. For each dancer dealt up from the deck each round, players try to negotiate to get the dancer to join their troup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Negotiation is done by simultaneous blind-bidding on one of the dancer's needs. Each player chooses a card of one type and places it face down. When the three cards are turned up, the player who didn't match the others wins the bid and takes the dancer to their tableau. For example, Alice and Brenda bid on Fame, Cathy bid on Money, so Cathy wins the bid. When the game ends, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dancers may have special abilities. Some may be triggered when turned up from the deck, some may have one-off effects when placed on your tableau, some may have permanent effects. There is also a &amp;quot;management policy&amp;quot; card which is drafted before the first round, and activated before counting points at the end. This might mess up the other players' scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special effects on the dancers add some language dependancy to the game but the game is still playable with crib sheets or paste-ups for the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;In Paris, end of 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is the owner of a Cabaret, and negotiate with the casts to bring success for your stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware. Casts are artists, and artists have mannerisms. With thoughtful negotiations, assign casts in the best position to produce the best stage in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player producing the most gorgeous Cabaret wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19世紀末、パリ。&lt;br/&gt;各プレイヤーはキャバレーのオーナーとなり&lt;br/&gt;キャストと交渉を行い、毎晩繰り広げられるステージを大成功に導くことを目指します。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;しかし、注意してください。&lt;br/&gt;芸術肌のキャスト達は、一癖も二癖もある人間ばかり。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;巧みな交渉でキャスト達の個性を活かしながら、&lt;br/&gt;最高のステージを作り上げましょう。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ゲーム終了時に、&lt;br/&gt;最も華やかなステージを作り上げたプレイヤーの勝利です。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
