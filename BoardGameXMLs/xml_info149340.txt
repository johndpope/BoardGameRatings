			<description>A dice game for simulating a game of baseball. There are 4 six-sided dice included, 2 Pitcher dice (one for each team), and 2 Batter dice, both used by the player who is at bat. The Pitching player rolls their Pitcher die to determine the type of pitch, then the Batting player rolls their Batter dice to determine the outcome of the at bat.  A run is scored when the Batter dice add up to 4 total bases, or when the Pitcher die comes up &amp;quot;Home Run.&amp;quot;  Like real baseball, a player stays at bat until they accumlate 3 outs by rolling &amp;quot;Strike Out&amp;quot; on either the Pitcher die or Batter dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with a miniature duffel bag to store the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
