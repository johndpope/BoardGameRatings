			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Three] programs on one cassette:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Bomber - You're in command of a plane bombing enemy terrain.  Enemy games try to shoot you down.  Try to bomb the guns to rack up points and make yourself safer, but it's not easy!  Complete with color, sound, and a chance to make a buried oil tank explode - if you can get at it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Rebound - A game of skill and strategy.  Try to make the little ball (thingamajig, whatever) bounce off the walls and barriers so that it hits the jackpot and not you.  The wall configuration changes, and sixty points get deducted from your score for every second you think, so this one is no pushover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Supertennis - Not another computer ping-pong game.  This one uses a joystick, not a paddle.  Let's face it - Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe don't move in one dimension, do they?  Your speed is not infinite and the ball bounces and goes out of bounds.  Come to the net and hit forehands and backhands.  A true simulation.  Joystick required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
