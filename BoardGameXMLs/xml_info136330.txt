							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TNT (The Narrative Toolbox) Example of Play</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TNT is a different kind of roleplaying game. Inspired by the &amp;ldquo;indie&amp;rdquo; idea of using rules and game mechanics to determine not what happens, but rather who gets to describe what happens, TNT gameplay is both very similar and very different from what you get with a more traditional roleplaying game. That being the case, we thought that an example of play might be helpful. This isn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be the one and only way to play the game. Some groups like to give players even more expansive narrative rights, while others prefer to keep the players&amp;rsquo; narrations focused on the task they&amp;rsquo;re attempting. Both options are fine. As you read through the following example, remember that there&amp;rsquo;s no wrong way to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TNT (The Narrative Toolbox) is a simple universal roleplaying game that allows you and your friends to play any kind of story about any kind of characters in any kind of world. If you can dream it, you can do it in TNT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
