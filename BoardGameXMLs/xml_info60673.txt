							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Festival of Blades</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full module for the Neiyar: Land of Heaven and the Abyss Campaign setting. This module debuted last June at the Origins Game Convention. Designed for 8th-12th level characters, this high-powered game focuses on the annual Festival of Blades, a sacred gladitorial style combat held in the city of Delansha. Warriors from around the island travel to the city for the chance to compete for the grand prize, the title of Kalguardia and a power weapon known as the Blade of Kalla.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While entrants know there is a chance to die during the combat, noone was prepared when entrants started turning up dead BEFORE the festival even began. Explore the city to uncover clues as to who is killing off combatants and why, before the PC's themselves become the next victims! Experience the thrill of the arena and discover all of the side-quests throughout the city. Also includes additional weapons designed specifically for the Festival. Newly revised edition includes a full color map of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
