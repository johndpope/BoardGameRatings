							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Horror: The Madness Dossier</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can You Handle The Truth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History is a lie. The truth is that the godlike Anunnakku enslaved mankind, co-opted language to program us, and established the superhuman &amp;scaron;edu as our overseers. And that would have been The End if reality-warping disaster hadn't overturned everything in 535 A.D., leaving the true past forgotten but not gone, shoved from human memory by a collective delusion. Now the irruptors &amp;ndash; servants of the Anunnakku, dimly remembered as monsters of myth &amp;ndash; gnaw at the edges of our world, seeking to return their masters to power and history to the way it was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most humans are clueless about all this. Worse, those who discover snippets of the truth tend to worship the Anunnakku or irruptors as gods, or turn the power of language and symbols to misguided ends, making the situation worse. Fortunately, a stalwart few are moved to defend our reality from forces that would rewrite it. Welcome to Project SANDMAN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Horror: The Madness Dossier gives you everything you need to run a campaign featuring Project SANDMAN and its human, inhuman, and superhuman rivals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Truth. Discover the real history of the world, how it fractured from what we see today, and the dangers we face if everything old becomes new again &amp;ndash; and learn about the origins of Project SANDMAN, and the battle they fight for our reality, whether we like it or not.&lt;br/&gt;    The Warriors. Create high-end heroes using the eight included character templates, a unique martial art, and powerful mental disciplines for rapidly absorbing new skills, resisting mind control, and even swapping personalities.&lt;br/&gt;    The Tools. Gear up with specialized equipment, from the technological (drugs, surgical brain-hacking gear, and implants) to &amp;quot;reality shards&amp;quot; with amazing powers that defy explanation.&lt;br/&gt;    The Enemy. Battle an entire bestiary of powerful irruptors . . . not to mention human and more-than-human traitors.&lt;br/&gt;    The Weirdness. Make slaves and influence people with the words, memes, and potent symbols used by all sides of the secret war for reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In GURPS Horror: The Madness Dossier, the stakes are nothing less than losing your mind, your reality, and everything you believe to be true. Being an elite warrior means only that you know what the world stands to lose, and you willingly expose yourself to dangers far beyond your abilities. Who says that &amp;quot;scary&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;high-powered&amp;quot; don't mix?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
