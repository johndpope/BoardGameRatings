			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NBA Street Showdown is the fourth title in the NBA Street series, and the first for a portable console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Showdown has the same root format as the previous series titles &amp;ndash; players compete in three-on-three streetball matches, complete with fantastical dunks and tricks. If enough tricks are performed, players can execute Gamebreakers to score big points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of game modes to play, but the main career mode is King of the Courts. Players can customize their own team, after which they travel the country to take on other courts and their champions. There are 11 championed courts, and each time the player beats an opponent&amp;rsquo;s team, they earn the right to one of the players on that team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides King of the Court, there are playable mini-games such as Shot Blocker and Arcade Shootout, as well as online match capabilities. Additionally, friends can match skills in hotseat play of the mini-games as everyone competes for the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
