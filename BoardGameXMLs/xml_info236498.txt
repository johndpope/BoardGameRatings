			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Worlds and the various Companions and Settings provide a range of different Arcane Backgrounds, most of which can be extended or customised through trappings to cover a range of different arcane concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for GMs to design or heavily customise their own Arcane Backgrounds, particularly if they&amp;rsquo;re basing the magic in their campaign on specific mechanics from other games, novels, or movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savage Arcanum simplifies the creation process and makes it easier to balance new Arcane Backgrounds by breaking down the various options into a series of arcane abilities, in the same way as Savage Armoury and the race creation rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is intended for GMs who are designing new Arcane Backgrounds for their own settings. Like the race creation rules, Savage Arcanum can be highly vulnerable to min-maxing if players are permitted to design their own Arcane Backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
