							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythos Horror Creation System</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H. P. Lovecraft created a whole genre of horror with his mythos stories, a genre that others have taken and expanded upon or with which they have created their own visions and interruptions of comic horror. Gaming has been no less active in bringing Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s horror to the masses with the advent of the Call of Cthulhu RPG, few horror classics RPFGs can bring players to a place of thrills like a good CoC game. The Mythos is still going strong today with all sorts of RPGs, board games and card games filling the hobby with nasty things that crawl and slither and so there is no limit today to the fun you can have with Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s mythos. But there lies the problem, Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s creations have become to well known. The monsters and horrors of the mythos are all well codified, the stat worked out the horror used over and over again. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to run a cosmic horror game without the players already well versed in the lore and mythology. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s mythos has been everywhere, in music, movies, television and comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the mysteries and cold horror washed away with familiarity, its no wonder that the mythos itself is difficult to inject into a game and not have it fall flat. How can you generate a horror setting and feeling when the players can see behind the GM a collection of plush Cthulhu dolls and the other gods of terror?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well Avalon is here to help out.
