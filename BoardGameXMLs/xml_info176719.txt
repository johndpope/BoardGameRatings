							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fringe</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The edge of known space is a varied place. There is no exact or specific definition that determines which worlds make up the Fringe. The Fringe is not a defined territory, like a country or a corp world. It is a frontier - a vague line drawn on star maps that marks the edge of &amp;ldquo;civilized&amp;rdquo; space. Worlds near the edge can be on one side of that line one week, and on the other side the next, depending on where the bandits are roaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also difficult to define what a Fringe world looks like. Such is their variety that, rather than attempting to define what the Fringe worlds are, it is easier to define what these worlds are not: these are not the comfortable and secure planets where people won't kill you over a pair of magnetic boots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien threats, space pirates and lost civilizations all wait those that dare to explore the Fringe.  Are you made of the right stuff to make your fortune on the Fringe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fringe is a campaign sourcebook for use with the Infinite Futures 2.0 and the Pathfinder role-playing game. As such, both the Infinite Futures 2.0 and the Pathfinder Core Rulebook&amp;trade; are needed in order to make full use of the material found within this book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fringe is a particular setting for Infinite Futures. In its primary essence, it is a far future space setting designed to incorporate as many different science fiction elements as possible without stretching credulity to its limit.  Everything from alien bug hunts to mecha wars are possible on the Fringe.  Explore new worlds or plunder the star lanes for pirate booty, its all possible on the Fringe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
