			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albarrana is a late medieval castle building game played with building blocks. The game rules are freely distributed for anyone to share. While designed for 2 to 4 players, it can be played with more as long as there are enough blocks available. After three rounds of building and fighting with rival castles the winner is the player with the largest and greatest castle with the highest towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During building a random card determines the block every player gets to place next to their castle. There's a push your luck mechanic in that the players should complete the castle before a dice roll ends the building phase after 8 to 13 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fighting is asymmetric so that the defender is basically choosing which attackers to target and tries to score high enough dice throws, while the attacker is able to choose where he moves his troops and if he wants to try to conquer the castle to get a block for himself or simply wreck parts of the defender's castle. Conquering is achieved by reaching a flag inside the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actual victory points are calculated after the third battle by adding the squared height of the towers to the castle area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
