							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Company</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have fallen into BAD COMPANY. In this place there are no good guys, just you, your sidekick and wave upon wave of insectoid enemies who have just one thing in mind - the complete destruction of every human being they set their nasty little bug eyes on. No quarter is asked and none is given, you know what to do - if it's alien, blast it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BAD COMPANY can be played by one or two players who have the choice of eight different heroes, each with different characteristics and abilities. Regardless of their talents, they will all be faced with repeated, uncountable waves of alien attack, including onslaughts from the fearless Fly-Heads. And if they do manage to clear one planet from its insectoid infestation, there are three more to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
