			<description>Players are given identical hands of six action cards which they will use to manipulate a stack of two double-sided tokens (through actions such as &amp;quot;flip stack&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;swap tokens&amp;quot;). The stack starts the game in a random sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player sets one card aside at the game's start. Then, for each round, each player chooses a card from their hand, both being revealed simultaneously. The uppermost colour on the stack determines which player's action takes effect first. When both cards have been processed, they are discarded and the top colour on the stack determines that round's winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over five rounds, the score for each round being one, one, one, two and three points respectively. If tied, the initially discarded cards are used to play a tiebreaker round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
