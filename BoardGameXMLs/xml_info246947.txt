			<description>Vote ME! is a vocal party game for three or more players, split into Parties and can take from about 10-15 minutes (3 round game, a few players) up to 90 minutes (9 rounds, 7+ players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round has three steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Draw cards - the area card that is being contested and the Policy and Theme card for the round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Give speeches - one player from each party has to give a 1 minute speech based on the rounds Policy and Theme&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) All players vote for the Party (other than their own) that they thought gave the best speech. The Party with the most votes wins the area card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the Party with the most area cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Policy cards cover things you would normally expect to see in an election, and are there to provide a focus for the speech. The Theme cards provide additional flavor for the speech content, and normally, only the title of the Theme card is used, with the 6 options used as inspiration. However, if you want to add a bit more of a challenge to your game, you can roll a dice and use the corresponding option to the number rolled as the theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
