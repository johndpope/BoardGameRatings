							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amaze</name>
									
			<description>First, each player draws a maze on a 6x6 grid using the pads of blanks included with the game.  Players then work their way through their opponent's maze by asking yes-or-no questions, Battleship style.  For example, a player may ask &amp;quot;Is the entry square on the North side?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;May I move from square 24 to 30?&amp;quot;  You current location is marked by a figure.  When a player runs into a roadblock, he puts up a wall on his grid.  The player who finds his way to the end square first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
