			<description>&amp;quot;Tryline&amp;quot; is a head to head Rugby Union simulation. &lt;br/&gt;It consists of Fast Action Cards, Team Cards, a color coded pitch made up of squares and a blue and red reversible counter that changes color once possession changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FAC's control the Kicking, Passing, Running, Rucks, Mauls, Scrums and Lineouts etc. These are turned over by players depending on the previous FAC command or on the strategic placing of a Team Card.&lt;br/&gt;The Team Cards have 2 functions only one of which can be used when it is played. The first function called the Territory Part uses a move value attached to Kicking, Passing and Running etc. which are implemented when the player has been allowed to on the FAC. The second function is the Action part which can be used to counter play determined by FAC's or indeed by the placing of other Team Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tries are awarded when the counter lands on the Tryline by means of Running, Passing and Tap Penalties. If Kicks, Mauls and Scrums move the counter onto the Tryline then players turn a FAC to see what the outcome is on the Grounded Ball section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At an advanced level, once players become used to the basic game, Tryline offers you the opportunity to introduce Substitution Cards and a Yellow Card system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
