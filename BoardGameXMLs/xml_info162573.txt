			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CALL OF CATTHULHU DeLUXE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book I: The Nekonomikon (The Book of Cats) &amp;mdash; Complete rules for play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first volume of Call of Catthulhu Deluxe contains everything needed to play the game: How to make up cat characters, how to use Cat Dice to meet Challenges, how to scrap with other critters, how to use Treats to get a little edge in play, and how to get ready to play again another time. After a little fooling around with this book and some pencil and paper, one person can volunteer to be Cat Herder for the evening and invent some Challenges for everyone&amp;rsquo;s cats to encounter. With 30 different types of cats and countless unsuspecting humans, mice, dogs, fish, birds, treats to liberate, toys to demolish, and countless other challenges to meet, the cat&amp;rsquo;s world is one big sandbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Call of Catthulhu, players take on the roles of a variety of ordinary-seeming cats fighting conspiracies of cosmic chaos. Mighty spirits such as Snarlyathotep, slimy Phatphroggua, and Hastpurr of the Yellow Eye inspire their cultists to destroy civilization-but that&amp;rsquo;s where all the comfy furniture is! One person acts as the Cat Herder, arranging the secret plots, challenges, and rewards and guiding the others through the process of making an adventure. Rules are light and quick, emphasizing player cleverness and the fun of being feline. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of darkness and chaos in the world, but our fuzzy heroes can handle it!... Usually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
