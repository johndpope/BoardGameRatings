			<description>BuzzPutt is a 1-4 player golf game that has you playing adorable bees! There are three pre-made putt putt courses that you and your friends can play on. Each person will select a bee and its matching ball. You have to place the ball on the starting point of the board, with the arrow pointing towards where you want to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, you roll the dice and pick a shot (basically a stroke in golf) based on what you have rolled. You can now move your ball that far. If you land on certain tiles, such as the honeycomb tiles, it'll cost you more movement points to move out. If you end up out of bounds, you must end your turn and start your next turn on the last tile you touched. Once everyone is at the end, you can move onto the next course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
