							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sea Cave</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the seacoast of Prax a fishing village is being terrorized by unknown terrors from the Deep. The Chief Fisherman has raised a call for hearty adventurers to seek out and  destroy the unknown menace that has sunk their boats and eaten their people. Monstrous Serpent tracks have been spotted leading into a nearby Sea Cave complex. Who knows what dangers and riches live therein...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This incomplete RUNEQUEST! adventure includes background, cave complex maps, room descriptions, and a cast of dozens of foes. Made for game Referees, solitaire role-players will also find this expedition a challenging and absorbing one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the &amp;quot;Introduction&amp;quot; section:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDITOR&amp;rsquo;S NOTE: This scenario was found in the Chaosium files&lt;br/&gt;after having been set aside, unfinished, in the late 1970&amp;rsquo;s. It&lt;br/&gt;remains unfinished to not diminish its &amp;ldquo;work in progress&amp;rdquo; charm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
