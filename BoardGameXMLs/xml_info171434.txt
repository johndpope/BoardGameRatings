			<description>Pirates Enjoy Math (Don't Say Arrrrrrithmetic) is a micro card game for 2-4 players in which players use math and the Order of Operations to try to become the pirate with the most Loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of two rounds per hand and as many hands as players would like (recommended play is first to 29 points).  The first round is a card drafting phase where players try to build a Crew that will help them get the Loot.  The second round is where players use their Crew to create a mathematical formula that will get them closest to the Loot Value.  The winner gains the Loot, plus each player has a chance to earn Bonus Loot based on the cards they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
