			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of three to six 4th-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 9, 14, or 19 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two years ago, the Agency assigned an undercover agent, Eric Sienski, to infiltrate a ring of Russian arms dealers. When Sienski repeatedly failed to make contact with his handler, Control assumed he was dead or worse, turned. In fact, Sienski was still active, but tight security protocols and the remote location of the ring&amp;rsquo;s headquarters in heartland Russia made communication needlessly risky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, Sienski has decided to blow his cover and flee with information that the ringleader, Aleksei Kamenev, is in contact with a French research lab that's accidentally discovered a new type of nerve gas. Looking for a quick cash-out, the lab's head scientist, Andr&amp;eacute; Gauthier, has placed the accidental discovery on the black market. Kamenev has placed the highest bid, but before the deal is sealed, the ringleader has requested a full-scale demonstration of the gas's effectiveness &amp;mdash; at Paris' Fashion Week, where the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous designers present their new collections to the upper crust of high society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
