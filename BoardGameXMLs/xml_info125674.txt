			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knudepunkt is an annual larp festival, taking place in the Nordic countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Under the names of respectively Knutepunkt, Knutpunkt, Solmukohta and Knudepunkt it has taken place every year since 1997. In 2003 it takes place in Denmark, and on that occasion this book is published.&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the 1997 Knudepunkt there had been very little contact between the different countries and to many it came as a surprise that they were not the only ones to &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; larp.&lt;br/&gt;Now, seven years after, the situation is quite different. Joint ventures between the countries have been undertaken and players are happy to travel beyond their own borders to participate in other countries events.&lt;br/&gt;With this book we are trying to collect some of the Knudepunkt magic. Knudepunkt has always been a forum where innovation and creativity have flourished and where people from the Nordic countries have shared their visions and dreams for the future of larp.&lt;br/&gt;The book, like Knudepunkt itself, is about moving on from yesterday into tomorrow. The aim is to help the Knudepunkt newbie up to date - as well as spawn creativity, innovation and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;There is nothing as practical as a good theory. That is the foundation for this book. Within these pages, you can find ideas, advices and practical solutions to your problems and questions about larp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
