							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legend of Candlewind</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Developed by Atmosphere Entertainment Studios (first game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Manual&lt;br/&gt;The story&lt;br/&gt;Far to the north, at the foot of the Frost Mountains, lies the small town of Candlewind. For adventurers and those seeking their fortune, it is a popular starting point for expeditions into the icy mountain landscapes shrouded in mystery. Not far from the eastern edge of the town lies Blackwood Forest, which is plagued by a band of rogues. In order that the rogues be driven out and to ensure safety along the trade routes through the forest, the town council has offered a generous bounty for the leader of the rogues.Volunteers soon start gathering in the taverns of the town with the intention of putting an end to the rogues' thieving ways. Our brave party of teenage heroes is among them, led by the fun-loving bard Garrison Hiffs. He always has a cheery tune on his lips, and is well-versed in the art of combat, magic, and archery &amp;mdash; a true all-round talent. At his side are the bold daredevil Wulk Oakcutter, the  apprentice mage Sarago and the daughter of a forest witch, Shailee Frostflower. Determined to fulfil  their mission, the group sets off towards Blackwood Forest to begin their first adventure together...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to fight your way through the many levels of the rogue hideout, proving your mettle in numerous battles in order to reach the leader of the rogues and defeat him in battle. On your way, your group of heroes will come across various treasure chests, which will often contain useful items such as healing potions or torches. However, the chests are sometimes booby-trapped, which is why it is not a good idea to force them open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
