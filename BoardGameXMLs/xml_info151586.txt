			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1OO years have passed since Mankind revolted and slew the Sorcerer Kings of old&amp;hellip; Now, the survivors of seven kingdoms begin to start new lives and hopes on the ashes of old. However, even as life continues, an ancient and forgotten evil stirs awaiting its moment to strike against mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the struggle for survival in a war-torn land where new empires arise to impose their will upon the masses. Vicious warlords fight to control territories carved out of fallen kingdoms. Imposing magicians emerge claiming the legacy of the Sorcerer Kings. High Priests of long forgotten gods and goddesses amass wealth in the name of divine right while Warrior-priests, devoted to a banished god, patrol the lands bringing justice to people abandoned by their rulers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages is a detailed post-apocalyptic fantasy setting taking you through an ancient realm that is fighting for its survival and its humanity. Seek your fortune or meet your fate in the burning deserts of the once lush and vibrant land of Vuul, or travel to the humid jungles of Najambi to face the tribes of the Man-Apes and their brutal sacrificial rituals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales From the Fallen Empire is a post apocalyptic swords &amp;amp; sorcery setting created for use with the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG by Goodman Games.
