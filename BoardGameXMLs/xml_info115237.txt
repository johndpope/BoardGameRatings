							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Low-Tech: Instant Armor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Best Defense&lt;br/&gt;Every low-tech fighter (and every gamer!) knows that the secret to surviving slings and arrows -- not to mention swords, musket balls, and dragon bites -- is a good suit of armor. GURPS Low-Tech and GURPS Low-Tech Companion 2: Weapons and Warriors deliver handsomely in that department . . . but it can take a lot of number-juggling to get costs and weights for the bits you want, and some page-flipping to find the options you desire. GURPS Low-Tech: Instant Armor offers defenses against both these annoyances and battlefield dangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the work is a complete set of armor tables for torso, arm, leg, head, neck, hand, and foot armor; for sub-locations like the abdomen, groin, and bits of the arms and legs; and for five helmet patterns. Each table lists only the armor materials that suit the body part in question, and adjusts TL when a material is available earlier or later than usual in that role. Every piece of armor comes with DR, cost, and weight, as well as the realistic time needed to don it and a Holdout penalty that accounts for DR, flexibility, and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that's not all! You also get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Materials and Modifications Tables. Handy summaries that let you quickly determine the options available at your TL, how they affect cost, and how they adjust the stats in the armor tables.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Helmet Designs. Ready-to-use examples of complicated historical headgear, illustrating how the system can be used to create some classic helmets.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Optional Rules. Answers to a variety of questions, from &amp;quot;How much does it cost to armor only my vitals?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Can I sleep in armor?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;If you've ever been frustrated trying to armor your TL0-4 warriors, then Low-Tech: Instant Armor is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-Tech: Instant Armor is a supplement to GURPS Low-Tech, but the armor stats within would be useful in any TL0-4 GURPS campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
