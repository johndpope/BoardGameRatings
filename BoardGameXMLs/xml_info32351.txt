			<description>This game is a simulation of the early air bombing campaign against Iraq. Completely card driven, players draw missions and attempt to make their primary and any secondary or tertiary targets as possible by rolling dice, which can be modified by aircraft type, experimental weapons and recon missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each target has a Class and a Combat Rating of 2, 3, 4, or 5.. In order to successfully destroy a target, the player must match or beat the Combat Rating listed for that target using as many dice as they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
