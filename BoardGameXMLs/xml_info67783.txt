			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instant adventure for 4-6 characters levels 4-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrived in the village of Blackbrook, you couldn't help but notice the anxiety and gloom in the faces of the locals.  When you bought the bar a round and asked the villagers about their troubles, they explained that the dead have not been resting easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, we've often had problems with the restless,&amp;quot; said a wizened old woman in the corner.  &amp;quot;Vampires, zombies, even wild ghouls from time to time.  But they mostly stay in the mountains, where the hunting is easy.  But that might be changing now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Five nights ago, Dekellus, the lord's son, went missing.  We found him a day later on the edge of town, dead.  There was a vampire bite on his throat, and not a drop of blood in him.  Looks like the restless dead are on the hunt again.  You'd best be careful if you are traveling at night.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, two days out of Blackbrook and half a day into the mountains, the old woman's words come back to haunt you.  The sun has just sunk beneath the horizon, and you hear clanging steel, shouts, and other sounds of battle from over the rise before you.  You could try to walk away from this trouble, but it may just follow you.  After all, the night is still young.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
