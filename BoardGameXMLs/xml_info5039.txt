			<description>Battle for North Africa: War in the Desert, 1940-42, takes GMT's Gameplayers Series into the modern era, allowing players to fight one of the hobby's favorite campaigns with a totally new approach that emphasizes ease of play. The randomized features of the innovative Activation Marker system allow gamers to combine logistics, command, and use of reserves into one simple mechanic, while still providing a maximum amount of uncertainty, tension and fun. The scale of Battle for North Africa also allows players to recreate the sweeping maneuvers of the desert war with scenarios that can be played in one sitting or that cover the entire two years of fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And for the first time, players will be able to change history, perhaps bringing Rommel's Afrika Korps divisions in before O'Conner can sweep the Italians from Libya!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Gameplayers emphasis on ease of play, most veteran gamers will find themselves in the thick of things in less than 15 minutes, while newcomers will find Battle for North Africa most accessible. And if you can't find a ready opponent, Battle for North Africa has been designed with solitaire play in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All your favorite units are here -- from Rommel's 5th and 8th Panzers, to the hulking behemoth tanks of the British Royal Tank Regiments, to the Italian Rapgruppamento Maletti, complete with the Saharanio Camel Regiment (which had no camels).&lt;br/&gt;Battle for North Africa will provide an evening of fast armored action, with enough historical and tactical insight to satisfy even the most demanding of gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative Sequence of Play -- the Activation Marker System -- that combines uncertainty and play tension, logistical requirements and command capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;Extensive Random Events that include Enigma and Ultra, sandstorms, desert raids, amphibious operations, and even Italian paradrops, all with no extra rules burden.&lt;br/&gt;Differentiation between combat formations and support assets; a simple and elegant combat table that emphasizes combined arms; armor upgrades; Italian surrender; and variable Allied withdrawal.&lt;br/&gt;Four scenarios, including a full 1940-42 campaign that allows players to alter German and Allied arrivals.&lt;br/&gt;Hidden reserve system, variable overrun, counter-attack, and armor superiority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1 month&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 8.5 miles / 13.68 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Division&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Two 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed countersheets (280 1/2&amp;quot; &amp;amp; 176 5/8&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 20-page Battle for North Africa rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards&lt;br/&gt;Three single-side printed Play Aid cards&lt;br/&gt;One 10-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
