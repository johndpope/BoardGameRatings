							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Praetor: PromoPack</name>
									
			<description>The PromoPack for Praetor acts as a mini expansion for the base game and contains 6 promo City Tiles, 2 promo Wall Tiles, a double sided player board and a few extra Gold tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The promo City Tiles blend in perfectly in the universe of Praetor, offer an enhancement to the game play and lots of fun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     the Senate allows a player to take over the first player position for the next turn thus being in the pole position to build or activate the most attractive City Tile.&lt;br/&gt;     the Temple of Mars allows players to score Favor Points for each retired worker. Combine its ability with one of the expert sides of the player boards and you have a potentially lethal combo.&lt;br/&gt;     the Fort provides a mix of Favor Points, Gold and the infamous Morale - probably the most expensive and hard to obtain &amp;quot;resource&amp;quot; in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last but not least, the promo player board offers two brand new expert sides, giving players opportunities to discover new strategies in the Praetor universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any promo component can be added to the base game separately or together with the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Praetor Promo Pack will be available in the Geek Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
