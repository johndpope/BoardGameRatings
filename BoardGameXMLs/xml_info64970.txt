			<description>This game is played with a part of a standard deck of cards. Depending on the number of players, some cards are removed. Then tricks are played. The uniqueness of the game is that the score depends  on the number of tricks won in a strange way. For example with five players there are five tricks, and the score is 1 for winning 1 trick, 2 for 2 tricks, 5 for 0 tricks, 6 for 3 tricks, 8 for 4 tricks and 0 for 5 tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.davidparlett.co.uk/oricards/minimis.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.davidparlett.co.uk/oricards/minimis.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
