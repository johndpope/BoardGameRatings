			<description>This is game #16 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nimxus is in the Nim family.  It has a unique feature where players can be forced to place pieces in a column or row, based upon how many pieces their opponent played.  Each turn, players place 1-4 pieces on the board.  This number, 1-4 corresponds with the number or row the player's opponent put pieces in.  Each player has their own unique row, while sharing a column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a player has no legal move.  At that point, that player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
