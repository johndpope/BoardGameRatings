			<description>A free Engle Matrix Game posted on the Hamster Press website. The publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the honorable society of war gamers. Our hobby has a long and noble past. Ever since Robert Lewis Stevenson (Treasure Island) and HG Wells (War of the Worlds) played games with toy soldiers in the 1890's, grown men have been reliving make believe glory in made up wars.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;'Politics by other means...' is a simple war game suitable for children and adults. It is not tied to one historical period. It covers all wars from Summeria to Star Wars. All you need to play are a few figures, some six-sided dice and a table of toy terrain to make a battle field. The game is played by each player, one at a time, moving and shooting. Everyone going ends the turn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
