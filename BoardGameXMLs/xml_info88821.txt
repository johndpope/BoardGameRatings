							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fahrenheit</name>
									
			<description>Fahrenheit is one of the many full-motion-video games that were released for the Sega CD in the 1990s. Played through a first-person perspective it follows a rookie firefighter belonging to a fictional fire house called &amp;quot;Company 13.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an introduction exposition scene the player advances to the first of three burning buildings (i.e. a house, an apartment, and a college service basement) to rescue victims and property while disposing of potential hazards (explosives, kerosene, gas valves, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player wanders through each building, an on-screen menu will pop up, allowing movement to the Left, Right or Forward. The game is timed, so decisions must be made quickly or the computer will make the (wrong) decisions for the player. In addition to this, the player has a limited supply of oxygen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three different levels of difficulty and a password feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fahrenheit (1994 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
