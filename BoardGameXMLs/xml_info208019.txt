							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game: Fan Favorites</name>
									
			<description>This expansion includes player decks for Thomas Raith and Waldo Butters, and book decks for Blood Rites and Dead Beat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Raith's deck is butt-kicker best at clearing obstacles and taking down foes. The deck features a slightly higher average Fate value per card, giving him potent discards as suits his family's wealth. The killer app? His Inner Demon stunt lets him play the top card of his deck for free. If luck's on your side, it can be a real game-changer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waldo Butters' deck uses his incisive intellect to take advantages and investigate cases. Not making enough progress on your cases? With his talents as a Forensic Pathologist, Waldo can turn your hits into clues. (And yes&amp;mdash;you'll get to play a Polka Will Never Die!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round all that up with two new book decks based on books #6 and #7, Blood Rites and Dead Beat &amp;mdash; along with a few more Side Jobs cards &amp;mdash; and you'll add tons of new team combinations and hours more of potential for play. And, yes: we'll have Sue in there (as a potent Advantage card&amp;mdash;she'll be our signature image for Dead Beat's advantages, in fact), along with plenty more Foes (individually illustrated thanks to the latest funded stretch!), Cases, Obstacles, and Advantages arrayed in new, exciting, dismaying ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
