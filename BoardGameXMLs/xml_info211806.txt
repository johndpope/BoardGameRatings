							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Windward!: The Lunar Islands</name>
									
			<description>To Windward!: The Lunar Islands is a 2-4 person competitive, historical Euro-style tabletop game inspired by the Golden Age of Sailing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a competitive, strategic tabletop game which realistically captures the excitement, danger and unpredictability of life at sea. Players command their own fleet of ships in an effort to establish themselves as the dominant naval power in the Lunar Islands. The scales of power can shift suddenly all with a change of wind or an enemy's skills as a master gunner, skilled sailor, or clever scoundrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a Home Island a sturdy Sloop to begin their quest for adventure and riches and the race to gain the most Power &amp;amp; Influence over the islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1- Check Wind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check wind timer and reset wind direction if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2- Perform actions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their turn a player gets 4 actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sail up to 2 steps leeward or straight to leeward&lt;br/&gt;     Sail 1 step to windward (may not sail straight to windward)&lt;br/&gt;     Use Gunnery card&lt;br/&gt;     Use a Sailing card&lt;br/&gt;     Dock/Go to town&lt;br/&gt;     Upgrade a ship&lt;br/&gt;     Buy a new sloop&lt;br/&gt;     Relaunch a sunken ship&lt;br/&gt;     Dive for sunken treasure&lt;br/&gt;     Buy up to three cards (Sailing and/or Gunnery) for 2 gold each&lt;br/&gt;     Buy 1 Power and Influence token for 8 gold (once per turn, not allowed during final round)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3- Collect Power and Influence tokens &amp;amp; claim accomplished Missions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     +1 Selling cargo for 2 gold per ton during a docking action&lt;br/&gt;     +1 Buy Power and Influence for 8 gold (not allowed during final round)&lt;br/&gt;     Sink an enemy ship&lt;br/&gt;         +2 for a Sloop&lt;br/&gt;         +3 for a Frigate/Barque&lt;br/&gt;         +4 for a Indiaman/Man o' War&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All awards doubled during final round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4- Draw and carry out 1 Event card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wind can be an unpredictable ally or fierce opponent. It dictates how far and which directions ships can sail and a change in the wind change quickly shift the balance of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sailing &amp;amp; Fighting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A players hand consists of Sailing and Gunnery cards which are used then discarded to move across the board with ease, to attack other players ships or perhaps fend off an opponent. The diversity and strength of these two decks can turn vulnerable seeming Sloop into a fierce or wily opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trading&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By filling a ship's hold with one of 3 commodities in the game and trading it to the neighbouring islands, players can begin to amass gold and gain Power &amp;amp; Influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This gold can be used to add ships to their fleet or upgrade their Sloop or Sloops to be fierce fighting ships like Frigates and Man o' War or rich merchant vessels like Barques and the famous Indiaman and take on enemies to win Power. But be careful, as a ship becomes laden with treasure, it will become targets for other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events add another wrinkle of unpredictability in the game. At the end of each players turn a random event occurs which may effect their fleet, or the entire board with positive or perhaps disastrous consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions set out tasks that players can accomplish during their turn for a significant payout. Be sure to store as much treasure on your home island as possible because treasure still on a ship at the end of the game only counts for half of what gold on shore is worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the final round the stakes are raised as the race to get the most Power &amp;amp; Influence over the Lunar Islands nears an end. Players who have thought strategically and planned can turn this to their advantage and sweep victory out from under their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of game awards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     +1 for each Sloop in your fleet&lt;br/&gt;     +2 for each Frigate/Barque in your fleet&lt;br/&gt;     +3 for each Indiaman/Man o' War in your fleet&lt;br/&gt;     +1 for first Mission, +2 for second, +3 for third, etc.&lt;br/&gt;     +1 for every 10 treasure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game the player with the most Power and Influence wins.  In case of a tie whoever has the most treasure is the victor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
