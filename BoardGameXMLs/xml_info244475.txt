							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chris Tamm&#039;s Goblin Mine Dungeon Zone</name>
									
			<description>Random Tables for Magic Elf Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally I envisaged this as one of 12 zones to be used in my game where I ran modern Australian army vs dungeon dimension so text and tables here have some anachronisms possibly unwelcome in some settings. These were designed so I could ad-lib dungeons on the fly with a few tables and cave geomorphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the project went on I got good enough to create d100 tables all the time. The earlier Gothic Book was a collection of all the graveyard horror and mansions and ruins stuff. I would like to expand all these books into full developed RPG books but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to do some minimal edited Carbon editions in the meantime compiling my stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dungeon zone covers abandoned and humanoid occupied mine sites. The mines are filled with abandoned mining equipment, unmined ore and lost treasures. Humanoids mostly goblins occupy the mines now. They fight for territory and wage endless inter tribal warfare. Adventurers come for the treasure these humanoids hoard and also because these long forgotten mines act as underground corridors avoiding mountains and other obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've also included mushroom stuff for when goblins turn a section of tunnel into a underland fungus forest. Also dwarf d&amp;eacute;cor for those areas overtaken from dwarf occupation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I did expand more I&amp;rsquo;d like to include tables for deeper  levels with might have connections to hell or my other dungeon types including giants, demons, undead etc. Probably more fantasy geology and a bunch of geomorphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
