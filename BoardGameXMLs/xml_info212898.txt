			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;A New Adult Card Game&amp;quot;, this Depression-era publication requires players to a set of cards either by trading with other players or by &amp;quot;snooping&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;gutter&amp;quot;. The game has 45 cards. The five Scavenger cards each list eight items that the player drawing it must collect. The other 40 cards are the items to be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 25 tokens, and antes one into the pot before each hand. The four players draw one Scavenger list card blind, and get dealt a hand of eight cards, with the remaining eight stacked face down in the gutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn a player may either trade (offering one or two cards from his hand for an equal number from any player) or snoop by drawing one or two cards from the gutter, paying a token into the pot, and discarding an equal number of cards from his hand, face down, to the bottom of the gutter pile. Each player in a trade decides which card(s) to give up and passes them without declaring what they are. Players may not refuse a trade offer, even if they have to give up a card they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete his full scavenging list of eight items wins the hand and takes the pot. The game can continue as long as players desire (and have tokens left). The game can be played with 2 or 3 players by eliminating one scavenger card and its set of 8 objects per player less than four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
