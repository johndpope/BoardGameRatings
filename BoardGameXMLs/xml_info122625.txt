			<description>2 Player game with fantasy theme that combines chess with worker placement.  Minions of 8 types are used as both chess pieces, some with unique moves, and also as workers. Each round players take turns placing their minions into the 16 available Tower Chambers. Each chamber holds a distinct Mage that grants a special power, such as adding a minion to the board or moving a specific type of minion on the board. Players then take turns removing their minions from the tower to activate these powers. 12 chaos mages are available to mix things up. Win by capturing your opponents greater minions or by wiping him off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
