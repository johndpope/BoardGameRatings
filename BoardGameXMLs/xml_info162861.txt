			<description>Full Mojo Rampage is a roguelike game that takes place within the confines of the Voodoo reality. In this realm only the most powerful rites and powers can provide a safeguard against evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a voodoo apprentice hungry for knowledge and ready to perform deeds for the voodoo gods known as &amp;ldquo;Loa&amp;rdquo;. Through helping them you will gain their favor and trust. Your first quest requires you to help the mighty Baron Samedi. Samedi is known for his love of women, good tobacco and for drinking more rum than anyone. Last night he got too drunk and turned a safe ritual into a mess. Hordes of enemies are entering the world and he needs your help to clean up for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
