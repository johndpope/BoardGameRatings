							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">EMPIRES: Fate of a World</name>
									
			<description>How does an empire grow from a nomadic tribe of spear-wielding cave people into the greatest civilization of all? Is an empire forged though might and battle? Through enlightenment and culture? Or through the amassing of great and undeniable wealth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course of history is up to you!  Guide your empire from its beginnings into a futuristic nation of leaders!  Wipe out any who stand in your way, or absorb their territories into yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMPIRES: FATE OF A WORLD is a strategy game for 2 to 4 players where each player represents a civilization in its infancy,  owning nothing more than a small settlement and an explorer unit.  Through the use of Development Cards (Archery, Railroads, Robotics, and the like), players sculpt their civilizations.  Over time, settlements become cities, explorers give way to armies, and eventually, one Empire will emerge as the greatest of all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMPIRES: FATE OF A WORLD is played out on a world map board, with wooden tokens representing settlements, cities, and units.  In addition, each player has a development mat where he or she plays Development Cards that shape the Empire.  How a player achieves victory is completely up to them: Wealth, Culture, or Might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a combination of skill, strategy, and luck, EMPIRES: FATE OF A WORLD is perfect for anyone with their sights set on ruling the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please visit the game site for more details!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/empires-fate-of-a-world&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/empires-fate-of-a-world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
