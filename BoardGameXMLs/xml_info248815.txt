							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grim Reaple (fan expansion to Carcassonne)</name>
									
			<description>When the grave yard tile is laid, the Grim Reaple comes into play. The Grim Reaple reaps one meeple. This is done in a certain order. First, the Reaple takes the closest robber on a road that touches the grave yard. If there is no robber, then the Reaple takes a knight or mayor from a city that is contingent to the graveyard or is connected to the graveyard by road. If there is no knight or mayor in a city connected to the graveyard, then the Reaple takes a monk from a cloister or abbey that is contingent to or in the same field as the grave yard. Lastly, as a professional courtesy to a meeple that uses the same tool of the trade, and a monk is not present in a contingent cloister/abbey, the Reaple takes a farmer from a field that touches the graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approved by carcassonnecentral and carcassonne-forum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
