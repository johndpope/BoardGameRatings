			<description>Silvanus is a co-operative 2 player card game in which players are spiders with human like battle tactics. The goal is to survive to game end, possibly carrying remaining health to a more challenging scenario. Threats deal a sequence of colored card icons which must be matched in a given time for success. This is accomplished with small icon decks called &amp;quot;Halots&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action action decks contain either enemies or Items that can be gathered to help in encounters. At certain points of the game, &amp;quot;Happenstance&amp;quot; cards will sometimes hinder players actions whereas Character cards present helpful traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silvanus is a versatile game, many of the components can be added or adjusted to fit a desired difficulty for players. There are optional modes of play such as allotted moves instead of real time play, and more. Short story snippets are included in the rules to give players a glimpse of Silvanus lore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
