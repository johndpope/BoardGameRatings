			<description>The second generation Game Link Cables came in a few varieties, but each serves the same purpose. The first was called the Game Boy Pocket Game Link Cable (model MGB-008), and was designed to be used with the Game Boy Pocket. The MGB-008 was the only Game Link cable to be white in color, and may have only been released in Japan. The MGB-008 features the smaller second generation connectors on both ends, allowing two Game Boy Pockets to link.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Game Link Cable&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
