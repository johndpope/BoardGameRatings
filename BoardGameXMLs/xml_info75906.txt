							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadliest Warrior: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Deadliest Warrior: The Game is a fighting game based on the Spike documentary TV series Deadliest Warrior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game pits two warriors from different time periods in head-to-head combat in an open arena. Each warrior features different attributes which players must adapt their playing style with in order to fight effectively. For example, the Ninja is quick and nimble but is equipped with very weak armor, while warriors such as the Spartan or Knight are able to carry heavy shields that give them extra protection against attacks while sacrificing speed and agility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features realistic weapons damage that can cause amputation of limbs and instantly fatal wounds; subsequently fights may last as little as a few seconds. It is also possible to simply wound a warrior's limb rather than amputate it, impacting their ability to perform certain combos and negating any ability to carry shields. Because of this, the game has drawn comparisons with Bushido Blade, a fighting game known for featuring brief fights because of its realistic weapon-based combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features online versus and tournament multiplayer modes, as well as a number of single player minigames such as slicing up pig carcasses against a time limit and surviving waves of opponents on a single life bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Deadliest Warrior: The Game,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
