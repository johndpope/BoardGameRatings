			<description>Cat &amp;amp; Mouse is a simple roll-and-move game where players roll a die to move around a square board with an inward spiral track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in the lead, the other players are chasing you from the board, thus naming the lead marble the Mouse and all the other players the Cats. The Cats are chasing the Mouse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the luck of an opponent's roll, they can bump you back to the beginning and replace you as reigning Mouse of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
