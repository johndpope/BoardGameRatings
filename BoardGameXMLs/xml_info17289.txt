							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stellar Journey</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Far beyond the Milky Way, undisturbed for billions of years, lies a vast, cold cloud of molecular hydrogen, helium, and dust. Penetrating shock waves from a distant supernova or a close encounter with a passing star disrupts the cloud, setting its gases and dust in motion. Forcibly separated into numerous fragments, the gigantic cloud is transformed into an immense stellar nursery from which hundreds of bright, shining stars will emerge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play STELLAR JOURNEY: The Game, each player gathers &amp;quot;mass&amp;quot; to form three stars, plus &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; for each to evolve through all stages from beginning to end. The first player to complete the life cycles of all three - ending in a white dwarf, a neutron star, and a black hole - wins! Whether new to astronomy or a veteran stargazer, whether competing with family, friends, or classmates, whether young or old, STELLAR JOURNEY: The Game is certain to provide hours of wholesome fun, learning, and adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STELLAR JOURNEY: The Game &lt;br/&gt;Simulates star birth from nursery to end stages &lt;br/&gt;Four levels of difficulty permitting players to compete at their own level &lt;br/&gt;No regressive plays - lose your next turn, etc. &lt;br/&gt;GAME CONTENTS:&lt;br/&gt;Game board; game pieces; sixty colorful cards presenting a total of 300 questions at four levels of difficulty; and a booklet containing the rules of play, record charts, game objectives, match to the National Science Education Standards, image credits, and glossary.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stellar Journey: The game was developed in cooperation with NASA'S Chandra X-ray Center and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and The Wright Center for Innovative Science Education, Tufts University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
