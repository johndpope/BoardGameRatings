			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the State of the Art&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want a full-length portrait for your character sheet or a Light Infantry counter for your wargame, the Character Artist Pro add-on for CC3 is the tool for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Artist Pro lets you create attractive, high-quality portraits of characters for your games. Building characters is simple. Select from the basic races such as human, elf and dwarf, or choose horrific humanoid monsters. Just click on icons to choose the race and sex, then select body parts and clothes to build your portrait. One mouse click to choose, then another to place, and you've added the feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Artist Pro gives you superb control of the color and dimensions of your creations. Want a purple-skinned bug-headed alien? No problem. Need a wide, squat warrior? Just rescale. Add weapons, armour and containers, and your character is kitted out for adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you've made your character, you can place a high-quality image onto your character sheet. You can add your portraits to counters, create silhouettes or make stand-up card figures. Character Artist Pro makes it easy to add useful information like armour type or hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Artist Pro also includes many pre-generated characters, and some beautifully drawn monsters, treasure and magical effects artwork. Combine these with your portraits to enhance any fantasy art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 17,000 beautiful symbols.&lt;br/&gt;Character Artist Pro is the state of the art!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
