							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starship Bridge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 24 x 20 inch map of a Starship Bridge, and includes the VTT (Virtual Table top) files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape sells a wide variety of space ships and science fiction map materials. For lower levels of a large starship such as this, our SciFi Floor Tiles can be placed down to make a level and then reconfigured to make new levels. Our Med Bay can be used as the medical treatment facility of the Starship. Our Repair Bay makes an excellent storage warehouse/repair level. Our Launch Bay can be used as the place the starship holds and launches shuttles and small fighters. Our SciFi Bars and SciFi Diner can be used as part of a level for recreation and relaxation. Our Cryo Room can be useful is this is a long distance starship where cold sleep would be necessary. Our free Junction Room can be used as one of the levels the aliens have damaged and can be used as one of the levels for the second half of Impulsive Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our SciFi Characters Miniatures figure flats can be used as the starship crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoy this freebie, our full ship designs such as The Basilisk Lander, The Tug, Vanguard and Vaztstar Shuttles, and The Valkyrie may be of interest to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hope to dissuade you from your present course of action. This species is primitive, barbaric, and militaristic. Even the slightest movement toward their vessel could be seen as an act of provocation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Bridge is an interior map of the lifts and bridge of a larger starship, suitable for the bridge command of a group of Player Characters. With thirteen computer stations, this bridge can fit a large group of Player Characters and their allied starship crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Bridge is intended for far future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impulsive Act: The captain of the starship approaches the vessel of a species known for warlike behavior slowly while hailing them to profess they are friendly and not hostile. As the large starship nears the alien vessel, it swings into action and rams the starship. Breeching tubes rip through the hull as alien marines fight their way to the lifts. The alien marines pour out of the lifts and try to take over the bridge. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the Player Characters to prevent the aliens from taking over the ship, first by fighting them off of the bridge, and then using the lifts to get to lower levels and drive them back to their ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
