			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Strings Attached is all you need to start your own FIASCO game based on the works of Jim Henson. Maybe you're a group of fuzzies racing cross-country in a stolen bus trying to save your local theater. Maybe you're trying to save you're buddy from running away and learn a lesson about friendship in the process. Maybe you're the last of an ancient race exploring dark twisting caverns to save the world. Maybe you've been stuck watching a crappy play for hours and have had enough. Maybe you are all of the above.....IN SPAAAAAACE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
