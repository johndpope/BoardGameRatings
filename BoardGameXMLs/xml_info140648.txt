							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Super Soldier</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Super Soldier is a patriot who is willing to give everything his has for his nation and its people. This character has risked his life by volunteering for a dangerous military experiment, an experiment designed to create the perfect warrior. He is not just a better fighter, he has become something that is slightly more than human. The Super Soldier's physical abilities have been pushed beyond the limits of what ordinary men can achieve. He is tougher and more resilient than any other soldier could ever be. Not only is he physically superior and dangerous in combat, but the Super Soldier also possesses a driving spirit and indomitable will. It is his incomparable courage and willingness to sacrifice that enables the Super Soldier to inspire awe and confidence in those who fight beside him. This 6 PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Haven: Full Metal Zero. Nobody does the d20 Modern espionage and spies better!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
