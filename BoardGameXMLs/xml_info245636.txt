			<description>&amp;quot;Stand up when you think the rice dish paella comes from Spain. Sit down if you think it comes from Greece!&amp;quot; Stand up Sit down With about 300 questions of this kind the quiz game brings &amp;quot;life in any children's party. The questions come from different areas of knowledge - from fairy tales to geography, from biology to history, always tailored to the knowledge level of primary school children. So that the reflection is however not too cramped, the stand-up sitting down rule brings additional momentum into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
