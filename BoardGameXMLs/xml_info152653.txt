							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jason Zaklan</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadly aces can be dangerous wildcards on the modern battlefield. Whether they fight for money or for a cause, these lone warriors can often sway the tide of battle by simply choosing a side and joining the fray. Hidden on the world of Homestead before the war with Hasek&amp;rsquo;s forces, Sang-Wei Jason Zaklan is one such warrior, an elite commando in service to the Celestial Throne. But when FedSuns mercenaries come calling ahead of schedule, and the local defenders resort to guerrilla war, will Zaklan risk his cover and fight them openly, or will he allow countrymen to die for the cause?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jason Zaklan is one of many warriors who have emerged from the fires of war to join the ranks of the notable elite, forging his reputation and his destiny with the aid of his custom Ti Ts'ang. This dossier file provides players with the background and description of one of the BattleTech universe&amp;rsquo;s upcoming elites, complete with character and BattleMech record sheets suitable for play with Total Warfare and A Time of War: The BattleTech Role-Playing Game. Bring Jason into the battles of the Youling Zhanshi (CAT# 35LP02A) for an even more legendary performance, or simply employ him in your own games as a valued ally&amp;mdash;or a deadly foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
