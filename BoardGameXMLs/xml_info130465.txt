			<description>This official Mayfair promo expansion was included as a convention and retail give-away on a tile sheet titled: Game Variants &amp;amp; Mini Expansions Set #1. It was also included in the Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This gives players the opportunity to potentially push two sleds on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;He sled, she sled&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Take a Fast Sled token and place it behind your screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nominate Another Sled:&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, after a sled is pushed or pyramid stone is lifted, you may use and discard your fast sled token to nominate and push an additional sled. This token may only be used to push a sled, it may not be used to lift. If another player has used his/her sled token this round, then you can not use your token until the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End:&lt;br/&gt;If the game ends without the completion of the pyramid and you still have your Fast Sled token, you are eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
