							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle (also known as SWAT3  or SWAT3:CQB) is a tactical squad-based first-person shooter, developed by Sierra Northwest and published by parent Sierra Entertainment for the PC on November 23, 1999. SWAT3 remains the biggest selling title of the SWAT series, and is the only member of the SWAT series to come close to the popularity of the earlier titles of the Police Quest series, from which it originated although it's the first game in the series which omits the name Police Quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the first first-person shooter of the Police Quest/SWAT games, SWAT3 received a new game engine with cell and portal technologies for simulation of environments, and advanced AI and ballistics. The developers spent some time with LAPD SWAT, studying tactics in order to create an accurate, realistic simulation. Most of the animations in the game were motion captured, acted out by a SWAT officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of a Los Angeles Police Department SWAT element leader, in command of a five-man element. Over a number of missions, the player has to defend the city from violent criminals, terrorists and the threat of a nuclear weapon, and prevent disruption of an important treaty signing. The game also features multiplayer including traditional Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch modes in addition to Paintball mode and Cooperative play through the single player missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SWAT 3 was succeeded by SWAT 4 in April 2005, development and publishing being transferred to Irrational Games and Sierra owner Vivendi Universal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name indicates, the game is based on CQB  tactics. The player is in charge of a 5-man SWAT element, and unlike other tactical shooters, such as the comparable Rainbow Six games, the player is a police  officer; therefore arresting rather than simply shooting suspects on sight is the primary objective. The improper use of deadly force (when a suspect is wounded and unable to use weapons, has surrendered or poses no threat) is penalized in the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SWAT_3,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
