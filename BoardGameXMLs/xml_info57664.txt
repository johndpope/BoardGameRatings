							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Body Link</name>
									
			<description>Bodylink attempts to help students learn to integrate their knowledge of the various components of human physiology. These components, body parts, body systems, and body processes are often taught as independent units. In reality, they comprise an intricate pattern of interlocking relationships. No single entity stands alone. Instead, each entity has a multitude of connections to other entities and systems. The game is designed to graphically display this web of relationships. Body parts are linked to related body processes, grouped with common system entities, and connected to other body parts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to gain points by grouping together tiles of body parts and body activities according to physiological relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
