			<description>from 1KM1KT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viento Libre - Fantasy Steampunk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VientoLibre is the most modern aircraft from Wandering Realms, the sum of the combined efforts of the more advanced (and explosive) Goblin technology, the delicate and precise inventive Nisse, elemental magic of Fay and the powerful Soul Sorcery of humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four kingdoms have made sail to the VientoLibre to find out why the Wandering Realms have lost their way across the Ocean of the Four Winds, being isolated from the Lower Continents after the dense curtain of mist floating around the floating archipelago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flying ship sailed with a combined crew of four races, that despite their differences and difficulties have been an uneasy truce in search of the truth of the outside world. But each faction has its own agenda on the ship, and now that they are isolated in the mist &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will they be able to work together to find the solution to the mystery, or fight each other for control?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
