			<description>Swing Away Golf, also known as 3D Golf and known in other regions as Golf Paradise (ゴルフパラダイス Gorufuparadaisu?), is a sports game developed by T&amp;amp;E Soft for the PlayStation 2. Borrowing its concept from Sony's Hot Shots Golf franchise (known in Japan as Everybody's Golf), a sports game franchise, Swing Away Golf was first shown as a launch title for the system at the PlayStation Festival in 2000 and released by Electronic Arts that same year. The game was critically well received, receiving an aggregate score of 76.28% from GameRankings based on 27 reviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game borrows its elements from Hot Shots Golf, another sports game. In comparison, There are numerous gameplay modes available to the player including a story mode and other single player and multiplayer settings that are pretty much on par with what players would expect from a golf game on a console. The game lets players pick from one of seven different character models to begin the career with. And instead of giving players a preset skill level for each of these characters, it allows players to determine their skill by distributing Skill Points for Distance, Accuracy, Control and Recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Swing Away Golf&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
