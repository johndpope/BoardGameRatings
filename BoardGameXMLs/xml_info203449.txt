			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3D Control Pad, called the Sega Multi Controller in Japan and the Joystick 3D in Brazil, is a control pad developed for use with the Sega Saturn. Debuting with NiGHTS into Dreams, it was Sega's answer to the then revolutionary Nintendo 64 controller, which featured an analogue stick as opposed to relying solely on D-Pads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analogue sticks generally allow for greater precision in a 3D environment, which in 1996 were becoming more common in the console video game market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
