			<description>Literumi is a 4 player partnership trick-taking game, similar to Bridge or Spades, but with a word-making twist, like Scrabble or Bananagrams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in Literumi requires critical thinking, careful planning, deliberate teamwork and a quick wit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, teams bid with the number of words they think they can make. The winner of the bid gets to call trump, but they have to complete their contract to make any points. Then teams take tricks, to get as many letters as possible. Finally, both teams have two minutes to turn those letters into words. The more words you make, the more points you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
