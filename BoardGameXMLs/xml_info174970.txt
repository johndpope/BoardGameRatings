							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Edge</name>
									
			<description>The Edge is a skirmish scaled 35 mm wargame set in the post-apocalyptic world with medieval and steampunk aesthetic influences. It&amp;rsquo;s mechanic combines the traditional wargame approach and solutions from mana-based card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world destroyed by cataclysmic Judgement Day that left behind not only havoc and desolation, but also beneficial crystals and mysterious portals, remnants of humanity are unified under the authoritative rule of The Chapter, the priesthood of The One, a god of technology, defending humanity against Demons, conquerors of whole worlds, which one day came out of the portals. In the bloody war that followed, from the dead human bodies, broken machine parts and power of the crystals new entity was born by ominous and barely understood method &amp;ndash; The Faceless, beings deprived of autonomic consciousness and emotions, devouring both metal and flesh, through which implementations every creature evolves on its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The humanity found a way to use the scattered crystals to create and empower mechanical blessings of The One, but the Demons have their own reasons to gather them and even The Faceless have their purpose to seek the crystals, as the power that dwells in them is fueling the hulks of their physical forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
