							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero Realms: Necromancer Promo &amp; 4 Zombie Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is an exclusive promo for Hero Realms Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Necromancer is a champion that can put a zombie token into play every turn! These zombies are also champions, but because they are tokens, when they die they removed from the game instead of going into your discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can keep your Necromancer out for a few turns, you can build up a deadly swarm of zombies to attack your opponent. She isn't particularly tough, so you'll want to get some guards to protect her while she works her evil magic. (A guard is a champion that protects you and your other champions, like an outpost in Star Realms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
