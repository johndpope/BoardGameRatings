							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Per&#039;s Gadgets and Computers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A corner store in the station&amp;rsquo;s shopping district, Per&amp;rsquo;s Gadgets and Computers (PGC) looks like any other technology store at first glance. Looking more closely, however, one discovers a large variety of unique and useful gadgets in addition to the standard tech gear and computer hardware. Many of the items for sale are unique and designed and created by Per himself. Are you looking for something a little off the beaten path? Do you have an idea for a device that would make your life easier? PGC is the place to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you take that annoying cousin that is always talking about the latest technology and gadgets and combine him with that old crazy uncle that is always telling wild, impossible-seeming stories, that's Per Arnoldson. He is obsessed with the newest gear and tech and always like to talk about it and show it off. The difference is that while your cousin may talk big and not really know much and you're pretty sure your uncle's stories are complete fabrications, Per knows his stuff and the stories are probably true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
