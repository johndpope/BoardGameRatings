			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the eerie winter mist came a nightmarish rumble... Tigers in the snow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On December 16, 1944--in the twilight of his Third Reich--Hitler played his last desperate hand and launched a massive surprise assault against the thin Allied lines in the Ardennes forest of Belgium and Luxemborg. This began the Battle of the Bulge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The German infantry and armor units did enough damage and covered enough ground in the next three days to cause near panic among the American generals. While the Allied forces regrouped and reinforcements prepared to move in, the Germans rumbled steadily toward the Meuse River and the open ground on the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, shortages of fuel and supplies seriously impeded Hitler's advance, and his troops never reached the Meuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How would the Germans have fared if they had been led by a clear-thinking strategist such as yourself rather than a madman? On the other hand, would the German units have gotten as far as they did if the Allies had been under your command instead of the American generals?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's your chance to find out in this realistic and entertaining simulation of the Battle of the Bulge....Tigers in the Snow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Tactical Design Group&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
