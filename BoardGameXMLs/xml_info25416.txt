			<description>The game consists of a deck of thirty-two oversized playing cards. Each card depicts a sheriff, a gunman or an ordinary cowboy. Each player is dealt a card and looks at it secretly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it is a player's turn, that player returns the card to the bottom of the pile and draws another if it is not a gunman or a sheriff. If a player has a gunman, that player can choose to eliminate another player by saying, &amp;quot;Stick 'em Up!&amp;quot; If the chosen player responds by revealing a card whose cowboy doesn't have his hands up that player is eliminated. Responding with a gunman or sheriff eliminates the player who is taking a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player reveals a sheriff on his turn, all players holding gunmen are out of the game. The last player remaining is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
