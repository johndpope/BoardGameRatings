			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Australian troops had, at Milne Bay in New Guinea, inflicted on the Japanese their first undoubted defeat on land. Some of us may forget that of all the Allies it was the Australian soldiers who first broke the spell of the invincibility of the Japanese Army.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Field Marshall Sir William Slim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeated at sea in the battle of the Coral Sea in May and then distracted by the US Marine Corps landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese High Command was forced to change its plans for New Guinea. After diverting the previously allocated Army regiment to reinforce Guadacanal, it fell to the Navy to gather a scratch force to capture the &amp;quot;lightly defended&amp;quot; airfield on the eastern tip of New Guinea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for Japanese plans, those months of delays allowed Australia to finish assembling a brigade of Militia at Milne Bay during July, then rush a veteran AIF brigade there shortly before the Japanese landings commenced on August 25th, 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several scenarios are included in Milne Bay to allow players to explore different Australian and Japanese plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
