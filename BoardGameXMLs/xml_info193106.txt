			<description>Pento is a light-weight casual card game for 3 to 6 players. A game can be played in under 30 minutes and offers a lot of replayability. Between the special card actions and ever-changing teams, there's always many ways for you to score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pento is a all about scoring points with your team, but those teams are always changing! Play cards to your collection for points, or swap teams during your turn. At the end of the round, teams only score the points of the highest scoring player, so plan carefully! Low-scoring players are often seeking to get on a better team, while high-scoring players are looking to go it alone. We call this Team Chasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you have the opportunity to change which team you are on by playing cards from your hand. Choose your team wisely: some cards only let you swap cards with opponents, but you also score together with your team at the end of the round. Balance these needs and you'll come out on top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
