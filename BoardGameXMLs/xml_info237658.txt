			<description>The night is dark. Clouds roll across the moon, leaving shadows creeping across the streets. The darkness and silence are peaceful, until the vague prickling at the back of your neck, the slight movements out of the corner of your eye make you realize...something is following you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something is Following You is a quick RPG meant for two people. It is meant to be played while out for a walk, but you could play it at a table instead. The premise is simple; a person is out walking, alone in a lonely place, when they realize someone or something is sneakily following them. Something unnatural. The pursued seeks to find out what is chasing them, and evade it or confront and defeat it. (Or maybe make friends with it &amp;ndash; anything is possible!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
