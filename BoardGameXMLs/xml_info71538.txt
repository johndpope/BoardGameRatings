			<description>The pdf. file containing the complete rules and game components can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World Turtle Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a brief description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to complete sequences of symbols by flipping over the correct tiles on the board.  Each tile that is flipped over correctly rewards the player with 1 point.  However, if the tile is one of that player's previously placed tiles the player gets 0 points.  Once a sequence is complete that player places their tile on the board and changes the location of one other tile on the board.  In this way the location of specific tiles changes throughout the game.  At the end of the game each player is given 2 additional points for each tile they have placed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
