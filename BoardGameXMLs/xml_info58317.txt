			<description>The game consists of an unusual game board which is actually a transparent screen with black color inside. By pushing the black color to the sides, one can see through.&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, 20 symbol tiles are placed under the night sky. Everyone tries to remember their positions, then they are covered by the night. The players then draw task cards which show three of the symbols, then push the black color aside to display those three symbols shining in the night. When a mistake is made, a countdown starts (one of 20 cards is flipped over). When all 20 cards are flipped over before the players managed to fulfill 7 task cards, everyone loses. If not, everyone wins. &lt;br/&gt;Several playing variants are given in the rule booklet, focusing on either opening right symbols or drawing pictures which others have to recognize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
