							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Campaign Book, Volume I: Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>Subtitled: &amp;quot;A compendium of outlines to help you create your own fantasy role-playing campaigns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;And not just one campaign, but six!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the campaigns details a unique setting, important NPCs, and a complete storyline with outlines of at least a half-dozen adventures.  Each of the campaign settings builds the story to a climatic [sic] finale, but that doesn't mean the campaign is over.  Each of the settings is rich enough to allow for many future stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Enter Astria, Realm of Faerie and help a prince regain his throne.&lt;br/&gt;     An entire race that exists only in the minds of the Dreamers is being threatened by a powerful extradimensional sorceress.&lt;br/&gt;     As ambassadors to a new land, you are outraged to find your people's most hated enemies already negotiating with the newly discovered culture.&lt;br/&gt;     As faithful servants of the Emperor, it is your duty to root out treachery and treason wherever you find it.  Word of revolt is spreading through the Empire ...&lt;br/&gt;     An angry Merqueen is destroying the shipping trade that your homeland depends upon.&lt;br/&gt;     A mysterious and powerful spirit has chosen you to act on its behalf in a war-torn world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
