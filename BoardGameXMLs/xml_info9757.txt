							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Count Your Blessings</name>
									
			<description>Count Your Blessings is a board game that takes players through life, encouraging them to accomplish certain things for spiritual gain while managing their finances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to roll a die and move their tokens, executing instructions on the space their tokens land on.  Most of the time, they have to pay money, which is usually gained from the &amp;quot;Pay Day&amp;quot; space.  Players can also buy businesses and earn income from other players who land on those spaces.  Loans can be taken if money is insufficient, but too many loans lead to bankruptcy, which will hurt a player's final score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blessings, used for scoring, are mostly gained by achieving accomplishments.  Most accomplishments (getting a diploma, attending church, etc) are gained by landing on the spaces required.  Some require players to have visited another space (e.g. to get married, one must land on &amp;quot;BYU Square&amp;quot;, pay $15,000, then proceed to the &amp;quot;Temple Square&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When landing on a Spice of Life space, players draw a card and follow the instructions printed, which can be beneficial or detrimental.  Some cards offer choices: a player can either gain cash or Blessings, or possibly mull over which to sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blessings are scored for a player when he or she lands on the &amp;quot;Interview Square&amp;quot;.  The game ends when a player has three Interviews; the player with the highest total score (from three Interviews) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1985 version by Ungame is simpler in design.  It has fewer spaces on the board and does not have events that require players to track to different spaces to gain Blessings.  The first player to obtain a Gospel card (obtained by landing on a square) and have at least 50 Blessings (the number can be adjusted on agreement) wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
