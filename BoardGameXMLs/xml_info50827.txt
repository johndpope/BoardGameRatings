			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first glance, The Edge is a city like any other, filled with establishments from investment firms to nightclubs. But if you scratch under the surface, you'll find things not typical of New York, London or Tokyo: an investment firm run by a 14th century alchemist who discovered the secret elixir of eternal life; a nightclub in the form of a suburban home, complete with what seems to be a perfectly ordinary family to bake you muffins and watch sports on TV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Your Service is a sourcebook of Al Amarjan locations for Over the Edge, the classic roleplaying game of surreal danger. It features nearly three dozen unique establishments in the Edge and environs, from Ahmad's Computer Shack in Science Barrio, to the notoriously haunted Wind Farm just outside the city. As a resource for Game Moderators, it features developed locations that can be dropped into play on the spur of the moment, including detailed NPCs, plus story ideas to inspire plots involving the player characters. It's a gold mine of ideas for any modern game setting involving the unusual and supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
