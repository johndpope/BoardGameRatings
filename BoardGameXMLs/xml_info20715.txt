			<description>The year is 2340.  Just as in all of history, conquest is at the heart of mankind.  Enslave or become a slave is the future.  You are in charge of breaking through the wall of your enemy&amp;rsquo;s city to allow the entry of your battalion to take over.  Organic Titazium metal (O37T2y) has been used in the construction of all walls during this time period, which makes them virtually impenetrable.  The wall cubes must be removed carefully or the wall structure will collapse and repair itself thus defeating your mission.  While you are attacking the walls of your enemy, they in turn are attacking you.  By using limited means, you must minimize the damage directed to your city.  Victory belongs to he who enters the city first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
