			<description>Interrupt is a 2-7 player connection-style game using differently shaped 3d wooden blocks. The objective of the game is to create a continuous connection with one set of blocks that spans the length of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a modular square; prior to the game players place &amp;quot;terrain&amp;quot; upon the board using neutral blocks. Each player then must decide how to bridge and/or tunnel through pieces to reach the other side. Once per turn, a player may either place a new piece into play or move one of their existing pieces on the board, as long as it isn't trapped by an opponent's piece. Alternatively, players can use a small selection of &amp;quot;wildcard&amp;quot; pieces that provide a connection for all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game is won once the first person successfully bridges the board with no edge connections between pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple rule variants possible - this is a family of games about building geometric connections in 3d space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
