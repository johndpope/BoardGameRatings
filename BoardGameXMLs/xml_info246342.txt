			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIMBER! is an action-packed arcade style game with multiple levels of play and difficulty. You're Blackjack Daniels, the greatest lumberjack that ever set foot into an ATARI computer! Imagine yourself in the deep dark forest chopping down trees for the Upland Logging Corporation. Your boss has sent you on a very important mission and your job depends on the successful completion of that mission. You are to clear the forest, chopping down trees into cords so that the logging trucks may easily transport them to the mill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But things aren't as rosy as you thought they might be. You've noticed several forest creatures looking at you as you're trying to meet your logging deadline. Some of them are downright unfriendly looking! You quickly realize that you will be short of your quota of trees in this area, and you'll need to move on to a new woodland area to get enough trees downed. But, everywhere you tum, you see snakes, bears, and other forest creatures. To top everything off, your ax is getting dull and you're finding out that you must hit the &amp;quot;sweet&amp;quot; part of the tree to make it fall. Time is running out! You must race on to meet the deadline. You quickly enter a mole hole as a snake is about to strike and find out that it comes out in another part of the forest. In fact, there are mole holes all around you and by jumping into them, you find shortcuts to other parts of the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't swim and the river is flowing rapidly. You know that your only way to get to the trees on the other side of the river is to cross the bridge. You look around. Oh! Here comes a bear. You quickly cross the bridge and you're temporarily saved from the bear. By the way, I'm the boss now and I need someone to perform an emergency mission for me. Will you be brave enough to try it? TIMBER! is all machine language. Requires 40K RAM, a disk drive and I joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
