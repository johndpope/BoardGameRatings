							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TRS-80 Space War</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRS-80 Space War combines logic with luck into an exciting space simulation. Imagine yourself the captain of a Federation starship! Your mission is to destroy three Klingon vessels which have invaded your space sector. A Klingon ship is hidden in one of the 48 quadrants which comprise the sector. You may fire into a quadrant by entering the desired coordinates (coordinates are given on a sector map). If a Klingon is in your target quadrant, you will destroy him. If not, you will be given a &amp;quot;Trajectory Analysis&amp;quot; on which to base your next shot. Remember, the Klingons may fire at you at any moment! If they do, the odds are 1 to 4 that your ship will be destroyed. If your shields hold and the enemy's torpedo is deflected, the Klingon will immediately move to another quadrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
