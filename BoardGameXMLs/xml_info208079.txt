			<description>Box Back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 3D interactive animated adventure based on the hugely popular game phenomenon Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons from Wizards of the Coast, you walk side by side with the three heroes sent to prevent disaster. And thanks to groundbreaking interactive computer animated DVD movie technology, you direct the action and choose which of hundreds of possible storylines will unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, in a land ravaged by strife, an ancient race of mages created a terrible weapon called the Aryx Orthian, the Scourge of Worlds, an artifact capable of destroying all their enemies and putting an end to all wars. Now, after centuries of safe concealment, evil forces are on the verge of locating this dreadful artifact and unleashing its terrifying power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together Regdar the warrior, Lidda the rogue halfling and Mialee the elven wizard must face every kind of danger from terrifying beholders and bloodthirsty orcs to powerful druids sects and mysterious apparitions but it is you who will make their decisions and guide their hands. At critical points in the story you must choose whether to fight or flee, which path is best, and who to trust. Do old loyalties mean more than new friendships? Will you prevail by strength or by guile? Will the world be saved or consumed by an ancient evil?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 990 unique story combinations, more than 20 decision points and 4 different endings, the fate of the world is in your hands....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARE YOU READY FOR THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
