							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Torment: Tides of Numenera</name>
									
			<description>From the Developer Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single player, story-driven, isometric role-playing game. PC, Mac and Linux. DRM-free.&lt;br/&gt;Languages supported: English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torment: Tides of Numenera&amp;trade; continues the thematic legacy of the critically acclaimed Planescape: Torment&amp;trade;. Set in Monte Cook's new tabletop role-playing world, Numenera&amp;trade;, the newest Torment asks: What does one life matter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numenera's Ninth World is a fantastic vision of a world in which massive civilizations have risen and fallen - disappeared, transcended, overwhelmed, or destroyed - and left their cities, monuments, and artifacts behind. As each rose and fell, their achievements became part of the accumulated detritus of eons... but much of it did not decay. And now this assortment of ancient power is there for the taking, ever-present, underfoot. The humans of the Ninth World take and use what they can. They call these wonders (and horrors) the numenera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of these humans discovers a way to use the numenera to grow strong, to cheat death, to skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he discovers an unexpected side effect: You.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torment&amp;trade; is a game of complex and nuanced morality, deep and reactive choice and consequence, and immersion into a new and strange vision. You will chart a course through bizarre dimensions, across the face of a vastly different world. You will earn companions along the way, and discover their value - perhaps through their strengths, perhaps more literally by selling them. Throughout it all, you will choose a path that will lead inexorably to an ending that stems naturally from your actions, facing adversaries who harness powers beyond your comprehension, and who will ultimately force you to face yourself and answer the question: What does one life matter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
