			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Daring Tales of Adventure: Compendium 3 contains four two-fisted pulp adventures for the award-winning Savage Worlds roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a scientific mission to a previously unexplored island off the South American coast goes missing, it is up to the brave and fearless heroes to come to the rescue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all does not go well, for the rescuers soon become stranded on the mysterious, jungle-swathed island. Exploration brings the heroes into contact with degenerate tribesmen, ferocious beasts from a bygone age, deadly traps, and vile Nazis plague our heroes every step of the way. In Island of Terror can our heroes thwart the Nazis&amp;rsquo; dastardly plan?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where under the world are they! When last we left our intrepid heroes they were plummeting down a mine shaft inside an erupting volcano. Where have they ended up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With death lurking at every step of their journey, will the heroes have what it takes to survive the Kingdom of the Blood Gods?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for stiff upper lips and daring adventure as the heroes hit India! Hired by the Boston Museum to oversee the final stages of an archaeological dig, the heroes are quickly embroiled in a headlong series of predicaments orchestrated by the feared Thuggee cult as part of their dastardly plot to destabilize the British Raj.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the heroes save the British Empire from a major embarrassment, or will The Hands of Kali prevail?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s getting hot in Siberia! Chasing mobsters over a frozen Alaskan lake might be fun, but when an airplane suddenly drops from the sky and the heroes are attacked by Nazi rocket troops you know it&amp;rsquo;s not a normal day! And when a Russian priest staggers into their lives with a tale of a holy relic from Tunguska being sought by the Nazis, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a day to remember!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the adventurers uncover the Legacy of Tunguska?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
