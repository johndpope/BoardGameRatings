			<description>A card game based on a tactical battle in the Vietnam War. One player is responsible for defending a U.S. firebase, the other controls the attacking VC/NVA units. Each player uses a custom deck which is made up of cards representing combat units, fortifications, supply, tactics and morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players build hands of cards. The player with the hand having the highest combined force total wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who wins the most hands out of 9 wins the game, except that if either player wins 3 hands in a row then the game ends in a victory for that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
