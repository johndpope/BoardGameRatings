			<description>Welcome to Villa Villekulla (Pippi Longstocking's house)! Pippi has arranged an exciting treasure hunt for you and your opponents. The person to first find five different items in the garden, and return to Villa Villekulla wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a pretty simple game, based on one of the short-stories about Pippi, in which she invites Anika and Tommy over for her birthday, with treasure hunt, in which the guests ends up with the presents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to roll a die, and move along on the paths in the garden. There are several different paths through the garden, connecting the house and the five areas with treasures. Each area has treasures in a different color, and each player has to collect one treasure from each area, but in addition each treasure has to be different. You do not need to roll the exact amount to end on an area, as you can choose to stop once you reach an area. In addition there are spaces in which you have to draw a card, which will help or hinder you in your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
