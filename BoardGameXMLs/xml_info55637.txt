			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of God&lt;br/&gt;It sits at the crossroads of the world. Held by Islam, open to Christian pilgrims and longed for by the Children of Israel, Jerusalem is the magnet that draws three faiths to one place. It is here that East and West collide bloodily, where palmers from England and hashishin about their business can pass in the street. And it is here that Cainites gather, drawn by a power far greater than they can comprehend or fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afflicted by the Curse of Caine&lt;br/&gt;Enter Jerusalem by Night and learn its ways. Discover the ancient alliances and enmities that have outlasted kingdoms and Crusades. Meet the Cainites who have seen millennia from their perch atop Davids city, and pay them homage. But beware, for while everyone is drawn to Jerusalem, only one can possess it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Holy City Beckons&lt;br/&gt;They say that in 1099, when the Second Crusade took Jerusalem, the streets ran so deep with blood that a man on horseback would have his progress slowed by the flood. They say that the Cainites who followed the invaders went mad then, and that few who aided in the sack of the city were ever seen again. They also tell stories of ancient Cainites lurking in the Valley of Hinnom, where the lepers dwell, and of monstrous acts of faith and devotion, beneath the Temple Mount. They say many things about Jerusalem, for it is a place of wonder and faith, of blood and fear. And now its gates lie open. Enter, if you dare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bloody Past, A Legacy of Faith&lt;br/&gt;Jerusalem by Night is the complete guide to the Holy City in the Dark Medieval world. From the gates of the City to the Temple Mount, from David&amp;rsquo;s conquest to the uneasy truce between Saladin and Richard the Lion-Hearted, the whole city is here. Learn its secrets. Meet the Cainites who have dwelt here for centuries. Some have wandered, but always they return. For there is always, and always will be, Jerusalem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jerusalem by Night includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The history of the Holy City, from its prehistoric roots through the conquests, reconstructions and Crusades; &lt;br/&gt;     A complete roster of the vampiric denizens of Jerusalem, from the haughtiest Ventrue to the most humble Nosferatu;&lt;br/&gt;     A guide to the city's layout, a survival guide for religious Cainites and more!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
