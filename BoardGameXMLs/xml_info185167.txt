			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for four player characters of any level.  A Prison in Eastern Orland, Near the Ruins of Mt. Silverload.

Prior to the king&amp;rsquo;s death, however, the crown prince and his family were brutally slain while traveling by a band of wandering Orlandish mercenaries.  Groups of elite dwarven warriors were dispatched to capture or kill the murderers, and after several months one such group returned with the leader of the mercenary company as a prisoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nine-page PDF file is distributed in a ZIP archive that also contains five dungeon maps in JPG format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
