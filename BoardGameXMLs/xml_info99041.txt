			<description>DoDonPachi Dai Ou Jou is the fourth arcade game in Cave's DonPachi series. It is considered to be the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; sequel to DoDonPachi.[citation needed] Dai Ou Jou is renowned for both its level of difficulty and its highly refined gameplay. The &amp;quot;Dai Ou Jou&amp;quot; portion of the title translates as &amp;quot;peaceful death&amp;quot;, which is a wry reference to the overwhelming and frantic manner in which players meet their end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries have passed since the catastrophic war that almost cost the human race its complete annihilation at the hands of the deranged commander of the DonPachi Corps, a military squad of starfighter pilots known for their combat prowess and emotional detachment (as a result of the inhuman training they are subjected to - the first game being a prime example of it, with the trainee actually slaughtering comrades posing as the enemy); whatever remained of his genocidal army was gathered, transported to the Moon and sealed within a network of caves, left to rot away as the nightmares faded into legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The human race flourished again, to the point of colonizing the Moon itself, the megacity of Lunapolis being the hub of human activity on lunar soil. However, as time passed, the dormant machines reawakened, rebuilt, evolved: the undeground caverns of the planet swarmed with all sorts of advanced warmachines, and automated production facilities, at their core a heavily guarded platform where the ultimate fighting machine of the past, the mechanical bee Hibachi, was slowly being rebuilt. Still following their original programming, the machines broke the seal, invading the surface and quickly seizing control of the almost defenseless Lunapolis, its streets and facilities now completely overtaken and littered with heavy artillery emplacements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With little time to spare, the DonPachi Corps are reactivated, with enough time to build only two fighters; nevertheless, to each was bestowed the assistance of an Element Doll, highly evolved sentient droids (apparently widespread in human society by then, and treated as little more than slaves) capable of providing tactical data and enhancing the craft's own capabilities. Knowing that the mission is plausibly suicidal, the two attack ships are deployed on the Moon surface, just outside of Lunapolis, alone against a ruthless army of machines with a single objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controls in Dai Ou Jou are identical to the previous games in the series.[citation needed] The joystick (or controller on the PS2 version) moves the ship. Tapping button 1 fires standard shots, and holding button 1 fires the laser weapon. Pressing button 2 activates a hyper if one is available, or uses a bomb if no hypers are in stock. If the laser is active the bomb is an amplification of the laser weapon; otherwise it is an explosion that covers the screen. In all cases the player becomes invincible for a short period. There is also an option to enable button 3, which automatically fires only the standard shots, otherwise known as &amp;quot;auto(matic) fire&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dai Ou Jou follows the conventions of the previous game with only a few changes.[citation needed] The chaining system is intact and works in much the same way.[citation needed] Causing an enemy to explode fills a meter, and every enemy destroyed before the meter depletes adds to the current chain and again refills the meter. Holding the laser weapon over a large enemy will hold the meter steady and slowly accumulate hits. In this way it is possible to create a single chain out of any of the 5 stages, although this requires much practice and skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;DoDonPachi Dai Ou Jou&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
