			<description>A follow-up to Le Loto Des Odeurs, Le Loto Des Saveurs attempts to teach children about flavours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 30 jars with tiny candies, and 30 cards with images of the different flavours. Each turn, one jar is opened and each player gets a candy. They now try to identify the flavour as quickly as possible. A player that wants to make a guess grabs the corresponding card, after which his guess is verified by the game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player who has guessed the most flavours correctly at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
