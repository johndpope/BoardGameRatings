							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alienish</name>
									
			<description>The aliens are coming! Are they coming in peace? Have they abducted anyone famous? Who is the best rock band in the galaxy? We need answers and we need them now. This is why we train you as our diplomat for the upcoming galactic council. However, only those who master the exotic alien language will represent us humans, as a minor slip of a tongue can turn a space flight into a space fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alienish is a game of mastering alien languages. You and your rival diplomats are trying to learn an alien language. Be the first to correctly pronounce the alien symbols on the flash cards to gain fluency points. Make a mistake, and you lose fluency points. In the first round, a pronunciation table helps you read the foreign letters the right way. However, in the second round, this table is hidden and you must rely on your memory. The diplomat who has the most fluency points at the end of the second round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
