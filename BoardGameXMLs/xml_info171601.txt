They can take initiatives in several areas&amp;mdash;economic, social, military, domestic and foreign policy, environment, culture, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the countries of the world are represented, with their variables and their own modes of functioning. &lt;br/&gt;The game includes phases for economic management, trade, wargame, construction, espionage, simulation, and political manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two game modes are available :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Global competition, mode that can be played solo or with multiple players, which sets 16 great nations against each other (played by artificial intelligence or other human players).
