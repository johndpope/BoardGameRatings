			<description>These rules are designed to simulate land combat in North America during the French and Indian Wars, 1744-1766.  The rules are geared to lower intensity warfare from skirmish level to brigade-sized actions.  They may also be extended to the frontier warfare of the previous century as well as the era of the American War of Independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The style of the rules are &amp;quot;Old School&amp;quot; in the sense of relatively high figure density with considerable attention to actual unit organization.  Extensive notes and information are provided in the rules book on units such as Scottish Highlanders, American Rangers, Canadian Militia, and Indian Allies among others.  The rules also include such &amp;quot;chrome&amp;quot; elements as &amp;quot;How to Portray an Eighteenth Century Leader&amp;quot; (Chapter 4) as well as rules for colonial sieges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules set concludes with the design for a campaign game set during the struggle for Lake George in New York state.  An area map is also provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
