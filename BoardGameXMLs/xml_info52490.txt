							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phoenix Command Mechanized Playing Aids</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Playing Aid Counters streamline play of the Phoenix Command Mechanized Combat System, so players can run a Scenario with a minimum of record keeping. Instead of using Status Sheets, players just put Counters directly on the playing surface to keep track of what is happening. Included are Counters for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Vehicle Speeds&lt;br/&gt;- Aim Times&lt;br/&gt;- Vehicle Status, including Abandoned, Burning, Mobility Kill, Gun Kill, and others&lt;br/&gt;- Hull Down and Turret Down Positions&lt;br/&gt;- Missiles and Artillery Strikes&lt;br/&gt;- Spotting&lt;br/&gt;- Infantry Movement, Fire, Morale, and Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 500 Counters are included, providing markers for dozens of Vehicles and their supporting Infantry. There is also a Tip Sheet, with guidelines for Mechanized play and Scenarios, as well as how to use the Counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
