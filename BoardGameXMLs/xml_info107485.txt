			<description>Battle Grand Prix (バトルグランプリ, &amp;quot;Battle Grand Prix&amp;quot;) is a Formula One racing video game in which one or two players can pit themselves in three Grand Prix races. Graphically, this game is not up to par with other hits such as Mario Kart. Each of the different team cars have different color schemes. The courses also vary from blacktop to concrete, which lends to the feeling of driving in unique places like Toronto and Iceland. Rain is also included and is implemented in a realistic manner for the game's era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can pick from 40 fictional drivers and 24 teams to play with. The game is always shown in split-screen mode, even when the player is playing on his own, in this case the opponent directly behind or ahead of the player is shown in the other window. Car settings can be adjusted in the garage. Pit stops can be used to repair the car during a race. Crashing the car can also force the player to retire from the race early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game the player can choose from four game modes: Survival - Finish at or lower than a certain position (determined by your difficulty) to continue to the next race, Champion(ship), VS, and Slot - In this game mode steering happens automatically. The only thing the players need to concern themselves with is the gas and brake pedals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features three difficulty levels: Beginner, Pro and Expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle Grand Prix&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
