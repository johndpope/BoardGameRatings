			<description>Splittin Infinitives is a space-strategy board game where each player takes command of an entire race and attempts to conquer the galaxy by military force, colonial expansion, superior technology, underhanded politics, or any combination of the above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of space-tiles each with a different geography laid out randomly, and each player has their own space fleet and starting technology.  A technology deck describes the various technological advances players can get.  Older races begin with more tech, younger races can acquire more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beginning of the game is primarily exploration and colonization using the star-fleet, dealing with random anomalies in space such as black holes, or space-pirates.  Once players make 1st contact, then military force and star fleets, and the political deck, come into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most colonies on the board when the last planet in the galaxy is colonized.  Planets are also drawn from a random deck, each with different difficulty ratings, mineral wealth and population maxima.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splittin Infinitives is suitable for an afternoon's or evening's gaming.  The various decks give variety, and keep it light-hearted, while the base allows for strategic serious play.  The rules are simple enough to fit on one page, and it can be played right out of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
