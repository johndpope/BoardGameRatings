			<description>This is a trick-taking game that uses one of the decks of dual value cards produced by Clever Playing Cards. Each card has two different values, with a solid suit for one value and a different hollow suit for the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wizard fashion, the number of cards dealt to each player increases with each round, although by two instead of by one, beginning with four cards in the first round and ending with a final round of twelve cards. Players play the solid suit until half the cards have been used in a round, then switch to the hollow suit for the remaining tricks in the round. Each trick taken is worth a point. The player with the most points after five rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
