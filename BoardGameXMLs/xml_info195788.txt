			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a series of grisly murders rocks the village of Markle on the eve of a momentous Gala, the Party finds themselves drafted into the roles of detectives! Charged with finding the culprit at all cost, their only suspect has a few holes in his Alibi&amp;hellip; and his upholstery! Buttons the Dragon, former plaything of the Lady Markle and current town mascot has apparently gone rouge; and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the party to stop him! Despite the obvious clues, things just don&amp;rsquo;t add up. Could an enchanted stuffed animal really be the culprit? Exactly what is happening in the Tower of the old keep? And just why do all the witnesses keep acting so weird? With time running out, the Party must unravel the Tale of the Terrible Button Dragon, before it&amp;rsquo;s too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
