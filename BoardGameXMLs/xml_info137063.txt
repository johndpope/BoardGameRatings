			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exclusive module, Call of the Frog God, is an adventure by Casey Christofferson, for 4&amp;ndash;6 characters of levels 8&amp;ndash;11, using both the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules, and the Swords and Wizardry Complete Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique adventure takes place in the setting of The Razor Coast and its nearby environs, however is not directly related to the plot of The Razor Coast&amp;rsquo;s over-arching adventure, and is intended as a thrilling diversion from that quest. GMs may use this adventure as they see fit, incorporating it into the overall adventure of The Razor Coast, or simply use it as a way to help characters build experience points and collect loot that will help them achieve success against the intrigues of The Razor Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Call of the Frog God is estimated at 36 pages for the Pathfinder version, and 28 pages for the Swords and Wizardry version, with full color art, and 3 maps of the environs and scuttled ships. Plus, part of the adventure takes place IN A WHALE! This adventure module will NOT be for sale after the Kickstarter, nor available via PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
