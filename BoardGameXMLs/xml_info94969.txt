							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Block War!</name>
									
			<description>It is the 22nd Century and in the vast and overcrowded Mega-City One, the populace are crammed into mile high tower blocks. Each one is a city in its own right, with hospitals,&lt;br/&gt;shopping malls and parks. It is said that a citizen may be born, live and die in their block without ever leaving it.&lt;br/&gt;But citizens suffer from high unemployment and boredom is rife. It is in these conditions that almost anything, no matter how trivial, may escalate everyday tensions between&lt;br/&gt;neighbouring blocks into all out block war. &lt;br/&gt;A block war is nothing less than an anarchic armed battle between opposing blocks. With only the judges able to put a stop to it before many lives are lost, or worse still, the violence spreads throughout the city - Block Mania! Now you take the role of a Mega-City block and must fight your own block war, dishing out the ultra-violence from the relatively safe perspective of your dining room table. The only hazards you shall face will be spilled cups of synthi-caf, your partner wanting to set the dinner or a knock on the door from the judges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;You play the role of a Mega-City block out to win a local block war, through killing opponents, gaining objectives and morale boosting actions, with success measured in &amp;lsquo;Fighting Spirit&amp;rsquo;. &lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts until one block has achieved a comprehensive victory, neighbouring blocks surrender, are wiped out, or when the judges arrive in force to shut the shooting match down.&lt;br/&gt;It is helpful to set a time limit for play, say two hours. Once that time has been reached and the round finished, each player in turn order starting is allowed one turn before points are calculated and a winner decided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
