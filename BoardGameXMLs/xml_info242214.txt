			<description>5 Stack is an exciting chip stacking game with the perfect mixture of strategy and chance. 5 Stack is simple enough that a 5-year-old can play it and interesting enough to captivate the seasoned board game veteran.  Proudly made in the USA, components include a game board, coloured wooden chips, dice, scoring pad, and instructions.  Designed by Jackson Robinson, and published by Kings Wild Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set-up: Players all get 25 chips in their colour plus a single gold coin, and dice are rolled for a random set-up that adds five chips per player to a 6x6 game-board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play: In clockwise order players take turns to: (a) move a chip or a chip stack of their colour in a straight direction on the board; (b) place a new chip with the location determined by a dice roll. The game ends when someone has played all their chips and cleared all chip stacks under their control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win: The aim of the game is to score the highest number of points.  Points are scored by clearing a stack (when a stack under your control reaches 5 or more chips, with gold chips being worth 5 instead of 1 point each).  Your final score is the total number of &amp;quot;cleared&amp;quot; chips minus any of your unplayed and uncleared chips at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
