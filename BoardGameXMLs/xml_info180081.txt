			<description>Crusher is a fantasy trading card game that can be played with various deck sizes:  A Skirmish game involves no deck, just a starting hand of 7 cards.  A Clash game uses 20-card decks.  A Battle game uses 40-card decks.  A War game uses 100-card decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players exchange attacks using character cards and booster cards played out of hand. The object is to eliminate all of your opponent's characters in hand while that opponent lacks the ability to draw more characters from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
