			<description>They're not just clowning around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Pistol&amp;quot; Pete Hendricks welcomes you to the Muskogee Fairground and Family Emporium, eastern Oklahoma's premier tourist attraction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's something for everyone here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racing and dueling fans come to the fairground racetrack, the largest independent track in North America. You've seen them on Muskogee Vision -- now experience the power of gas-engine racing for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're into obstacle racing? You're in luck -- the fairground has the world's first themed ob-race, &amp;quot;Great Moments in Oklahoma History.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want a place to bring the family? The family emporium has everything from twin ferris wheels and a carousel to the Big Green Monster roller coaster to the Virtual Arena, where autoduellists can face hazards beyond anything the real world can offer. &amp;quot;Pistol&amp;quot; Pete's restaurants are the best in the state, and the dance floor is open every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, you may also find bandits, thieves, screaming mothers-in-law, homicidal hitchhikers, cycle gangs, ARFs and killer clowns...but we did say Muskogee had something for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muskogee Mayhem is a Car Wars adventure pack, consisting of a 24 page rulebook, 88 full color vehicle counters and four 21&amp;quot; x 32&amp;quot; maps which fit together to form a giant 42&amp;quot; x 64&amp;quot; racetrack / dueling arena. It is not a stand-alone game -- you will need either Car Wars Compendium and some pedestrian counters or Car Wars Deluxe to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Car Wars Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
