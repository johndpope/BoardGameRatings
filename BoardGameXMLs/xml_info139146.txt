							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Families Thrive on Cadburys Bournville Cocoa</name>
									
			<description>Cadbury advert/game from The Champion Annual for Boys in 1950. At this time, Cadbury often used the back of children's annuals to advertise and they nearly always liked to make it a game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY: All you need to play this game is a dice, together with a dice cup (an egg-cup will do) and some coloured counters or buttons, one for each player. The game can be played by any number of players, and the first player to reach 80 and get into &amp;lsquo;bed&amp;rsquo; is the winner. Don't forget that you must obey any instructions that you land on. With your last throw you must get the exact number to reach 80: if you throw too high a number you must wait for another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cadburys, the makers of Bournville Cocoa, hope you will have a lot of fun with this game, and that Mummy will always give you plenty of lovely chocolatey Bournville Cocoa to help you to grow up healthy and strong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
