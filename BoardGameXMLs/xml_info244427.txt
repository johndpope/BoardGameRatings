			<description>Maybe you thought you were done with high school forever, or maybe you have been dreaming of the day you would finally start. Kicking Class brings an enticingly comical twist to high school. Players take on the role of students going through a whirlwind of hilariously relatable high school faux pas. In the game, you will race against your fellow students to come out on top and claim a full-ride scholarship to the university of your dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike your typical scholarships, which judge you based on boring things like your GPA or school contributions, the K.A. scholarship has developed its own unique ranking system. To claim this scholarship, you will need to pass classes, spread rumors, throw parties, and do whatever it takes to get the upper hand over your fellow students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you strive for popularity or bury your face behind textbooks, the options are endless. Now get ready to kick some class!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place over the 4 years of high school. Each year there are 3 trimesters, in which you will be taking classes. To pass a class, you will roll skill dice and see if you meet the requirements. If you pass, you keep the card and gain the reward. If you fail, you must draw from the dreaded failure deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will earn scholarship points (SP) for passing classes, being popular, and taking the ACT. At the end of the game, whoever has the most scholarship points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
