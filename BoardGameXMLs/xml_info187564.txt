							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cobrat Racebook</name>
									
			<description>From the description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cobrat are reptilian creatures divided into three subspecies: high cobrat, low cobrat and troglodytes. High cobrat have snakelike bodies between 9-12 foot long and about 18 inches in diameter. They stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with the rest of their body trailing behind them as they walk. They have thin, but powerful legs and spindly arms that end in four long digits. High cobrat are covered in scales ranging in color from dark green (almost black) to a light tan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low cobrat are hulking humanoids that stand 5 feet tall. Their bodies are heavily muscled and powerful. They have scales and their coloration is similar to that of the high cobrat. They look like &amp;ldquo;lizard men&amp;rdquo; from other fantasy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troglodytes look very similar to low cobrat. However, they are closer to 8 feet tall and even more powerful. Their scales grow quickly and they are continuously shedding old scales. Often the scales grow too fast and individual scales crowd one another causing them to be crooked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book provides a single race for use with the Runebearer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
