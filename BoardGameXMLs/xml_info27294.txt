			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Our latest travel game with a mirth provoking twist&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a kind of Treasure Hunt.  The box contains twelve 'Teaser' cards and twelve 'Key' cards.  The Key cards bear a list of words, and for each word there is a related trivia question that may be true or false, and a 'next' word that is to be found on one of the other Key cards.  The Teaser cards bear a single unique printed word, each to be found on a different one of the Key cards, and space to write in eleven more.  The Key cards are distributed around the playing area (maybe a room, a garden, or larger area) and the players travel between them, following their chain of words.  Points are awarded for both speed of completion, and accuracy in answering the trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Teaser cards are in fact double-sided, with a different word on each side, allowing two rounds.  The box states that additional Teaser cards can be bought, as replacements or to increase the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
