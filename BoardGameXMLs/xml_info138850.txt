			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Tiberius Flagg of the U.S. Army offered Zak the opportunity to take part in a special experiment called Project Super Trooper. The process was a success and he became the greatest black ops solider until he started to develop a conscious and started to refuse certain missions. He wanted to be a hero for his country &amp;amp; the people and became the first military crime fighter. Only one soldier, Zackary Knight, was given a replica the full Super Trooper Formula treatment. It was believed the only reason why it was successful was because of the fact Zackary was a mutant (Peak Human Healer). Knight was given the secret identity of Avenger to be a morale-boosting symbol. Rapidly Avenger started to grow more professional and competent; he became the focus of the fight against crime in Megatropolis and acted as a catalyst for the emergence of a string of similar heroes across the US. He would become one of the world's most influential heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
