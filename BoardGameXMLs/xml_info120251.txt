							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster House</name>
									
			<description>Monster House is based on the film of the same name.  Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4.  As a result the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children's films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus feature, the full version of Thou Art Dead, the arcade game played in the film by Jon Heder's character, Skull, was included on the game disc. Thou Art Dead was an original horror platformer, reminiscent of both Castlevania and the Ghosts 'n Goblins series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Monster House (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
