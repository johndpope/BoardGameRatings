			<description>Steam And Steel 1880-1906 - Quick Play Rules for Naval Wargames&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;48-page booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steam and Steel is a simulation of naval warfare from the development of the pre-dreadnought battleship in about 1880 to the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906. The rules may be used to simulate actions involving ships built before 1880 with some loss of realism, but the gunnery tables are not intended to simulate either the centralized fire control of the large main armament of dreadnought battleships or battlecruisers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also available (but not necessary for play):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steam and Steel Ship Lists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;52-page spiral bound booklet, published 1992. Originally published in Brassey's Naval Annual 1905.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This companion volume to the Quick-Play rules contains almost the complete list of every nations warships, armored ships, cruising ships, torpedo boats and submarines. Details are provided of displacement, dimensions, H.P., where built, makers of engines, launch and completion date, cost, amour (including location), armament, speed, coal capacity and complement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
