			<description>This is a twist on the usual game in which participants compete in a race while they balance an egg on a spoon.  In this one, 10 different items are given to 2 teams of children.  You can try to stack as much items on your balancing sticks as you want whenever it is your turn to race, but you risk slower speed, and if any of the items fall, it is back to the starting point.  But if you succeed in bringing a stack of items from the start to finish, then you can leave the items at the end point and go back to the starting point to pick up some more or pass to the next player in your team.  The team that completes all the items first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
