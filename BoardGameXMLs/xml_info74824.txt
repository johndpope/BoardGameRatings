			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talespinner is a narrating game with just enough dice to create some spice. The goal of Talespinner really is to tell a story, and to sharpen each player's narrative skills at the same time. Players take it in turn to describe complete scenes based on the intentions of the other players, the roll of some six-sided dice, and their own idea of how the story should proceed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Each Talespinner will need pencil and paper. Each will also need 5 to 10 six-sided dice that are distinct from those of the other Talespinners. The group will need a torch, fedora, grail, geode or other unique artifact to represent the conch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
