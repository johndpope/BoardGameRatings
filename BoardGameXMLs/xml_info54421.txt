			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this adventure, the characters are assigned to contact Major George MacDonald, leader of a group of resistance fighters in southern Indiana, and secure his cooperation with the CCF. They must also deliver a new microwave device for cleaning up Xenoborg remains. But once they arrive, the situation heats up - the Xenoborgs have brought in reinforcements! With the help of a human traitor, they have captured several civilians, and plan to execute them on the six o'clock news unless the resistance fighters surrender. Once the execution has been stopped, the characters must locate the Xenoborg camp where the remaining hostages are being held. And there they find an even bigger threat - an Aerial Teleborg and its Xenoborg captain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet includes six ready-to-play characters (with both Basic and Advanced stats), maps of post invasion Indiana and Illinois, and a detail map of a Xenoborg camp.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
