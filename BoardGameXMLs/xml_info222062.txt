							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Illusionist&#039;s Tomb</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gimble Boddynock was a gnome illusionist who greatly enjoyed practical jokes. When his time came, he built this tomb of hazards and tricks to prevent anyone unworthy from finding his greatest treasures. Since that time a tribe of kobolds have moved in, learning how to avoid the traps and hence having an easily defendable base for raiding operations. An ogre mage has also recently moved in, who has been searching for Gimble&amp;rsquo;s actual tomb and treasures there in, but is as of yet unsuccessful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
