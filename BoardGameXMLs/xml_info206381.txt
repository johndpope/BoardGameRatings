			<description>This party game consists of 14 player cards and a rules and solutions sheet. Each player card lists 12 riddles, and the solution to each riddle is an object that can be found in the host's house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest 40 minutes be allowed for players to roam the house and work out answers, and the first person to present a correct and complete card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sample riddle: &amp;quot;One half of me would take you right away; the other half might make a happy day.&amp;quot; The answer is Carpet (Car + Pet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is undated, but is similar to other games issued in the 1930s by PGP and UPL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
