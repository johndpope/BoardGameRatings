							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sherlock Holmes DÃ©tective Conseil: Oliver Stone</name>
									
			<description>On a brisk Sunday morning at around 10am, as we wind our way around the grounds of the Tower of London, a boy, not more than ten years of age, hails Wiggins with a message:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My dear friends, Oliver Stone was found dead in his home. I think it might be instructive for you to look into this matter. Meet me tomorrow afternoon at 221B to compare our respective investigations, if you wish. S.H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So begins &amp;quot;The Oliver Stone Case,&amp;quot; a single extra case expansion originally published in Role Mag' (#3 - November-December 1990).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
