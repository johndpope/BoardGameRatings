			<description>This game belongs to a series of 4 games by Scandecor, which come in a square plastic board (Play Cavalry, Play Balance, Play Ecology and Play Numeric).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played on a 12x12 board and each players has 9 dice as playing pieces. These dice look like normal 6-sided dice, but 2 sides of them are free. The are 2 types of dice, odd and even dice. Odd dice show 1-3-3-5 on their sides, even dice 2-4-4-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to win the most points, which are given for capturing opposing dice. You can also win points, when you succeed in bringing an own dice to the opposite corner of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start, the 9 dice per player start in one corner of the board and they show 1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5 on top. When a die moves to an adjacent empty space, its value is not changed, but a die can also be used to jump over another, if the value on top is within a range of 1 to the jumping die. Then a die can be turned to change its initial value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is rather slow developing, because it takes some time, until the dice approach each other on the large 12x12 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
