			<description>Mare Bella is a children's game that takes place at the sea side. Players have to collect 5 hidden types of sea animals and avoid picking up rubbish such as tires and old boots that have been washed up by the tide. But if they do, they will have the opportunity to rid the beach of such litter, which brings its own reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the younger player, the game has a simple environmental message; for the older player it has a gameplay in which a certain amount of skill and memory is involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a 'lotto' board, with space for 5 sea animals: a fish, starfish, crab, sea urchin (type thing) and an octopus. The aim is to be the first to collect all 5 of these, from amongst the square tiles that are laid out over the playing area. Players receive the 'beach bag' from which they draw a round token (same idea as dipping into the Scrabble bag that holds the letters). This token has on it a particular fish type or a particular colour on it. The player then chooses a square tile from the playing area whose upside corresponds in colour or fish type to the round token. He/she flips over the square tile to reveal its underside (which is likely to be different). If the underside is a fish that he/she hasn't collected yet, then the player adds it to his 'lotto' board. If the underside shows a pollution, he/she must collect the pollution. Once a player has three, then he/she may remove them from the game and get a 'free dip'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memorising the underside of certain tiles definitely helps, but is not essential, meaning that anyone can play from the age of 3 and up, although the game is certainly illustrated with kids in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is soon to be available in the UK, costing around &amp;pound;18. See &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.isimat.fr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.isimat.fr&lt;/a&gt; or email muellbauer@lycos.com for details&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
