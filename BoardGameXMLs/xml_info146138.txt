							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bulwark: Jakab Startouched</name>
									
			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Co-operative Deck-Building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eschewing the narrow study and academic focus of the Council of Mages, Jakab learned from the example of the elves and mastered something resembling their traditional magic. Having travelled all over the world in the process, he is a seasoned adventurer and mighty opponent on the field of battle. He was named Startouched by his tutors for his celestial inspiration, and not for having a head full of sky. He says.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Hard Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jakab Startouched is a new Hero deck, fully compatible with the base game. It introduces a little randomness to the Hero supply piles, making for a less predictable start to the game. He is recommended for experienced Bulwark players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
