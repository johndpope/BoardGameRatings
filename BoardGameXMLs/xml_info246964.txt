			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EvilK is a program written in North Star BASIC that permits you to act out your fantasies of being a motorcycle daredevil!  The game is a simple motorcycle jump over several busses, which takes into account both gravity and drag forces.  The ramp angle and motorcycle speed determine the distance jumped.  Note that the injury penalty is greater for long jumps than for short ones, and that there is a chance for a crash even on a jump of the right length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EvilK was written by Charles Aylworth and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol. 4, No. 4, July/August 1978.  The article notes a FORTRAN version was available from the author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
