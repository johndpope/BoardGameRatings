			<description>Each player selects a different doubles and places a marker on the board to signify that it is his. All players then ante one chip to the jackpot. The first player then takes the dice and rolls and continues to roll until he rolls a 7. Each rolled number is kept track of unless a 7 or doubles is rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a double is rolled the player who has the double marked adds it to his score and must ante a chip into the jackpot. On a seven the total that the player has rolled is added to his score and a new round is started. If a 7 is rolled by way of a 6 and a 1 the player forfeits his entire score and must ante 1 chip. The first player to achieve a score of 252 or better while it is his turn to roll wins the game and collects the jackpot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules do not assign any significance to the jackpot so I can only think that it is supposed to be a betting game. The rules are provided in English and Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
