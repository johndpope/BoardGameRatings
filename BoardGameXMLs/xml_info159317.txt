							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arcanum College</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off the coast of the Newmack Sea and to the east of Gortelburg sits the walled town of Cordicstown. Within the fortified tows in the infamous Arcanum College where young mages of wealth or talent come to learn the craft from the masters. For young adventuring mages this place offers the opportunity to improve upon their spell books and even apprentice with the masters of the mystic arts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This offering has a twofold opportunity for adventurers. First for those who study magic they can find safe harbor at Arcanum College. For their colleagues the opportunity to rest, relax, and purchase arcane items can be had in Cordicstown.  While set in the Filbar Campaign, this area can be easily combined with new or existing worlds of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
