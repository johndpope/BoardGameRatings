			<description>Dingo and his friends have gotten lost on Walkabout! Visit their dreams to lead them home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dingo's Dreams is a delightful and clever family game for 2-4 players. Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When a player flips a tile, it means their animal is traveling through a part of the dreamscape. Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game).  After a card is drawn, a player takes their extra animal and slides him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side.  The player will use this tile to shift another column or row on the next turn, and so on, until one player's dreamscape tiles match the goal.  The player then shouts their animal's name-- &amp;quot;Dingo!&amp;quot;, for example, to win the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules add Hazard Tokens which increase the challenge substantially: to complete the required dream pattern, the player may not have his animal in any of the Hazard spaces marked on the dream card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
