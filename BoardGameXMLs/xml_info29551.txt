							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">G.I. Joe Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A card game for 2 to 6 players, in which the object is to get rid of your hand by playing one card per turn. The cards all portray different G.I. Joe characters, and are either numbered or marked with a star. Players try to match the current face up discard by either picture or number. Players who cannot play must draw from the discard pile. Play stops when one player is out of cards or when no one can play, and points are awarded based on remaining holdings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
