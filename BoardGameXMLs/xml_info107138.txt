			<description>Catalog Description, Adventure International&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lance Micklus, who has authored some of the finest programs available today, has channeled his energies into the making of his first adventure. Now, for both the Color and the TRS-80 computers comes DEATH PLANET: The Dog Star Adventure - an exhilarating dip into a peril-filled universe! The evil General Doom and his Roche Soliders are preparing to launch an attack against the forces of freedom lead by the beautiful Princess Leya. The Princess has been captured by Doom - and it's up to you to pull off a daring rescue and save her and the royal treasury!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEATH PLANET: The Dog Star Adventure has been written in a format similar to a standard adventure - your electronic alterego is manipulated by keying in one- or two-word responses as you react to the game's events. Prepare yourself for a thrilling adventure Lance Micklus-style - prepare yourself for DEATH PLANET: The Dog Star Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game  Instructions, Softside Magazine version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil General Doom and his Roche Soldiers are ready to launch an attack against the Forces of Freedom, led by Princess Leya. Enroute to a secret command center on the planet Harris 7, Princess Leya's ship was attacked by Doom. She is now being held prisoner on one of his battle cruisers. It is a sorry day indeed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The capture holds extra prizes for Doom and his men: onboard Princess Leya's ship is the entire treasury of her Freedom Fighting Force in a chest containing Melidium Crystals, the currency used in this galaxy. The Princess is also wearing a necklace made of shinestones. Encoded in one of the stones is the location and strength of her Freedom Fighting Force. Hopefully, Doom has not yet discovered the secret of the necklace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I, your computer, am your puppet. I'm hidden aboard the Princess's ship. It is possibly, although very difficult, that we may be able to save the day by rescuing Princess Leya, her necklace, and the treasury. But even if we don't, anything we can do to foil General Doom's plans may help win a victory for peace in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We must be very careful of guards who are all over the ship. We could easily be caught and imprisoned. Sometimes you may only have enough time to give me one command, which if not the appropriate action to take, could easily end the game for both of us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I understand ordinary English in one- or two-word commands. If you want me to go somewhere, just give me a direction. I can GET or DROP something just by your typing GET or DROP plus the name of the object. You can SAVE a game on either tape or disk by typing SAVE. A previously saved game can be restored with the command LOAD. Other words I understand include HELP, INVEN, LOOK, SCORE, and QUIT. In addition to these, there are many other words in my vocabulary. The fun of playing ADVENTURE is not only trying to figure out what to do, but how to explain it to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
