			<description>PARticipation is a golf game. Players spin a spinner in order to determine their shots, which are kept track of on molded plastic three-dimensional terrain. Putting is done with a life-sized putter and golf-ball included with the game, with the idea being that the players will set up their own &amp;quot;greens&amp;quot; a la miniature golf with varying levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
