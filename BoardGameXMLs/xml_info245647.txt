							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infected: The Carrier</name>
									
			<description>Infected is a quick, strategic, secret role, semi-cooperative social game. One of the party is a Plague Doctor, spreading the Bubonic Plague. The Villagers need to find and rid themselves of the evil doctor before they succumb to the greatest plague in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Carrier is an expansion which adds new characters, roles, abilities, and chain reactions. New cards, new dice, and new miniature included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Plague Doctor now brings his Ravens with him, and they too carry infections. If a Villager receives an infection, they must pass their Raven card on their next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many new roles include abilities to fight against the Plague Doctor and Ravens, including the new Huntress, Blacksmith, Apothecary, Priest, and other Villagers. However, a new powerful Plague Doctor exists, and a new Sinister Villager could even be in your midst. You'll never trust your friends again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
