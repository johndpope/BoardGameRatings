			<description>Follow the footsteps of Lewis &amp;amp; Clark using this 56-card deck of oversized exploration cards.  Join their historical expedition and learn about the discoveries they made on their westward trail.  Sioux warriors, grizzly bears, rattlesnakes, and more complete a fact-filled adventure for all ages.  Instructions for two simple card games are included.  Players collect cards by sequence (in order of when Lewis &amp;amp; Clark first observed the item) or by category (such as plants or fish).  Each rummy-like game has its own unique challenge.  Young explorers can also line up the exploration cards in numerical order to match the Trail Map Poster, creating an educational journey of their very own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;56 Exploration Cards&lt;br/&gt;Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;Trail Map Poster (18&amp;rdquo; x 24&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br/&gt;Stickers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
