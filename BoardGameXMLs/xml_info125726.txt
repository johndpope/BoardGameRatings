			<description>Marmots are crazy for flowers. But they must be careful when they walk through the lush meadows and look for their favorite meal. Fox and eagles are in fact crazy for these little animals...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flowers in 3 colors are distributed on the game board face-up.&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player rolls dice and take the action indicated.&lt;br/&gt;If die shows flower the player moves his marmot the nearest place with the flower with proper color.&lt;br/&gt;If die shows arrow player may move one step with his marmot.&lt;br/&gt;If die shows burrow player may move his marmot to any burrow.&lt;br/&gt;If die shows danger player removes one of the eight burrow-cards from the play so there are now less places to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has lost both marmots or when all&lt;br/&gt;the flowers of one color were collected. This is when the player with the most flowers that wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
