			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Yags is a roleplaying game system designed for games in a number of different genres, from fantasy to modern and science fiction. It's goal is to enable Cinematic Realism, covering the range from low fantasy or horror where fairly mundane people are thrown into abnormal situations, up to heroic larger than life characters who are trained to manage against overwhelming danger through skill, wits and luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is up to the Game Master to decide on the type of campaign that will be played by selecting one of four starting character levels: Mundane, Skilled, Exceptional or Heroic. These determine the number of points a player has to build their character and the maximum levels they can start with on their attributes and skills. This choice does not limit how powerful and/or skilled characters can become over time, they merely represent how good characters are at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
