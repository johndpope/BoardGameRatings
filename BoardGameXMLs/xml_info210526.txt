			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Nyrond Regional Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gritting his teeth against the stabbing pain, the wood elf with decorative facial tattoos heaved the body of the half-elven lass over his right shoulder. Her bejeweled hand swung limply in response to his movements. Quickly, yet with care, he scooped up the bundle resting on the muddy floor with his other arm and cast a final gaze at the carnage before limping out of the cave. As he plodded through the muck, he could feel warm blood running down the side of his torso and down his leg as the strain of the unbalanced load put pressure on his grievous wounds. At long last, he reached his destination: the Knobs of Cullidor. It would be here he would take refuge. It would be here he would await the Duchess of Woodwych.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outdoor-based Nyrond regional &amp;quot;call to war&amp;quot; scenario that welcomes animal companions for adventurers of...level 2 through 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure has an optional encounter[.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
