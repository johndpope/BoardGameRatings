							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Illuminati</name>
									
			<description>Though the real history of how the Old World powers spread their influence and came to dominate the USA will never be known, American Illuminati gives you the opportunity to demonstrate how, as the leader of one of these old world dynasties, you would have accomplished the feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will become the leader of an ancient Illuminati faction. Your objective is to infiltrate agents into the newly forming United States in order to exert control over the state governments. The more states you control, the greater your power in the federal government. The more control you have in the federal government the more power you have to dominate the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AI is a Euro-style board game that plays equally well with 2, 3 or 4 players. The mechanics are simple enough that you can teach most anyone to play, though strategic players are much more likely to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is attempting to place agents into the newly forming USA. The more states your faction controls during the four major turning points in 19th century US history, the more conspiracy cards you will draw. Conspiracy cards can be used to gain advantages during the game but are also how you win the game.The Conspiracy Deck mimics a standard deck of playing cards though all the suites are different to fit the Illuminati theme. Throughout the game you are secretly attempting to form the best Poker hand (what's more American than Poker?) with your Conspiracy Cards while playing your Action Cards to maximum advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
