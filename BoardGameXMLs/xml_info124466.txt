							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cold Dark</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been a little over two days since our balloon wrecked in this cold, dark place. We are somewhere below the floating island the doctor was all excited about seeing. He&amp;rsquo;s been missing for days now, fallen from the balloon in a storm in the dark, and since the boys are out foraging for food, leaving me, Connor, and Jenna to hide in the shelter of this cave, I appear to have nothing better to do then to keep up the good Doctor&amp;rsquo;s Journals. Perhaps, when we find him, he can pen in the things he&amp;rsquo;s missed writing over, and he does so seem to enjoy writing in this journal.. I think it brings him comfort, a piece of science in this strange place. Perhaps I should start back at the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
