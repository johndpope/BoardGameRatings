			<description>Ah Fruits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albert the farmer is a very old man who can't really go around is farmland to pick is fruits like he used to.&lt;br/&gt;So instead of letting is fruits rot on the ground, he gathered a few of his animal friends to help him out with his tedious job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if you give a basket to a duck, a dog, a pig, a turtle and a hedgehog, confusion is bound to happen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all of their good will and dedication, our little friends can't stop bickering and start little competitions between themselves to see who will gather the most fruits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
