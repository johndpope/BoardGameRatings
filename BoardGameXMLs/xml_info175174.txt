							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Confedarcy of Kyria: A Federation of Adventurers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kyrian Confederacy consists of the Principality of Seavolk, Kyria, Arrillianna, Stone Helm, Ale Town, Forge Hearth, the Verdant Forest, Sea Cave and Independent Holds. Each of these is known as a client state. It is administered by the Kyrian Council which meets in Kyria once a month. The Council consists of seven representatives from each of the above areas except the Verdant Forest and Sea Cave. The Chair rotates each year and its occupant acts as the ceremonial head of state when required. Representatives are selected as appropriate to each client state. All client states are independent with their own governments which are federated for trade and defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
