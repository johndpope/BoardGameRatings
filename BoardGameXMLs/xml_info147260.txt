			<description>A fast-pace game of memorizing words and being bossed around by a deck of cards! Topsy Turvy forces you to remember a sequence of words created by the players while trying to draw cards following their simple yet distracting instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you master the art of memorization? Or will you break the sequence and turned Topsy Turvy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topsy Turvy is a sequence memory game that challenges players in their skill of memory. Players decide who goes first, then that player decides on the first word of the sequence and draws a card. This card determines which player gets the next turn. That players says the sequence, adds a word, and draws a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, a card does not simply determines the next player, though, but tries to throw off the players' train of though, such as the &amp;quot;Erase&amp;quot; card that deletes any word of the current player's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
