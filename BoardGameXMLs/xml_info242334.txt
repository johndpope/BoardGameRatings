							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Uncle Harry&#039;s Will</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncle Harry has died and has left you everything.  However, he has neglected to mention where everything is!  Instead, his will consists of a poem which contains clues.  You will have to travel all over the United States both by car and on foot to solve the puzzle, and there are over 300 locations to probe.  Be careful and watch out for red herrings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
