							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ettercaps</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the repulsive and fascinating ettercap. These strange spider-like creatures have been horrifying and enchanting us for ages, and this book provides a few fresh ways to look at them, especially in making them relevant at higher levels. First, the feral ettercap (CR 6) is more bestial than its kin, but its six claw-tipped arms and cunning use of its webs more than make up for that. The webspinner ettercap (CR 9) is best known for the various unique webs it can create&amp;mdash;the acidic web, the anchored web, and the steel web&amp;mdash;but can also wrap up its foes to save for later, or just inject them with its eggs. Finally, the spider lord ettercap (CR 12) is not only capable of controlling spiders telepathically, it can enhance their abilities, and even transform foes into giant spiders that it can then control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
