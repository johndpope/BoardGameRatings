			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to StarCluster 4 with Zero Stage, an introductory game for StarCluster 4. You play agents of the Unifactoid Peripatetic Headline Intelligencer news agency, agents with a thirst for news and a disregard for personal safety. You cover all of Jeshen Space, a ten sun system empire belonging to the Jeshen - and their allies, the Humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters are Human or Jeshen. You know what Humans are, and Jeshen are very humanoid indeed - tailed, hairless, hermaphroditic, semi-aquatic humanoids. They run Jeshen Space, and own the choicest Real Estate. Of course, they were here first, and they took in Humanity as refugees, and beggars should not be choosers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any rate, Humanity has convinced the Jeshen that they co-evolved with their servitor apecies - uplifted animals, robots, and bioroids - and they could not live without them. So, though it disgusts the Jeshen, Humans have their slaves, and Jeshen Space is crawling with secrets and conflicts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
