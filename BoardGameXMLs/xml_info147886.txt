			<description>Tyrant Soul pits a group of unique and powerful heroes against against a variety of encounters that evoke the feeling of an epic, set-piece &amp;quot;boss fight.&amp;quot; Each challenging encounter requires long-term strategic thinking, precise tactical execution and optimal usage of resources to conquer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tyrant Soul was inspired by end-game raiding popularized by MMOs, but also draws influences from a diverse collection of RPGs, miniatures skirmish games and TCG/LCGs - along with its own mechanics, including (optional) digital integration features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Tile-based battle map makes for a different battlefield in every encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Each playable character has a unique skillset and mechanics that make them play differently from the others. From the rapid-fire, combo-based style of the fiery Kindleborne to the reality-bending Traceless who leaves behind &amp;quot;shadow copies&amp;quot; of herself that can copy her attacks and movements.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Gather power from the &amp;quot;Soulstream&amp;quot; that permeates the world (represented by a set of poker-like cards with custom suits) - put together the right combinations to activate powerful Heroic versions of your base skills that add new twists and enable new combos.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; The &amp;quot;recharge&amp;quot; mechanic is a quick, intuitive and visual take on cooldown mechanics popular in video games.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 5+ epic boss monsters and encounters - each with its own theme and mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Every encounter follows an &amp;quot;AI script&amp;quot; with a combination of set and randomized events to create a dynamic challenge - no &amp;quot;GM&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Overlord&amp;quot; needed. Digital extensions make it a snap to run the encounter from a tablet, smartphone or laptop.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Compete with other players around the world by taking on special, super-difficult &amp;quot;achievement&amp;quot; challenges. Our online leaderboard will ensure that everyone knows your accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Playable as a modular single session game or an extended campaign where players grow in power and attain new powerful items and skills.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Expanding World: New boss encounters and character classes to be released regularly!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Alternate Game Modes: Take on your friends in PvP combat, or enter the Gauntlet and face an endless horde of randomized foes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
