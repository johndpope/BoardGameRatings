			<description>Using individually rated player cards and dice &amp;quot;Bones&amp;quot; players select from 10 run or 6 pass plays on offense, and 12 defenses to play a simple to learn, yet very detailed game of football.  Football Bones builds off the original Statis Pro model by Jim Barnes and updates to a Base-10 system allowing for greater variability and realism in the results.  Advanced statistics previously unavailable have allowed us to come up with the most accurate player cards and that translates to accurate play on the field!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play by Play has been studied and every ball handler in the game now more accurately reflects on-field performance. 3 yards and a cloud of dust, yup we have that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the beauties of the original Statis Pro system was and is the simplicity. Cover 2, Cover 3 it&amp;rsquo;s in there, Wildcat got it!, 6 Offensive lineman got it!, 3 Tight Ends got it! More plays and strategies, weather rules, a new model for quarterbacks and ball handlers. Solo, league, and replay tested&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; All the fun and excitement of the original Statis Pro game is there and we&amp;rsquo;ve added so much more&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
