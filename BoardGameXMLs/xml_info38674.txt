			<description>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll never get out of this financial mess until I follow a Budget!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Why not learn what it means to live by a budget? Before each trip around the game board, players plan a budget and receive $2,000. They experience the realities of real-life economics as they buy a home or rent an apartment, pay insurance costs, make investments, buy groceries and clothing, repair fire damage, collect commissions, etc. If the budget projection is reasonably accurate, the player collects a bonus on payday! The winner is the player who has the greatest wealth at the end of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
