							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1000 Vragen Quiz</name>
									
			<description>Traditional quiz game. Each player has a track on the board and moves according to correct answers. First to the end of their track, wins. There are five subjects of questions. Art and Culture, Nature, Sport, Geography and History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looks like it was made for a Dutch company called Premium but I cannot find any trace of that company existing today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
