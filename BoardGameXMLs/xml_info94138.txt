			<description>DE/LE BELGOTRON&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully bilingual Dutch/French - 2 games in 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quiz:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete in a cyclists' race, cycling from the Belgian Coast to the Belgian Ardennes. During the race, they answer trivia questions about Belgium. The first player to reach the cyclist with the yellow jersey wins. Anyone can win, whatever their knowledge about Belgium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The political game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players learn to understand the inner workings of the Belgian federal State. They use their pawns to obtain strategical influence in the judicial, legislative and executive powers, and combine these powers to obtain points and make a political career from their local community to the federal government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
