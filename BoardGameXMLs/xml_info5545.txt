			<description>Horses leave &amp;quot;apples&amp;quot; as they wander in the pasture, the farmers collect the &amp;quot;apples&amp;quot; hoping to use the manure in their gardens, the rabbits try to eat the farmers' vegetables and the hunters try to stop the rabbits. The first farmer to score 50 points by growing vegetables and collecting manure wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board with a 16 by 16 grid, divided up into four 8 by 8 fields (i.e. 4 chess boards put together). Each player controls a horse that roams around leaving manure in the field. The player's farmer wants to collect the manure to use in his field to grow his vegetables. Each player also controls a rabbit which will try to eat the other players' vegetables and a hunter that tries to keep the rabbit away. In the game the pieces have moves similar to chess pieces. The horse moves like a knight (of course), the farmer like the king, the rabbit like a bishop and the hunter like a rook. Players receive 2 points for each vegetable grown and 1 point for each bucket of manure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played solitaire, by 2 or 4 players or by teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
