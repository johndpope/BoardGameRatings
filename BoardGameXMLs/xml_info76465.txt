			<description>A football-Simulation that the author used for his own leage. It is a rather complex simulation with a lot of dice-rolling and many rules, really designed to simulate a (European) football game.&lt;br/&gt;The dice decide over angle height and speed of the ball, but can be influenced by the players. Since its a complex simulation and would take quite some time, the game is played over a fixed time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
