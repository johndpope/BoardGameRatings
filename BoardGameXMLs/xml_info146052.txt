			<description>Nightmare is a Trading Card Game. ( TCG/CCG )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a world of shared nightmares and featuring 13 different Phobias to deploy against your own subconscious and that of your enemies, Nightmare will test your ability to remain focused and escape your fears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deploy strategy, planning, and a bit of Delusion before you lose your soul forever in an experience that combines the familiar with the never before seen in a compelling new twist on TCG gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Makes Nightmare Different?&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare isn't your typical cookie cutter clone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare shares some very fundamental TCG conventions with other games but the core structure and setting is completely unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're going to explain everything as we go along, but what you're in for can best be described as &amp;quot;wicked&amp;quot; in every sense of the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare will also feature Achievements, DLC, and many more world first features! There's even a Novel Length Storyline planned!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Game Structure&lt;br/&gt;There are 121 different game cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players design and build a single deck made up of a certain number of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Types&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare doesn't have &amp;quot;spells&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;creatures&amp;quot;, it features Phobias, Entities, Delusions, Doubts, Uncertainties, Guilts, Synaptic Misfires, Paranoia's, and Entropies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Overview&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of a game, players shuffle their decks (called &amp;ldquo;Mind&amp;rdquo;) thoroughly and draw cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide who goes first, by random selection.Each player may place one Delusion per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play progresses through turns and stages until one player loses their all of their Lucidity, thus losing the game or achieves 100 Lucidity. If there are more than 2 players, the last player still holding on to some Lucidity is the winner and buys their sanity with the souls of their opponents or achieves 100 Lucidity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is just the surface. Players will have to contend with Madness, Repression, and Regression in their struggle to escape their Nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
