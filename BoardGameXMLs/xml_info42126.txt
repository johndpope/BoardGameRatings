			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are American Civil War historical miniature wargame rules, using the simultaneous movement &amp;amp; firing method. There is a simple &amp;amp; limited written order system to enable the command structure &amp;amp; fog of battle to be reproduced without slowing the game down. To compliment this we have our brigadier system, where miniature generals have to command their forces, &amp;amp; are not just a morale bonus on a horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules use a scale of 1 figure represents 20 men, although smaller scales are used in some scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Base sizes are not important in LRN enabling them to be used with figures already based for many other sets of rules. There is also a points system for those who need one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
