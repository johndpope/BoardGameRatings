			<description>Two tactical games on modern warfare: Red Attack and Rebel Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instruction manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REBEL FORCE is a company level simulation of a battle between a modern combined arms force and a well equipped rebel force. Each turn represents about 15 minutes of real time. A hexagonal grid map representing 500 meters per hex, is used to regulate movement and combat. A Terrain Effects Table summarizes how the features on the map affect the movement and combat of the units. A Combat Results Table has been provided to explain the combat system although the computer automatically calculates and implements combat results as they occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RED ATTACK! is a two-player level game which simulates an attack by a mixed Soviet tank and infantry force against a defending infantry force. The attacking (Soviet) player wins the game by occupying two of the three towns on the mapboard at the conclusion of the fifth complete game turn. The defender wins if the attacker fails to achieve these victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roger Keating&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
