			<description>Calling all Power Ranger fans! Do you think you have what it takes to beat Finister? Answer trivia questions in this trivia game about the hit TV show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players shuffle the deck of over 50 trivia questions and put them face down. Players then play rock, paper and scissors to decide who goes first.&lt;br/&gt;The player left of the player going will always draw a trivia card and read it off to the player. If first player answers correctly, they receive the trivia card. If they answer incorrectly, the card goes to the bottom of the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues till all of the trivia cards have been answered successfully. After all of the trivia cards have been answered, players count the number of cards they've answered correctly. The player with the highest correctly answered trivia cards is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
