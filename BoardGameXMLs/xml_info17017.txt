			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to imagine yourselves out on the golf course playing a relaxing game of golf - but - it is a board game and is meant to be light-hearted and entertaining, so there are a few hiccups along the way - and - you must bear in mind you will be very much at the mercy of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;Played as near to real golf as possible with 2 dice, 1 black and 1 white. The black for the fairways bar the four short holes. The white for the four short holes and all eighteen greens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The black and white dice cards are used when each dice rolls a 'c'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the various games can be played e.g Stroke play, Foursomes, Fourball, Match play, Stableford etc. Up to 4 players at a time. Serious golfers can deduct their handicaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joy for all the family and friends. Fun to try and beat 'Dad'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
