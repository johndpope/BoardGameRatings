			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game setup involves players selecting an unused, dead character from some prior game.  The character is entered into a common database.  The next step in play is to select a character from the common pool.  These dead characters all exist in a common setting called The Unreal &amp;quot;that exists outside of temporal and physical reality. It's a place where the mind forges a reality and imposes it around. You'll take these characters through each others reality until they can finally rest with a dramatic final scene and then move on to their proper afterlife.&amp;quot;  The game uses the various source rules system(s) from which the characters came in an intriguing mash-up process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
