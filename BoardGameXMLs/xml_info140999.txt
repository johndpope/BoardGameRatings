							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blocky</name>
									
			<description>Blocky is an endless game the was created in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2012.  The team behind it consisted of some people from Nemesys Games and other guests during the jam.  The theme at the time was &amp;quot;Ouroboros,&amp;quot; which most interperated as &amp;quot;infinity.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Blocky, you must create and destroy blocks to find your way to the gem.  When creating a block, you must 'solidfy' Blocky and begin again from the start of that level, so make sure you strategize!  Destroying blocks can help clear a path to the next objective.  When you finally reach the gem, the screen is rotated and a new level begins.  Each level in Blocky is unique and is created by the user during each play, so no 2 plays are the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
