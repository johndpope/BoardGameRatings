			<description>&amp;quot;2-4+ player board &amp;amp; card wargame. Each player controls an Advanced Spacefaring Alien Civilization.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Alien Race sends its fleets out to conquer the galaxy. Each Race has six attributes which can change throughout the game: Attack, Defense, Movement, Production, Strategic, and Initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players share a custom card deck containing two types of cards: Technology and Event. Technology cards give a Race a new ability or an attribute bonus that last for the duration of the game. Event cards represent temporary bonuses and effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hex map of space filled with ten &amp;quot;terrain&amp;quot; types: Alien Ruins, Star Cluster, Nebula, Super Nova, Black Hole, Dark Matter, Quasar, Worm Hole, Asteroid Field, and Deep Space. Each type of space has a special effect, except for Deep Space which has no effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to win the game. Either control all the Star Cluster spaces in play or occupy the most spaces when the deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
