							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bavarian Holiday</name>
									
			<description>What can be better than drinking beer at a fine pub and enjoying the scenic mountain views?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dice game Bavarian Holiday, players choose how many and which color of dice to roll to represent which types of beer they have ordered. If you run out of beer spaces to cross off your core sheet, you spill your beer and are forced to roll only for pretzels. Be the first one to quit before spilling too many beers or eating too many pretzels, and you get bonus points for having the good sense to leave the pub, buy flowers, and go home.  15-20 minutes 2-5 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
