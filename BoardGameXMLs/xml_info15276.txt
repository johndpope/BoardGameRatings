							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elements</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The four ancient classes of earth, air, fire, and water combine with the discoveries of modern science to create: elements.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically a deck of 120 cards divided into 4 suits (earth, air, fire, and water), 28 cards per suit, plus 8 special &amp;quot;aspect&amp;quot; cards (Adam, Eve, Dragon, Phoenix, Unicorn, Leviathan, Philosopher's Stone, and Abyss).  Cards are valued 1 to 7 and each is named with a modern element (hydrogen, helium, lithium, and so on).  Cards also have directional arrows (N, S, E, W, etc.) that are used in some games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules included for 7 different games, each an original variant of traditional types of card games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnosis: Be the first alchemist to attain the knowledge of how to transmute lead to gold.  Somewhat like multi-player solitaire with a &amp;quot;take-that&amp;quot; element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directional Dervish: Capture the most cards.  Reminiscent of dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Chess: Win the battle by capturing both of your opponent's aspects.  Like it's name, inspired by chess but played on a board made out of cards and with cards as &amp;quot;pieces&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemical Warfare:  Capture the most cards.  Hard to think of a comparison, but a bit like icehouse (place cards with arrows pointing at your opponents' cards and try to capture them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry Clash:  Bond elements using valance numbers.  A version of rummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particle Poker:  Win the most chips or counters during an evening's play.  As it says, a version of poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
