			<description>This is a University of California at San Diego themed variant of Monopoly.  Houses and Hotels are replaced by Years of Credit and Diplomas.  There are no auctions, and all money required to be paid other than rent and the purchase price of properties is placed in the center of the board.  Any player landing on Spring Break (Free Parking) collects all of the money from the center of the board. Playing pieces are History, Art, Anatomy, English, and Calculus textbooks.  Unique properties include the Quonset Huts, the Price Center,  the Guardian, the Sun God, the Koala, Revelle Plaza Fountain, the Hump,   Genesee Avenue, Che' Cafe, Canyon View Pool, Muir College, Warren College, Fifth College, Revelle College, and Thurgood Marshall College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
