			<description>Willi the bookworm has eaten all the books and made a mess of all the letters. The players now have to clean up the mess and create new words.&lt;br/&gt;Three theme cards are placed on the table, each player gets a certain amount of letters. Three letters are in the exchange area. The first player places a letter next to a theme card to start a word which fits that theme. The next player can start a new word for a different theme, or continue the current word by dding another letter. At the end of the turn, a player draws a new card.&lt;br/&gt;Instead of playing a hand card, a player may take a letter from the exchange area and add it to any of the words, and must replace it from their hand. If this also doesn't work, they can discard a card. &lt;br/&gt;When a word is finished, the cards (which show a number of points depending on how often they appear in German) are put on a score pile and a new word for this theme can be started. If the players agree that it will be too hard to finish a word, they can discard the cards and start a new word.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues like this until all cards have been played. Points in the discard pile are deducted from the points in the score pile, and the overall number is checked on a chart to see how well the group did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
