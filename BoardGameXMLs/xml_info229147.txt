Whether you face a humanoid enemy, a tentacled krakennewt, or a putrid tatzelwurm, this set has the hit location die you need!  The dice set also comes with a booklet that summarizes the Focus Rules for Hit Zones from the Aventuria Compendium and the Aventurian Armory.  Did you arrow hit the enemy's upper arm or wrist?  Is one location worse than the other?  With the Hit Zone Dice Set you have the answer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scheduled to ship in August 2017&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
