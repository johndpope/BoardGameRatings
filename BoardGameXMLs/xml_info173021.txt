			<description>John wants to place his cowboy to the gold mine and so does Carl &amp;amp; Abby. There is only one vacancy for the job. How to solve? Let's settle it the &amp;quot;Wild West Way&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild West Way (WWW) is a free print &amp;amp; play card game for up to five players. Each player is a new comer to the town &amp;amp; wants to build up his/her fame through different achievements. Before building up the fame, a player also needs to build up his/her various skills like shooting, brawling, gambling or horse riding. The more skillful a player is the higher chance a player can win over certain characters or buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, players place their meeples to different buildings. A player may borrow money from the bank, take a wanted poster from the sheriff's office, donate to the church, buy items from the general store, or meet various town characters at the saloon. A player may also challenge other players with a gun duel, bar fight, horse racing or even a poker game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends, the player with most fame points wins &amp;amp; becomes the new mayor of the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
