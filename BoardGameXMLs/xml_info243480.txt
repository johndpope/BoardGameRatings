							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Hall of Tyr</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hall of Judgment: Here Tyr himself guided human and dwarf in the ways of honor, law, retribution, and justice in war and life. It has been lost for centuries, hidden by the power of Asgard from those without permission to enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tiwstakn, the fabled keys that unfog the mind and guide the body when seeking the Hall, have been found. The clerics of Tyr in the city of Isfjall, have offered the PCs a substantial reward if they have the will to rediscover the hall, and return the holy books from within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are, of course, not the only ones looking&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Hall of Tyr is an adventure scenario for Fifth Edition or Swords and Wizardry, targeted at characters who are established but are not yet the movers and shakers of the world. It is geared towards 4-8 characters of level 4-7, with 28-32 total levels recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module is set in a Norse-inspired culture and land, and uses the mythology and legends of the Asgardians, and the nordic/viking culture, as a basis. It includes advice on how to drop it into any campaign and setting, so long as the journey and quest takes the party into the mountains and wilderness, in search of an object or goal that is valuable because of its history and contents, but not powerful by itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Preface. The preface introduces the scenario and describes how it was written. It also includes conversion guidelines for Swords and Wizardry.&lt;br/&gt;    Introduction. The local geography and the events leading to the quest to rediscover the D&amp;oacute;mst&amp;oacute;llinn, the Hall of Judgment, are laid out with enough background to drive the adventure. The introduction also provides some inspiration to use the adventure in other campaigns, settings, locations, or even as part of a mega-dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;    Lost Hall of Tyr. The core scenario. It includes 20 adventure segments - a journey, a riddle, a combat encounter, or a physical feat. Each encounter will include Challenges, telling the GM what must be overcome, Concealed information that the players don't know initially, Alternatives that talk about ways to short-circuit, bypass, or otherwise not just Leroy Jenkins one's way through a challenge, and Rewards, where appropriate. Ransom encounter tables, encounter map images, and evocative artwork paint the story of the challenges faced.&lt;br/&gt;    Wilderness Survival. Travelling overland, especially carrying an adventurer's usual load of gear, is hard work. This short chapter discusses ways to make that work dramatic and fun, including guidance for food, water, hunting, preserving meat, and rules for cold weather and climate. Not all challenges have talons and teeth.&lt;br/&gt;    Bestiary. Each monster that is listed in the scenario is given statistics, including a quick-reference chart for grappling, as well as statistics compatible with Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry and the Dungeon Grappling rules.&lt;br/&gt;    Dungeon Grappling Quick-Start. Even if you don't have the book, you can still use the rules. Two pages of grappling the way it should be: fast, fun, and well-integrated with the Fifth Edition and Swords and Wizardry rules mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a complete adventure that can be run on its own or dropped into an existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survive the journey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vanquish your foes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rediscover the Lost Hall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claim your reward&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
