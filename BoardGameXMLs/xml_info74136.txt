							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Ride Kursk: Gross Deutschland â€“ Updated 2016</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game has been completely updated, as has the entire game set including DRK-3Pz, DRK-11Pz, and the XLVIII PzK Enhancement.  The most significant features that have been improved are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Map - many of the owners of the IISS game set have already have&lt;br/&gt;The Master Rules - which now contain a significant amount of clarifications and examples and are downloadable from the Death Ride Kursk ConsimWorld folder&lt;br/&gt;The Command and Control and Fire Support Enhancements are now built in to the main games&lt;br/&gt;The Air, Maintenance, and Logistics Enhancements are only in the XLVIII Enhancement package&lt;br/&gt;The unit counters have symbology similar to the IISS game set&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Battle for the Red Army has been updated&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios for the XLVIII 3 game set have been updated&lt;br/&gt;The charts and tables have been brought up to date with the IISS game set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game, and its sister games (DRK-3Pz and DRK-11Pz), have been re-released and were updated.  They are great representations of the fight at Kursk and the struggle for the Kursk salient which failed miserably for the Germans.  Red Army dominance over the Germans was established here and you can see why in playing this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Master Rules are well developed and have input from numerous conventions and player input.  They are based on the seven battlefield operating systems and the sequence of play is very open, allowing players to perform activity in the order the players deem most appropriate and requiring a significant amount of planning.  Just moving around the map can be very dangerous.  Planning your maneuver, fire support, air defenses, logistics, command and control, engineering, and intelligence assets to come together and help you fight the battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
