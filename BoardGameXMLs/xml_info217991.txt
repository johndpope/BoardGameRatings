							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MASHED: A Korean War MASH RPG</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MASHED is a tabletop roleplaying game that uses Powered by the Apocalypse rules to explore the value of human life and the stresses of war&amp;mdash;but it&amp;rsquo;s also about relationships. And courage. And laughter. And love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although your characters spend long hours performing surgery, MASHED compresses these into short events to focus on the most dramatic moments. Much of the game actually occurs outside of the operating tent, at times when the flow of casualties has ebbed. Here you may fall in or out of love, fight the orders of ineffective top brass, set up pranks, help your South Korean allies, pick fights, seduce your way through the unit, pull rank, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can find ways to relax amid the horrors of surgery and war, you might get rotated home with your sanity intact. Just remember that you&amp;rsquo;re practicing medicine in a combat zone&amp;mdash;and death isn&amp;rsquo;t confined to the operating tent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
