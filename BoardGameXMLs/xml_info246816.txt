							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Glory</name>
									
			<description>All heroes need to prove their worth! In Tales of Glory, the players play emerging heroes. Each turn represents a year in the heroes' lives, and each player decides what their hero has done that year (defeated a monster, looted treasure, met people, etc.) to try to gain glory. After ten turns, the player with the most glory wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players select at the same time a quest they want to do from a common pool. They then have to pay the cost of the quest and place it on their &amp;quot;path of life&amp;quot; connected to another quest they already made or their departure area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some quests such as slaying monsters bring immediate glory points while others are affected by what players have done before or will do afterwards on their path of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
