			<description>This is Memory but with some special cards. There is the Arschkarte: you give this one to another player. That player has to give away half of his already collected cards.   &lt;br/&gt;Vollselberendverarschkarte: If you draw this card you have to give half of your cards to your left neighbor. &lt;br/&gt;Rinderwahnsinnkarte: Players change their seats but have to leave their cards.&lt;br/&gt;Joker: it is your turn again.&lt;br/&gt;Aetsch/baetsch Karte: There are no matching cards for these cards so players lose their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
