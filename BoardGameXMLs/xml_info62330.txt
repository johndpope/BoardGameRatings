							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Greatest Gift</name>
									
			<description>A card game about trying to figure out what the other players would most like out of real life, and offering these things as gifts.  Players are rewarded when their offered gifts are chosen above the others.  Gifts range from wealth, skills, and acts of kindness to super powers and objects of absolute ridiculousness, and even a few &amp;quot;promises&amp;quot; for real-life things.  Fast-paced and simple to learn and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
