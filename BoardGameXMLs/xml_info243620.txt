			<description>North &amp;amp; South brings you to the future, to a place where two armies troop together at each other's border, ready to enter into the inevitable confrontation.&lt;br/&gt;As the commanding officer of the northern troops, you try to determine the positions and the strength of the enemy elite troops by means of some daring moves.&lt;br/&gt;The opponent from the South tries to do the same and the consequences soon make themselves felt. Skirmishes in the air and on land quickly lead to true trials of strength in which now the North and then the South is winning.&lt;br/&gt;Luck only plays a minor part and the better strategist will win increasingly more battles. Only recklessness or a surprise counteroffensive can still stop him from winning the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
