			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll find everything you need to create an anthropomorphic animal character compatible with the rules in the SRD5. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re a player looking for a specific furry race to craft your perfect avatar, or a DM building a vast world with diverse and fantastical residents. Whatever your desire, the options and rules presented are intended to give you the utmost convenience and flexibility to make incredible anthro characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Anthros&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthro is a term that collectively refers to creatures of numerous races of anthropomorphic animals. All anthros have the humanoid creature type, appended with the (anthro) tag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The typical anthro (if there is such a thing), is roughly human-sized and shaped. They have animalistic skulls, though sometimes the muzzle is shortened, giving the anthro a somewhat more human profile. While fur is the dominant skin covering for anthros (hence, the race&amp;rsquo;s most common slang epithet: furry), other bloodlines might boast colorful plumage, a variety of reptilian and piscine scales, or even a chitin exoskeleton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fursona 5E is an update to the series for D&amp;amp;D 5th Edition. It contains converted content from the original Fursona:The Definitive Guide to Creating Anthropomorphic Characters, plus new material exclusive to this sourcebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features a streamlined approach to character creation, so generating an anthro has never been easier. Choose from 21 races and 72 subraces, or create your own creature using a comprehensive list of traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are new subclasses, backgrounds, feats, spells, items, and everything else you need for an anthro campaign. Whether you are a player looking to create your perfect furry avatar, or a DM building a vast world with diverse and fantastical residents, Fursona 5E is your definitive source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
