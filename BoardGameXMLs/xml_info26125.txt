							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Reel to Reel Picture Show James Bond 007 Movie Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>An expansion for the Reel to Reel Picture show game, this game could be played on its own with home rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions fall into four categories which are color coded&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yellow covers the Bond Basics, questions about Bond Girls, Villains and the props.  These questions are usually the easiest of the four categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pink covers the films of the Connery and Lazenby era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue covers the Moore, Dalton and Pierce Brosnan films.  At the time of this game being made, only Goldeneye had been made for Brosnan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silver covers Extras and other background characters, credits, the various music of the films and catchphrases and quotes.  This category can be either very easy or quite obscure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
