			<description>&amp;Aacute;lmok is a game about deep buried memories in the mind. It is a journey between dreams and nightmares. It is an experience based on the unconscious perceptions of the oniric mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;Aacute;lmok, the players are in deep sleep, trying to collect parts of their dreams to scape an eternal nightmare. Use your memory, find your way to the wakening, tap in sleeping powers of the unconscious mind, be the first to get free from your dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;Aacute;lmok uses the classic Memory Game mechanic with some twists to make the game more dynamic and enjoyable. In your turn, you turn cards face up and check if they are a group, like the classic game, but here, the groups must have 3 cards, but you can combine then using their color or their number, much like a rummy game. Each group you form, give you points and also a special dream ability that you can use later to gain even more points or save for bonus points in the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who reaches a certain amount of points first (based on the number of players), is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
