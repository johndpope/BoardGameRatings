			<description>Cassette Inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INVINCIBLE ISLAND is the primitive ancestral home of the mysterious Xaro tribe. Untouched by civilisation, legend tells that these island savages guard the unimaginable treasures of their first great leader - Xaro himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, you have more than just legend to guide you. Whilst on Invincible Island Dr. Chumley, the world famous explorer, sent out a last desperate message in a bottle. Amongst his pleas for help and rescue was a vital clue: &amp;quot;First find the Seven Parchments of Xaro&amp;quot;. He was never heard of again - perhaps the natives were hungry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with this information, your quest is to find the seven parchments, which, if Dr. Chumley was right, should lead you to the treasure. But remember: treasure is no use to you unless you can escape with it - alive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you on your quest, this program will show a graphic re[presentation of every location you enter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOOD LUCK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
