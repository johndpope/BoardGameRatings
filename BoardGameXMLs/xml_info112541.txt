			<description>WARGASM (which stands for War Ground Air Special Missions) is a 3D real-time strategy game developed by Digital Image Design and published by Infogrames in 1998 for the Windows PC platform. The game uses the 3Dream engine which allows for rich, atmospheric and varied battlefields as well as cutting edge (for its time) graphics. The player acted as commander and could direct AI friendly units as to what to do via a simple control interface on a 2D overhead map, and if desired could jump directly into any allied unit and control it in the 3D real-time environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can fight as a regular infantryman, special forces soldier, in a tank, in an armored personnel carrier (APC) or in a helicopter. Airstrikes are also available that are carried out by ground attack aircraft and stealth bombers but they cannot be controlled by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wargasm&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
