							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scooby Doo Game</name>
									
			<description>A game produced around 1980 by Milton Bradley, it was largely a standard children's roll-and-move game with a couple of twists: part of the board was a raised platform to give a 3D effect, and there was a lazy-susan under the game board that (when it worked correctly) would move pawns from one part of the board to another.  The player pawns, like the cover, featured Scooby Doo and his beloved nephew, Scrappy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
