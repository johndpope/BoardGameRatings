							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The White Witch</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The White Witch is probably the least understood Class in Dunreth or maybe all the world. The Pantheon considers these terrible Pagans to be only one step above their evil counterparts. Feeling that they could be to easily swayed to evil ways. Witches are really a cross between Clerics and Sorcerers. Their magic is derived from both the old, pagan gods they worship and the mana of the world. There are many types of&lt;br/&gt;Witches, and gods that they worship. Here you will find generic rules you can apply to the various types of worship there is for white witches. You will also find two examples from The Hunt: Rise of Evil Campaign setting. Their spells tend to be that of divination and healing. They brew potions and can lay on some powerful curses. Generally, white witches will tend not to use curses unless they are in a dire situation. It is their very ability to curse others that has allowed the Pantheon to sway the people of the world against them in many countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
