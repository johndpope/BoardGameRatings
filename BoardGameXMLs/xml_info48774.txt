			<description>From the back of the Boxed set:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Behind Enemy Lines is a role-playing game which allows you to take on the character of a U.S. infantryman in World War II. Parachute drops, night raids, sniper ambushes, pitched battles, combat patrols, and long-range reconaissance probes are the challenges you face. Your enemy is cunning, well-trained, and well-equipped. Your ingenuity, your courage, and skill are all that stand between you and disaster.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book 1 - Character Generation and Basic Rules. 96 pages of information and tables ranging from character generation, tank data and equipment weights to the basic sighting and fire tables. Simple and complex games can be played with selected use of this information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book 2 - Event Tables - 48 pages filled with event tables for all types of terrain and situations. In all, 38 tables giving detailed Game Master information and general player descriptions are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book 3 - Missions - A 56 page booklet containing three full length missions, four incidents, historical biographies, and 192 non-player characters. A 16 page booklet filled with maps for the missions and incidents is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;112 illustrated counters depicting American and German soldiers, civilians and special equipment, are provided.
