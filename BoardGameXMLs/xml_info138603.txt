			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many occupations that need a skilled hand, a keen eye, and a quick mind. The middle classes of the world are made up of experts with varying degrees of skill, plying their trade and earning an honest living. Some skills are so well regarded and paid that there are never any shortages of apprentices, and the greatest of artisans gain such stature and renown as to be figures of note throughout the lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among them, some gifted individuals speak of times when there is almost a melding of mind and body, where they seem to enter a Zone where every action is precise, every perception accurate and the greatest acts of skill can be wrought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be that as it may, sometimes trouble comes uncalled even into the most secure of dwelling and civilized city. And even the most devoted of workers may then have need of more than their craft to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The talented experts of the world are Professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
