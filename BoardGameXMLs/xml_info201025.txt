			<description>In the year 1799 the ship The Lutine shipwrecked for the coast of Holland. It carried large amounts of gold and silver. Until now there's still a large amount of this treasures left at the bottom of the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cardgame the sea bottom is simulated by 36 cards representing treasure or sand. Each type of treasure has a different value. To win the game you have to play your handcards better than other players to recover the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all treasure is recovered the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy treasure hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
