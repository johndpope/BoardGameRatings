			<description>This follow-on to Activity (1993) premiered at Essen 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a party game for teams with progress being tracked using up to 4 pawns on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player of a team draws a card showing something from the Ruhr area of Germany.  Then, depending on the card type, the player either draws on paper, silently acts out or verbally describes what is displayed on the card so that his teammates can guess it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sand timer determines whether the clue was achieved in sufficient time and whether the team's pawn may advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usually lasts about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
