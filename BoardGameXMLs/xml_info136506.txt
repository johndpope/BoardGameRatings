			<description>Knights of Xentar is a humorous JRPG with erotic content. The RPG system is completely different from that of the previous games. The player travels with a top-down view on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons similar to other traditional Japanese RPGs. The enemy encounters are random. The battles themselves are displayed in a side-view style similar to other Japanese RPGs such as Final Fantasy. The battles themselves are partially automated with the enemies and characters attacking each other in real-time. Battle can be paused at any time to cast a spell, use an item, or change attack style through a list of AI scripts. There are eight levels of attack strength, each with its advantages and disadvantages (for example, more powerful attack levels require more time). The game's quest is nearly two times longer than the series' first episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Knights of Xentar&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
