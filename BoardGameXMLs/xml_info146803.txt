			<description>Botchee Deluxe is a dice game where players will be attempting to create specific number patterns using one of six different modes of game play. The dice are sometimes rolled and sometimes simply used to represent a player's number. The game comes with two different plastic grids that the dice site in, allowing for customizable play and shifting of game difficulty. Most of the games play much like Suduko, with number patterns being required across rows and columns. But some of the games also allow for speed play and solo play. The entire game fits in a small plastic case, making it an easy travel game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few examples of the game modes of play include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o Region: This game mode uses columns and rows in the game frame. A row and a column region extends from one side of the game frame to the other. A box  region can only be located in one of the game frame corners. Players take turns selecting one of the dice and placing it in the game frame. The goal is to be the first player to complete a number sequence using one of the 3 regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o Speed: This game mode is all about solving the same Sudoku like puzzle using the Region play mode as quickly as possible. A stopwatch or other timekeeping device is necessary to play this game mode. The winner is the player with the best time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
