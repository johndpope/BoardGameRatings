			<description>Humans have become the cheapest and most dependable sources of labor in the Deep Intersect, a far-out sector of the Polystellar Intersystem. And the outer system Space Law, the code of order that makes it illegal to abduct Humans, is poorly enforced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays as one of four Alien species, each with a special power that will help them expand their control of the galaxy. Players must collect Flux Cores and abduct as many Humans as they can while expanding and maintaining their control of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, each player plays an Action card and assigns its Action Points. Then, the player rolls three Energy Cubes (dice) and 'burns' the Energy Value (pips) at the various Power Cores around the board or Species card. Players must collect Flux Cores (+1VP), which are needed to abduct Humans (+2VP) and explore the galaxy (+VP), in order to earn VPs and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Cards also have a Combat Bonus that can be applied in a Space Battle, where the struggle for control is most apparent. Each Alien species also has a unique species trait that is also applied in a Space Battle. Players also struggle for control of the galaxy in a tug-of-war fashion on the Control track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last Human has been abducted, the game is over. The player with the most VPs wins. Ties are settled with one last Space Battle, with the current VPs included as a combat bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires 3 (or more) dice, 4 tokens, and all included files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
