			<description>Equipment: 27 cards with black numbers and 27 cards with red numbers, each showing a points number and 3 squares holding a combination of numbers and Xs. No rules but it appears to be a trick-taking game. The cards you win are then used to complete your Football Pools results on your personal score-sheet.&lt;br/&gt;Football Pools were very popular in Britain, up till the 1990's, when the National Lottery came in and was simpler and more convenient the the Pools. The Football Pools required you to pick any 8 results from the professional games played that weekend and predict which games would end in a draw. If you got 8 right, you were a winner and the prize could be very substantial, even a million pounds plus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
