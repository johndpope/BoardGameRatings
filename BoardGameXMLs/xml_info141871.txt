			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Machine Language Arcade Game Written To Use All Those Special Features Of Your MOD III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien Defense is a fast action, machine language, arcade type game, with sound. It is written for the Radio Shack Model III microcomputer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts out with three Ships and three Smart Bombs. An additional Ship and Smart Bomb is awarded for every 10,000 points achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Smart Bomb will destroy everything on the screen (including your men on the bottom but excluding your ship) at the instant it is activated-but not aliens appearing on the screen while the explosions are taking place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warp Drive gives you the ability to get out of tight situations in a hurry - or vise versa - use with extreme caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are given fifteen men, positioned at random in the mountains, to protect from the aliens. For every 25 aliens that you destroy (excluding Mutants and Swarmers) you will get a Bonus of 100 points for every man that you have left. When all of the men are gone (destroyed by Smart Bombs or picked up by Landers) the terrain will be destroyed and you will end up in space with an unbelievable number of alines after you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you destroy a Lander while it is carrying one of your men, the man will start falling toward the ground. If you catch him before he hits bottom you get 500 points. If you set him down by moving your Ship all the way down, you get another 500 points. Activating the Warp Drive while carrying a man has dire consequences for the man (no points for you either).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you destroy a Pod (filled in diamond) it bursts into Swarmers that make Kamakazi Pilots look tame so it would probably be a good idea to have a Smart Bomb left when you go after one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of Radio Shack's policy of prosecuting anyone who distributes programs on TRSDOS Diskettes this program is distributed on a standard formatted diskette with its own boot loader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
