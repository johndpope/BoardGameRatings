			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five dice spotted 2 to 6, with a fish replacing the 1 spot. the fish on the one spot is a Black Crappie.&lt;br/&gt;The object is to catch the most number of fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have three rolls of the dice. The player rolls all five dice on his or her first roll, trying to produce a 6. If on the first roll the player gets a 6, the player sets that die aside and scores any fish thrown as part of his or her catch. The player then rolls the remaining four dice two additional times, trying to increase his or her catch of fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is played the same. A player must get a 6 before scoring the catch of fish. If a player does not roll a 6 during his or her three rolls per turn, the player cannot score fish on that turn, and passes the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player catching the most fish after each player has had three turns, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains: 5 green fish dice &lt;br/&gt; instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
