			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is announced but has not been released yet and is NOT sold yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it, nor add new releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miegakure explores four-dimensional space in order to solve various higher-dimensional puzzles within a garden setting. Inspired by the classic science-fiction novella Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin Abbot Abbot, Miegakure plays much like a regular three-dimensional platformer, but at the press of a button one of the dimensions is exchanged with its four-dimensional counterpart, allowing for four-dimensional movement as the player explores this new dimension in the same way that a two-dimensional being would explore the third, experiencing the various consequences of being able to move within a four-dimensional space by allowing players to experience it first-hand, using trial and error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Miegakure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
