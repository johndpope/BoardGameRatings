							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slimes: The Battle for the Boss Medallion</name>
									
			<description>The Boss Medallion is a relic awarded to various dungeon trash mobs and underlings that grants them the title of &amp;quot;Boss Monster&amp;quot;. and Once there was a cave in which dwelled a dragon whelp who possessed such a Medallion. One day, the whelp came to this realization: if he is destined to grow up to become a mighty Dragon, a force powerful enough to threaten possibly even the world's existence, what use does he have for such trinkets?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so begins the Battle for the Boss Medallion: a contest/game in which the dragon whelp has granted the opportunity to earn a Boss Title to one of the dungeon world's lowest inhabitants, the Slime!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The competing Slime lieutenants (the players) each have 10 health and take turns playing their Slime minions (cards) onto the Play Pile following rules similar to the card game B.S. Whenever a lieutenant's Bluff is called, a duel follows, with the loser taking damage from the recently played Slime Minions. These tactics and blows are exchanged until only one lieutenant is left standing to claim the whelp's Medallion!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary and Additional Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bluffing card game with Slime Combat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each deck features a different color mix of slimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Jokers and Slime abilities add even more strategy to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
