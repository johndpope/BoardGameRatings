			<description>Was marketed by the Helen of Toy Company by mail order from the back of comic books in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game of modern warfare was played out with plastic pieces on a map made of very thin plastic. The square grid shows a horseshoe landmass with an island in the middle. Players set up on opposite ends of the horseshoe and prepare to fight it out. Results are achieved via a spinner. Pieces include aircraft carriers, battleships, smaller cruisers, delta wing jets and tanks. There are also cardboard markers showing either the Maltese cross or the British three-ringed circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
