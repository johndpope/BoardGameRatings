			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;SENSUOUS EXCITING EXPERIENCES is a board game unlike any game you have ever played. Spinning the spinner and rolling the die, both of you will engage in a broad range of loving and romantic activities as well as communicating with each other and sharing yourself with your partner. As you engage in each activity you will earn points towards the `Gift of Time.'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games are played to a time limit or point limit. Components include a large board, 2 pawns, a spinner, a die, and rules. The rules recommend a pencil &amp;amp; paper for keeping score, although you could probably make do with a permanent marker &amp;amp; an expanse of bare skin. Presumably you will also want a timer, as AP is likely to be a serious problem when your opponent gets a result such as &amp;quot;Wild time: Relax and enjoy anything your lover wants to do with you, for you, or to you for the next (number) minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
