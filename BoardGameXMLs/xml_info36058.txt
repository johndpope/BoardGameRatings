							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gangs of New York Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Dead Rabbits vs Bowery Boys. Simulation of an all out Street Melee between two rival NY urban gangs circa 1864. Victory: Kill your opponents Leader.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 6x8 grid (it may be convenient to use a portion of a chess board). Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combatants. Each player starts with sixteen units: one Leader, seven Axers, and eight Knifers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn both players roll five six-sided dice. Each die result corresponds to one of six possible moves listed on the Result chart (such as &amp;ldquo;1 - One knifer may kill an opponent in an orthogonally adjacent space&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;5 - Move one of your men two spaces in any direction.&amp;rdquo;) The players alternate using one die result to make a move. After both players have used their five dice, the next turn begins and the process is repeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
