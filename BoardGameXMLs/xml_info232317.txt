			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this interactive story, see the Innerstar University campus through the eyes of the main character: a girl who is suddenly faced with a whole lot of change. It all begins when your room becomes flooded and you have no choice but to move out. You&amp;rsquo;re sure that your best friend would comfort you&amp;mdash;if she weren&amp;rsquo;t spending so much time with another girl. And you can't ride your favorite horse, Angel, on the overnight trail ride because she's almost ready to foal. Are you strong enough to roll with all the changes and to make the right choices for yourself? With more than 20 different endings, you'll enjoy this book again and again to see how different decisions change the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
