			<description>The kingdom's most celebrated warriors have come from far and wide to do combat in a grand tournament that will determine who is the fiercest of them all. Each has a personal reason for competing in the event, but there is a single thread that unites all of them: the desire to put their fighting skills on display in order to earn the right to be called champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sainome Colosseum R&amp;quot; is a fast-paced, PvP combat game for 2-4 players that allows players to take on chosen character roles, each with an assortment of individual skills and abilities. Using action selection, hand management, card drafting, and dice rolling, &amp;quot;Sainome Colosseum R&amp;quot; gives players important decision points while blending strategy, luck, and balanced replayability. As you explore the game, you discover the strengths and weaknesses of each character as well as interesting combinations that can put your opponents down for the count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player chooses two out of five actions, resolves both, then discards to meet the hand limit requirements. To gain the advantage in battle, gear can be attached to your character by physically placing equipment cards on any side of your fighter with a corresponding slot. These equipment cards can then activated using a unique dice mechanism to attack your opponents and initiate a wide range of special effects. Adding further to this dynamic gameplay is the ability for each character to transform from their beginning Normal Form to a heightened Awakened Form, which grants skill upgrades. The player who best utilizes these various systems to reduce their opponent's HP to 0 is ultimately the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
