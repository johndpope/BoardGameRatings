							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pacific War Classics Vol 1: Tarawa &amp; Saipan</name>
									
			<description>PACIFIC WAR CLASSICS VOLUME 1: The Island Battles of Tarawa and Saipan consists of two games in one package. The battles at Tarawa and Saipan are depicted on separate game maps and use two separate game systems. Although the Fresno Gaming Association was probably guilty of plagiarism in some of their game designs, their graphic presentation was always first class and this game is no exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Island Battle of Saipan uses the system that FGA previously used in their OPERATION CRUSADER game. This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls. Each hex on the Tarawa map represents 35 yards from hexside to opposite hexside and a Game Turn represents 2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9&amp;quot; x 12&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot; bookcase style game box; &lt;br/&gt;16-page (8?&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot;) Rules booklet; &lt;br/&gt;two 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; unmounted game maps; &lt;br/&gt;17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; unmounted game map; &lt;br/&gt;960 die-cut, back-printed, unpunched, cardboard counters; &lt;br/&gt;five card-stock Player Aids; and &lt;br/&gt;a 10-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
