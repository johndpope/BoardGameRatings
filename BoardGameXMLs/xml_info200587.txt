							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pizza Pronto</name>
									
			<description>Due to a telecommunication snafu, all of the pizza places in town are receiving the same orders from the same customers! The first delivery person to the house gets the tip, but did you remember the order correctly? Which pizza did the zoo order? Mushrooms? Pepperoni?!? You have to race your opponents to get customer&amp;rsquo;s tips first, but make sure you complete the order accurately or you get nothing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pizza Pronto, 3-5 players compete to deliver pizzas to locations around the table by flicking discs and tossing tokens. Each round, an order is read aloud. &amp;ldquo;Hello! I need a pineapple and pepperoni pizza at the zoo and a mushroom and pineapple pizza to the firehouse, please.&amp;rdquo; Players flick their delivery disc in real time, racing to each location. Once there, you can pick up a pizza and try to toss it into the fenced area. When a player has delivered both pizzas, they place their disc in the highest spot on the garage board. Players score points for delivering the correct pizzas to the correct locations, with bonus points awarded for speed and throwing accuracy. Once the deck of cards runs out, the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
