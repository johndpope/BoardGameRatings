			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We used to think that when the lights went out, the ghosts appeared. No, no...we had it all wrong. When the lights come on is when the ghosts come out to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine waking up one day and discovering, realizing, that all the data you are working with, all the code you hack, all the buzzing equipment, isn't clean; it isn't pristine and white the way you've been taught technology is, it doesn't obey the rules of logic the way you were shown it does, it isn't a glorious tool and it definitely isn't inanimate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Machines gather ghosts, and sorcerers can call them out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electric Ghosts is a complete, illustrated PDF mini-supplement for the Sorcerer RPG by Adept Press, and defines demons as ghosts born from the electric currents of modern technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
