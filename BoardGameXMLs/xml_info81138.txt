			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you stop the terrifying menace of the Gremlins?&lt;br/&gt;Gizmo is trapped inside Clamp Centre by the evil Gremlins. Your mission? Help him battle his way to the Control Center and rid the city forever of the Gremlin menace. &lt;br/&gt;It's not going to be easy. You'll have to use cunning and wits to survive with only the weapons you find inside Clamp Centre...matches, a flashlight, tomatoes, and a homemade bow and arrow. &lt;br/&gt;But if you're lucky, the door to Mr. Wing's Magic Shop may mystically appear...and let you buy some very special-and powerful-items to help you.&lt;br/&gt;This game has all the traps, mazes, and lightning quick moves to push your skills to the limits. And it has graphics that seem to come alive on the Screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gremlins. Stopping them is not going to be easy! Don;t say we didn't warn you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
