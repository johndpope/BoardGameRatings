							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Black Bestiary</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Tokyo is a unique modern-magic and urban horror campaign inspired equally by Japanese folklore and hentai horror and guro anime. A dark reality called the Black Else invades a twisted version of the modern world. Ordinary men and women are helpless against demons, oni and undead, and only the boldest heroes have an even chance against the perverse and the vile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Bestiary details the horrors of this strange, adults only campaign setting. Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find details of monsters as diverse as the pathetic, strangling cord called an Ittan, all the way up to cruel and god-like beings like the Vitruvian Walker, the legendary Biwa Centipede, or even worse things. Potential friends and foes, such as warriors of the feminist Eyrines Sisterhood, brutal Rape Pure brawlers, heroic Tokyo Metropolitian Police Department officers, and more are also fully detailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Bestiary includes all the monsters presented in the Black Tokyo Unlimited Edition to date, as well as dozens of all new monsters, creature variants, and other threats. Where the monsters found in Black Tokyo Unlimited generally had their origins as warped revisions of traditional Japanese folkloric creatures, many of those in the Black Bestiary are reflections of more modern nightmares. With new creatures ranging from the pitiful and idiotic, sea-shell crunching Awabi to the bat winged, night prowling and cannibalistic Devil Vigilante all the way to the Queen of Hell itself, the nightmarish Izanagi, The Black Bestiary includes well over one hundred vicious horrors for every level of your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
