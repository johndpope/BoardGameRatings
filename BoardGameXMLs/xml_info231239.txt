			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genius Guide to the Talented Bestiary is more than just another book of monsters (though we have that too!). The monster creation rules detail the step by step streamlined process for determining a monster&amp;rsquo;s base statistics. These allow you to quickly and easily design a monster of any size and challenge rating, making unique and balanced threats for your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Talented Monster Abilities breaks down every creature type and subtype, universal monster rule, and all the unique creature abilities your monsters need.&lt;br/&gt;        Talented Monsters demonstrates the capabilities of the system by presenting scores of new monsters created with it.&lt;br/&gt;        Player Options presents rules adding new and interesting possibilities for player characters such as construct creation, animating undead, monster cohorts, and summoning. We even have optional rules for creating character class progressions from monsters, letting PCs play anything they can dream of!&lt;br/&gt;        Talented Templates outlines our methods for using the monster creation rules to produce templates, adding infinite options for modification of any monster anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;        Mythic Monster Rules dial the talented rules up to the Mythic level, allowing you to build custom creatures with the most powerful of monster abilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
