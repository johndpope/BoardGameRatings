							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sinister Secrets of Silvermote</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hellish 64 page dungeon crawl designed for the Pathfinder RPG and scales for characters of 7th-12th level--an adventure not for the faint of heart! This is the first ever full-length adventure by Total Party Kill Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting of this adventure is a place called Silvermote, the underground lair of our latest villain in the Infamous Adversary product line, [Temerlyth the Undying]. You do not need the latter product to enjoy this one, but owning both will enhance your enjoyment immensely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temerlyth, our infamous elven lich, was forced to spend his great personal fortune and energies building what has become a hidden lair, laboratory and base of operations. He built it during a downward spiral of frustration, bitterness, spite, hatred and, finally, insanity-all of which drove him to seek lichdom. Silvermote is a calamitous reflection of his nature and more. This bizarre place features elements reminiscent of cathedrals, crypts and laboratories built over about a decade as Temerlyth, a once gifted alchemist and enchanter, went slowly mad and turned to dark necromancy in seeking a lasting solution against all werekind. Silvermote is a strange place from a lost age and has grown at least as twisted as its undead owner and just as filled with ancient spite and untold secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sinister Secrets of Silvermote is part adventure, part recurring campaign location, all written especially for the Pathfinder RPG. The adventure features an unhealthy mixture of lycanthropy, undead, traps, tricks, new magic items and much, much more, including rules for making intricate magical tomes, locked, trapped and ready to fill a library of rewards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure can be dropped into any campaign setting as a hyper-challenging one-shot adventure or as a recurring adventure site to which defeated characters might return again and again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 64-page adventure features high-quality art, a detailed, full-color map of Silvermote (viewable in the teaser!) and uses the Open Game License to work with the Pathfinder RPG rules. It also features full hyperlinks to the award-wining D20PFSRD web site so everything you need online is right at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
