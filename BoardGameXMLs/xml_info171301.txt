							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales &amp; Games: The Three Little Pigs â€“ Bonus Card</name>
									
			<description>This card is a promo card that was included in Tales &amp; Games: The Hare &amp; the Tortoise, and later in Tales &amp; Games: The Pied Piper, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card reads as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus Card for the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Three Little Pigs&amp;trade;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use this card in the Veteran Pigs variant. Award this card at the end of the game to the player who has blown away the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time you blow on an opponent's house, you receive the tiles that were blown away, instead of removing them from the game. Form a separate stack of these tiles, so you don't confuse them with your own building tiles.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, each player counts the pig heads on the tiles that he blew away. Whichever player has the most &amp;quot;bluster&amp;quot; points receives this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is a tie, nobody gets this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
