							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alpha Complex Nights</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alpha Complex Nights are three adventures set in the world of Paranoia. The first, Spin Control, features the deadly world of sporks, public relations management and the plots of deranged and evil secret societies. The really dangerous part of all this is the public relations part, of course. The brain eating zombies are nothing to worry about at all. In My First Treason five pre-generated young citizens get to experience their immensely fun childhood in a cr&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;che that specialises in young citizens that have had&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;brvbar;problems. As junior citizens they are expected to learn and grow into their future roles as proud foot vat technicians or bot repairmen. However this group of five famously resourceful junior citizens (and their petbot Timmy) are drawn into a series of increasingly jolly adventures. The final adventure is the Sweep of Unhistory. Due to a series of improbable coincidences the troubleshooters find themselves as the last, final, terminal line of defence for Alpha Complex. Fate has caused them to be the saviours of the computer not once or twice but on many separate occasions. Is not Friend Computer lucky to have such diligent and heroic citizens protecting Alpha Complex. So grab your laser barrel, citizen, and go forth and gladly serve Friend Computer by defeating the enemies of Alpha Complex!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
