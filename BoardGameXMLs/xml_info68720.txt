			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World's Oldest Criminal Organization is Coming for You... Are you ready?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Triads control crime in Hong Kong, and in many other cities around the world - but what few people realize is that the Triads have a history that reaches back 2000 years, to their beginnings as revolutionary secret societies in ancient China!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook, for use with Hong Kong Action Theatre!, is a complete reference to the Triads - their history, their traditions, and their operations. Whether they appear as the villains or the heroes, the Triads are an integral part of the Hong Kong Action Film genre, and now HKAT! players have more information than ever before available!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Triad Sourcebook features more gangsters than you can shake a REALLY BIG GUN at, a timeline of Triad history, varied informational sidebars, adn a collection of film adventures for Hong Kong Action Theatre!, including an epic-length adventure pitting the Triads against the forces of the Cthulhu Mythos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
