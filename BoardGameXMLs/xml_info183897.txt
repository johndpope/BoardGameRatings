			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wildlings have invaded your dream!&lt;br/&gt;Will it make you laugh or make you scream?&lt;br/&gt;The Stuff of Dreams and Nightmares help fight or flight&lt;br/&gt;Until half the Star Maps have tapped their light.&lt;br/&gt;When a &amp;ldquo;Question&amp;rdquo; is posed, more Stuff you may win&lt;br/&gt;Or else be lost in dream when your Star goes dim.&lt;br/&gt;~ . ~&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Stuff of Dreams and Nightmares, a story-telling,&lt;br/&gt;role-playing game where you and your friends play both yourselves&lt;br/&gt;and the strange creatures called Wildlings. Will the Wildlings use&lt;br/&gt;the powers of the stars to absorb all the Stuff of Dreams, or will you&lt;br/&gt;be able to take control of the dream, and escape?&lt;br/&gt;The Wildling rhyme helps explain how to play the game in general,&lt;br/&gt;but especially for the first time through, I&amp;rsquo;ll break down each line of&lt;br/&gt;the rhyme to explain in more detail.&lt;br/&gt;Also, the story is built by some materials you&amp;rsquo;ll have to gather.&lt;br/&gt;First, each Player will need one five-ounce can of kids&amp;rsquo; modeling&lt;br/&gt;compound. This will be the &amp;ldquo;Stuff of Dreams and Nightmares&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;referenced in the game. You can try for a brand name product&lt;br/&gt;like Play-Doh&amp;reg;, a home-made version of such, or another kind of&lt;br/&gt;compound like clay, as long as everyone has an equivalent amount,&lt;br/&gt;about 5 ounces (about 2/3 US cup.)&lt;br/&gt;Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll also need the Star Maps and the map of the Dreamscape.&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see how they are used during the play, but once you are really&lt;br/&gt;good at the game, or are an experienced story-gamer already, you&lt;br/&gt;might even choose to make these maps optional.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to two coins. Any pair will do, as long as each&lt;br/&gt;coin has a discernible head/tail side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
