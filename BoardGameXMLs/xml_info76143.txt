			<description>Volume III in the Rage Series System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Rage is a modern-near future RPG set in the modern world.  The world is in chaos, and warfare is everywhere.  The game takes place regionally in major hotspots or can happen in the hallowed halls of politics.  It's your choice!  You choose the battleground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can be Soldiers, Merchants, Pilots, Psi-Ops or Nobles. Each character type has expanded paths to choose from (Mercenary, Infantry, Armor, Thief, Smuggler, Pilots and the list continues).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The packet is 48 pages and contains all of the details to create your own game from the ground up. Character Sheets are included and can be photo copied as needed.  All you need is a d20, pencil and paper and you are ready to play!  Like all games in the Rage Series, this product is designed as a stand alone game but it can also be played interchangably with every other game in the Rage Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
