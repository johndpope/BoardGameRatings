			<description>GOOGLY is a card game that simulate the game-flow of an actual cricket match (the instruction manual states the game is &amp;quot;all the form and thrills of cricket without the Rain Stopped Play notices).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself consists of 98 colorfully designed cards: 48 Batting Cards with blue backs and 50 bowling cards with green backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay begins by separating the 50 bowling cards from the 48 batting cards.  From the bowling deck a number of individual bowler piles are created (i.e., 5 piles if 5 bowlers are indicated by the defensive player). The batting cards are then shuffled and split into 2 piles (1 for each batsman), then the 1st batsman flips a card from his pile.  If a 2, 4, or 6 is played, the score is recorded and the 1st batsman continues play.  If a 1 or 3 is played, the score is recorded and the play moves to the 2nd batsman.  If a &amp;quot;How&amp;rsquo;s That&amp;quot; card is played, the defensive player flip the top card from the &amp;quot;active bowler&amp;quot; pile (i.e., the pile designated as the bowler for the current over) and scores the result (i.e., run out, stumped, Not out, Leg-bye, etc.).  Batting cards are reshuffled every three overs; bowling cards are reshuffled every five overs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game flow and rules closely follows the real game of cricket -  an over consists of 6 bowled balls (cards) plus extras, batsman change sides after each over, 10 wickets taken constitute an inning, etc.  As with the real cricket, the goal of the game is to outscore your opponent over two innings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(description based on text included in the rule book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
