			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;就カツ！ (Shukatsu!) is an educational game aimed at helping graduates prepare for the job market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until recently, it was very unusual for people to switch jobs, as many employers would be very loyal to their staff and effectively provide a job for life (evidenced by the ubiquitous Japanese 'salary-man'). You try to get into a good company on your first go and prosper for life, or get hired by an unknown small company and you are doomed. Changing jobs suggests to employers that there is something wrong with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, for pre-graduates, the process of landing your first job became hugely important, really defining your whole future. This process is called 就活 (Shuukatsu),from two words: 就職 (Shuushoku) meaning 'to get a job' and 活動 (Katsudou) meaning 'activity'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game Shukatsu! is a co-operative game to simulate the experience of winning a job offer. The game was designed and published by a professional career advisor. He says &amp;quot;Experience an year of job hunting, in an hour. The game is based on 20 years experience as an advisor, you would have a live experience. You may try to beat it purely as a game, but also it may be used as an job-hunting support tool. In that case, the creator may act as a facilitator to gain the best effects.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses various types of cards, for example, for the job-hunters:&lt;br/&gt;Activity card - study companies, attend ability training session.&lt;br/&gt;Weakness card - don't study for unknown matters, habitual latecomer, impatient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the employers:&lt;br/&gt;Company card - industrial newspaper press, internet brokerage.&lt;br/&gt;Hiring requirements - co-operativeness 3+, aspiration 3+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, some cards have Bad Events, for example:&lt;br/&gt; - too busy on part-time job.&lt;br/&gt; - suffer burnout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the setup, lay out some company cards and assign them requirements cards. These would be the goals of the game for the job-hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the players will be assigned some parameters, and some Weakness cards. By using the Activity cards, players work together to overcome those weakness, and eventually meet the requirements of those companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every once in a while, some Bad Events occur. Players must also work together to beat them too. At the end of the game year, if all of the players have managed to meet the requirements of some of the companies, they are hired and they win. If anyone fails to get a job, they all lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;キャリアアドバイザーが作った「就職内定」のためのゲーム。&lt;br/&gt;1年間の就職活動を、1時間で体験することができます。20年間のアドバイザー経験をもとに制作したので、ゲームとは思えないリアルな体験が得られます。&lt;br/&gt;純粋なゲームとして攻略してもいいですが、制作者がファシリテータとなって、就職活動支援のコンテンツとしていただくことで、より高い効果が得られます。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
