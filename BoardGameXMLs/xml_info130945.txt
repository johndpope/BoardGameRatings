							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocket Jockey: Space Port</name>
									
			<description>SETUP: After you create the face up cargo draft pile, place the Space Port tile next to the maneuver deck on the opposite side and turn over the top maneuver card in the deck and place it on the Space Port tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUELING: Whenever you draw a card, you may exchange one card from your hand with the maneuver card in the Space Port.  You may have a maximum hand size of 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MID-GAME SCORING VARIANT: Place a marker in front of the first player.  When the mid-game scoring is triggered, each player is given the opportunity of an equal number of turns.  New cards are not replenished in the planetary display, but each player is allowed to continue to make any available deliveries until the player to the left of the starting player finishes their turn.  Now continue with the mid-game scoring as normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
