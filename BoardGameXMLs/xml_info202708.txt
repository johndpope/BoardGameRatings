			<description>Trivia game about the 1970s. Has 500 different questions in 5 categories and is small enough to carry with you when traveling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a handful of category cards, and on their turn they may play one of them and try to answer a question from that category. If they answer correctly, they may discard that card; otherwise, it's returned to their hand. The first one to get rid of all his cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
