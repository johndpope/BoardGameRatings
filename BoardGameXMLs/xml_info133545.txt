			<description>Medieval Monastery is a card game in which players are trying to collect sets of an eight suited deck of cards. The suits are all related to monestary life, such as Prayer, Study, Order, Monk, etc. Each suit is numbered 1-9. The goal of the game is to collect straights, 3/4/5/6/7/8 of a kinds, and flushes. Each is worth a certain amount of points. These are collected at each of the game's 10 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is divided into four phases (Ascetic, Eremitical, Cenobitic, Salvation). The first is drawing a card, the second is the action phase, the third is the scoring, and the fourth is discarding all cards and starting fresh for the next turn. The actions of the second phase (Eremitical Phase) are determined by playing one card from your hand. Depending on the suit, you'll be able to draw new cards into your hand, trade cards with other players, or bid on cards drawn from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After ten turns the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
