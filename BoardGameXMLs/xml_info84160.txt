			<description>You and your opponent are snipers trying to kill off the members of your opponents army and maybe their sniper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sniper and Hiding places cards form the Sniper Row. The rest make the Trench. On your turn, you take the aiming card and put it on the opponent's card that you're attacking. Roll a d6 to see if you hit. After that it's your opponent's turn and play proceeds until either one's army is terminated or a sniper is fallen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 1 or 2 dice and 54 special cards in the game.&lt;br/&gt;There is 1 Aiming Card and a Pass Card&lt;br/&gt;There's a 26 cards set for each player's army. &lt;br/&gt;Each Army will consist of&lt;br/&gt;1 Sniper (You)&lt;br/&gt;9 Hiding places&lt;br/&gt;1 General&lt;br/&gt;1 Colonel&lt;br/&gt;1 Major&lt;br/&gt;1 Captain&lt;br/&gt;2 Sargent&lt;br/&gt;10 Solders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
