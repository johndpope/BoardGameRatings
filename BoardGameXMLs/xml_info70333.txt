			<description>A single player card game of Vikings and conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw cards to travel across a countryside to encounter, attack, and pillage towns and strongholds along the way.  All the while, you must keep up your food and army numbers as you try and control as many towns/strongholds as you can, depending on the difficulty you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you draw cards, you encounter enemies or towns and have to roll a die to determine your attack power.  As you push on with attacks, your army dwindles, but do not despair.  You gain more recruits through the towns and strongholds you conquer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you draw cards to move across the countryside, your army uses up your precious food, which you gain back through hunting or conquering towns to supply your army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a long and hard journey to capture all seven towns and strongholds, but with some perseverance your Viking army can come out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
