			<description>From the adventure introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of Shadowrunners are hired for a somewhat delicate job. However its unusual, but then Shadowruns usually are, that&amp;rsquo;s why you want capable folks who think not guys with itchy trigger fingers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh it should be entertaining, nice toys, wonderful locations, and well&amp;hellip; telling you the catch would spoil the fun&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the authors webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for and first run at GenconUK 2004. Since run once at Conception 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The groups at GenconUK did well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mission away from base this makes less use of contacts that some of the scenarios where contacts are critical. Players seem to work out that they need to be sensible and generally things have gone quite well. The ending can be a touch on the hazardous side but player characters have proven as resilient as ever to attempts to terminate them and have generally done ok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
