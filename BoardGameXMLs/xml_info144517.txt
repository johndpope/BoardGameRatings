			<description>From the box:  &amp;quot;The action-fun packed game of skill and chance.  Roll the dice, score words, set back opponents and have fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to make eight words from letter tiles that are collected as one moves around the board, although  optional goals may be established to suit the various player's ablities.  Most ot the spaces on the board allow players to choose from a selection of letter tiles, other spaces may allow for the exchange of letters from the letter bank,or the taking of letters from an opponent.  There are also a few penalty spaces that then require the making of an additional 5 letter word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
