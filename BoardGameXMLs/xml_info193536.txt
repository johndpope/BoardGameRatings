							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Superpowers: Masks of Chaos</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like everything else, crime has changed in the post-Ragnarok world, but it has not disappeared. Even though the most notorious costumed villains have all gone, a new generation of evildoer has filled in the void. A new syndicate called MISCHIEF has appeared. A multionational gang of thieves and killers, MISCHIEF has a unique ace up their sleeve: the Masks of Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Mask of Chaos grants tremendous supernatural power instantly to anyone that wears it. MISCHIEF agents uses the Masks to rob banks and assassinate crime bosses, any heist or contract that pays enough. No one knows who leads MISCHIEF or where they found the Masks they currently use. Other Masks are still hidden, buried in ancient tombs in distant corners of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement covers the history of the Masks of Chaos, MISCHIEF as a criminal organization, with stats for MISCHIEF agents, plus how to create and use the Masks in your Base Raiders game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
