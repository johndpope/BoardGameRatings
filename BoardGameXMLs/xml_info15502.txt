			<description>You are the manager of one or more pop-bands. As a manager it is your job to sell as many records as possible of the band/s you manage. You also has to arrange concerts to get money from ticket-sales and to get more profits from the record sales. To be able to sell records you must also manufacture the lp:s themselves (you can&amp;acute;t sell lp:s you don't have). There is also a billboard kind of chart that will generate money if you can reach the top 3. The game is played over 8 turns, in which you can swap bands during turn 4. In turn 8 the whole game ends with a song contest among all bands in play. The winner is the player that has the most amount of money at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
