			<description>Slings and Stones is a strategy boardgame which uses a standard checkerboard with chess and checkers pieces. It can easily be learned and played in a few short minutes, but mastery of the game will take much longer. Each and every move can have huge ramifications, and players will find it extremely difficult to plan more than a couple of rounds in advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I stumbled upon this game while skimming through some old journals I found in my grandfather&amp;amp;#65533;s attic. The rules were gleaned from Kardon's writings on the Muighar tribes, and I've tried my best to keep them authentic. However, as Kardon's description of the rules are not very clear, this version may vary slightly from that of antiquity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As most of you probably don't have access to authentic Muighar Slings and Stones pieces or boards, I've taken the liberty of finding some substitutions. This game can played using a chess board, with 4 pawns and 12 checkers. Pawns represent the slings, and checkers represent the stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.darkshadowgames.com/Epic_Registration/register.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.darkshadowgames.com/Epic_Registration/register.ht...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;(Click &amp;quot;Download SLINGS.ZIP&amp;quot; for rules and bits)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Super Duper Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
