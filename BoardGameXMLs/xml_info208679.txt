			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nestled in a deep valley, Shroudhaven has never seen sunlight in the centuries since its founding. A long-forgotten war drove refugees to the valley where a persistent thick fog had permanently settled, a side-effect of magical might employed during the war. The fog shields its residents both from the elements and from those who might seek to destroy them merely for who they are. For most of those dwelling in Shroudhaven are undead. A dark reputation&amp;mdash;like the pervasive fog&amp;mdash;hangs over the village, but those spending time with the villagers tell a different story, one in which the battle against the base urges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
