			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone always knew that something was a little bit &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; with Artie and Charlie O&amp;rsquo;Connor (also known as the O&amp;rsquo;Connor Twins). Although unquestionably bright, neither boy ever seemed to have a bit of common sense to go with their natural intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The O'Conner brothers own and operate a small chicken farm in the hinterlands of Golan County Texas. Unbeknownst to most citizens, the brothers also run an illegal cockfighting operation on the side. Unfortunately, the high-class attendees of these illegal matches have become somewhat jaded towards the&lt;br/&gt;normal brand of bloodsport, which has caused the brothers to seek out more exotic match-ups. In this case, the matches have progressed to fighting giant carnivorous mutant chickens in a great bloodletting of claws, beaks, and feathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is presented in an easy format for the GM to customize for his indvidual champaign as he sees fit. The thrust of the game is to lead the characters into searching the O&amp;rsquo;Conner homestead for clues, leading ultimately to a running battle along the back roads of Golan County with the enraged, giant, mutant chickens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
