							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halfling Harvest</name>
									
			<description>Halfling Harvest is a simple take-that set collecting came for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year our Halfling friends have a little party to celebrate the end of their harvest. The last few years have been quite extravagant and the problem is, this year they have drawn the attention of the various monsters that live in the mountains around the shire with their little shin-dig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Halflings drink and dance on into the night, these monsters arrive all at the same time and (as one would expect) they do not wish to share the spoils. The fight amongst them grew ugly fast and I fear that our friends will all be hauled off one by one in the impending battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What we need is a distraction. The sun will rise soon and the monsters will scatter, so why don't we trick them into having a contest for the Halflings. Have each group take a recipe and the first to gather all their ingredients, gets ALL the Halflings. With a little luck this will delay them long enough that the sun will come up and our little friends can make it home in one piece.&lt;br/&gt; Goal of the game/objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the persona of one of four monsters and scramble to sort through the pile of ingredients to gather what they need to complete their recipe. This is done by drawing from the pile and playing cards from your hand; laying them face up on the table in front of you. The first person to collect and play all the items in their recipe wins. Play again to delay as long as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end, the winner of the most games can decide whether they are a friend of the Halflings in disguise and was able to delay long enough to set them free, or is the real Monster and EATS THEM...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Component list&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;72 Poker sized cards, 12 Jumbo sized recipe cards, and a Rules sheet in a two piece box&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;4- player cards: Ogres, Giants, Goblins, Trolls&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;12- recipe cards and 68- component cards  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;13- Halflings  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;42- Ingredient cards:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;7 each of: Spice, Dragonberry, Mutton, Fungus, Dwarfish Eel, &amp;amp; Elf Bread &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;9- Attack Cards:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;1 Take Two Halflings, 1 Take Two Ingredients, 1 Wild Attack, 3 Take One Halfling, 3 Take One Ingredients &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;2- Wild Ingredient Cards &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;2- Defend Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.At the start of each turn, if the player has any number of Halflings, they MUST play all into their recipe by laying them face up in front of them.  &lt;br/&gt;2.Next, the player may play any one ingredient card into their recipe if desired, by placing it face up next to the Halflings in front of them. &lt;br/&gt;3. If the player has an attack card, they may then choose to play one against another player. *note: stolen items may not be put in your hand, but must be played immediately.* &lt;br/&gt;4.After the attack, the player may discard any number of cards still left in their hand into the discard pile.    &lt;br/&gt;5.The player will then draw from the component deck into their hand back up to a limit of five cards.&lt;br/&gt;6.Play continues to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Stolen items must be played directly into the recipe&lt;br/&gt;-&amp;ldquo;Wild&amp;rdquo; cards can be played in place of any ingredients, but not Halflings&lt;br/&gt;-The &amp;ldquo;Wild Attack&amp;rdquo; card can steal any card, Ingredient or Halfling, and is the only card that can steal a &amp;ldquo;Wild&amp;rdquo; card. &lt;br/&gt;-The &amp;ldquo;Take two Halfling&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Take two Ingredients&amp;rdquo; attack cards may both be taken from the same player, OR may take one from two different players.  &lt;br/&gt;-You may play more ingredients or Halflings into your recipe then are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
