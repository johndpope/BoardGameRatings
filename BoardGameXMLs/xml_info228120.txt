							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cloaks &amp; Daggers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to legends, the mankind was created by Immortals &amp;ndash; godlike figures, ruling the world, building towers hundreds of miles tall, placing barely understandable monuments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said they have created us humans and tamed the shelicans &amp;ndash; wild cat-people to serve them. Secrets of sorcery were forbidden for humans; but the Immortals still mated with their servants, giving birth to half-human offspring. These were called Bloodied and they eventually rebelled. They defeated the Immortals &amp;ndash; except one, and took over their cities, where their descendants rule now as the aristocracy. Heists, cons, stealth and assassinations. This is not the time of heroes - it is time of professional cunning thieves. In Cloak and Dagger you explore the world of humans and shelicans plundering the ruins of the Immortals, wielding clockpunk gadgets, running from mysterious Paladins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as always - it only takes a couple of pages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     System for running your very own thieves' guild (Preview of the forthcoming Revised Edition!)&lt;br/&gt;     New race of catfolk and new rules for running heists and stealth missions&lt;br/&gt;     Mystical abilities for learned magisters, devout paladins and dark Bloodied.&lt;br/&gt;     Description of Urx, city of the Last Immortal&lt;br/&gt;     MASSIVE selection of new gear, from katana (because hey, someone always wants one) to heavy repeating crossbows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
