							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Items of the Nile</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Items Inspired By Ancient Egypt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Egyptian mythology is at least as rich&amp;mdash;if not more so&amp;mdash;with legends of incredible magic items with legendary and unorthodox abilities as European legends are. Whether they received their legendary status from contact with legendary owners, or were, themselves, instrumental in allowing the legends to be born, the legends of the old kingdom are full of mysterious and exotic magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Mastery: Mythic Items of the Nile captures some of the feel of these unusual items, and provides players and GMs alike with numerous magic item special abilities that have both a strong Egyptian flavor, and take full advantage of the mythic rules presented in Mythic Adventures. Take the boat of the underworld and travel through the lower planes alongside Ra in his nightly voyages. Or don the crown of three gods and gain the blessings of Set to not only travel the desert without fear of its harsh conditions, but also take control of beasts and creatures of chaos alike. Or perhaps you would rather brandish the scepter of Apophis, which can animate to deliver deadly and venomous bites with the power of the great serpent Apep, and call serpents to aid you in combat. All these and more Egyptian relics, along with their ancient and mysterious powers, can be yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
