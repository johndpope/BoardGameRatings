			<description>&amp;quot;Welcome to my new Fantastic Galactic Imagination Explorer 3-D drawing game! Look at the dynamic NEW SECRET CITY ADVENTURES mural on your game board to become familiar with this imaginary universe. All game players are TRAVELERS and all game pieces are your PASSPORTS to these exciting places!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you travel through the game, you'll learn about THE NEW SECRET CITY. The object of the game is to keep on playing until you can draw your very own completed version of THE NEW SECRET CITY ADVENTURES mural! Are you ready! Here we go!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-from a flyer in the game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Described as &amp;quot;The Ultimate 3-D Drawing Game&amp;quot;, this is definitely a game for hyperactive youngsters. Players travel around the board collecting points and trying to learn the &amp;quot;12 Magic Words of Drawing&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various activities on the game board ask the player to draw pictures, complete short stories, and find creative explanations for objects on the board's artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
