							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ElectraWoman &amp; DynaGirl Game</name>
									
			<description>ElectraWoman &amp;amp; DynaGirl must reach the Secret Scientific Formula space in their ElectraCar and return to ElectraBase while using different combinations of Computer Power symbol cards to thwart the bad guys:  The Sorcerer, The Pharaoh, The Empress of Evil, The Spider Lady, Glitter Rock, and Ali Baba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Trouble Space depicts a different combination of Computer Power symbols needed in order to overcome it.  Computer Powers include ElectraData, ElectraForce, ElectraBeam, and a few Super Power cards (a combination of all three).  If a player does not have the right combination of Computer Powers for that particular Trouble Space, they must remain in it until the correct combination is achieved.  A card is drawn every turn, regardless of whether a player can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional cards used to obstruct opposing players include ElectraPush and ElectraComp Blocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the short-lived Sid and Marty Krofft live action children&amp;rsquo;s television series from 1976, starring Deidre Hall in her first major television role as ElectraWoman and Judy Strangis as DynaGirl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
