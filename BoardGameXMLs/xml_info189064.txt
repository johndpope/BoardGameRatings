			<description>Balthasar the bee has a birthday today. Small insects of the forest prepare some birthday present for him. But they want to make it a surprise and for this they need to reach Balthasar's house earlier than he does. &lt;br/&gt;In this cooperative roll and move game players are competing against the game - trying to reach the house earlier and not get caught by Balthasar...&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player rolls the dice (a number and a color dice) and moves the figure of the corresponding color (in case a star is rolled, any figure can be moved), Balthasar also moves one space fewer than the figure did. Players can use shortcuts while Balthasar can't. When players step on an ant space they can draw a helping token (move twice, hide behind a bush, stop Balthasar for a round, choose any color etc.). On some special spaces there are one-time-only helps like a bird's or a hedgehog's help in transporting the given figure. Some birthday postcards are also left on the track - these have to be collected before Balthasar steps on this space, otherwise Balthasar finds them and there will be no surprise (the players lose).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
