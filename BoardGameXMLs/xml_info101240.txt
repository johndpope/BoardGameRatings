			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Lords&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Lords is an arcade game released by Atari Games in 1992. It was a first-person perspective space flight combat simulator. The gameplay allowed a player to fly in any direction he chose. It is notable in that it was, in fact, a multi-player form of an arcade game. Each cabinet had two screens, each with separate controls for individual players. Two cabinets could be connected by a link cable, for a total of four screens with potentially eight players. A single cabinet would have a red ship on one side, and a green ship on the other. A second cabinet connected to the first would have a blue ship and a yellow ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
