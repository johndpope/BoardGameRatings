Features of the core mechanism:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Resolution uses a small pool of d20s, attempting to score equal or under an attribute.  &lt;br/&gt;     It's very easy for the Guide to present interesting choices and complex situations as single rolls, by setting up the dangers and opportnities each roll provides - and for players to decide not just &amp;quot;IF they do well&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;HOW they do well&amp;quot; when stakes like that are played out.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Breath&amp;quot; is used as a means of tracking encumbrance and weariness, as stunt points, and for use in social action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engine doesn't include a setting, introduction to roleplaying, or precdure for building gaming situations.
