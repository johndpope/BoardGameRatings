			<description>Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition was a special edition release of Balance of Power sometimes referred to as Balance of Power II). It was released simultaneously on five platforms in 1989 after the original achieved many sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1990 edition adds more countries, advisors to help out the player, a new &amp;quot;multi-polar&amp;quot; level that allows countries to generate events of their own (such as declaring war on other countries), and a few miscellaneous features. However, with the ending of the Cold War, interest declined, and there have been no further follow-ups or clones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Balance of Power (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been several years since the release of the original Balance of Power.
