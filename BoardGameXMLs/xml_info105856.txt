			<description>Sparkster (スパークスター?) is a 16-bit generation side scrolling platformer produced and released in 1994 by Konami for the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System, directed by Hideo Ueda (Axelay). It is a different game from the Mega Drive version, which bore the full title of Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, and has no plot continuity with the original Rocket Knight Adventures for the Mega Drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kingdom of Eginasem, a land inhabited by opossums, is under attack by the Lioness's army of yellow dog soldiers, which also kidnapped Princess Flora. Sparkster, the Rocket Knight, is out to battle this threat, rescue the princess and save his kingdom from certain destruction. His nemesis, the rival Rocket Knight Axel Gear, is aiding the invading forces, making Sparkster's task even more dangerous. The player's goal is to battle through all of the enemy warriors and robots, defeat Axel Gear and infiltrate the enemy's battleship, where the yellow dogs leader, Generalissimo Lioness, is planning to launch a warhead to destroy planet Eginasem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sparkster&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
