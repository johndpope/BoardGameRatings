			<description>The game of baseball has been played for many years in many forms.  The term &amp;quot;Lords of Baseball&amp;quot; refers to the moguls on the business end of the game.  The people who make the decisions and cut the paychecks have been made into symbols of greed and of ferocity.  In Lords of Baseball, you will take on the role of one of these owners.  You will need to build an entire organization, not just a Major League team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseball Hall-of-Famer Tommy Lasorda once said of the game, &amp;quot;No matter how good you are, you're going to lose one-third of your games.  No matter how bad you are you're going to win one-third of your games.  It's the other third that makes the difference.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lords of Baseball, your record is based on this principle.  Do you have what it takes to sustain a dynasty?  Will you build your team through trades or through a strong farm system?  With multiple paths to victory, Lords of Baseball will give you that chance.  It&amp;rsquo;s not only about winning the World Series, it&amp;rsquo;s also about doing the little things that will help you score Victory Points and at the end of 20 years make you the Lord of Baseball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of Baseball is a card driven game where players take control of a fictional organization and build it from the ground up.  They will invest money into a Farm System, Front Office, and Field Manager in an attempt to build a dynasty.  Over the course of 5 seasons, owners will use these investments to score Victory Points.  These investments will not only score VP's for owners, but also give them certain privileges during game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year is broken down into 4 phases: Spring Training, Regular Season, Postseason, and Winter Meetings.  Player decisions will go a long way towards seeing how well the team fares during the season.  If the team with the best record has enough wins to win the pennant, that team moves on to a World Series phase that allows them to earn more VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
