The game was released in Japan but was also a limited release in North America. The game was released in a PAL version in Europe and Australia under the title Tokyo Xtreme Racer (not to be confused with the Dreamcast title of the same name).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first game in the series that has been released on a platform other than the Dreamcast. Zero was to originally be released on the Dreamcast, but was then cancelled and moved to the PlayStation 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
