							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nations Assemble</name>
									
			<description>The Nations Assemble is the fifteenth game in the Pocket Battle Games series from LPS, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was on this front where Napoleon massed the bulk of his best troops to once and for all shatter the assembled might of the Allied forces opposing him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nations Assemble is a mini-game, postcard sized. Rules at the back, map front and 17 double sided counters along the sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a hex and counter game where troops are activated though a standard deck of cards: black activates French units, red Coalition. How many and all is determined by the specific card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who controls both towns of Probstheide (L4) and Wachau (O3) wins the game, otherwise it is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
