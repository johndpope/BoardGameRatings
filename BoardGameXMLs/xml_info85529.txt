			<description>Players try to form the longest possible continuous rows of balls. Winner is the one scoring most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player places one ball of his color on a 6x6 grid (36 recessed spaces on the board). The other players place their balls, turn by turn. The aim is to form continuous rows of one color, running horizontally, vertically or diagonally, until the first layer of the pyramid is complete. Once a floor is finished, the players count their points. Each layer is scored separately. Each alignment scores the number of balls that it has. Some balls scores several times if they are at the crossroads of several alignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each floor, the plateau decreases a little more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the pyramid is completed, the players count the lines that appear on the slopes of the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For two players, there are two options: Either everyone plays two colors, or players build a smaller pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
