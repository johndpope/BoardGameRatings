			<description>They say being a dragon is pretty cool. And for the most part, they're right &amp;mdash; the wings, the fire breath, and a big pile of gold to sleep on at night. At least until &amp;quot;the party&amp;quot; showed up to steal that gold for themselves. Little do they know that you've found the village and castle keep that they call home. Now you and your closest dragon friends are prepared to ransack the quiet town and take back what is rightfully yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirty Dragons is a scenario-based dexterity game for 2-5 players. The locals have stolen from the dragon &amp;mdash; you &amp;mdash; and you've had enough! Through a combination of flicking, dropping (firebombing), and taking advantage of the unique &amp;quot;flight path&amp;quot; mechanism, you work to regain your lost fortunes by targeting nobles, heroes, and buildings. The numerous scenarios, as well as the dexterity aspect, add a significant amount of replayability to the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
