			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soul Gazers are said to be &amp;quot;touched&amp;quot; by the divine, but the few show know of their existence have differing interpretations over whether the divine power at work is good or evil. However, most soul gazers believe they are doing God&amp;rsquo;s work. Usually they, or someone close to them, have suffered an injustice, prompting the soul gazer to swear true vengeance upon his enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This intervention in a moment of crises invokes a spiritual change. These instruments of &amp;quot;justice&amp;quot; receive certain powers, enabling them to overcome adversity and complete their quests. They are forever linked to their vow of justice and spend the rest of their time on earth seeking out others who deserve punishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although some soul gazers believe that punishment must be administered by their own bare hands, in fact they are not limited to unarmed attacks. As long as justice is meted out, the means is not important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
