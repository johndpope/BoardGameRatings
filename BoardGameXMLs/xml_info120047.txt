			<description>For 38 years Jim Knopf, his friend Lukas the railway man, Emma the locomotive and all their friends have taken children to Lummerland. This game leads players to three different locations, Lummerland, Kummerland and Mandala, and of course the kidnapped princess LiSi must be freed. The game is based on the concept in Michael Endes stories of cooperation and the joint efforts against adversities. The die brings luck into the game and Emma suspension, because players need to be in the company of Emma when the pass the finish line, but Emma tends to run away to another player in the last moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
