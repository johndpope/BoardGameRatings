			<description>Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 is an ice hockey game for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. The game is endorsed by hockey star, Wayne Gretzky and is the sequel to Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey. The game gained widespread criticism for several perceived shortcomings, including being unfit as a pure hockey simulator. This left many simulation enthusiasts disappointed, but many arcade fans delighted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of two basic options: Arcade and Simulation. Players have the ability to customize period length, camera angle, line changes, penalties and rink size. In addition, fatigue, fighting and puck-streak can be toggled on or off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulation Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulation mode is designed to emulate the real game of hockey. Players may play five, four, or three to a side, depending on preference. Recognition of penalties, off-sides, and icing are all optional, but two-line pass is not considered. Period length can be selected between 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcade Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Arcade mode checking, hooking, and tripping are more violent. Fights occur with greater frequency, and penalties are disregarded entirely. Additionally, players may utilize a &amp;quot;power shot&amp;quot; which lights the net on fire when a goal is scored. As a resule of these changes, the Arcade mode tends to be more exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
