			<description>A game of deduction, in which one has to try to figure out how many colored rods the other player holds in his/her hand.  the player deducting best wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays  with 3 rods, the boardgame is set to indicate the total number of rods in play at any given moment (eg. at start of the game with 3 players, the indicator is set at 9).  Then players choose to hold 0,1,2 or 3 rods in one hand and shows his/her closed fist on the table top, hiding the rods in the hand.  &lt;br/&gt;Then each players takes his/her colored indicator and places it next to the indicator equalling (guess!) the number of rods in all players' fists.  this process is done for all players, but one can not choose a number already chosen.&lt;br/&gt;The person guessing correctly can place one of his/her colored rods in the boardgames foreseen spaces, the total number of rods indicator on the boardgame is then changed to one less (rod in play).&lt;br/&gt;Should nobody have guessed the total amount of rods, the round is played over again.&lt;br/&gt;First player to get rid of all 3 of his colored rods wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS : 'Bamzaai' is deducted from the dutch verb 'Bamzaaien' and means 'deciding based on guessing a number in ones fist' (these can be beads, matches, peanuts, ...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
