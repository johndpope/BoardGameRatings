			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Can you spell SWEEP? How about WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS? America's Favorite Word Game meets New England's most celebrated sports franchise in the 2007 Boston Red Sox World Series Championship Edition of SCRABBLE. It's the same classic SCRABBLE played on a baseball diamond featuring great commemorative 2007 World Series images and stats. Baseball shaped letter tiles, some ultra fun rules and a special Red Sox World Series bonus dictionary is sure to be a grand slam!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of several Major League Baseball editions of Scrabble licensed and published by Sababa Toys. The most significant difference in this game is the way the board is laid out to resemble a baseball diamond, meaning the location of bonus squares is significantly different from classic Scrabble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
