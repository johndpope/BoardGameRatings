			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombieskin is a story roleplaying game about mutants and zombies &amp;mdash; Damned and Scabs &amp;mdash; waging an epic battle at the end of the world. As society crumbles around them, the scab horde grows stronger each day. Characters are the Damned, not so average people with genetic mutations, using their gifts to fight the zombie hordes and keep the world from ending. But each use of their mutant power brings them one step closer to becoming zombies themselves&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now. As the final days of the war tick away, the first child born without a mutation must be protected from the scabs and brought to safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
