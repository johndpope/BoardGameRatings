							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Top Careers In Science</name>
									
			<description>Top Careers In Science is first in a new series of educational games from LOOP Card Games (UK) based on the popular Top Trumps system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to obtain the entire stack of cards by calling out and comparing specific attributes from the cards... the player holding the card with the highest value of that attribute wins all of the cards in the round, and the player who eventually wins all the cards, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each custom-illustrated card displays information on a specific career in the Sciences, with number values attributed to a variety of career-related attributes.  Each card is sponsored or supported by a prominent employer in the related field, and provides website information which might help students further their interest towards a career in that field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
