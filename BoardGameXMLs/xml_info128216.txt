			<description>Bill Johnson &amp;ndash; You Wake Up To Marmageddon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the world of 'Bill Johnson - Zombie Issues Specialist' an e-book by Jon Brown, Marmageddon is a tile-placement game in which Players draw and place tiles, exploring a warehouse - trying to collect the most Marmite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles feature Marmite, Zombies and movement icons. They must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that a warehouse is formed. Having placed a tile, the Player moves his character around the warehouse (based on the movement icons on the tiles), collecting the precious Marmite and defeating the Zombies. Players must escape the warehouse with their collected Marmite before the tiles are exhausted or the warehouse is complete, else suffer the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
