			<description>Brain Chain is a trivia game with a twist.  2-3 teams compete to answer questions- when correct, the team places a &amp;quot;link&amp;quot; of its color (red, green or blue) on the corresponding space of the large 10X10 grid that makes up the playing board.  To win, a team must get six &amp;quot;links&amp;quot; in a row- horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twist is that all teams move the same yellow marker around the edges of the board through the use of movement cards and &amp;quot;brain pills&amp;quot; (bonus cards gotten by answering questions correctly).  A team can ONLY attempt to answer a trivia question on a square that is in the same row or column as the yellow marker.  However, the yellow marker itself can be used to complete a row of six for the win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four corner spaces that have special powers: remove an opponent's token, place a free token, move any token, or attempt to answer a question on any square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trivia categories are: Business, Entertainment, Geography, History, Sports, Science, Potluck, and Oddball (you must figure out what trait 3 of the 4 items listed share in common).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Trivial Pursuit with a Go-Moku win mechanic and a dash of Pueblo added in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.brainchaingames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.brainchaingames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
