			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;'Color Code is a Karuta-like card game. Someone reads the hexadecimal RGB color-code (the kind that is used in web pages), and players aim to be the first to grab the corresponding color card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Japan, there is a a 400-year-old card game for two players, named Hyakunin Isshu      (100 Poems by 100 Poets) (Wikipedia: Karuta), for example &amp;quot;Iroha Karuta&amp;quot;, or Ogoola Karuta: 50 English Classics. Two players kneel on the floor opposite each other, with cards arranged in front of them. On each card are small pieces of text from classic poetry, and typically with a small illustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate Reader chooses from a random deck and sings a phrase out loudly. The players must search to find the matching couplet on their cards and either grab or block the appropriate card. Whoever snatches the most cards wins. Play is very swift and physically as well as mentally demanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game, Color Code, is basically the same. The difference is that there are no illustrations on the played cards, but instead a single color is printed on them. The Reader doesn't read a phrase, but calls out an HTML color-code, like #FFFFFF or #FF0000. When the Reader calls a code, the players must know which color it is and make their play. So if the Reader calls &amp;quot;#FF0000&amp;quot;, players must grab the red card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;WEBページの色を指定する１６進数のRGBカラーコードを読み上げ、該当する色カードをとる速度を競う、かるた風カードゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
