			<description>This is a game full of humoristic streaks, Norwegian myths, sensations and celebrities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Norsk Galskp (=Norwegian Madness) you win if you are the first player to travel from start through to finish, but on the way you have to do funny tasks that will bring out your true inner madness.In this game you can get the ability to send your opponents into a 4 second slow motion state, draw cards to make the others pick invisible apples from the ceiling every time you shout &amp;quot;apple-picking&amp;quot;, or maybe you are the one who has to improvise a &amp;quot;Joik&amp;quot;(=Sami song) whilst the other players clap a beat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you bring Norsk Galskap to the check-out till, you're not just buying a game, but moments filled with both madness and laughter. Norsk Galskap takes but 20 seconds to learn, and will make holidays, cabin-trips and Friday nights into stories and events that might never be forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
