			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your creativity by inventing terrifying tales that frighten, bewilder and electrify your fiends&amp;hellip; ahem, friends. Your goal is to discard all of your tokens by seamlessly continuing the story using phrases on your Snippet Card. The player ahead of you just described a basement full of severed heads that moan for the return of their bodies. Now it&amp;rsquo;s your turn. You draw a card that says, &amp;ldquo;She ran screaming through the night into the woods.&amp;rdquo; How will you weave that phrase into your tale? Be quick and make sense! Take it to summer camp&amp;hellip; take it on family outings&amp;hellip; take it anywhere you want to send people scurrying into their sleeping bags! Includes 50 cards, 25 punch-out tokens and instructions. For 2 to 10 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the picture tokens (axe, noose, ghost, skull, etc.) are passed out and everyone draws a story snippet card. One person reads an intro card, and then players continue the tale incorporating the story snippets on their cards. If they mention an object on a picture token, they get to discard it. Other people can discard more than one token named during the storyteller's turn. If the storyteller doesn't make sense or takes too long, they must take a token from the discard pile. The first player to get rid of all their tokens is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
