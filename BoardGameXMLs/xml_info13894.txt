							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dictatoropoly</name>
									
			<description>Dictatoropoly is a game about control and command.&lt;br/&gt;Although it takes its name from the dreaded Mon-, this is not a variant &amp;ndash;opoly. &lt;br/&gt;This game is based on our original version- Drugopoly.&lt;br/&gt;Dictatoropoly is played over two boards &amp;ndash; the left hand (square) stash/ash board where all the cash for arms goes. And the right hand (circular) board where the players move and take control of the dictators. The aim of Dictatoropoly is to control the majority of the dictators using your counters. The money builds up on the left hand board until someone takes control of that dictator and wins the stash, cash is then paid straight to the player until they lose control. A bit like a tug of war the dictators can pass back and forth several times before someone takes the majority. In the meantime the more you control the more you make! The less you control the more you Pay! Avoiding the pitfalls of the riot police, UN court and assassination attempts players take control of the ten different dictator squares by winning possession or taking them by force through dice rolling. Players have to pay for the weapons of mass destruction they use as they move around the board, unless they own them then the money is theirs. By holding the more high profile dictators in their control, players will begin to make a tidy sum from the other players. This can be played using any unit price (1p, 5p, 10p &amp;pound;1 etc) Create your own Dictatoropoly and rule the world with no care for the consequences. Control the majority of the board and you win! Taking the cash and the glory&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
