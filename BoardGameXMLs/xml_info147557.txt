			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure you take on the role of Tarl, a mighty warrior. Legend has it that in the land of Alvania is hidden a priceless treasure - the Eye of Bain. You have heard that the sacred emerald is kept in a temple by a particularly nasty tribe of Alvanians. After arriving in their village and finding the temple you are caught trying to enter without the leave of the great god Bain. The angry villagers tie you up in a nearby hut where you are left to await your fate. This is where your quest really begins.  Can you escape and find the emerald or are you doomed to die?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Simon Wadsworth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
