There are 4 different ways to play: The Chronicler, Kit &amp;amp; Caboodle, the Gamble, or Bamboozle! It's never the same game twice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bamboozle&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, pick up a card from the deck and without telling anyone else, choose to tell a true or false story.

After the story is told, all&lt;br/&gt;the other players guess whether the story is true or false with their Voting Card. Players receive a point if they answer correctly with the storyteller. If a player is incorrect, then the storyteller receives their points. First player to reach 20 points wins the game .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     119 Topic Cards&lt;br/&gt;     6 Voting Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
