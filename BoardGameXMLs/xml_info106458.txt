			<description>GT Advance 3: Pro Concept Racing (known as Advance GTA 2 in Japan) is a racing game developed by MTO and published by THQ for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in Japan on April 26, 2002, in North America on February 6, 2003, and in Europe on May 23, 2003. It is the sequel to GT Advance 2: Rally Racing, based heavily off of the gameplay from GT Advance Championship Racing, and the third game in the GT Advance series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game reportedly mixes the first two games of the series&amp;mdash;it has the city environments and paved streets of the first game, but the physics engine is slippery, much like the second, changing the strategy drastically from GT Advance Championship Racing. There are 97 cars available, and all are customizabal. Also added to the game is the &amp;quot;Drift Combo&amp;quot; mode, in which the player needs to drift a certain number of times within a set time limit to unlock a new car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;GT Advance 3: Pro Concept Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
