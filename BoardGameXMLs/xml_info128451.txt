			<description>user summary by zefquaavius&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly through space, exploring star systems, discovering valuable (or worthless) items, facing belligerent beings, and return home with more valuable loot than your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the designers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Space Explorers is a game of exploration and discoveries, not one of armies and conquering. Fleets are moved from system to system on a star map. New events occur, and new items and allies are found, along the way. Conflict between competitive aliens is likely, and combat between starship fleets is almost certain. All such interaction is handled by brisk card play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Space Explorers is based on the award winning indie computer games, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space and features the same disgusting aliens, peculiar artifacts, exotic starships and artwork by Bill &amp;quot;Phosphorous&amp;quot; Sears. Infinite Space Explorers is designed to set up and play easily and quickly, yet provide the essence of a star spanning galactic adventure. Discoveries are randomized so each game is different. -We think variety is the spice (and the spice must flow) and that replayability = value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that because of the particular board configuration used, Infinite Space Explorers is played as either a two player game or as a four player game. Rules for solo and three player games are not included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, Infinite Space Explorers was made to be easily modified. We encourage you to try out your own ideas for new starships, weapons, artifacts, alien races, rules -anything! That's why, for starters, three custom cards are included with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
