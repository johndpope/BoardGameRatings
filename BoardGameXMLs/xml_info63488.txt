			<description>Game consist of a single sheet a box, rules and 5 counters two of one color and 3 of another color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by 2 players, one player taking two old women and the other taking 3 little pigs. The women are placed in starting spaces at the top of the board and the pigs begin at the bottom of the board. The pigs are taken when an old woman can jump over a pig. There must be a vacant space on the other side to land on. The pigs never can take a women by jumping over them but if a pig can be brought to the womens starting space number 2 a pig that has been captured is returned to the board. The women win by getting two of the pigs before they are able to reach the yard at the top of the board. There are stones on the board where  no movement is allowed through. Play alternates with the women moving 1 piece and then the pigs moving one piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
