							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">USSR Simulator</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Control the USSR by adding taxes and making people work to gain more money and Communism to the Union.&lt;br/&gt;The more Communism you gain the more things you unlock - from making matches, to Statues of Lenin - and beyond to glorious Soviet technology!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money are gain per click (work based on Production) or per second (tax), but can also be gained by listening to the national anthem or playing in the Sportlotto.&lt;br/&gt;When you idle the game (closed) the game will still earn you taxes, but Corruption will also grow while you look away from the Party Funds! This can be fought by Repression; which also will transfer your Corruption into Communism when used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
