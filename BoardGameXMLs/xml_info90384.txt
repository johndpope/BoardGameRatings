							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cloud Giant&#039;s Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At what first appeared as a storm turned out to be something wholly unnatural. The bank of dark clouds followed no discernable weather pattern, coming to a halt above the township with little heed to the winds around them. But more, people could discern a shape in the midst of the clouds, a tower. This tower of stone seemed to them the center of the maelstrom and many wondered what it could mean, but others still wondered at what treasures it could hold. Some flee in panic, others still gather their arms for an adventure is in the offing . . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cloud Giant&amp;rsquo;s Tower, designed for 3-5 characters with a challenge level of 5, and should be playable in one session. It involves a simple tower located high in the sky above a large city of the Castle Keeper&amp;rsquo;s choosing. The tower can be positioned anywhere and it will be necessary for the player characters to have some means of flight to get to the tower. There is a constant large gray cloud under the tower, but the characters have no way to tell that the top of the cloud responds like land with a surface they can walk on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
