							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mug Shots</name>
									
			<description>If you witnessed a crime ... could you identify the criminal?  Would you be able to remember his face?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Mug Shot&amp;quot; file contains many different eyes, noses, mouths, etc. printed on transparent film.  The idea is to reconstruct the criminals face, testing your memory and your ability to observe facial details.  Included are 30 different Mug Shots along with 54 assorted styles of facial features that you mix and match to try and recreate the Mug Shot you saw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can either be played with two people or in a party atmosphere by splitting into two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
