It was like I said, we was tendin&amp;rsquo; to our sheep just like any other day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We got that Leroy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dammit let the man tell his story will you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We was tendin&amp;rsquo; to out sheep&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;WE GOT THAT PART LE-&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lester I will shoot you where you stand if you don&amp;rsquo;t let the man talk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry Sheriff. Go on Leroy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sheep started acting funny and then there was a huge shadow over top a&amp;rsquo; us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A shadow?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A big shadow, big enough to black out the sun right where we stood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What happened next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, me and Jack look up and there was the Devil. Long neck, big scaly body, forked tongue and wings stretched out the size o my ranch. Yes sir, it was the Devil. I was just standing there lookin&amp;rsquo; up an&amp;rsquo; a prayin&amp;rsquo; like the good Padre taught us. Jack, he hurried up and grabbed hims gun and started firin&amp;rsquo; away at that thing. I swear ta God that the Devil just done swooped by us and left us with the sun just a blindin&amp;rsquo; us. It musta turned around in the air cause it came back round and spit fire. OH GOD, A DAMNABLE STREAM OF UNHOLY FIRE AND BURNT JACK RIGHT WHERE HE STOOD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How The West Was Hacked takes a what if look at the Wild West of cowboys and cattle rustlers and mixes it up with harpies and hobgoblins in a game based on the Black Hack rule set by David Black. Boot Hill with balrogs. The Black Hack (TBH) is a traditional tabletop roleplaying game, played with paper, pencils and dice - it uses that Original 1970s Fantasy Roleplaying Game as a base. But it adds and takes away elements to make it a distinct streamlined flavor of the original roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes an introductory adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
