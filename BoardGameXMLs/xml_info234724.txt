			<description>&lt;b&gt;The Nazis are winning and we need Drastic Measures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAID: World War II is an action-packed four player cooperative shooter set during a time when the Nazi war machine was still going strong. During the worldwide fight against evil, four prisoners of war are freed from a gestapo jail to take down Hitler and his Third Reich once and for all - and get rich while doing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose from four different classes with their own highly developed skill tree and War Cry - a powerful ability that can be unleashed to buff yourself or the entire team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
