			<description>The game of Sovrano is a straight-forward and easy to learn game of strategy and cunning.  However, beneath the relative simplicity lies a depth of complexity that will keep the game interesting and re-playable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assemble your guards and prepare to lead your emperor to the throne and absolute power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sovrano is a game for two players that typically lasts between 15 to 30 minutes.  Each player has 11 pieces (1 Emperor, 8 Guards, 2 Archers).  The center space of the board is the Throne, while on opposite ends of the center row lie the Tower-spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to be the player who scores the most points by capturing the Tower-spaces (1 point granted per space held at the start of each turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second objective of Sovrano is to be the first player to move their Emperor onto the center space (the Throne-space) and hold it until the start of his or her next turn.  This grants that player 3 points and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
