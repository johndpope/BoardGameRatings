It consists of a bag, a sand timer, a colour die and 4 cards with seven different figures/shapes, which also differ between the player cards. The shapes fit into holes in the cards and have different shapes and colours, e.g. the helicopter, the woman, the man, the moon... &lt;br/&gt;Its a collection of games die rolling, grabbing the shape blind from the bag etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to be the first player having a completed board - by having rolled all colours and thus having gotten all missing objects containing these colours, or by grabbing the right items blind from the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
