							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spoon</name>
									
			<description>Card game that you need to add real spoons to the table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal 6 cards face down to each player. Put the deck face down in front of the dealer. In the centre of the table place some spoons (one less than there are players). The dealer takes a card from the drawing pile. He discards one card from his hand by placing it face down on the table to his left. The next player picks up the discard for his hand and places a discard on the table to his left, etc. The dealer always draws from the drawing pile when it's his turn. The last discard from each round is added to the discard pile, which is reshuffled and used when the drawing pile is gone. When any player completes a set (4 of a kind), he grabs a spoon. All other players then grab for a spoon too. The player who fails to get a spoon is out of the game. One spoon is removed from the table and play resumes. When there are only 2 players left, the one who grabs the last spoon is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the same game as Spoons although there are similarities. This is much faster to play to a finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
