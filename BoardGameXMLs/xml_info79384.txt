							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tony Hawk&#039;s Pro Skater 2</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, often abbreviated as THPS2, is the second game in the Tony Hawk's series. It was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision in 2000. It was first released for the PlayStation, with subsequent ports to the Nintendo 64 (by Edge of Reality), Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance (by Vicarious Visions), Mac OS, and the Windows PC (By Gray Matter Interactive). It was also released for the Game Boy Color, and was better received than the first installment on that machine. In spite of that, it still bore little resemblance to the other versions of the game. The Game Boy Advance  version, however, was highly applauded for translating the style and sense of the game accurately into an isometric (pseudo-3D or 2.5D) game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Tony Hawk%27s Pro Skater 2 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
