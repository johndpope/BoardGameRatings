							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Divine Right (2002)</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would you sacrifice to save another?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divine Right began as a game about exorcism, where the Characters saved peoples' souls at the cost of their own well-being. As design continued it became clear that my notes explored the Premise given above, rather than push a game of exorcism. A modern setting with slight paranormal activity is the closest thing to a default setting, but I kept in mind possibilities ranging from Mike Mignola's Hellboy comic to stories you might hear on the evening news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game allows a large amount of freedom for both Players and the GM. Before play, the group should sit down and discuss what level of controls the Players and GM are comfortable with. At one extreme, the Players may only narrate within strict specifics of their roll results. At the other, a GM may not even be necessary. In any case, the rules as written are how the game is meant to be played. If your group alters the rules it is either no longer Divine Right, or an improvement to the game. In either case, I encourage you to let me know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
