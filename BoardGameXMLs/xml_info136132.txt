			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forge is a fantasy themed MMO shooter.  The distinguishing feature of Forge is the developer's quest to eliminate grind from the game entirely.  As such, their goal is to have a new character be just as powerful as one who has played for years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of the game involves a vague Devourer who has devoured all the Gods.  The Gods get a bunch of people (That's you) to fight for them on a world called Forge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
