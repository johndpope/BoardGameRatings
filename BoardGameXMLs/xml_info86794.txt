			<description>Peculiar statistical replay game on a minor sport game, handball, dedicated to all the editions of this sport in the olympic games.&lt;br/&gt;Basic system is really simple, as each team is rated for goal made and allowed, plus a killer instinct capacity (the ability to win point to point games) and a random modifier based on historical performance in the competition. Opposing teams compares values, then a die is rolled for each team to determine the final score (after a few possible modifications).&lt;br/&gt;Very simple and very fast to replay an entire tournament in a very short time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
