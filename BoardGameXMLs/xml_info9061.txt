							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Devil&#039;s Triangle</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Triangles du Diable</name>
									
			<description>Players alternately place and move triangles around a board. Each player's 9 triangles have a number (1-9) on the back. Neither player knows which numbers are where. Each player designates one number as his Devil's Triangle (without knowing where the triangle is on the board). Triangles are captured by being surrounded on 3 sides by enemy triangles or the board edge. The first player to capture 3 opposing triangles or to have his Devil's Triangle captured by his opponent wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
