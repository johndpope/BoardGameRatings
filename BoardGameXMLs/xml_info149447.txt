			<description>Dictator of the Sea is about a battle between navy and pirate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perform one of the three actions below. As soon as the action is done, your opponent begins the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;1. Select one face down Board tile on the board and flip it face up.&lt;br/&gt;2. If a tile from your side (Navy or Pirate), the Whale tile, or the Shark tile is face up on the board, activate one of these units.&lt;br/&gt;3. Spend Treasure to bribe an opponent's unit. Replace one of your opponent's units with your own unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when&lt;br/&gt;1. If one side no longer has any units on the board&lt;br/&gt;-&amp;gt; The player who still has units on the board wins. This player wins even if all his or her units are face down.&lt;br/&gt;2. If 10 turns pass after all tiles are revealed&lt;br/&gt;-&amp;gt; Add all the ranks of captured enemy tiles and the ranks of any of your remaining units on the board to determine your score. The player with the highest score wins. Equal scores means a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
