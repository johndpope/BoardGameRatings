			<description>This is the first game in the Magical Legend series of games. The game is set in a mythical Chinese world like that of the Chinese classic &amp;quot;Investiture of the Gods&amp;quot;. The game world is further fleshed out in other Magical Legend comics and novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mode 1 (Deities vs Demons): &lt;br/&gt;Gameplay-wise this is similar to Bang. There are 3 roles (Deity, Demons, Spirits). The Deity wins if he kills all Demons and non-subjugated Spirits. The Demons win if they kill the Deity. The Spirits win if they kill the Deity and 1 Demon or 1 Spirit who has killed a Demon. The Deity has 3 power up cards which he can offer as a reward to subjugate(ie. ally) a Spirit. Spirits can renege on the alliance/subjugation but will suffer penalties for doing so. The game replaces the suits (Heart, Spades, etc) of Bang with a 5-element system (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) and characters, abilities and card actions vary depending on the elements involved. There is no concept of Distance and no Missed cards. Attacks succeed or are countered based on the elements. Card actions often require Magic points to power them. Otherwise the gameplay is quite similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mode 2 (Faction Battles):&lt;br/&gt;This mode can only be played with an even number of players (4-10). Players split into 2 camps and a representative from each camp draw 1 of 5 faction cards to see what faction they are. Factions have specific powers which can be triggered to allow cooperation between members of the faction. There are no hidden roles in this mode and all players of a faction win if the other faction is eliminated. Other aspects of gameplay (ie. drawing, attacking, etc) are similar to game mode 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
