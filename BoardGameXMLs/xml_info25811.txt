			<description>Two games in one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEEDING FRENZY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eat your way to the top in this fast, fun, frenzied game!  When a card is played, your goal is to eat it using animal cards in your hand.  But you better hurry because the frenzy is on and other players are hungry too!  The one who eats the most cards becomes the feeding frenzy champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOOD CHAIN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the game is to finish the chain!  Using the animal cards in your hand, your goal is to knock other players out of the game by filling in their food chains - from spider (#1) to man (#10).  The last player left becomes the king of the food chain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
