			<description>extrapolated from user review:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player to evolve along the 6 stages of evolution into man. You start as a lungfish. Over the course of a turn, you roll a die to determine if you get to mutate, and then move to run away from predators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutation is easier if you are in a warm climate. And if you are lucky enough to get a mutation card, you will either evolve, or pick up some mutation which can affect your movement or mutation abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of your turn, you flip up a card which lets you move and introduce certain type of new predators, evolve predators, and move continents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, the continents drift around the board, offering you chances to break a land bridge to strand your opponents on a plate along with a few hungry dinosaurs. Or drift yourself southward to bask and mutate in the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only other twist is that predators can only eat during certain player evolutionary stages. So trying not to mutate can be a very good idea at certain stages of the game. Being eaten costs you an evolutionary stage-so picking on the leader can help keep the game even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
