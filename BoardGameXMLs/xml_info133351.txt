			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card game about themed on political intrigue. In hand, players have cards representing individuals with a rank from 1 to 6. Players play cards before them to form groups; these must be of rising ranks. These groups are then used to fight to win the 8&amp;ndash;10 cards representing political power. Each turn, players choose a political role that will influence this battle, and each player also has a hidden role that he should try to keep secret throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when all policital influence cards have been taken, at which point the player with most such cards, added to that the played cards of his hidden colour, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
