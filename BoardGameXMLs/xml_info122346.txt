			<description>In MEGAcquire, a re-envisioning of Sid Sackson's classic game Acquire, players create and grow companies by playing tiles from their hand on the hexagonal grid on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEGAcquire is an exciting journey of strategy and luck, for three to six players, through the corporate world. Live in the world of fun and fortune as you maneuver to outwit your opponents. Build and merge companies while shrewdly buying, trading, and selling stocks to become the wealthiest player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds companies by adding tiles as they increase wealth by purchasing stocks in these companies. Cash flow is obtained by selling majority and minority shares through mergers. It is not always prudent to have the most stock in the biggest company, if you can build and sell enough smaller companies to generate a large income. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of the corporate world, but you will always need the &amp;ldquo;luck of the draw&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEGAcquire will appeal to players of any age, who like the feeling of power that is acquired through achievement. It is recommended for ages 12 and up, but cannot be limited because of the early possession of business savvy that can be found in younger players. Average playing time is from 2-3 hours, but shorter time limits can be set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEGAcquire includes 182 tiles and 350 stock certifications in 14 colors (seven hotel chains and seven companies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
