			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old West:  After the Civil War ends, a group of former soldiers quickly finds themselves at the end of their means. Their meager pay-out from the war doesn't last long, and herding cattle and sheering sheep is seasonal work. Eventually, then, these former soldiers begin to supplement their incomes with various acts of outlawry, using the skills they learned during the war. It isn't long after that before they become a gang of Outlaws in truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead End Gulch: Due to a little &amp;quot;misunderstanding,&amp;quot; a couple of the Outlaws have ended up thrown in jail and sentenced to hang for crimes that they didn't commit. 'Course they got a number of crimes that they did commit which would see them hanged, too, if'n those around these parts knew about 'em. But that's all beside the point to the Outlaws' way of thinking, and the injustice of this here trial and hanging sore outrages the Outlaws' sense of Justice. And they're not about to let the Law get away with such shenanigans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
