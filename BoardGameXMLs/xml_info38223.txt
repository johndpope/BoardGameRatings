							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mjollnir</name>
									
			<description>The game of Mjollnir is named after the Norse God Thor's&lt;br/&gt;mighty hammer which he could throw at an enemy and it&lt;br/&gt;would always return to his hand after smashing his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;Variations of these bluffing dice games were played all over&lt;br/&gt;Scandinavia and were a fun way to pass the time around the&lt;br/&gt;fire pit of a Viking long house during the long winter nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mjollnir is a pretty easy game to learn and comes with&lt;br/&gt;a game rules parchment. Besides playing Mjollnir, you can&lt;br/&gt;use the dice and &amp;quot;shaker&amp;quot; box to play many other popular&lt;br/&gt;dice games because each die is marked from 1 to 6 but with&lt;br/&gt;our unique symbols such as Odin One-Eye or Freya's Tears&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Mjollnir Game comes with a pair of Custom Dice&lt;br/&gt;a dozen glass &amp;quot;gems&amp;quot; which are enough to start off four players&lt;br/&gt;a complete &amp;quot;Rules&amp;quot; parchment and an attractively decorated&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Shaker&amp;quot; box that doubles as a storage container for your&lt;br/&gt;dice and gems. The box is decorated using Pyrography or&lt;br/&gt;wood burning which was a common technique in the&lt;br/&gt;age of the Vikings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
