			<description>The Great City of Andalanshar is once again leaderless. In-fighting amongst the members of the Council of Andals has led to a breakdown in the running of the city, and the guilds are once again flexing their muscles, trying to gain power however they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeing an opportunity to regain the power they once lost, the great families are rallying support to try and win control of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents the head of one of the great families, travelling around the city to try and influence the populace, whilst bribing the guilds in order to gain their support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to gain influence and gold, whilst travelling around the city and using their gold to bribe the guilds. The guilds allow them to change the dice they've rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
