							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythweaver Fantasy Roleplaying Game, Revised Edition</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythweaver was written with one simple goal: to provide a fast, flexible game system adaptable to any fantasy setting with a minimum of rules, charts and graphs but with a maximum of possibility for expansion and exploration. I think this game is a tremendous success, and I hope that you do, too. This game is the result of three years of playtesting and is actually the fifth working version of a game previously known as Mythic Ages. I hope that you have half as much fun playing as we I did writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you waiting for? Grab a pair of 6-sided dice and a pencil - and dive in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
