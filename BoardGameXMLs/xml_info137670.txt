			<description>This game for 2-4 players is superficially similar to GO, with players taking turns laying stones on a 11 x 11, 16 x 16 or 19&amp;times;19 grid of intersections. However, unlike Go where placed pieces are static or captured, Mynd (the Welsh word for go) shows its diversity using a push/pull mechanic that allows lines of pieces to be moved along lines (horizontally or vertically), according to a simple tug-of-war mechanic. Therefore, this is more an ongoing battle that the traditional game, with the status of claimed territory being under constant attack as walled off sections of the board are pressured by force of numbers. The game ends when there is no legal move left, the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an additional game reusing the Go aesthetic, utilising the same general-purpose grid and colored stones, it is hoped this will join the variety of other abstract strategy games that can be played with a Go set, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
