			<description>A race game of motorbike that you have to ride your team to victory obtaining more points with your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a team of three motorbikes (Yellow, purple, red and green).&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to move all your team to gain the highest score by summing the result of the arrival of the 3 motorbikes.&lt;br/&gt;The movement of each motorbike is done by a wheel with an arrow in the middle, at the turn player spins the arrow on the wheel, that will indicate how many squares move the 3 motorbikes.&lt;br/&gt;The tactic is dodging oil spills, and take the wake of the bike in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
