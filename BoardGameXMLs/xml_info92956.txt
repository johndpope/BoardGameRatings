			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Nocturne is a gameworld unto itself, and a setting that can be layered on top of virtually any other campaign, modern or otherwise. There is the real world, Materia, the world beyond life, Apocrypha, and the world between, Nocturne. Nocturne can only be reached through the unconscious, and it is a world with it own unique rules, unwritten laws, heroes and villains. And you cannot always tell the difference between the two. For the Awakening is coming, when the three worlds will merge. Some feel it will be the beginning of a new era and seek to bring it about (or exploit it), and others fear that it will be the end of everything and strive to prevent it. Not even the gods know exactly what will happen, but that doesn't prevent them from sending agents and avatars from the Apocrypha to Nocturne to further their subtle plans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
