							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Air Combat: PBY-5 Catalina</name>
									
			<description>Table Air Combat is a fast, simple air combat game that can be played on any flat surface.  All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a flight of four fighters, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &amp;ldquo;performance rulers&amp;rdquo; that represent the aircraft&amp;rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PBY-5 Catalina was a flying boat designed for maritime patrol and rescue.  Although slow, it had a long range and the ability to operate from unimproved pacific islands. When armed with bombs, depths charges,and torpedoes, it was effective at anti-submarine and anti-shipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
