							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lightning Class Cruisers</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Lightning Class Cruisers is a detailed treatment of the background, specifications, capabilities, and interior layout of the 60,000 ton Azhanti High Lightning class interstellar cruisers for the Traveller RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this supplement was distributed as part of the Azhanti High Lightning board game, it was information for the Traveller RPG. It was never sold separately by GDW but is frequently found separated from its parent game in collections and often can be found sold independently of the original game by those that sell used games. It is not necessary to play the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
