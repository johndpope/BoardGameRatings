			<description>The party game What Would Who? Do? takes the familiar &amp;quot;What what Jesus do?&amp;quot; question and opens it up to every person ever, whether fictional or real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of large Who? cards and small Duh cards; players need to supply a 20-sided die and 6-sided die for each player. On a turn, the active player flips a Who? card to reveal a sentence with a blank subject &amp;ndash; e.g., &amp;quot;What would _______ do if an asteroid were spotted on a collision course with Earth?&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; and six choices. The player chooses any person &amp;ndash; alive or dead, real or make-believe, famous or known only to players &amp;ndash; and inserts that name in the sentence. (If the active player takes too long or can't think of anyone known to all, he draws a Duh card, and uses the person on that card in the sentence.) Each player then uses his 6-sided die to secretly indicate a choice, with all of the non-active players trying to think how the active player will answer the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then reveal their answers. If no one matches the active player, no one scores points; if everyone matches, then everyone but the active player scores 2 points; if some number in between match, the correct guessers score 2 points while the active player scores 1 point for each correct guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use their 20-sided die to track their score, and the first player to reach 20 points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
