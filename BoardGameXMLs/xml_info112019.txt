							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magnus Thrax, Sculptor of War</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All men are stone. The strong become statues of the gods&amp;mdash;the weak are ground into sand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnus Thrax sculpts warriors. Once a celebrated gladiator, Thrax has stepped back from center stage and now uses his ages of bloody experience to shape the next generation of fighters who will win glory&amp;mdash;or die&amp;mdash;on the sands of the arena. But even though he trains others for the main event, Thrax's iron fist can still grind bones to dust&amp;mdash;and he's looking for an excuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on a stone cold skull-crusher found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign&amp;mdash;but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon. Each entry features ingenious stat-blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC's most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Magnus Thrax, an earth-shaking ex-gladiator guaranteed to rock your world.&lt;br/&gt;    CR 20 Male dreadnaught earth-infused ogre fighter (trick fighter) 12&lt;br/&gt;    CR 14 Male dreadnaught earth-infused orge fighter (trick fighter) 7&lt;br/&gt;    CR 7 Male earth-infused ogre fighter (trick fighter) 3&lt;br/&gt;    Dreadnaught and Element-Infused creature templates, to make a rock that none can lift&lt;br/&gt;    New fighter archetype - the trick fighter - focusing on combat maneuvers&lt;br/&gt;    New magic items like the showman's sandals - because you shouldn't just win, you should make it look good&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
