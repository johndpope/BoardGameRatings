							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into the Veil</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Veranthea Codex supplement of dark deeds, nautical adventure, and fell piracy for use with the Pathfinder RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Veil has always been a cauldron of conflict, deception, and intrigue, there has never been a more exciting time to sail the tesseract seas. The tension between forces is mounting again after years of silent machinations and subterfuge&amp;mdash;H&amp;rsquo;gal grows impatient, for he is also a prisoner here, and over the centuries he has gained insight into the location of The Great Crawth. The grand lich sits on the verge of bringing a new army to its desert sanctuary but the intelligent forge now senses that there are those within the Veil that can awaken it, returning it to its fullest potential so that it might effect its escape from a prison that has long been considered unescapable. Palpable tension lurks under the surface of the Veil sending ripples through all corners of its society. Talk of a second war between The Conglomerate and Ostershain has recently been on the tongues of people in all the tesseract seas&amp;rsquo; cities and the pirates have been more active as well, supposedly led from the deep jungles of Caramballa by an unseen mastermind. Whether in alliance with the undead minions of the ancient lich or as unwitting components in a vast machine, heroes who enter the Veil will decide its very fate by their actions and alliances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
