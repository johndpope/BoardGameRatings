							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tri-Chinese Checkers</name>
									
			<description>A 3-dimensional variant on Chinese Chess.  The board consists of 3 tiers.  All player pieces begin on the bottom tier, but the only way out is up to the middle tier.  The middle tier is an open grid, and connects to both the top and bottom tiers.  The top tier is a copy of the bottom tier, but reversed -- it contains the destinations that the players are racing to reach.  Each player tried to be the first one to get all 10 of his pieces from his starting zone on the bottom tier to his destination zone on the top tier, making standard Chinese chess moves and hops (but extended to 3d).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supports 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
