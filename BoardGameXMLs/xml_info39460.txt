							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pixie Pairs Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; variant was distributed exclusively at Best Buy stores as a promotional item with the purchase of Disney's &amp;quot;Tinker Bell&amp;quot; DVD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main differences between this game and traditional &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; are the number of cards in the deck and the goal of collecting pairs instead of books of 4 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 36 cards in the game are made up of 4 cards each of 9 of the Disney Fairies that appear in the Tinker Bell movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a 2-player game each player is dealt 7 cards to start with. If there are 3 or 4 players, each player is dealt 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, another player is asked for one of the fairies in the asking player's hand. If the asked player has that fairy, one card of that fairy is given to the asking player, who then puts the pair in front of them and continues their turn by asking another player for another fairy. If the asking player does not get a fairy from an opponent they draw from the deck. If they get the fairy they had asked for, they place the pair in front of them and continue their turn. If not, then the turn passes to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted and at least one player is out of cards. Whoever has the most pairs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
