			<description>Streets and Alleys is a solitaire card game using a traditional deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to build up four foundations in suit from ace to king. The tableau is laid out in four columns of seven and four columns of six cards. The top card of each column is available to play. The card may be moved to the foundation if fits or to build a tableau pile down regardless of suit. Empty tableaus can be filled with any card. Cards may be only moved one at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
