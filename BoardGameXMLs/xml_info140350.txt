							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Garden of al-Astorion (OGL 3.5)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gentle Reader!&lt;br/&gt;The Garden of al-Astorion is the translation of an adventure module I originally designed in a single evening for a Hungarian game convention and later revised and expanded for self publication on a whim. To this date, it remains the only adventure to be released in the country under the d20 license &amp;ndash; although it was successful as an amateur effort, others were reluctant to follow in its steps, and I lacked the time to do a follow-up.&lt;br/&gt;Although more than three years have passed since initial inception and almost three since first publication, I nevertheless decided to do a translation for the benefit of interested gamers who didn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to read the original. Although I would do some things differently if I designed the module today (hopefully better, too), I decided to preserve the original as well as a translation could allow instead. I believe it can and it should stand on its own merits. Let it be judged with this consideration &amp;ndash; but let it be Judged with a critical eye towards its failings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
