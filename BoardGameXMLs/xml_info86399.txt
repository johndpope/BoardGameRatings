							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kaiser&#039;s Bazaar - Book C</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that you've had a fun diversion through the Wizard's Market, time to get back to business! This is a very utilitarian list of goods; a look at the Timber Market, the Ceramics Trade and the wealthy Metals Brokerage. The Kaiser's Bazaar - Book A set the standards, and The Kaiser's Bazaar - Book B met the challenge. This book in no exception, providing even more for your growing Bazaar: The items and services listed are mostly of interest to Craftsmen and Merchants, and are most helpful for Game-Masters. If you still haven't tried the Kaiser's Bazaar sourcebooks, you are really missing out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, you can use the metals, woods, and ceramics lists in Book C to modify goods from The Kaiser's Bazaar - Book A and The Kaiser's Bazaar - Book B in addition to the items in Book C, and of course, future volumes. Now you know how much to charge for a Willow Fishing Pole and a Bronze Fish Hook down at the bait-shop, or the value of a Silver Hair-Brush and a Rosewood Violin found in an over-turned chest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
