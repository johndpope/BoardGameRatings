			<description>Board game Dinosaurusi is a simple game for 2 to 4 players. Each player has one figurine. The aim is to get to the finish as soon as possible. Paths which are moving figurines on are mutually intersect. In addition to the path are arranged markers (food) that players collect. Longer paths have more markers. The player whose figurine first reaches the finish receives 6 points, second 4 and third place 2 points. It is also important to collect as many markers. Each marker delivers one point. The winner is the player who at the end of the game has the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
