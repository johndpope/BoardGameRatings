							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paxland: The Kingdom of Peace</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Peace borders more civilized states than any other nation. It is an ancient kingdom with a long hereditary line of kings. It and the Empire are the richest and most powerful regions in the known world. Almost anything can be obtained here for a price. Sparkling and dangerous cities rise up in decadence astir with political intrigue. There are major humanoid settlements and border clashes are frequent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Peace consists of 14 duchies. Three of the duchies are traditional posts in the line of succession, so the three dukes are the king's closest blood relations. Four others are more distantly related. By law, the Duchy of Singorny, in which the capitol, also Singorny is located, cannot be held by a relative of the king. All other duchies were established based on service to the king. The ruling dynasty has changed hands four times in the kingdom's long history, once as a natural result of the demise of the king's line and thrice usurped. The Duke of Singorny has established a new line in three of these instances, the first legitimately. That is the reasoning behind the law for Singorny not to be a blood relation. However, some argue, especially the king's family for the repeal of this law based on the two usurpations by Singorny. The current king is 11th in his line and the 93rd monarch to sit on the Paxland throne. He has one minor daughter who can accede to the throne only if there are no sons or brothers. The king has one brother who is the First Duke. He also has an older sister who is the Third Duchess. The Second Duchy is currently held by a viceroy who is the king's nephew by his sister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
