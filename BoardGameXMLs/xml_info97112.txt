							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armored Knights: Operation Gazelle</name>
									
			<description>Armored Knights, starts with Operation Gazelle, the battle of the Israeli offensive to cross the Suez Canal and invade Africa and cut off the Egyptian Army elements that were on the east side of the canal. This series focus is on combat at the battalion level on a scale that makes representing large battles real fun. It will also have its own innovative and unique way to handle the combat mutlipliers for engineers, anti-tank, intelligence, and recon elements. The players will find this does not always work the way they want and the support troops sometimes fail to do the mission they are assigned to do. They might even have a detrimental effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grognard Simulations continues to think of new ways to make the players do some critical thinking before committing troops to take positions and engage in combat.  Providing the support that will give them the edge (rolling well also helps) is the key to maximizing combat strengths for each side.  The Israeli's are outnumbered somewhat, but the Egyptians have some serious restrictions given they did not want to beleive the threat was credible.  This gave the Israeli's time to eliminate the Egyptian air defenses and get their superior air power into the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
