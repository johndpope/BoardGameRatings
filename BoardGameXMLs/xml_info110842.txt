			<description>The children carry their feeding bags through the zoo and look forward to meeting another animal. The feed tiles are laid out face down, the animals line up on the track. In his turn a player turns up a tile. If it is the favourite food of the animal first in line he can take the tile, otherwise he turns it down again. Then he places another animal in front of the line. When the forth food for any animal has been found and taken, this animal is taken off the board. When the third animal is taken off the game ends and the player with the most tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
