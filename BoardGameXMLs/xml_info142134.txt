Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New game from the developer of LA Noire. It focuses on the International Police Force in 1930s Shanghai, described by the developer as &amp;quot;the most corrupt and decadent city on the planet, where anything can be had or done for the right price.&amp;quot; Set in the year of 1936, the game centers around the corrupt city of Shanghai in the hands of Western powers, filled with mob crime and political troubles. The Kuomintang ruthlessly puts down labor movements in an effort to suppress communism, whilst the International Police Force attempt to keep the peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2012, the game was targeting a 2015 release, but was confirmed cancelled in 2016, having not had a status update since 2013. In June 2016, an interview with Whore of the Orient producer Derek Proud revealed that the game was effectively dead. Proud revealed that the team fought to &amp;quot;the bitter end,&amp;quot; but they were unable to save the game and ultimately it was &amp;quot;wrapped-up&amp;quot; by parent company KMM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
