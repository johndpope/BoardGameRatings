			<description>Memory game played with dice.&lt;br/&gt;Studied to be able to help the Alzheimer patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content :&lt;br/&gt;1 game board -9 coloured cubes -2 dice -54 coloured pegs (6 of each colour).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game :&lt;br/&gt;Memorize the placement of nine coloured cubes, and after turning them face down, retrieve them. The winner is the first to get 6 coloured pegs in his scoring row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning of the game :&lt;br/&gt;Place the nine cubes colour side up. You have one minutes to memorize each one&amp;rsquo;s location before turning them face down. The youngest player starts by rolling both dice, then play continue clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules of play :&lt;br/&gt;The white die indicates the colour the player has to find, if it shows a star the player may choose the colour to find. He then turn over one of the cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-If it is the right colour, the player puts one peg of the same colour in his scoring row, he then put back the cube but switching its location with another cube and without looking at the colour of the other cube. Then he gives the dice to the player to his left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-If its not the right colour, he simply put the cube back in place and gives the dices to the player to his left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continue until one plyer has filled the six spaces in his score row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The black die :&lt;br/&gt;If ithe black die shows a star and the white die shows a colour, all players may look for the corresponding cube. The fastest player to put his finger on a cube then turn it face up, if it is the right colour, he wins a coloured peg and play continues as normal. If it is not the right colour he loses a peg of that colour if he has one in his score raw, and play resumes as normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player wins a peg of a colour that is no longer available he may steal if from one of the other players scoring row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The black die is not recommended when playing with children under the age of 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
