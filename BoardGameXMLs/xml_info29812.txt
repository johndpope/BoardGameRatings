							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fun at the Zoo Game</name>
									
			<description>Fun at the Zoo is a children's game.  From the side of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose the colored marker they wish to play and place it at the ZOO entrance.  To determine playing turns, players spin the spinner one time and the player with the highest number begins first, and the other players follow in turn to the left.  Shuffle the Suspense Cards and place face down in the center of the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the spinner and move forward the amount of spaces indicated on the spinner dial.  At &amp;quot;Your Zoo&amp;quot; you may &amp;quot;Feed&amp;quot; some of your Zoo friends and some you may not.  Upon landing on a space marked for one of your Zoo Friends, player draws one of the Suspense Cards.  If the players marker is on a space marked &amp;quot;You May Feed&amp;quot; and the Suspense Card states to &amp;quot;Feed&amp;quot;, player may go ahead 2 spaces.  If the turned over card says &amp;quot;Do Not Feed&amp;quot; player must go back 2 spaces.  By the same token, if the player marker is on a &amp;quot;Do Not Feed&amp;quot; space and the card turned over says &amp;quot;Do Not Feed&amp;quot; player may go ahead 2 spaces, but if the card says to &amp;quot;Feed&amp;quot; player must go back 2 spaces.  Replace the suspense card face down under the pile after use.  The first player to arrive back to the entrance wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
