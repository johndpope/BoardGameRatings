							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Johnsonville: Cutthroat Capitalism</name>
									
			<description>Referred to by the publishers as a &amp;quot;role-playing party game&amp;quot;, Johnsonville: Cutthroat Capitalism is a dice-rolling thematic game set in a small 1950s town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a small pool of money that may be depleted every turn, and the object of the game is to have completed the most &amp;quot;citizenly tasks&amp;quot; (objectives drawn at the start of the game) by the time all other players have lost money. Player interference to deplete the money of other players is encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions in the game can be completed in two ways- through rolling against the Game Master, or &amp;quot;Johnson&amp;quot;, or by drawing &amp;quot;Kit Cards&amp;quot;, fictional cure-all products. Players interact by describing actions and rolling or drawing to attempt to complete them. The positive(or negative) effects of these attempts are described by the Johnson in a humorous fashion based on the numbers rolled or card drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
