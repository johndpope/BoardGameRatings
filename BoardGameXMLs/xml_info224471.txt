			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is not a typical one involving beasties and being from beyond &amp;ndash; it focuses more on the terror in individuals, and a sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s desire to understand and have mastery over fear.  The setting is a psychiatric hospital, which gives lots of leeway for weird people and occasional random occurrences.  While events do occur, such as murders and suicides, the main focus of the scenario is on people &amp;ndash; the doctors, the PCs, and the patients.  It is about the nature of insanity as being only a measure of sanity, about the fears that we all harbours since children, about the problems psychiatrists have and how they can abuse positions of power to mask their own fears.  Essentially, it is about what happens when we lose our grip on controlling fear and unlock the self-darkened caskets in the closets of our subconscious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario typically is distributed as a ZIP archive containing several RTF documents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        1-page introduction&lt;br/&gt;        11-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;        6-page non-player-character details&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
