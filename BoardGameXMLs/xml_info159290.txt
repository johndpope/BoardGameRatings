							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raiders at Fargone</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming off the Plains of Dorack, you enter the Glockenspiel Mountains, where the remote village of Fargone is located. A merchant caravan you encountered a few days ago mentioned that Fargone residents have discovered a pass through the mountains to the sea; and a new trade route is opening up. This sounds like a nice place to stop before venturing to the sea!  As you approach the area where Fargone is said to be, large billowing smoke clouds can be seen&amp;hellip;.this could be problematic&amp;hellip;..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raiders at Fargone was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign, however it is easily adaptable to most any game and system. This adventure was designed for a party of 5th through 8th level characters. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign! This is the precursor to Odie's Staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
