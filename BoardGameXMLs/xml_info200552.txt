							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume XXI</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XXI, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 21 mythic spells, from telekinetic sphere to undeath to death. A mythic teleport can take you to specific places on other planets or planes, although with decreased accuracy. Mythic temporal stasis can be set to end automatically, and can be made to allow the target to take purely mental actions, while mythic touch of idiocy not only drains mental ability scores, but can also render the target amnesic or mute, or force them to act a fool, and mythic tree shape allows you to take the form of a fruit tree, oak tree, or willow tree, each with specific benefits. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
