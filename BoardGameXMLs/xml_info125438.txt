			<description>The third game in the Adventures in Math series, Carmen Sandiego Adventures in Math: The Case of the Crumbling Cathedral is an educational game. If players recover Big Ben in time, they&amp;rsquo;ll soon be whisked off to Russia, where someone has turned St. Basil&amp;rsquo;s Cathedral into a pile of sand. The third entry in the series, The Case of the Crumbling Cathedral, tasks players with the unenviable job of figuring out how this atrocity occurred, why there is a strange electric charge in the air surrounding the crime scene, and which of Carmen&amp;rsquo;s V.I.L.E. crew had the smarts to make this happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for a range of elementary learners across grades 3&amp;ndash;5, Carmen Sandiego Adventures in Math allows players to use the interactive features of the Wii to engage with math content in new and exciting ways. They'll graph with motion, sort coins with the flick of the wrist, and rearrange number sequences by using the Wii remote. And because the content is specifically aligned to the Common Core Standards for grades  4 and 5, they'll be learning and applying crucial math skills they need while having fun doing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the math topics covered include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Symmetry&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Identifying angles&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Graphing coordinates on a grid&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Logic puzzles&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Working with fractions&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Solving equations&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Tangrams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
