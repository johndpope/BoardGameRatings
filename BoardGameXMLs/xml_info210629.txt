							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Human Interface: Nakamura Tower â€“ AI Human Hybrid Forms</name>
									
			<description>It was a secret project. And utterly failed one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assumptions were ok... hmm at least for such morons, with dreams on armies taking over countries, somewhere at the end of the third world. The research and trials took almost 2 years. In the meantime the progress in robotics and nanomaterials completely changed the reality. The genetics and cloning were back. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to breed a stable hybrid. The mechanic part was either rejected or didn&amp;rsquo;t accept the orders from the interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole thing was too big, too heavy, not enough... let&amp;rsquo;s say... sublime. Yes, you are right, the marketing nowadays is important even for partly illegal military project for government. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know why the objects weren&amp;rsquo;t destroyed just after the project was closed. The whole lab was hidden somewhere in the bowels of the tower. Probably it was easier to keep it in secret than to destroy it. Or not... I think it is more likely, that our board was hoping to sell it to someone else anyway... or use it somehow. And they got what they deserved... She has used them! She woke them up, after she destroyed her own security. Probably the drones were not enough for her. She had to have something even more frightening... And the rest... well you know that better than me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE TESTIMONIES OF A SECRET INFORMER, ALIAS &amp;ldquo;SERPIO&amp;rdquo; DURING THE INVESTIGATION AFTER THE INCIDENT IN NAKAMURA TOWER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
