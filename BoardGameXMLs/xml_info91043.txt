							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frankenstein&#039;s Monster</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Frankenstein is busy with reanimating his hideous creation! Your objective is to stop him and you can only do that by building the monster's only weakness: A brick wall around the monster in the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must make haste! Gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you will use them to build a barricade around the monster before it comes alive. It won't be an easy ride however...! Numerous ghosts, poisonous giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders, a pool of acid and swarms of bats are all set to hinder your efforts. Avoid them at all costs and run for the tower, or the helpless villagers will be doomed once the abomination is completely energized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
