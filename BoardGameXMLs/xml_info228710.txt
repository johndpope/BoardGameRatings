			<description>A 'Press Your Luck' family card game where the odds move between all levels of doubt and certainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to reach 15 points by predicting whether the next card is higher or lower. Each correct call wins a point, where the player moves a chip from the central pool to a transitional holding pool. During their turn, players may stop at any time with the points they have accrued in the holding pool, and move them to their bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An incorrect call while these points are being accumulated, results in those points being returned from the holding pool back to the central pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An incorrect FIRST call on a player's turn results in the loss of half of their current bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number chart and extra chips are provided to mark off cards that have already been played. This allows complete focus on chance evaluation and strategy play for the remaining cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may pay a penalty of one point back to the central pool, if they wish to pass on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players are generally engaged in each others rise and demise. There are situations where a player's next call is a certain points gain, some where it's 50/50, and all odds in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most gamers of any genre, usually have a selection of filler games at hand to fill in those spare moments before and after game sessions. Here's one to add to your collection that combines fun and playability. It ticks another box too that's familiar to all gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're in a game and it's soon evident in the time that's left that you cannot win it. The beauty of SAVVY as one player put it, is that you're never out of it, and you can win the game from anywhere. It can play as fast or as long as you want depending on player strategies, and it flows smoothly as player fortunes rise and fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you an odds or instinct player, or just plain lucky?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn new skills, and get set for wicked humour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn, just two rules. High or Low. Pass or Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that SAVVY is a simple game. It&amp;rsquo;s got strategy, odds judgement that will tax even the brightest minds, and pure levels of addiction that compels you to get involved with other players decisions. You may find yourself encouraging players to go for it, when really you want them to blow out and drop points. Oh there&amp;rsquo;s humour alright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s your playing style. Are you an odds calculator who plays the percentages? An instinct player who gets the feel of the cards and plays accordingly? Or never mind all that, you feel lucky and call whatever comes into your head, today's your day, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So back to the game, is the next card higher or lower?Do you play, or pass and give the next player something to think about? No thanks there! Get it wrong and there are penalties. Get it right and you&amp;rsquo;re on a roll. Correct calls win points. Fifteen points will win it. You can be nearly there, and then start falling back to zero. Can you handle the sympathy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then there is the fantastic help from your fellow players. If you want to follow it, dream on &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re in the wrong game. Banter has no boundaries here, and some of the advice on offer would make your progress very backward indeed. Sometimes you will remember a game for the laughs you had, the winner is irrelevant, well nearly. That&amp;rsquo;s how game sessions go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of drama, humour and constant dilemmas. SAVVY is a one-off rollercoaster. Master the art of &amp;lsquo;When To Stop&amp;rsquo;. Judge the moments well and take the kudos. Gain the SAVVY status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we first trialled the finished rules on Christmas night 2015, our youngest player was the neighbours child from across the green. We showed him the concept of calling higher or lower, and guided him for a while on the best way to play. He played cautiously and lo and behold, won all three games. A feat which has not been equalled since. So to Owen who was six and three quarters then, we salute you! He's welcome back anytime he's changed his winning ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3-6 players, aged 8 and upwards, and a playing time of 10-40 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
