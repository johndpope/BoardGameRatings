			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of blocks fall in a jumble. It is up to you to click on them to remove them, ideally without waking any up. You have two color choices that you can remove, blocks of like colors can be removed by clicking on them. But be careful, if any blocks were resting on the block you remove they will fall and wake up and be angry with you. You have a meter which slowly drains the more blocks get angry. Anger too many blocks and lose the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
