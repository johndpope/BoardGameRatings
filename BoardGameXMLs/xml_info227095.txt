							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naval Warfare on Tékumel: A Primer</name>
									
			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;An unofficial treatise describing aspects of naval warfare and history in the Tékumel setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the author's blog comments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what all are you getting? Well, it is a primer on naval warfare on T&amp;eacute;kumel. Section 1 is a brief introduction. Section 2 discusses the history of naval warfare on T&amp;eacute;kumel. Section 3 deals with naval architecture and the organization of fleets in the Five Empires. Section 4 covers the &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; practice of naval warfare. Section 5 describes two historical naval engagements, to illustrate the points raised in Section 4. Section 6 offers some brief concluding observations. This is followed by a rather lengthy section of endnotes and then a brief list of references cited. &lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt; It isn't &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; canon T&amp;eacute;kumel. It is a completely unofficial fan essay. In fact, there are a few instances (clearly identified in endnotes) where I explicitly depart from canon fact. Moreover, in the T&amp;eacute;kumel of my imagination, it is still the reign of the 61st Seal Emperor Hirk&amp;aacute;ne &amp;ldquo;The Stone Upon Which the Universe Rests.&amp;rdquo; For me, subsequent canon historical events have not happened yet (and may never happen). The disclaimer required by the Tekumel Foundation for fan work appears on the first page of the Table of Contents. &lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;This is a pure fluff piece. I originally envisioned it as a naval equivalent of Professor Barker's &amp;quot;Military Formations of The Nations of The Universe&amp;quot; article published in the Dragon Magazine back in 1977. Although the scope grew over time, it is still intended to serve the same kind of role.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Prior familiarity with the world of T&amp;eacute;kumel is assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
