							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DCS: A-10C Warthog</name>
									
			<description>The Publisher Website From the Digital Combat Simulator site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;DCS: A-10C Warthog&amp;quot; is a PC simulation of the U.S. premier Close Air Support attack aircraft. This is the second aircraft in the DCS series, following DCS: Black Shark, and raises the bar even higher in the DCS series. Warthog brings the most realistic PC simulation of a modern fixed wing combat aircraft in regards to flight dynamics, avionics, sensors, and weapon systems. You also have the option to play Warthog in &amp;quot;Game&amp;quot; mode for a casual game experience. Fly missions in the Caucasus region of the Black Sea against and with a wide array of air, land and sea forces with new and improved intelligence. Create your own missions and campaigns with the included Mission and Campaign Editors, and fly with and against friends online using the included online game browser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User addition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asked about realism, in an interview DCS: A10C producer Matt Wagner says they have been the developer behind the A-10C Desk Top Simulator for the Air National Guard, Active units, and Reserve units of the USA. Part of that deal was to reuse code and data for the production of a 'entertainment' version of the DTS, which, he estimates, is about 95% of the real thing. (Obviously, not everything could be recreated in the game for security reasons.) In the game, the player can look around in the A-10C cockpit and (nearly) every button can be clicked or turned and has the same effect as in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
