			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a country engaged in war.  The players begin the game with well equipped sea, air, and land forces and a war chest.  The units are moved around the board, encountering the dangers and obstacles of modern warfare.  During the play the units may seize certain strategic bases, ports, etc., allowing the player to collect a specified amount of money from opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The units are safe at all times in friendly territory but may be lost or captured when they enter enemy areas.  Each player moves the units into play three at a time, one in each of air, land and sea lanes.  Players must continue to move the 3 units around the track (lowest rated move first) until all 3 units have left the playing field.  Then another 3 units are moved through the track until all players have moved all their units through the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that has earned the largest amount of assets (money + value of surviving units).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
