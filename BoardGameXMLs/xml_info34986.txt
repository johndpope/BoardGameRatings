			<description>Game is presumably from the 1950ies and a greyhound racing betting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 6 x 8 suits of greyhound cards and one hare card.&lt;br/&gt;Added is a rubber gameboard, enforced with raw canvas which also depicts the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place your bets - and then one card after the other is turned up from the shuffled deck until one dog has laid out all his cards. Should the last card be the &amp;quot;disqualified&amp;quot; the dog is exactly that !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be played by any number of players as long everyone has counters (or money?) to bet...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
