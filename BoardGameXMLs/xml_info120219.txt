			<description>One of the type of game that the British, in particular, liked to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each horse is attached to a length of string. By 'jiggling' the string, your horse can be made to move forward and, when a jump is reached, a different use of the string will allow your horse to 'jump' the fence. A fair amount of dexterity and finesse is needed with the aforementioned actions. The horses have two bases you might say, one flat and one rounded (it works exactly the same as a wheel would).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to finish the course, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
