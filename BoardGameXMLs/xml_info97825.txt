							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 Joystick</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 is a joystick which is capable of detailed, directional force feedback (haptic) effects.  In addition to general, broad force force feedback effects (vibrating), the joystick can apply torque to itself in specific directions to simulate environmental resistance.  It is advertised as having 100 different force feedback effects.  Several of the Microsoft Flight Simulator games can make use of these detailed force feedback effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The joystick can be moved in three axes (two tilt axes and one twist axis) and includes eight buttons, an analog slider and an eight-directional hat.  It uses a USB interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model number X05-63776 has a silver plastic trigger.  A later model replaced this with a translucent red plastic trigger trigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
