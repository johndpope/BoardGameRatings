							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Average Modern Fast Food Restaurant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It felt like forever since he had simply grabbed a coke and a burger and took the time to taste it. Jacob slowly savored each bite of the bacon double cheeseburger and each sip of the ice cold soda. It helped him remember a simpler time before the blood and the screams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He almost smiled for a moment, but that moment of tranquilty was cut short as a cream colored Volkswagon Beetle flew through the side window of the restaurant and slammed into the children's play area. Stunned, he looked at the empty, mangled play area and then back along the trajectory of the vehicle until his gaze rested upon a short thin man in a button-down white shirt and neatly pressed pants. In his right hand, he held a briefcase. The man's left arm resembled a massive lobster claw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starring in disbelief, Jacob thought to himself, &amp;quot; I thought you were dead.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture as well as hex and square grids.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flippin' Out is a fast food restaurant that is over 10,000 square feet. The restaurant contains a children's play area as well as numerous booths and tables and a drive-thru. The restaurant can easily serve as a dining location for any type of fast food as well as other casual dining options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
