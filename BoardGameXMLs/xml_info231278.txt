			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact is a foresight game. It is designed to help people imagine and think critically about the future. Players take on the roles of distinct characters, each with their own 'Job of the Future' and unique set of preferred future conditions. They compete to create a world where their future job is relevant and secure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 5 players choose from 10 &amp;quot;Jobs of the Future&amp;quot; with differing back stories and victory conditions. They draw and play cards from a deck of 100 Impact Cards that relate current technological trends to future conditions. They assess and discuss the likely primary and secondary impacts of each card on one or more of 10 different &amp;quot;domains&amp;quot; (e.g. Manufacturing, Energy, Security, Home, Work) and place or remove influence cubes. &lt;br/&gt;There are also Disruption Cards that indicate large-scale or sudden shifts in the system that pose larger challenges to the players. &lt;br/&gt;After each round of play (every player has had one turn), players collect the played cards and generate the &amp;quot;Headline of the Era&amp;quot; from player suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;When a player sees that the number of influence cubes equals or exceeds the win condition on three of the domains specified for their &amp;quot;Job from the Future&amp;quot;, they reveal their role and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally designed by Idea Couture in collaboration with Policy Horizons Canada, an organization within the Public Service of Canada that examines emerging policy challenges and new ideas and questions posed by trends in technological and social development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is not a great deal of strategy or mechanical challenge in this game, but that's not the point; the purpose of the game is to get the players thinking and discussing the possible second-order effects of current developments, using their logic to persuade other players on what other domains could be affected besides the obvious ones. &lt;br/&gt;This game appears to be aimed at wannabe policy analysts, amateur futurologists and soi-disant speculative thinkers generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
