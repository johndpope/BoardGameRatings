			<description>this is a set of 112 total meeples&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the Character Meeples for each of the factions in Tiny Epic Kingdoms by Gamelyn Games.  This set replaces the meeples from the base game with high quality, painted Meeples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set contains 7 Character Meeples for each of the 16 factions in Tiny Epic Kingdoms by Gamelyn Games. We do not have very many of these sets left after the Kickstarter orders that caused such a fine upgrade kit to exist, so don't delay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See close-up photos of each character: Humans, Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Constructs, Satyrs, Lizardfolk, Dark Elves, Centaurs, Valkyries, Goblins, Merfolk, Undead, Halflings, Shapeshifters, and Order of Gamelyn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from a merged entry&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Epic Kingdoms comes with 7 meeples in five different player colors (black, white, blue, orange, and purple). These character meeples are larger than those included with the game (approximately 19 mm tall) and are intended to be used in place of the meeples that come in the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character meeples exist for each of the original 16 factions:&lt;br/&gt;- Human&lt;br/&gt;- Orc&lt;br/&gt;- Elf&lt;br/&gt;- Dwarf&lt;br/&gt;- Construct&lt;br/&gt;- Satyr&lt;br/&gt;- Halfling&lt;br/&gt;- Lizardfolk&lt;br/&gt;- Undead&lt;br/&gt;- Goblin&lt;br/&gt;- Valkyrie&lt;br/&gt;- Dark Elf&lt;br/&gt;- Merfolk&lt;br/&gt;- Centaur&lt;br/&gt;- Shapeshifter&lt;br/&gt;- Order of Gamelyn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain variants exist which allow play with just a single character meeple. In such cases, the regular meeples included with Tiny Epic Kingdoms are still used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
