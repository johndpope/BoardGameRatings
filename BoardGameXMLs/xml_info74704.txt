			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Amplitude, the player controls a ship (referred to as a &amp;quot;Beat Blaster&amp;quot;) moving down a path of varying shapes and lengths, containing up to six tracks. Each color-coded track corresponds to a different aspect of the song, such as percussion, synth, bass, or vocals, and contains a sequence of notes. As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the notes activate a small portion of the track. If the player successfully activates enough notes in sequence, the track is &amp;quot;captured&amp;quot; and the section will play automatically for a number of bars, freeing the player to capture another section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to capture a sufficient amount of sections to reach the end of the song. If the player continually misses notes, an energy meter empties until the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successor to Harmonix's earlier game, Frequency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
