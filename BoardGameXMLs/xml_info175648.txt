			<description>The night of the summer solstice, all the goblins are on the moor to designate their king. Enter the round and build the most beautiful dolmen to win the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dolmen is a beautiful wooden play on the Celtic theme published in limited series. You play the Goblins, these small Breton goblins, who will build their dolmen picking up the slabs arranged in a circle around the stone table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the most points in its own construction at the end of the game. It stops when a player has 7 tiles in its dolmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, players will either move their korrigan AND watch a slab OR try to add a tile to their dolmen AND watch a slab&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A korrigan moves from 0 to 3 (without rolling the dice) on the light points around the circle in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile has a colored light on two of its sides. Arranged on the circle early in the game, the face of each slab has points (2 to 6). These will serve as the final countdown to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add a stone to the dolmen, the korrigan must be in front of it and one of the colored sides of the stone must be the same color as the ends of the dolmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player rolls the dice and if the result is more than the score of the slab, it can be placed by matching lights. &lt;br/&gt;If the dice score is not enough, you need to consume power points symbolized by colored gems and give the difference on the stone table of the fairy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To recover its power points, the player must go see the fairy. This will also take the opportunity to replace the stones around the circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a dolmen is finished, each player counts his points (even those with incomplete dolmen) and adds the unused points of powers. The winner is the one with the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning, this is not necessarily the fastest who is the winner ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
