							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Jeu des 7 Tours</name>
									
			<description>Le Jeu des 7 Tours is a cycling game containing a large board measuring 69x49cms., 14 pawns (unfortunately no plastic cyclists, just classic pawns here), two dice and 70 cards with  questions about cycling. In the game it is possible to enter 7 different races. These are the Tours of France, Spain, USA, Japan, Benelux, Italy or Columbia. The tracks of these races are compiled out of a combination of flat stages, time trials and mountain stages. Movement is decided by rolling 2 dice, when someone rolls a 7 he has to draw a card and answer a question about cycling. The winner is he who wins the overall classifying of all races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
