			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to Play - Ages: 8 through Adult - 1 or 2 Players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic and exciting College Version Basketball Game which enables players to record each Field Goal, Free Throw, Rebound, Turnover and Foul just like in a real-life game.  It's possible to be blown out or have a double overtime game.  Unlike programmed electronic games, no two games will ever be alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your favorite team to the FINAL FOUR!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's great fun!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes: Team Rosters, Scoresheet Pads, Game Instructions, Scoresheet Instructions, Game Scoring Pads, Dice, Dice Cup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- - - - - -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, after reading the instructions, here's how the game works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coaches choose their starting lineup and allocate the players to a position (two forwards, two guards, and a center).  Then, they roll dice and confer with a standard results table (same table used for any team that plays--ie, there are no considerations for team or individual player talent level).  Repeat this until game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hence, the game is not realistic in the sense that Clemson can beat UNC just as easily as UNC can beat Georgia Tech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box cover shows the logos of the then-eight teams in the ACC.  Inside the box are all-star rosters for each of those teams (that is, players from different years play together), plus eight other teams (Georgetown, Indiana, Louisville, Marquette, UNLV, Notre Dame, St. Johns, and UCLA).  For whatever reason, Abdul-Jabbar/Alcindor is not included on the all-time UCLA team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's about it.  A basketball simulation with specified rosters, but you can list your own buddies names and get the same results when you take on the all-time all-star UNC Tarheels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
