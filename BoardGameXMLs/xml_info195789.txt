							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Archetypes Volume V</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Good to Be Bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sick of saving the world? Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&amp;rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &amp;ldquo;evil campaign,&amp;rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&amp;rsquo;ve found them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the bloodboiler, a bloodrager archetypes whose rage is infectious, inciting allies and enemies both into a frenzied riot, the maligner, a druid archetype that specializes in turning animals and plants against civilization, and transforming them into more dangerous creatures, the zealous hound, an inquisitor archetype that denounces his foes to weaken them in combat, and specializes in dragging confessions from heretics and other sinners, the bokor, an occultist archetype that can exploit the connection between objects and their owners to enact powerful magic in the style of voodoo dolls, and the obsessive murderer, a stalker archetype that focuses on building a connection between himself and his prey to deliver truly devastating attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
