							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paratrooper (1983)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the only one left to stop them.  The sky is full of enemy choppers.  Paratroopers keep dropping into your area with non-stop barrage of enemy troops.  They are out to destroy you.  This new game is an unbeatable blend of arcade action and quick thinking strategy.  You must make every shot count - don't be too fast on the trigger.  Every time you hit a chopper or paratrooper you get extra points.  Wait until you see the climax of this game - you won't believe it.  This is a multiple skill level game with razor sharp graphics and sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
