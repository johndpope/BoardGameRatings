			<description>Is Brian totally insane?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some say that Brian has gone totally crazy and that he sees little green men. Some also say that he might have killed someone in a moment of rage...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some say that he wanders like a homeless man in the dark streets of New York while others can swear he is enjoying a vacation in Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people even dare to say that Brian Basco is dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Gina will do everything she can to find him and prove to everyone that they are wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help Brian and Gina solve the mysteries of their last adventure, packed with humor, suspense, twists, golden chickens, lies, and a happy ending. Or maybe even two happy endings...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
