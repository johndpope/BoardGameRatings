							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raccoon Madness Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The raccoons are out of control. They&amp;rsquo;ve diversified into many different forms, morphing into all manner of styles. In Raccoon Madness, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to be good at bluffing in order to get rid of your cards. Will another player call your bluff?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players that have no cards won!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every day we have to decide whether to tell the truth or to tell a lie; sometimes we are afraid of being deceived and we feel ashamed whenever we are caught in a lie. To train our intuition and to enhance our emotion reading skills in a fun environment, we have created &amp;ldquo;Raccoon Madness Game&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created by three friends. We have been inspired by Tim Burtons art, old USSR game and Texas Holdem Poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
