			<description>The main objective of the game is to collect seven of one type of victory card. Players must balance their play between researching technologies, expanding cities and building units. Having only a limited number of actions per turn, it is important for players to consider their activities carefully so that they maximize their ability to collect cards. The first player to collect seven of one type of victory card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on hex-grid map boards and players can choose which sections of the map to assemble. Currently there are maps of Europe and the Caribbean, although plans for future maps will cover the entire world. Players lay tiles down to form cities and can build military units to protect them or attack others. Cities create the wealth that a player needs to further their empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to perform their moves, building their empire up while keeping a close eye on their neighbors to prevent them beating them to the end. Open play allows players to watch other players activities, and manage resources in way that can stop other players winning while not hindering their own advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been designed to give flexibility to the rules so that players can develop in-house versions of the rules without breaking the game. One popular alteration is in the collection of cards. Players can change the speed and dynamic of the game by changing how many and of which types of card need to be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is fully customizable allowing players to design their own versions including army units, maps, technologies and rules. The online published version of the game can be downloaded and printed off for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
