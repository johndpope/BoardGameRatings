							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Play Rome</name>
									
			<description>This is an interesting collection of 30 or more games placed in a box with dozens of beautiful printed paper &amp;quot;boards&amp;quot; for playing the numerous games listed in the enclosed book.  &amp;quot;Play Rome&amp;quot; seems to be made in conjunction of the &amp;quot;Department for the Promotion of Culture, Theater, Tourism and Sport&amp;quot; of Rome.  The many printed boards are quite beautiful and the games run from being very simple to being very complex. The description on the box reads,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These games may help you to discover your own personal Rome.  They will not only lead you far and wide through the city but also through the centuries starting from a small village of some dozens of huts up to our days.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
