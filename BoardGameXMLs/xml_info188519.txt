							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Temple of Heryshaf</name>
									
			<description>In this game, the player adventures through the Temple of Heryshaf, the Ancient Egyptian god of Primordial Waters.  The goal is to reach the apex of the temple - Heryshaf&amp;rsquo;s Inner Sanctum!  But beware!  For the temple is filled with traps, and the passageways are winding!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, choose one of the five cards at the base of the pyramid to start the path.  Each turn take the token representing your character and move it onto a card.    The token may only move to a new card if the room you are in has a path which leads to that card and the card you are moving to has a corresponding path.  When you attempt to move to a new card, flip the card over and sees what effects are activated.  There are both traps and helper cards you may find inside the temple.  You may choose to backtrack, but if you do, one card on the board is discarded, and a new unknown card takes its place - which may help or hinder you later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player wins if they make it through the temple, avoiding the traps or disarming the traps, to arrive safely at Heryshaf's Inner Sanctum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game tied for first place in the 24 hour contest for September 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
