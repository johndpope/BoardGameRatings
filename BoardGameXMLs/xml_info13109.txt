			<description>This &amp;quot;Extension&amp;quot; Variant is for use with the Battle for Moscow (first edition) FREE game by GDW Games, which first appeared in &amp;quot;BattlePlan&amp;quot; Magazine, issue #7, by Thomas M. Kane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion allows the Soviet Player a means of continuing the game to 'play out' the Soviet Winter Counter-Offensive. There is a *NEW* set of Victory Conditions based upon victory points in which they are attained by eliminating enemy units, capturing cities and holding them by the time the game ends. For the Germans, there is a *BONUS* if they Capture Moscow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Variant has a Winter Effects Table, a means for Replacements to effect the creation of a Soviet 'Tank Army', and an extended Turn Record Track to display the entire *NEW* Game's length (including the Turns from the beginning of Battle for Moscow (first edition), which is required in order to play this).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
