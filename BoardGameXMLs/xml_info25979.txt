			<description>This magnetic small traveling game was broad out by Super Accord, a company from Hong-Kong (now China) somewhere in the '90s. It's a plastic box (8,5x8,5cm.)that can be clapped open.  There are four different magnets that are used as pawns (one for each player) and a 6mm. die. The rules are very easy, movement of the magnets is determined by the die, some boxes on the track can cause bad luck (resulting for example in skipping one or two turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
