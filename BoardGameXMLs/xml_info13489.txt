							<name  sortindex="1">Whac-A-Mole Card Game: Chass&#039;taupes Jeu de cartes</name>
									
			<description>The game contains 30 cards with a mole in the hole, 30 cards with no mole, and a small plastic mallet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four games included. Two of them, &amp;quot;Mole-No Mole&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mole-A-Round&amp;quot; are pure luck, just with different methods of randomly distributing victory points among 2-4 players. Of the other two games, one is an action game and one is a memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Whac-Wild&amp;quot; is an action game for 2 players where all of the cards are shuffled together and dealt face down to a pile for each player. The mallet is placed between them. Each player then takes turns flipping the top card of his/her pile. If the card has no mole the other player takes a turn. If it has a mole the first player to grab the mallet and whack the card puts it in his/her score pile. The player with the most mole cards after all cards have been flipped wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Mole Pairs&amp;quot; the entire deck is shuffled and dealt out to the 2-4 players. A certain number (depending on the number of players) of cards is set face down in front of each player. They then take turns whacking two of the cards, either in their own area or that of another player. the cards are flipped up. If they match (either mole/mole or no mole/no mole) they go into the whacking player's score pile and new cards are put in their place by any player other than the scoring player. The scoring player then gets another turn. When a player whacks a mole/no mole mismatch, the turn is over and the cards are turned back face down. When all pairs have been claimed the game is over and the player with the most pairs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
