			<description>This undated but circa 1920s game is simple dice-driven horse race played on a two-part metal track. Six metal horses and two metal hurdles are also included. The metal seems to be the selling point, since the box declares &amp;quot;As played on Ocean Liners&amp;quot;, and both the box and board graphics feature ships and shipboard play of a shuffleboard-sized version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 16-space U-shaped track has six lanes. Each horse is assigned the number on a D6 corresponding to its lane. In the standard game, each player throws three dice, with each horse moving one space for each time its die number appears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules, printed on the metal board, provide for a steeplechase version, where the two metal hurdles are placed on designated spaces and require two of the three dice to show the horse's number to pass. They also provide for a &amp;quot;fast game&amp;quot; where one die determines the horse and a second die how many spaces it moves. And finally there are rules for a &amp;quot;slow race&amp;quot;, where the last horse wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
