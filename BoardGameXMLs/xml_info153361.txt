							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Four Fronts</name>
									
			<description>Four Fronts is a Chess variant for 2, 3, or four players, individually or in pairs.  Each player has 12 pieces: 6 pawns, 1 each of the king, queen, knight, rook, and bishop, and a &amp;quot;prince&amp;quot; piece that is a hybrid of a bishop and a rook.  The board is an ordinary 8x8 black and white chessboard, but extended along each of four sides for the player's starting fields.  Along each 8-square side of the board is another six squares, then another four squares, then two, all of them centered.  The overall shape of the board then can be seen as a square with jagged edges, and with its four corners highlighted in colors to match the players' pieces.  The colored squares are the starting positions for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's rules of movement, capture, and winning conditions appear to be otherwise the same as in Chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
