			<description>The next generation of MOBA&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple: Two teams of five players. Fighting enemy drones, turrets and warriors, players advance towards their opponents base in order to destroy their headquarters. You&amp;rsquo;ve been there. You love MOBAs. Think you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it all? Think again. Welcome to Shards of War &amp;ndash; the next generation of MOBA!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the Sentinels&lt;br/&gt;The gateway has been opened. Sentinels from alternate realities enter the battlefield of Empire City. Some to close the portals and restore order, others to make sure they never have to return &amp;hellip; what do you fight for?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twice the action &amp;ndash; in half the time&lt;br/&gt;Forget about long lane-phases and jump straight to the action to feel the rush of fast-paced, 20-minute matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WASD controls!&lt;br/&gt;Play with intuitive direct controls to experience the most intense MOBA battles. WASD let's you seamlessly control your Sentinel with run and gun action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original setting: a dystopian future&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve wielded all the swords, you&amp;rsquo;ve cast all the spells. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring out the big guns! On a dystopian, future Earth, the boundaries between realities have fallen and parallel Earths clash for supremacy&amp;hellip; and survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loadouts&lt;br/&gt;Explore immense variety and flexibility for each Sentinel. Loadouts and crafted items enable unlimited versatility! Use your time battling foes instead of thinking which items to take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved team-play: Team Levels&lt;br/&gt;There is no I in team. You fight together. You win together. In Shards of War every action accounts for you AND your friends. And this has a direct effect on your entire team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
