							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Destruction Contraption</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party barely remember the Labyrinth Lord recruiting them when he sent them to investigate the destruction of the little village Massakra.   What happened here?  There is a trail leading north.  The river acts odd when we get in it.  Over the land we will go.  This crazy looking guy called Oblurn is of little help.  Thankfully nothing seems very tough so far... what is that weird looking place over there?  Oblurn helped little...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Destruction Contraption is a low level Labyrinth Lord/OSR adventure.   Weird, interesting perhaps.  You must find out what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
