							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Sojobo</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The martial skills of the Tengu are legendary across the Golden Empire. Although few in number these avian Yokai long lives give them ample time to gain mastery of not only the martial but also to learn the secrets of the kami who call the mountains their home. Hidden away in their mountain top cities and guarded by the devoted hill tribes few have ever seen these mysterious warriors. What has brought Sojobo down from the mountains and to the aid of the Tengus' old allies the Temple is not known. Sojobo&amp;rsquo;s skills in combat are equalled by very few. Now he has spread his great wings and left his mountain home the spirits and prospects of the people of the Rokan can only be lifted as a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
