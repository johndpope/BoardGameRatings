Now you can be privy to the closely-guarded secrets of Briarwood Castle in this two volume set, which includes The Briarwood Castle Guidebook and The Dungeon Book, plus a seperate parchment GM's map depecting the dungeon controlled by Ralf, a lich whose quest for power could have a profound impact on the City-State. This set provides exciting material for endless variety of fantasy roe-playing scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;In the adventure you are convicted criminals of the City-State. The Overlord himself has offered to save you from the Death penalty if you can find the vulnerabilities in the Castle's defenses and enter the Castle from the outside of its walls&lt;br/&gt;Someone close to Lucius II is betraying him, and that person dules over the depths of The Old Bathhouse Dungeon and Ralf's Dungeon.
