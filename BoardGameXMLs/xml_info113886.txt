							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sand Dragon Inn</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A restful stay on an Arabian night with the Kobold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for Kobold Quarterly #10 and in collaboration with Open Design, Rite Publishing and cartographer Jonathan Roberts bring you the Sand Dragon Inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sand Dragon Inn is know for its luxurious common room and beautiful mosaic courtyard, but it hides a dark secret. Under the Inn lies a network of caves - and the secret to the Inn's name. This map presents an exotic Inn, with common room, meeting rooms, courtyards, stables, store rooms and owners quarters. It can be used without the underground tunnels if all you need is an exotic Inn, or you can include the caves to open up a more sinister underside to this decadent waystation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map pack includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Multi-page PDF in US Letter and A4 formats that enables you to print out the maps for your gametable at 1 square = 1 inch. The PDFs come in both color and printer-friendly greyscale.&lt;br/&gt;    High resolution JPGs with and without grids for both the upper and lower level of the Inn, designed to be easily dropped into any virtual tabletop program, or printed to scale at your local print shop.&lt;br/&gt;    MapTool campaign files with vision blocking and light constructed for quick use in 4E, PFRPG, or any OGL game. They are compatible with Maptool 1.3b84 or newer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
