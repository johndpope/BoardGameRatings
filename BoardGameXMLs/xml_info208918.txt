			<description>The Superman and Wonder Woman Starter Set is the first in a series of annual starter sets, not linked to a larger release for Dice Masters, designed by Mike Elliott and Eric M. Lang. The set will feature Superman and Wonder Woman along with other Kryptonians and Amazons, with new spins on 8 DC heroes (and their dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Masters is a collectible dice-building tabletop game designed by Quarriors! creators Michael Elliott and Eric M. Lang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of up to 20 dice, and a player can &amp;quot;purchase&amp;quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
