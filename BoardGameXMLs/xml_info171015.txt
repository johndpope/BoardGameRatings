			<description>Would a hero like you assassinate the president of the United States to defend the right to be Powered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the corrupt President Victon launches his oppressive campaign of Powered Regulation, your Legendary heroic rise transforms into something much more: you must become a political icon fighting to restore Powered rights in America. This new battle takes a twisted turn when your once-greatest enemy, Prodigal, tells you President Victon&amp;rsquo;s darkest secret....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you are faced with the biggest choices of your career: Do you trust the word of your archenemy? Will you evade President Victon's gang of criminal bounty hunters? Can you save your family and complete your rise as a Legendary hero?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Rise: HeroFall completes the epic Heroes Rise trilogy by Zachary Sergi, featuring the smash hits Heroes Rise: The Prodigy and Heroes Rise: The Hero Project, interactive novels where your choices control the story. The Heroes Rise trilogy is entirely text-based&amp;mdash;without graphics or sound effects&amp;mdash;and driven by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of your decisions lead to this epic conclusion, where you must truly define what you believe is right and what you stand for as a hero&amp;mdash;and what (or whom) you&amp;rsquo;re willing to sacrifice for those ideals. Play as male or female, gay or straight, and decide how your story will end. How many alternate endings can you unlock?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How high will you rise?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
