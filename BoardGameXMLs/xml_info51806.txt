							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tomb of Tobin&#039;s Hills</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An instant adventure for 3-4 characters levels 1-2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any experienced gamer knows that space behind the DM&amp;rsquo;s screen can be pretty limited. That&amp;rsquo;s why Tronen Games have brought you the A5 Adventure series. This handy size may be small but is packed with adventure. Remember the smaller they are the bigger they bite!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re only kobolds....was the last thing he said, never saw &amp;lsquo;im again&amp;rsquo; says the old villager shaking his head. A group of kobolds bearing the symbol of a red dragon have attacked the village of Garrad in the shire of Brent stealing sheep &amp;amp; livestock. A brave villager tracked them to a small group of hills known by locals as Tobin&amp;rsquo;s Hills and to what appeared to be an old mine. The mine had been fortified with a rather crude palisade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of adventurers, hired by the local reeve, went into the hills a few weeks ago but have not been seen since and the raids have continued. The road has become dangerous for the few merchants that travel through, prompting them to offer a reward but no one seems to have taken up the challenge...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;rsquo;s not like the old days, there seem to be fewer hero&amp;rsquo;s these days.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
