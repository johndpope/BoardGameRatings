			<description>From the Back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You think you're ready. You're not. You don't even have a clue. The Future has Changed. The Players have Changed. The Rules have Changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Dark Future, the Megacorporations ruled the world from their starscraper towers, enforc&amp;not;ing that control with armies of cyborg assassins. While the boostergangs roamed a shattered urban wilderness, the endless party went on 24-7 in the hottest clubs, sleaziest bars and meanest streets this side of the Postholocaust. But that was before the Crash; before the dark days of 203X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the battlefield belongs to the new Lords of the Street: the DMA-shape shifting Reefers vs the full-body cyborgs of Corpore Metal, Desnai's robo-enhanced mechajocks against the monster makers of Riptide, the nano-boosted roadwarriors of Rolling State against the cybertech megaweapons of the urban Edgerunners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready to hit the Street in this new incarna&amp;not;tion of the legendary roleplaying game of the Dark Future - a world so dangerous, so dark, that only the toughest, smartest and most cybered-up will survive. But you can deal with it. Because you're ready. Because you're - CYBERPUNK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;___________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplaying in the Dark Future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3rd Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Rework of the 'classic'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While intended to be a complete rewrite, it lifts some material from the previous editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, the main difference it that now the game is designed to get the players playing their characters almost immediately, with 'Templated Characters'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It relies on a lot of pre-generated templates and easy to use rules, but then goes into some more advanced rules and of course a new version of 'Friday Night Fights'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
