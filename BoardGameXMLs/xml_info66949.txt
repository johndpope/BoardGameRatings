			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards. It is a 3-player version of GOPS.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 13 cards. The other cards are revealed one by one. Then every player chooses one card simultaneously and reveals it. The highest card wins the trick. In that case the same suit, or the same color, or the same parity (spades/hearts or clubs/diamonds) with the first revealed card wins. Then the next card is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;After 13 tricks each player scores as follows for the cards they won: The face value of all cards of any one suit, minus the total face values of all other cards, plus 10 per void suit.&lt;br/&gt;Then the game continues up to 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
