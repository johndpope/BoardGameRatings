			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Items of the Future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, science fiction and fantasy were never meant to mix, but ray guns, aliens, and crashed space ships have been a part of fantasy roleplaying games ever since 1980 and the famous Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. Many Pathfinder products have embraced the science fiction genre, and as a result there are lots of GMs who may find themselves wanting to make use of the numerous ray guns, personal shields, power armors, teleportation chambers, and more that are the hallmarks of science fiction. But while sci-fi and fantasy may have turned out to be a combination much like peanut butter and chocolate, there&amp;rsquo;s one aspect of the Pathfinder game that has never before been combined with sci-fi, and that is the realm of mythic power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces eight sci-fi themed magic items created by the zogot, an ancient race of spacefaring creatures that discovered how to harness mythic power eons ago, and used it to power a mighty interplanetary empire. While the zogot vanished long ago, many of their relics can still be found today. Ride in style in a zogot force chariot, or trade in your battered full-plate for an ancient zogot power suit. Ray guns, stealth units, transporters, and more are all included in this book, as well as the mysterious zogot mythic power chamber, which can give a temporary boost of mythic power to creatures that use it, and is rumored to even be able to transform a normal creature into a mythic one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
