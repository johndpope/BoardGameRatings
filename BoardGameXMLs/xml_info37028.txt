			<description>&amp;quot;Toy Parade is a colorful, exciting game for pre-school kiddies, who need have no knowledge of numbers and counting; and an interesting game for older kiddies too.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vintage &amp;quot;spin and move&amp;quot; children's game for 2, 3 or 4 young children. The spinner depicts toys that are also shown on the squares of the game board. After spinning the spinner, a player moves to the next square showing the toy that the spinner selected. There are also colored squares on the board which have special effects, such as causing backwards movement or the loss of a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get all the way through the Toy Parade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
