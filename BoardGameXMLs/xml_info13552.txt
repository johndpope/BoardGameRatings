							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Associations: The Game of Quick Connections</name>
									
			<description>Players have to make was many word connections as possible before the egg timer runs out.  Two cards with letters are first dealt to each player and your first word (only) must encompass these.  l and k, could mean &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; for instance.  With a and k, you could write: bank, sand, castle, keep, sake, for, age, less, time.  All of these can go together to form words or phrases or idea-connections with the previous word (for and age makes &amp;quot;forage&amp;quot;).  When time is up, you have to pass to the right and carry on from the last word which the previous player wrote.  After each sheet of paper has been around every player, each player scores for the words they wrote.  Any disputed connections are voted on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
