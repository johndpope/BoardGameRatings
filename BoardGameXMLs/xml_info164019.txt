			<description>In the deepest depths of the ocean lie scientific discoveries yet to me made, ancient mysteries still to be solved and vast treasures to be gained by those willing to take the greatest risks.  But it will take a brave soul to challenge the crushing pressure and terrors to be found at the bottom of the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come aboard the fantastical Nautilus and meet her intrepid crew and the brave Captain Nemo, as they risk their lives for fame, fortune and glory - 20,000 Leagues under the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bathysphere is a 24 card microgame played across several rounds with each player having an opportunity to be Captain of the Nautilus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players simultaneously vote whether to Descend (dive deeper), Ascend (return to the surface) or Abandon Ship! (leave in an escape pod with a small share).  Majority rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the vote the Nautilus dives and may face many dangers or crises by turning over a dive card. The crew may elect to use their skills and fix these crises or let them pass, however, if 3 crises go unresolved, Nautilus is destroyed and all hands lost to the crushing depths. Resolving a crisis places it back in the dive deck, meaning it may resurface again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deeper Nautilus and her crew travel, the greater the rewards but the greatest rewards are shared only with those demonstrating the most loyalty to the Captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
