							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNO: Fantastic Four</name>
									
			<description>Standard Uno using a Fantastic Four theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: The &amp;quot;N-Zone&amp;quot; card.  When played the player who plays it selects another player to draw cards from the draw pile until a red card is drawn.  When the selected players draws a red card, he/she must place it on the discard pile.  The player who played the N-Zone card determines the color to be played in the next round by announcing his/her choice of red, yellow, green or blue, despite that there will be red card on the top of the discard pile.  The N-Zone card can be played as a player's last card allowing him/her to go out of the game.  If this happens, the player who plays the card still chooses a player to draw cards.  The point value of the N-Zone card is 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
