							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Circle of Jerks</name>
									
			<description>Circle of Jerks is a fast-paced, sensational party game that requires players to compete while yelling the most-inappropriate sexual terms you can imagine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incredibly easy to learn! Each round lasts only 15-60 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race your friends to identify the matching symbol between cards. You can only place a card if you shout out its ridiculous name out loud!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can take Circle of Jerks anywhere! Play it at a bar, a pregame or a basic sorority social. Pull it out at a quiet coffee shop or during a boring lecture. Are you dreading going to that funeral for a great-uncle you've never met?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring life to the party with Circle of Jerks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
