			<description>MediEvil 2 (MediEvil II in North America) is the sequel to MediEvil, a Gothic comedy horror platform game that allowed the player to explore several horror themed levels set in the Medieval century, the opportunity to collect items, weapons and activate sequences in order to complete tasks to advance further in the story. Similar to the first game &amp;quot;Medievil&amp;quot;, the player is set to defeat monsters in order to foil Zarok's evil plans again. This sequel also contains several new characters and an entire new range of levels set in 19th Century London. However, it still follows similar beasts, demons, traps and encounters with bosses as before. The exact date of the game's setting is unknown, however the year is defined as 1886 AD, 500 years after Sir Daniel Fortesque was laid to rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Medievil 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
