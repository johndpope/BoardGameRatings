							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horton Hears A Who! Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Cards are dealt out face-down in a 7x7 grid, representing the clover field. Hidden amongst the Clover cards are Who Cards, a special Who named Jo-jo, Jungle Animal Cards, and Beezle-Nut Oil Cards. Players flip cards starting at the outside edge and proceeding orthogonally until they collect a Who, or run into an Animal stopper. Cards are then re-flipped face down. Once a player finds three Who cards, he or she must then find the Jo-jo card to win the game. The game is designed for ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
