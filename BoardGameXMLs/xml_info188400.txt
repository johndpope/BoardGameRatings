			<description>In Medieval Might, two generals are pitted against each other in a battle. Each leads their army against each other to become the supreme commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing their units, represented by cards, on the battlefield. Each card builds up the strength of their forces, and use tactics to weaken their opponent's forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your knights and banner-men to greatly increase your strength, while deploying your scouts to gain an advantage over your opponent. If they start to take the lead, use your marksman to eliminate high value targets or ambush their forces to reduce their effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The army with the higher value at the end of that round is the victor of that round. The game ends when one player loses two rounds, and the winner is crowned the supreme commander&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
