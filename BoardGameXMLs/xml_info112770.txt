			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Hi all. I'm guessing you've noticed the new look. I figured that after more than three years and six issues it was time for a change. But don't worry. Under the swish new exterior it's still the same sad, immature and puerile Critical Miss that you've come to know and quite like. It is still - and always will be - the stated opinion of this magazine that bad language is both big and clever. We've worked damned hard to create a reputation for irresponsibility, and we don't intend to let that slip now..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content wise, I had quite a few ideas for this issue of Critical Miss, but most of them were for things that I really couldn't do, like this and this. But in the end, I managed to come up with the usual bundle of crap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well that's about it. Here's Issue 7. Hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
