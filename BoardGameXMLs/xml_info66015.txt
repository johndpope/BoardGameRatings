			<description>A strategy card game with little to no luck. Several unique factions and a total of more than 60 unique units with their own traits &amp;amp; stats. Only 30 &amp;ndash; 60 cards needed for a complete army&lt;br/&gt;No random card draws&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based off of the Computer game &amp;quot;Battle for Wesnoth&amp;quot; this is a fantasy tactile warfare card game. Line up your troops and fight each other to the death! The goal of this project is that every player has access to all cards available. You will never be stuck purchasing thousands of cards to find a single creature, instead you just print your army!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is licensed under the GPL&lt;br/&gt;In short, you may play the game, spread it and even sell it if you want to, but whatever you do you must always do it according to the GPL license(s).&lt;br/&gt;All card art used is under GPL2 or higher, and so is the shield &amp;amp; swords logo.&lt;br/&gt;Any other graphical material which does not depict a character or the sword and shield logo and which relates to the project is naturally copylefted under GPL3 and is available in it&amp;rsquo;s original format(s) from this site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
