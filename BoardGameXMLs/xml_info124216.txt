							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galaxy Empire</name>
									
			<description>Players start out with a single undeveloped world and attempt to build a huge empire in the universe. Along the way to their empire, players can form alliances with other players, research technologies to improve space ships, and perform various missions. Alliances are similar to guilds and serve many functions such offering members protection, enabling free trade among members, and consolidating forces for attacks. Although the game is text-based, Galactic Empires still looks good and has more action than most other games in the genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
