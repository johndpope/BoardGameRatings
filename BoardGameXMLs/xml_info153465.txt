			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Competition karate is a strategy simulation game in which students of the martial arts train and compete against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating a new student involves picking one of the 5 instructors and &amp;ldquo;rolling the dice&amp;rdquo; for each of the 9 abilities. The abilities include Strength, Agility, Quickness, Stamina, Perception, Courage, Arms, Legs and Body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training consists of selecting which areas to train and &amp;quot;rolling a die&amp;quot;. The roll result is added to the ability being trained.  A general workout can improve all abilities by a few points. While specific training can garner a larger increase in points, But a cost of points to other untrained areas. Each instructor has 3 areas they focus on and will add points to those abilities as well. Each student can only &amp;ldquo;workout in the dojo&amp;rdquo; once in-between official tournament matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of matches: Regular and Official. Regular matches are like official mathces, But are just for practice or exhibition. Wins &amp;amp; Loses are not recorded but students can still sustain injuries. Up to 32 students can participate in the single elimination contests. The players control the martial artists by selecting which offensive or defensive move they want to execute and the computer determines the results based on the competitors' abilities scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful attacks earns the student judges' points and progress points. Judges' points determine the winner of the match, Progress points determine when a student can be promoted to the next rank. All students start at the white belt rank and can be promoted all up to Red Belt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
