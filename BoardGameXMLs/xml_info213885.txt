			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the HMS Heartbreak, a luxury escape pod hurtling through the infamous Nobelle Quadrant- home of the largest Space Mall! Well, former space mall, now it's just a debris field filled with old junk from planet Earth.  You are one of six passengers sharing a cozy, hi-tech escape pod. Try not to kill each other as you make your way to safety. While you're at it, why not pick up some retro Earth antiques along the way with the tractor beam? Heartbreak EP takes players to the darker side of moons with a punk-rock attitude. Space may be vast, but for passengers aboard the HMS Heartbreak, it's about to feel a whole lot smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heartbreak EP is a semi-cooperative game of passive aggression. Players need to work together to keep their vessel intact long enough to get to a registered safe planet. The only problem is, you've got frenemies. Each player harbors profound hatred towards another crew member for reasons that don't have to be explained. Can you work together despite your rivalries?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of every round, all players will roll their action dice. All players are able to view the results of each die. On a player's turn they will assign dice to the growing number of events that threaten the ship or use them to power their station. Each station performs a function crucial to the operation of the escape pod. Share resources, take resources, or do nothing at all! You didn't choose to be stuck in a pod with them! Bluh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heartbreak EP brings new meaning to the expression &amp;quot;Give me some space&amp;quot;, and includes play modes for solitaire, fully cooperative, semi-cooperative, team vs team, and traitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
