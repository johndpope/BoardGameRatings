			<description>&amp;quot;Your city is on the move with the new SimCity 4 Rush Hour Expansion Pack. Get your Sims on the road to happiness by taking control of your city's transportation including roads, rail, air, waterways, and even cars. Take complete charge of vehicles on the streets of your city. Is the fire department stuck in traffic on its way to a four-alarm fire? Take direct control of the &amp;quot;hook and ladder&amp;quot; and pursue the quickest route to the blazing inferno. Solve missions from chasing down bank robbers to catching car-jackers, and earn reward buildings and other vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you gain traction by fixing transportation problems and solving missions your mayor approval rating will soar and Sims will flock to your city. Put your Sims on the move in new cars, ferries, and helicopters. Choose from all-new road types including wide avenues, suspension bridges, or one-way streets. Whisk your Sims across the city by developing seamless mass-transit systems that connect to a greater regional travel network. Add popular structures such as historic rail stations or classic Americana road marks. Go global and create a city based on a modern European building set. Make your final mark as mayor and personalize your cities by labeling street names, mountains, neighborhoods, and points of interest.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
