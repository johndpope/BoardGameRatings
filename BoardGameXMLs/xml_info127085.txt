			<description>Statler made a version of &amp;quot;Geographical Lotto&amp;quot; with USA map cards and cities. Playthings Limited made essentially the same game for Canadian cards and cities. It is not known if Playthings and Statler were somehow connected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically a bingo game whereby the player have cards which they are trying to fill. The call are made by blindly drawing a city card which is then called out. Each card has twelve cities. The winner is the player who fills his card first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Geographic cards for each player with 15 cities&lt;br/&gt;     City cards which to draw &amp;amp; call&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
