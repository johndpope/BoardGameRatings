			<description>Game based on the popular British television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 44 cards in 11 suits, so there are 4 of each suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player to get rid first of his dealt out cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player lays out a card face down onto the table and calls out the number, next player in line must play the following number. After card no. 11 card no.1 follows.&lt;br/&gt;At any time the card layer can be challenged: If the number challenged is correct, the challenger takes all his cards and those of the opponent, if not: it's just the opposite.&lt;br/&gt;If the game tends to drag on, it is advised to fix a time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again a card game in line of the Pepys series with top graphic design and card quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
