			<description>Clan Battle is a game of conflict and elimination for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  The game starts with the outer ring of Stonehenge seeded with guards and walls.  Players play cards to fight for possession of spaces on the outer ring, and to position guards there.  On your turn, you have the option to reveal a trilithon card to try to eliminate a random opponent.  The last person in the game wins.  Alternatively, if the current king is eliminated, the player with the most guards in play wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
