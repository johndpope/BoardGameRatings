							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fraction Fortress</name>
									
			<description>This educational game consists of:&lt;br/&gt;- A game guide&lt;br/&gt;- A spinner marked with the fractions 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8 and 1/10, and 3 &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; spaces&lt;br/&gt;- 76 plastic Fraction Fortress blocks (four circular base blocks, six 1/2 blocks, six 1/3 blocks, twelve 1/4 blocks, ten 1/5 blocks, twelve 1/6 blocks, sixteen 1/8 blocks and ten 1/10 blocks)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a circular base block, which forms the base of their tower.  Players take turns spinning the spinner and taking the corresponding fraction block.  If the spinner points to one of the wild spaces (depicted by pictures of a knight's helmet or a princess), the player may choose any available fraction block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has enough fraction blocks to make up a complete layer of the tower (i.e. the player has fraction blocks that add up to a value of exactly 1), the player adds that layer of blocks to their tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When there are no more fraction blocks to pick up, the player(s) with the most layers in their tower wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
