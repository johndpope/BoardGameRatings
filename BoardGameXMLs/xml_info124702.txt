							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Violentina</name>
									
			<description>A Brazilian indie RPG. First successful crowdfunding roleplaying game in Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How would you like to seat around a table with your friends, to tell a thrilling Tarantinesc-like story? Intense and full of overturns, about crooked mobsters and seductive, but dungerous, femme fatales?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what about, while telling this story, you are seated at the table, just like your characters would. Around a dirty old poker table in a underhanded cassino? Scoundrels, deceivers and crooks with poker chips on their hands, a smelly cigarret at the corner of the mouth, and their live's destiny decided by a deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achou interessante? Ent&amp;atilde;o voc&amp;ecirc; precisa conhecer&amp;hellip; Violentina!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting, huh? So you must play Violentina!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Violentina is a game about violence, vices, voluptuousness and venality, where the players take the role of gamblers, scoundrels, mobsters, femme fatales and corrupt law officers in collaborative game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavily inspired on Tarantino's and Guy Richie movies, Violentina uses a card-based system, also poker chips, to distribute the narrative game control among the players, to bring the particular characteristics from this kind of movies to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In accord with this proposition, Violentina is a narrative game where everyone is the Game Master, no prep, no chronological order of events, based on scene framing and on every player's creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
