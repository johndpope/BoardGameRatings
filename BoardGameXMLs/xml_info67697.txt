							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gates</name>
									
			<description>The Gates is an abstract strategy game for 2 or 4 players. The board features a series of circles connected by color-coded &amp;quot;gate&amp;quot; symbols. Each player has eight plastic tokens; two each of red, yellow, blue, and green. The players maneuver these tokens through patterns of adjacent circles by moving a playing piece through a &amp;quot;gate&amp;quot; of a matching color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to reach the starting circles of the opponent's playing pieces. Players are allowed to enter circles containing enemy pieces of the same color but can be &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot; by enemy pieces of a different color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four players can enjoy the game by working as teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a small 11.5&amp;quot; x 7.5&amp;quot; board, 16 high quality playing pieces, a storage insert, and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
