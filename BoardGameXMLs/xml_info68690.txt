			<description>When a player rolls one of the colours on his square he may take a building peg and place it on the matching colour space. When a square is complete with building pegs the player may take a second square from the pile, place it on top of the completed square and continue building his tower. At the end the player with the tallest tower is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
