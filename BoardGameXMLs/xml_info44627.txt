			<description>Thrown into a world gone mad...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where the dead won&amp;rsquo;t stay dead...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where your best friend can become a murderous cannibal in a matter of minutes and won&amp;rsquo;t stop at anything in her quest to hunt you down and eat you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;your characters must survive the chaotic forces of flesh-eating psychopaths that seek to consume them, and figure out just what the hell is going on - and how they can stop it. To help you, you&amp;rsquo;ll have an arsenal of savage weapons, and maybe some super-special hidden tricks up your sleeves. Better hurry up, though, &amp;rsquo;cause the clock&amp;rsquo;s ticking, and when the stroke falls, all hell will break loose - like it hasn&amp;rsquo;t already!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannibal Contagion is a game of mental stress and violent survival against hordes of supernatural cannibals. The players use high-stakes playing-card battles to determine the outcomes of their actions, with a heavy focus on pure primal narrative and totally badass action. These pages contain a complete role-playing game, with rules detailing character creation, mechanics for resolution of mass-character conflicts, methods for generating your own custom Contagion effects, guides and advice on how to set up and run games, examples of rules in play, and a slew of quick-draw tables to help you jump right in and play without a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice. Read these rules, grab your friends and a deck of playing cards, and get ready for some zombie-murdering survival comedy (and horror!) adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannibal Contagion is a 6x9 book filled with two hundred and six fun-packed pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
