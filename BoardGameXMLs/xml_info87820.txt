			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the only game of deep-sea salvage, this BASIC program allows you to take command of a nautical treasure-hunter.  You start with just $10,000 to buy a Scuba or Diver rig and investigate the shallow seas near port.  If you're lucky, you'll find the Oyster Beds and Spanish Galleons containing pearls and gold necessary to continue your operations.  Upon returning to port, you will be offered cash for your goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game essentially breaks down into three phases.  The first are the make-or-break days on which your initial $10,000 are spent.  You can only hope to make it big enough (generally about $40,000 worth of treasure) to get to the next phase--where you hired a historian and a diver rig for a few weeks.  Then you thoroughly explore your island's coastal waters in the hopes that you can accumulate a few hundred thousand dollars.  With that war chest, you can hire a bell rig with unlimited range and get the million-dollar treasures.  Be warned--it is virtually impossible to get to the third stage, though it can happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An incredibly primitive yet surprisingly addictive game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
