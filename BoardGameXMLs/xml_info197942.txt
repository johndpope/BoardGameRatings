			<description>Shapes the Game is a dexterity game where players take turns playing cards and placing pieces on a central platform. Each player starts out with 8 cards and the object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card corresponds to a plastic piece. Players may play more than one card on their turn as long as the cards are the same color or wild. If a player tries to play too many cards at once, another player might play the Stop Turn card, which will force the player to discard those cards and draw replacement cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, place cards down for the pieces you intend to play, and place the corresponding pieces on top of each card. With one hand, place each piece one at a time onto the central platform. Once you place all of your pieces, draw a card from the deck to end your turn. If any piece falls off of the central platform, your turn ends. For each piece you didn't finish placing, draw a card from the deck. Instead of drawing a card to end your turn, you must steal a card from an opponent as a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
