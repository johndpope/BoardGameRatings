							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chariot: Fantasy Role-Playing in an Age of Miracles</name>
									
			<description>Publisher description&lt;br/&gt;Atlantis nears its fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An empire founded on a dream tears itself apart. Slaves make one last bid for freedom. The precursors of the human race rail against extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You came from this world. Fated to witness the end of the age of miracles, you have the power to make one final difference. You will love and hate for the fate of a world you will not live to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your future lies in the cards. Endings, catastrophe, triumph. Death, the Tower, the Chariot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What wrongs will you right?&lt;br/&gt;Whom will you save?&lt;br/&gt;What will be your legacy?&lt;br/&gt;Where will you stand in the face of the coming wave?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of theosophical myth, outsider art, and the dreams of youth by Howard David Ingham (Promethean: the Created, Vampire: the Requiem and Changeling: the Lost).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this game contains nudity and discussion of adult themes, and is not for minors. Those who are offended by discussion of slavery, prejudice and similar, or those for whom such discussion recalls trauma should approach Chariot with caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
