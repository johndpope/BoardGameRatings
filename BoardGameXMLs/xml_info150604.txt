			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An cooperative adventure game where players explore a map, trying to empower themselves as much as possible before the time runs out and they have to battle the Demon Lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a music player playing instructions, randomized from a play list &amp;ndash; the voice of the captive princess that guides the players (in the right or wrong direction). Instructions include &amp;quot;go west&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;don't go north&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;gain a life&amp;quot; and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a possible traitor mechanism: One of the players might be the demon lord in disguise, which is why players also have to be wary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player decides to fight the Demon Lord, or the random player has selected &amp;quot;place a token on the Demon Castle&amp;quot; three times, at which point the Demon Lord is revealed and the players compare their strengths with the enemy. Most powerful side wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The princess's voice is done by Kurumi Miru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
