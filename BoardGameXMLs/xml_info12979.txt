							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Senlac Hill</name>
									
			<description>In 1066 Saxon King Harold force-marched his army up to York and fought a battle at Stamford Bridge that ended the Viking era in England. He then turned around and force-marched back to the south of England to fight the Normans at Hastings. Unfortunately, after trudging 250 miles in nine days, his soldiers spent the night before the battle singing and drinking instead of resting. Senlac Hill is Norman Smith's nicely done desktop published simulation of the 1066 Battle of Hastings. Emphasis is on disordering the enemy. Good rules covering archers and feigned cavalry attacks. Scenarios include the historical set up with the Saxons waiting on Senlac Ridge and the Normans formed up in the valley below, an alternative scenario that allows the Normans more freedom in deploying their army and one that gives Harold the option of moving down onto the valley floor to force the Normans to fight across boggy ground. One 11.5x16.5 inch game map, 140 counters that have to be mounted and cut-out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
