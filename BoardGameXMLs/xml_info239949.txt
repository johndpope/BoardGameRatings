			<description>This fun and exciting game will delight children.&lt;br/&gt;When it is your turn, roll the dice and press it on the chicken's breast as many times as the number of dice rolls. If nothing happens, it is the next player's turn. When the chicken coop opens and the chicken cackles and lays its egg, the player picks it up, opens it and drops the egg slab from the inside to the table. If it lands so that the egg is visible, the player has bad luck: he wins nothing in this round. If it lands so that the chicken is visible - Congratulations!&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most chickens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
