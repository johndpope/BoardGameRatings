							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hardened Heroes &amp; Fiendish Foes (R.A.R.E. Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Hardened Heroes &amp;amp; Fiendish Foes, a new steam-noir or steam-pulp world of the 1930's. It parallels the real world in thought, but is an adaptation of our own minds. Within this world of steam, gasoline is volatile liquid that is frowned upon as highly explosive. Cars use &amp;quot;steamplug&amp;quot; technology, ships scope water to refill their boilers and aeroplanes harvest clouds for quick refills as well. Think of a world that never went to gasoline, but instead increased their technology level in steam ten-fold. This is the world you will create your character and adventure into. This is a world where Diabolical Maniacs, Mad Doctors, and Underworld Mobsters threaten the very framework of life. If you believe you can fill the shoes of a noir hero, then this steam world is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powered by the Realistic Advanced Roleplaying Engine (RARE System) used by Broken Swords &amp; Battered Shields, this all-in-one book provides a flexible system and an immersive world that allows Narrators and players to dive in without any extra supplementary books.  Combat utilizes a BattleBoard and has optional cards to enhance gameplay.  These are included in the download in digital format for print in any way you desire.  Sample adventure also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
