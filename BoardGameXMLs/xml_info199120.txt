			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a first person shooter where you identify, target and snipe various threats, preferably going for headshots. Across various levels and campaigns you eliminate threats for the military, whilst under the guidance of action star Jason Statham. You can also visit a training range, as well as purchase and upgrade new weapons. Each mission you are fixed to the spot, but are able to look around and zoom in and out with your sniper rifle's scope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
