							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RunePunk: Steam &amp; Shadow</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dark steampunk fantasy like no other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the jewel of a star-spanning empire, the city is now a crumbling macropolis held together by ancient runes and lost technologies fighting against the entropic push of chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is now the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to ScatterPoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the player.&lt;br/&gt;Choose from five races and assign them new racial edges or consider for a moment the exhaustive number of other new edges and hindrances, arcane backgrounds, professional edges, and powers. This immense flexibility means the sky is literally the limit. Will your character have innate armor, weaponry, or perhaps even wings? Will you cast runes, make machines, or summon demons? You decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the game master.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the complete Plot Point campaign, you will discover the many secrets of ScatterPoint and find a cache of adventure generators and indispensable playing aids to allow you to take your players on any kind of journey you can imagine. Even after the included campaign is completed, your adventures are just beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RunePunk is a complete setting officially licensed for Savage Worlds and requires the Savage Worlds roleplaying game to play!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
