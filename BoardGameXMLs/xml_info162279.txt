			<description>The aim of these rules is to simulate combat in the period 1789-1815.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COURSE OF A GAME&lt;br/&gt;Each game is assumed to be one of the following formats&lt;br/&gt;a) Competitive - each player has a force which is balanced using a points system. The game commences with the opposing forces (starting on or off table) and advancing towards each other, with intent to give battle and destroy the opposing force. Starting with initial contacts from patrols and/or vanguards prompting their commanders to respond. The main forces are deployed in attempts to seize and/or maintain the initiative. Finally one force is defeated and the victors may attempt pursuit. The rules are primarily designed around this type of game.&lt;br/&gt;b) Scenario &amp;ndash; each player has a force defined for the scenario which may be based on fictional or historical events. The objectives and victory conditions being defined by the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REPRESENTATIVE SCALES&lt;br/&gt;There are variable ground and troop scales to allow for varying sizes of engagements. So in effect the ground scale will vary from 1:2500 (i.e. 1mm on the table = 2.5m in life) to 1:30,000 (1mm = 30m). However in any game the ground and troop scales are directly proportionate to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken into bounds of varying length. For game purposes these are expressed are periods of minutes. The activity of all troops within any bound is directly related to the time span of the bound. For example a five minute bound allows all troops to complete five minutes of activities. However a 500 minute bound allows all troops five hundred minutes of activities. The reason for the variability is to allow for those periods where little or no activity occurs to be passed over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troops are represented by figurines and or models based on varying size bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
