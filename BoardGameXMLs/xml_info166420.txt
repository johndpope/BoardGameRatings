			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play Savage Worlds, then you know their slogan: &amp;quot;Fast, Furious, and Fun!&amp;quot; And if you play any role-playing game, you know it's all to easy to get stuck generating characters, filling out record sheets and otherwise doing paperwork. Sometimes you just want to sit down and play. Sometimes you need the characters already waiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you need a Cast of Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast of Cards decks offer gamers ready-to-use Savage Worlds NPCs, monsters, and villains, complete with stats and background--you can just shuffle the deck, choose and play. Available for order on dry-erase marker-ready cards, or printable from the PDF you can download today, Cast of Cards decks save you time and effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck offers 17 Extras (NPCs), including game stats and character backgrounds, as well as space to track Wounds in case you upgrade the Extra to a Wild Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Cast of Cards: Cult of the Living Ice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the uttermost north is a land of ice and snow. Travellers there may find a freezing death waiting for them, or they may find a cult devoted to an arcane formation of living ice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
