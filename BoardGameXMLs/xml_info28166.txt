							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Popeye Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of this card game, based on the Robert Altman film, changes from winning the most rounds you can in the High Game to losing the most rounds you can in the Low Game. The Dealer always decides on a High or Low Game depending on the value of the cards he holds in his hands. You are awarded points after each game is played only if you have won or lost a specific number of rounds. Capture the one and only Spinach Card and you will win a point for it alone. The first player to score 10 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 40 playing cards divided into 4 color-coded and character-themed suits numbered 1-10: Red Olive Oyl, Blue Swee' Pea, Purple Bluto and Yellow Popeye along with 1 Spinach card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-winded rules that basically boils down to a slightly more extensive version of 'war'. Players lay down cards, highest value card within a suit wins, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
