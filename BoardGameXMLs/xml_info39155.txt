			<description>HardBall Wars is the &amp;ldquo;brother&amp;rdquo; to our football game, GridIron Wars. While I was designing GridIron Wars, an idea popped into my head&lt;br/&gt;regarding a similar method to resolve a baseball game. After putting the idea to paper and mailing it to a couple of trusted friends,&lt;br/&gt;HardBall Wars was born. HardBall Wars is simple enough for a child to learn, but robust enough to satisfy even the most veteran of baseball gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many may wonder, why a baseball game? Aren&amp;rsquo;t there plenty of good ones already on the market? In short, the answer is yes. There are many&lt;br/&gt;fantastic baseball games on the market. With HardBall Wars, I&amp;rsquo;m really not re-inventing the wheel. You&amp;rsquo;ll never hear me tout the game as&lt;br/&gt;better or more realistic than any other game currently on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, having said that, I do feel like this game stands up well against any other baseball game in terms of what is truly most important,&lt;br/&gt;the &amp;ldquo;fun factor&amp;rdquo;. My testers and I have had an absolute blast playing the game. The unique batter-pitcher interface, combined with the X-&lt;br/&gt;Factor deck, makes the game unique and in my humble opinion very fun to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My philosophy with Downey Games has always been to price games as low as possible, making the games accessible to all. Most current baseball&lt;br/&gt;board games sell in the $50-$60 range. While that is reasonable to most, it does make it an expensive proposition to purchase multiple&lt;br/&gt;seasons or teams. With HardBall Wars, I&amp;rsquo;ve purposely designed the game with a cost factor in mind. For that same $50 or $60 you&amp;rsquo;ll be able&lt;br/&gt;to purchase multiple seasons of HardBall Wars. Also unlike other games, we strive to rate nearly every player who stepped foot on the field&lt;br/&gt;of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HardBall Wars is based upon a modified log5 method. That may not mean much to some, but using this method allows the pitcher and batter to&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Interact&amp;quot; on every at-bat. Rather than a 50/50 model or a generic pitcher grade, with HardBall Wars you'll see the difference between&lt;br/&gt;pitchers and batters and their impact on the at-bat in a very visual way. You'll also immediately see the difference in righty/lefty&lt;br/&gt;matchups at the plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fielding is not neglected in HardBall Wars. You'll see the difference between the gold glove shortstop and the lead gloved fielder not only&lt;br/&gt;in terms of errors committed but also the ability to turn hits into outs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most unique aspect of HardBall Wars is our introduction of the X-Factor Deck. And often times it can generate a lot of excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the X-Factor deck just about anything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in a baseball game can take place. From run downs, appeals, dropped third&lt;br/&gt;strikes, rain delays, rain outs, ejections, brawls to even the extremely bizarre like the now famous Pine Tar incident&amp;mdash;all are possible&lt;br/&gt;within the X-Factor Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is far more than just a Rare Play mechanism. There are many conditional events within the deck and even some very mundane plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-Factor deck simulates the events that happen in real life that as a tabletop gamer you don&amp;rsquo;t often see in your own gaming. One can see&lt;br/&gt;something out of the ordinary in almost every baseball game in real life. And we have brought that to the tabletop through the use of the X&lt;br/&gt;-Factor Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With HardBall Wars, the decisions as a manager are all yours. You decide when to steal bases. You decide when to Hit and Run or Sacrifice&lt;br/&gt;the runner to the next base. You'll make the call when to intentionally walk the opposition&amp;rsquo;s slugger, or when to bring the infield in to&lt;br/&gt;cut down a runner at the plate. You'll make the call as when to attempt a squeeze bunt or play for the big inning. You'll make the call to&lt;br/&gt;bring in the lefty specialist to face the opposing left hand slugger, or stick with your right hand throwing starter. With HardBall Wars, you&lt;br/&gt;may even be ejected from the game! Nearly every situation that faces a major league skipper is replicated in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The printed game features game charts printed in full-color, the season of your choice, 3 dice, a die-cut X-Factor deck also printed in full color, score sheets all packaged in a sturdy game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
