							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pog Word Builder Game</name>
									
			<description>Pogs are small cardboard disks with a variety of designs on them; they were popular in the early 90's. In the original game of Pogs, players would gamble Pogs from their own collection in an attempt to expand their collection further. Players would stack Pogs face down in a stack and throw a 'Kini' (a hard plastic disk, sometimes referred to as a 'Slammer') from above in an attempt to turn the Pogs over and claim them for their collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pog word builder combines the classic action of Pog with the challenging gameplay of Scrabble. Use 1 letter and 2 letter Pogs to build the biggest words possible. Pog's are obtained in the same way as the original game, by by trying to turn over a stack of Pogs containing unknown letters. The player who builds the most words wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the emphasis of Pog word builder is on the number of words, rather than the length or the quality of words, the game is easily accessible to young players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
