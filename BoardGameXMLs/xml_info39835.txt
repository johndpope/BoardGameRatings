			<description>Wings at War  is a series of wargame rules for recreating air combat using Vapour Trails 1/600th scale aircraft models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each set of rules is for a specific conflict, with games designed to last around one or two hours. As the sky tends to be a lot less cluttered than the ground, games can be set up quickly and fewer models are needed  -  making for a cheaper night out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any number of people can play. As the victory target is dependant on the size of a force, opposing side's don't have to be equally balanced, a smaller or less sophisticated mix of planes can defeat a larger or more advanced enemy by reaching their (lower) victory target first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
