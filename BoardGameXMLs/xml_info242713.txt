			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of items that could be found by players on a farm. The items range from small to rather large, including farm machinery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These may also be found by players in locations that supply farms. They may be used to decorate a location, or be a potential source of loot. Many pieces of farm equipment are quite lethal in nature, and some could easily kill slow-moving zombies. Others are more likely to be clutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every item will be found on the same farm; livestock farms are less likely to have crop equipment, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;44. Grain Truck (Lorry with a large rear tipper compartment for transporting harvested grains)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
