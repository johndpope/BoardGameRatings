							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">micropul dynamo</name>
									
			<description>In this dice-laying game players are scientists trying to harvest precious micropul matter from an energy core; while using their dynamo dice to claim territory and to affect the playable dice in each other's hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of dice they must play optimally to keep a flow of new dice coming in and if possible keep aside some dice in a supply stack that will be worth more points at the end of the game. Drawing new dice is done by activating catalysts in the dice playing area. Dynamo dice can be used to alter the dice-tile faces showing in a players hand and their opponent's hand, resulting in additional strategies and adds a strong adversarial component to game. During the game, groups of micropul of the same color will get formed. These groups can be claimed using dynamo dice and will be worth a lot of points if they are closed at the end of the game; however, the special power of that dynamo in the new dynamo action is sacrificed as a claim is made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based upon micropul, but uses dice instead of tiles and has an additional action (making it more adversarial) and adjustments to hand size and core size to take the dynamo effects into account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or competitively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
