			<description>Space Dreadnought 3000 is a fast play game in which military and economic conflicts are fought out and decided through strategic skill and daring. Battlefleets leap across light years to compete for control of strategic stars and star-clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 48-page rules booklet.  Counters are provided for play without miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are designed for use with Kallistra's Space Dreadnought 3000 1/3000 scale starships and 1/600 scale fighters, but spaceship models from any manufacturer may be substituted. A model represents one ship or a large number of fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6ft x 4ft table is required if using miniatures or 3.5ft x 2.5ft table if using counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included for playing Tactical, Strategic and Campaign Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TACTICAL GAME is played for 10 turns.  Each turn is composed of the following steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Secretly write movement orders &lt;br/&gt;  2. Simultaneously execute movement orders&lt;br/&gt;  3. Secretly write combat orders &lt;br/&gt;  4. Resolve combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships are grouped into fleets which move together between a dozen or so giant hexes representing a star system. The hexes are positioned in any of ten recommended configurations.  The hexes are not arranged in a hex grid, but rather form paths or rings.   Fleets unable to trace an uncontested path to a supply planet hex are at an extreme disadvantage in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aggressive movement plots can have dire consequences; fleets plotted to move THROUGH hexes occupied by a NON-MOVING enemy fleet are summarily destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposing fleets in the same hex battle.  There is no movement during battle. Players simply roll a twelve sided die for each attacking ship and reference the ship's offensive table.  The result is compared to the target's defenses. Combat may last several rounds until one side is destroyed or withdraws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 10 turns, the player with the greatest point value for all surviving ships is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STRATEGIC GAME includes a couple scenarios played out using tactical rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CAMPAIGN GAME is played on an area map for which players fight for supremacy. Each area represents a star system.  Players may build naval bases. Conflict is resolved by playing a tactical game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules include supply ships, command and control, alliances, team-play and multi-force campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
