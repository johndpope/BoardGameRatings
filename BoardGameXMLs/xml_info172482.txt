							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadow Sun</name>
									
			<description>Enter a world that has felt an alien touch upon its sun. An ever-increasing shadow that creeps across the sun's brilliant face, with consequences that are only now becoming horrifically apparent. The city of Shar, once capital of a mighty empire that covered the continent, still remains the most powerful of the city-states of the ancient South. With its huge defensive stone walls that have withstood attacks for over a thousand years, its lofty towers and elaborately-constructed domes capped in gold, and massive ziggurat temple at its center upon which godly sacrifices are performed, the metropolis stands as an oasis amidst the hot desert of the Singing Sands. Yet all is not well in the Golden City, for a plague has come to Shar. A plague so deadly the Sharians name it Aya's Wrath - a curse from their god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shadow Sun is a dark, heroic fantasy RPG that combines the classic adventure of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, the fear of otherworldly horrors of H.P. Lovecraft, and the grim sword and sorcery of Conan the Barbarian. Rendered in full 3D graphics using the Unity engine, the game offers a deep, single-player role-playing experience with a gripping story, important player choices, dynamic NPC dialogues, and multiple ways of solving quests. Do battle against the strange creatures native to Shar and unspeakable horrors not of this world in real-time, visceral combat like The Witcher 2, using a dozen different weapon types, special melee attacks, powerful magical spells, and deadly traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A premium, full 3D Western RPG with a story filled with complex characters, intrigue, danger, and shocking surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A 10-hour adventure where you delve into the decadent imperial city of Shar and the exotic desert lands around it, as the Golden City languishes in the grip of a plague and simmers in defiance against the kingdoms of the North.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Gorgeous graphics using the Unity engine, including normal/specular mapping and dynamic lighting on the characters, as well as anti-aliasing and bloom.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Create your own male or female character and customize them with different appearances and over a dozen types of armour.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Choose from among 30 skills to suit your play style and grow those abilities exactly how you want as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Ally with one of four companions to adventure alongside you, each with their own personality, abilities, and romance options, and gain their approval or disapproval on your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Adopt a faithful dog companion to fight by your side.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A useful journal and detailed codex help you keep track of quests and the people, places, and things you encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Explore over 70 finely crafted areas and uncover 200+ unique items, hidden secrets, and ancient treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A striking and compelling orchestral music score by long-time Ossian composer, David John.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Includes Apple Game Center support.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A universal app for iPhone (3GS and up), iPod touch (3rd gen and up), and iPad (1st gen and up), with Retina display support.
