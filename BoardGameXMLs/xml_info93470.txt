			<description>In EndBreaker! SCG: Build &amp;amp; Break, a deck-building and card-selecting game, you are a leader of a brigade of EndBreakers, those who can gaze into the eyes of others and see their ending in a scene from that person's new future, with critical implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is set in Lanceburg, one of the city states of the world of EndBreakers, a world threatened by the Masquerades: those possessed by a mysterious power, the Thorns. You recruit party-members (Job cards) in the tavern, learn powerful skills (Ability cards), clear missions (Scenario cards) and battle against monstrous evils (Masquerade cards). You earn victory points (Dalc cards) by clearing scenarios or winning battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Masquerade cards are revealed one by one during game play, and each player must fight this monster, earning VP according to how well they do. After three battles are resolved, the game ends and the player with the most VPs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
