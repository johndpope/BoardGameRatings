			<description>&amp;quot;CATCH THE CROOK WHEN HE POPS&lt;br/&gt;BE THE QUICKEST OF THE COPS&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All eyes are on the Crook ... when will he pop?  ZOOM!  There he goes ... everyone grabs for him!  Sharp eyes with quick reflexes are needed here.  Catch the Crook when he pops then you can move your Cop along the board toward the Crook's Hideout.  Be careful though, you must finish your move before he pops again.  If you don't ... back you go!  The first player to reach the Crook's Hideout wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A plastic figure about 5&amp;quot; high representing the crook is attached to a suction-loaded spring device and placed in the center of the colorful gameboard after being 'set'.  Players may roll the die as many times as they wish on their turn, but if the suction device releases before the player has declared their move finished no rolls for that turn count.  Whoever catches the plastic crook has the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move their plastic 'cop' along the game path from the Jail house to the Crook's Hideout is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
