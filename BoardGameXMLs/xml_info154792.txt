							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume II, and its successors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 14 mythic spells, from antipathy to bear&amp;rsquo;s endurance, mass. With the spells in this book you can use mythic astral projection to not only visit other planes, but also visit the minds of other sentient creatures. Or you can use mythic atonement to instill a pseudo-conscience in the target, making it difficult for him to remain his current alignment, even if he is unwilling. Try a mythic banishment that prevents the banished creature from returning for a certain amount of time, or expend your bear&amp;rsquo;s endurance early to achieve an automatic natural 20 on a single Constitution-based roll, among lots of other exciting spells. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait: get your hands on the latest mythic spells now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
