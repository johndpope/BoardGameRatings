			<description>Players receive a number of cards with 8 spaces on them, each containing a Biblical name or reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leader takes the smaller cards one at a time, and reads the question on them.  Players shout if they have the right answer on their scoring card, and the right answer is checked.  If they are correct, the question card is placed on their scoring card; if incorrect, then the player with the correct answer may take the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win when one of their scoring cards is full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
