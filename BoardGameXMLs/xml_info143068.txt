			<description>Mini Motor Racing is an Isometric Arcade Style Racing Game developed by The Binary Mill for the iOS and Android platforms. It was released on the iTunes App Store on December 8, 2011, and on the Google Play Network on May 11. The game features vehicle, race and environment physics, vehicle upgrades, day and night tracks, single player career, quick race and multiplayer modes along with Game Center leaderboards and achievements. Mini Motor Racing also uses Apple's iCloud to store and sync progress across iOS 5 devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini Motor racing is an arcade-style racer with strong emphasis on fun over realism. Rather than controlling acceleration and braking, the user must instead master powerslides and timely nitrous boosts to succeed. Cars regularly crash into the environment and each other, but there is no vehicle damage, only a time penalty. The game uses a modified version of the Unity physics engine to model these collisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing first, second, or third in a race nets the player cash rewards, which can be supplemented through in-game cash power ups. This money is used to unlock additional vehicles and tracks, or to upgrade existing vehicles when playing career mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses HD graphics, and while the game is set in an isometric view, the cars and tracks are full 3D models. Several control schemes are available for the user's selection, though physical controls such as those on the Sony Xperia Play are not supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini Motor Racing uses Apple's Game Center platform for social play, featuring competitive per-track leaderboards and achievements. Multiplayer gameplay is supported through WiFi and Bluetooth, allowing for up to 4 players in WiFi and 2 players through Blutooth connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mini Motor Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
