			<description>Clang! is a combat card game for 2 to 5 players, with great artwork, simple rules, and an easy, numberless game system - ideal for the casual gamer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PREPARE FOR WAR!&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Core Army Pack are two unique armies, the Army of King Henry Oakenheart (blue), and the army of Emperor Maximillian Ravenclaw (red).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card represents a troop of knights and men-at-arms, showing a picture of their commander, with two sets of markings - their battle attacks at the sides, and the peacemaking skills of their commander at the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For both of these, the bigger the bar the better! Large bars beat medium bars, beat small bars, beat no bars at all! The same goes for red bars, but red bars always beat white bars, no matter what size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To battle each player draws four cards and places three cards face down in a row with the long side (side) facing the other player, who then does the same. Turn over troops a pair at a time and compare the combat bars to find out who wins each battle.  Loser places their card face down and the winner places theirs face up. The player with the most face up cards wins and collects all face up troop cards (including the other players surviving troops who have changed sides) and puts them in their army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To have peace talks each player places three of their four cards face down in a row with the short side (top) of each card facing the other player and announces which skill is being challenged. Turn over troops a pair at a time and compare the combat bars of the chosen skill to find out wins each peace talk. Loser places their card face down and the winner places theirs face up. The player with the most face up cards wins and collects all of their face up troop cards along with all face down troop cards of their opponent and puts them in their army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your opponent no longer has any troops (no more cards), they are defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Clang! gamebox Poker Tuck Box (54 cards)&lt;br/&gt;Army of Emperor Maximillian Ravenclaw Deck (1 deck of 25 cards)&lt;br/&gt;Army of King Henry Oakenheart Deck (1 deck of 25 cards)&lt;br/&gt;Poker Deck Instructions Deck (1 deck of 2 cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
