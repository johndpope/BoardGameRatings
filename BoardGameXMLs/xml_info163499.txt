			<description>Spot it! Match &amp;amp; Learn consists of two Spot it! games: Spot it! Numbers &amp;amp; Shapes and Spot it! Alphabet. Both games feature similar gameplay, with players trying to spot matches as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in Spot it! Numbers &amp;amp; Shapes features six different symbols, with their sizes varying from one card to another. Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. To play, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has collected the most cards when the deck runs out wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spot it! Alphabet plays similarly, but each card has eight items on it, thus making for a larger deck (55 cards vs. 31 cards) and more challenging play suitable for older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the base game, two additional games &amp;ndash; each an observation game with a speed element &amp;ndash; are included for each deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
