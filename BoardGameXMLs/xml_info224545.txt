			<description>Butchers vs Orcs! is a two player roll and move game.  The theme of the game is based on in-character rivalry between the Butchers Guild and the Imperial Orcs within the Live-Role Playing world of Empire by Profound Decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to move their pieces (representing the Butchers and the Orcs respectively) in opposite directions along a track on the board, trying to get their own pieces from their opponent's base to the safety of their own base. Pieces are moved and taken if landed upon in a similar way to backgammon, however two key enhancements give it more depth than classic backgammon. Firstly, the middle section of the track is a dangerous no-man's-land where pieces cannot protect each other, forcing players to judge when best to risk making a run for it.  Secondly, each player has a leader which is at greater risk than other pieces, encouraging players to play tactically to protect their leaders and get them to safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
