			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sangokushi Sousouden is the fifth title in the Eiketsuden spinoff series based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms strategy games. Cao Cao is the protagonist of the game, which is a twist from his typical portrayal as a villain in media based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is given control of Cao Cao and his forces and officers from the time of the Yellow Turban rebellion until the eventual unification of China. There are a large number of officers that can be deployed in battles, each with unique abilities and attributes. All officers have a unit class that determines their general strengths and weaknesses. Similarly to Sangokushi Koumeiden, every action that the player takes impacts the path that the story will take. There are two primary plot threads &amp;ndash; one follows history closely, while the other has a more fictional bent. Cao Cao&amp;rsquo;s personality will change based on which thread is followed. This title has more stages than any previous game in the series, with over 60 chapters available to be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
