			<description>From the front page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;Three years ago, Zelgar Lightborn&amp;rsquo;s brother left the town of Silvergrail on a grand adventure and was cursed with lycanthropy. Now he&amp;rsquo;s returned, along with the rest of his pack. A Living Forgotten Realms adapted adventure set in the Moonshae Isles for Adventure Level 6 (character levels 3-9). At least one person at the table (either a player or the DM) must have an active subscription to D&amp;amp;D Insider. We recommend that you allow at least six hours of playing time to complete this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must have a legal copy of the published adventure to use this document. &amp;ldquo;Leader of the Pack&amp;rdquo; is found in Issue 194 of Dungeon online, part of D&amp;amp;D Insider. Dungeon issues may be found on the Wizards of the Coast website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://wizards.com/dnd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://wizards.com/dnd&lt;/a&gt;). This adaptation document does not present adjusted stat blocks for low/high tier; the DM is expected to use the stat blocks from the published adventure and adjust as needed. Any LFR-legal AL 6 table may play this adventure, but bear in mind that the stat blocks in the adventure were written for a party of level 4-6 characters. Tables at the low end of the level band might find this adventure very difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
