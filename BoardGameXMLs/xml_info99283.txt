			<description>&amp;quot;An exciting, fast moving game of travel&amp;quot; - from box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for players to travel on the gameboard to the locations shown on their shopping lists. The first player to return to their residence with the travel cards for all locations contained on their shopping list wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with $2000 and get 10x the dice roll in money when they visit the bank initially (which has to be done first). To get the travel cards, players need to pay 10x the dice roll on the turn that they visit that location. Players can visit the bank later in the game, but not until they run out of money. Players get 10x their die roll and need to pay back what they owe with 10% interest. Players can choose to stay at the bank and roll for one additional turn and collect 10x what their roll is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
