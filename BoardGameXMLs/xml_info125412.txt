			<description>Based on rules published by MindSports.nl:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mephisto is a puzzle game played by virtually any number of players. It requires a double-six domino set, five uniquely distinguishable pawns, five corresponding dice, and a one-minute timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing area is made by laying all twenty-eight dominoes face up into rectangle of 7x8 squares. Other than the double-blank, no blanks can touch the edge of another blank. Pawns are set on any five of the blanks, dice are rolled, and the timer is flipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players examine the board and call out bids. When the timer ends, the high bidder must move the pawns to spaces with a sum that meets the bid. (There is also a special bid for landing all five pawns on matching spaces.) Meeting the bid wins the stake. (The publisher suggests candy or beer, but scoring one point would suffice.) Failure pays an equal stake to every opponent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pawns move orthogonally the number of spaces indicated by their corresponding die. They are not allowed to cross the same space twice nor any occupied space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
