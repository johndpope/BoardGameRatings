			<description>German cycling game from the late 1920s published by a company from Leipzig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six riders in the game, divided into two teams. Three of the riders (black, red and yellow) have a special lap counter in their back wheel. These riders are moved with the three coloured dice on the outer lane (with roman numerals) and try to win a lap over their competitors. The game rules calls them &amp;quot;Tempofahrer&amp;quot;, which might be translated as &amp;quot;endurance riders&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three other riders are sprinters. They race each other on the inner lane at given intervals and compete just for some points which count only in case of a tie in the number of laps won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are the three coloured dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three dice are thrown in turns and the riders in the outer lane advance as many fields as dice mark their colour or their teammate's (three-coloured dice would have been enough and probably better). However, if in a turn none of the dice shows your colour(s), you fall back to the red square with no lap won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you hope for a long run of throws with at least one of your colours to win a lap. And most often than not you get a bad throw when you have completed more than three quarters of a lap and you are very near your objective. That hurts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the sprinters wait their turn to play. At intervals (the rules are not particularly precise here) the coloured dice are put aside, the riders on the outer lane stay wherever they are, and a short sprint takes place between the three riders on the inner lane. No complicated rules here either, just throw and move, with a couple of penalty squares (2 -only reachable by a double one on the first throw- and 13). Teams whose sprinters land twice on these squares during the game (in different sprints, most probably) are penalized with one lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules state that some player or onlooker can call a sprint anytime during the game for a special price he is willing to offer (a present for the winner of that sprint). Just like the &amp;quot;primes&amp;quot; in 6-day races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose rider(s) perform best during the race by crossing the finish line first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
