			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filbar Friday introduces the Theocracy of Wagovia! The country in the western lands is ruled by clerics of the Goddess of Destruction and Rewards. The four armed deity is the &amp;ldquo;law of the land&amp;rdquo; and those failing to follow the tenants of the religion often find themselves removed from society. This offering is more of a supplement spelling out the theocracy as opposed to actual adventures. While humanoids and &amp;ldquo;monsters&amp;rdquo; are present in different sections of the lush land the main opposition comes from two different human sects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gorian Syndicate is a group of freedom fighters from the land to the east that was conquered and destroyed by the Wagovian fighters. These people are mostly magic users and are seeking vengeance. The same can be said for the other group, Cult of the Elementalists. This religious sect are the sworn enemies of Wagovia and are not allowed to openly practice their religion. These are the main protagonist groups that players will face in the TW series!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for any number of adventurers of different levels and a DM.  This reference guide is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
