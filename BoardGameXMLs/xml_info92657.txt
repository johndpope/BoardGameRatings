			<description>Translated from the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Espada da Gal&amp;aacute;xia tries to be a middle ground between hard sci-fi and Fantasy sci-fi. Yes, we have aliens denser than steel, but only because there is no water on their bodies - only pure metal. Yes, we have alive robots, but they are in fact intelligent crustaceans that have substituted their shells for mechanical bodies. Yes,we have swords of indestructible metal, but that's because they are made of metallic hydrogen - an hypothetical material that would be the densest known substance, found on the nucleus of Jupiter and Saturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Espada da Gal&amp;aacute;xia is a web published supplement based on the novel Espada da Gal&amp;aacute;xia by Marcelo Cassaro, it was released for free on the website by the author after a long series of problems with the publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
