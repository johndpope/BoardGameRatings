			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody knows the kind of place.  Everybody has heard of it.  A place of retreat for the most vulnerable, where they can have peace of mind and physical security - instead of fear and constant, angry reprimands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orphanage of Harlott Grove was such a place - &amp;quot;Alice Feldman's Home of Orphans&amp;quot;.  There was always room for one more.  Always.  Alice Feldman always made sure that all the children immediately felt comfortable - that they felt at home.  She lived for it.  A loving, motherly, caring old lady.  The only goal in her life was to make sure &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; orphans got the best possible life.  Outwardly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her love knew no limits. Literally. And thus it was that early in the morning on a spring day in the late 1950s they came to close down the orphanage.  They removed the children and then tried to burn the orphanage.  Maybe there was something else they were trying to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah yes, sometimes &amp;quot;evil incarnate&amp;quot; can assume such an innocent form...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
