			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a set of 12 additional scenarios for The Road Not Taken. You may choose to run them with The Road Not Taken, giving everyone a chance to be the main character more than once, or to intersperse them with the other scenarios, allowing people to max and match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Road Not Taken is an experimental LARP of decisions and emotions. In it, each player will have the opportunity to take the spotlight in a scene and make a tough decision. The game can handle 6-12 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenes in The Road Not Taken are not continuous. There is no continuity of plot or character for each scene. Before each scene, the players will get new characters specific to that scene. Think of the game as 6-12 mini LARPs each lasting about 10 minutes, but building to a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each scene, one player will be in the spotlight, the one making the decision. The other players play voices, the inner voices that guide us all when we make decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
