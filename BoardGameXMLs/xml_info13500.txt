							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman Forever: Audio Game</name>
									
			<description>This game uses an audio tape to instruct and guide the players through the game. The game board has two sides for two different scenarios. Side A of the tape is used for the Gotham City side of the board. Side B is used for the Claw Island scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Pre-Battle Phase, you draw cards, take cards and give cards to other players as instructed by the tape. You may also flip the Battle Coin to determine if you win or lose cards. During the Battle Phase, the tape will tell you when to put Thug cards and Two-Face and The Riddler face down onto the board. When you control Batman and Robin, you will turn over cards one at a time. If you defeat the villain, you turn over another card and continue to battle. If you lose, you pass Batman and Robin to the next player. The first player to defeat Two-Face wins the Gotham City scenario. The first player to turn over (rescue) the Dr. Chase Meridian and Robin cards wins the Claw Island scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
