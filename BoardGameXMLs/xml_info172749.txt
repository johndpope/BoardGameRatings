			<description>How I got to the E.R is a party game that has no room for a solid plan and keeps the creative juices flowing, but thats what ultimately makes the game great! With the lack of time to create your story, what comes out is normally weird, sometimes creepy, and usually hilarious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY: Each player is dealt three unique cards and attempts to tell the best story they can within one minute. Once their time is up, it's up to the other players to judge how entertaining the story really was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
