			<description>BOOOO-OPOLY! It's Creepy! It's Ghoulish! It's a Scream! Boooo-opoly is a classic property trading game made for celebrating Halloween. Players buy favorite Halloween properties, collect Haunted Houses and trade them in for Full Moons. Sounds easy enough, but add Fright Fees, Bats in your Belfry, or get caught soaping windows and it becomes a little more difficult and a lot more fun! You may win the Jack-o-lantern carving contest or eating Slimy Spider Tacos at the Monster Mash! Whatever happens, it's going to be frighteningly fun! For 2 to 6 players, ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
