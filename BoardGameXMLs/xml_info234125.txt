			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost World Lunch is a quick-play card game for 2-6 players. Each player takes on the role of a Dinosaur (the deck has three carnivores and three herbivores). Your goal as the Dinosaur is to get as many Victory Points as possible by Biting, Clawing, Stomping, and Smashing the pesky, trophy-seeking Victorian Hunters as they sip their tea and eat their lunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game takes about 15-20 minutes to play. Each player is dealt three Hunters that they are racing against their opponents to complete. You complete a Hunter by matching (in order) all of the symbols on the Hunter&amp;rsquo;s card with your Attack cards, while trying to use the best Victory Point card on each Hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Hunter is also looking to catch a specific Dinosaur (that upper left hand corner image of the Dinosaur on Sergei&amp;rsquo;s card). If a player completes a Hunter that was looking to catch them, they earn double points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But watch out! There are special cards that allow your opponent to steal your Attack Cards or even swap your Hunter with theirs (getting all the associated Victory Points as well)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Play and Simple Play (for young kids) As there are three Carnivores and three Herbivores in the deck, players can split into two teams and compete together, rather than playing a free-for-all. Also, if you ignore the VP and specials, you can use the game as a simple color/symbol matching game with younger children&amp;ndash;work them up to Victory Points after they learn math skills and finally teach them the Special Rules when they have mastered Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
