			<description>[User Submission]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardball 6 is the last major release of the HardBall baseball simulator series, which started back in 1985 on various platforms of the time. It is the first game from this series to implement 3Dfx technology for the sprite rendering. HardBall 6, as with all the other games of the series, is a fully licensed product, so players of game have access to real team and player names, as well as an impressive selection of statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New commentary is provided by Greg Pap. Game modes include Dynasty Play, Interleague Play and Consecutive Season Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also supports several modes for network multiplayer, although the technology used for these is point-to-point, and no game servers are provided by the developers or publishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
