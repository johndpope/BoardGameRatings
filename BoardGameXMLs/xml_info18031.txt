			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Albert's and Boris's job is tiling bathrooms. Albert likes tiles which form circles, Boris instead prefers squares. Whenever they worked together they spent more time arguing than working. One time, two palettes of tiles were destroyed (one forming circles and one with squares), so something had to change. Since that day, Albert and Boris use only tiles which can be used to form circles and squares as well and they play 'Turnio' while they work.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turnio is a tactical game for two players Ages 10 and up. The chips show on two or four corners quarters of circles or squares. Each player chooses one of these symbols. The players try to place or turn the chips in a way that completes their symbols. Two quarters of the same symbol placed side by side are called a pair. Quarters which touch only at the corner, i.e. which are placed diagonally are by definition not a pair. For each pair completed, the player gains one point. That means a half of a symbol is worth one point, three-quarters two points and a complete symbol gives four points. The player who has collected more points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
