							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brinchie</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brinchie: an often misunderstood race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many think these folk are demons simply because they come from Norcan Darr and must be some different sort of Childer, right? Wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, yes, they might have come from Norcan Darr, but they&amp;rsquo;ve been a staunch ally in the wars against Darkness and Flame. Welcome to the Guidebook for the Brinchie, an oft misunderstood race of feline humanoids found in Shaintar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come with us as we delve into their society, their secrets and lay bare the fabled Crescent Warriors, an enigmatic shadow society of the brinchie steeped in tradition and honor. In this guidebook we&amp;rsquo;ll introduce more information on their martial art Kalinata, and sprinkle in some new Edges, adding even more dimension and skill to your brinchie characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We even take a look at some of the more obscure settlements of the brinchie, as well as revealing more of their personal history; much of their tradition has been lost as they have integrated into the overall society and cultures of Shaintar. Welcome, keep your fur safe and your claws to yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
