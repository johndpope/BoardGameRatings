			<description>War of Cakes is a competitive game where you will face other players in a pastry aggressive competition. During the game you have to build pies with ingredients and recipes that you get during the game, but beware! the other participants can ruin your creations. Nata, dynamite, chocolate or barbed wire are just some of the ingredients that we use to achieve first place in the contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of Cakes it is a turn-based game. It is a card game consisting of a deck of ingredients and other recipes. On each turn the player may draw cards and put recipes you want to build. Each player has their own cakes, but the recipes can be placed on any cake. First put the recipe and then you are adding ingredients, turn by turn. Every player is required to use an ingredient in their turn (whenever possible). An ingredient can be used on their own or others recipes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, to put a piece of cake in a cake we need to take several steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Put the recipe under construction.&lt;br/&gt;2) Adding the necessary ingredients&lt;br/&gt;3) Put the cake recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are not used dice or the like. The strategy is that players are required to use at least one ingredient per shift. And if not well managed, it can finish putting on good ingredients good recipes from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This makes it a semi-cooperative game. There are also recipes for cakes remaining points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
