Far from a book full of boring flaming swords, this manual has selected to present many exotic and unorthodox treasures enchanted by the most unusual sources!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    50 Painstakingly analyzed magical items with not only rich and flavourful descriptions and histories but also divinely inspired technical balance.&lt;br/&gt;    16 amusing illustrations of some of the best treasures to tantalize those adventurers brave enough to seek them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written foreward and asides from Mallavray himself.&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for any Pathfinder scenario or campaign, these items can add enormous flavour tactical options as well as many opportunities to come up with side adventures involving these items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
