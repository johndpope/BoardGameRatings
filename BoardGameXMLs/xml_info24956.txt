			<description>From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funny Frogs are standing in the pond.  Take a good look at what color legs they have because when the frogs are pressed down their legs will disappear.  Then you'll need to use your memory to guess the color of each frogs' legs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn move the boy around the pond.  Turn the boy so that the color of his cap is turned to match the color of your guess.  Now press him down and see if you're right!  When you guess correctly the frog will leap out and you get to keep him.  If you're wrong, remember what color you picked so that next time you don't pick the same color again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect four different color frogs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though Ravenburger re-used the art from Leapin' Lily Pads for this game, they are separate games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
