			<description>The players have to move their three pawns (one black, one red, one gold) from the starting spaces, marked with their letters (A-H) to the coat of arms in the center of the game board. Movement is determined by a die. Numbered spaces hinder or benefit the players. If a pawn reaches a space with an opponent pawn on it, the later has to go back to the space, the other pawn has come from. After completing a circle around the game board, the pawns advance to the inner circle and lastly the coat of arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was likely published about 1930.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
