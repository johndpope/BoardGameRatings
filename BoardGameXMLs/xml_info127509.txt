			<description>From the cassette inlay (ZX Spectrum Edition)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defend the castle against dragons, collect the gold, rescue the apprentices, AND take the latest YOPS course...SORCERY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3D ARCADE ACTION with MAGICAL ANIMATION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gandalf the Sorcerer was initially written by Frank Cecere and published by Tymac Software for the Commodore 64. It was subsequently converted to the ZX Spectrum by Software Conversions Ltd and renamed Sodov the Sorcerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The user plays the Sorcerer behind the walls of his castle, which is under siege by dragons. You control a cursor and if you get it on top of a dragon and press fire, your magic will turn the dragon into gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you fail to shoot the dragons, then they will slowly attempt to open your portcullis and if successful will invade your castle and steal one of your three apprentices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your magical power is reduced every time you fire, but can be replenished by going to the top of one of two towers on either side of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to collect the gold, you have to allow one of your apprentices to be captured. At this point the perspective switches to see more of the field outside the castle. In this mode, the cursor lays mines, the object of which is to destroy the dragon holding your apprentice. While doing so, the sorcerer has the opportunity to run around collecting the gold, but is vulnerable to the fiery breath of the dragons. Getting flamb&amp;eacute;ed by the dragons, or losing three apprentices results in Game Over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect enough gold, and you move to another level with even more aggressive enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
