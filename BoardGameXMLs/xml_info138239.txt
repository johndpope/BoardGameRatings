							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blockers! 2 in 1 Schnupperspiel</name>
									
			<description>From Spiel 2011, a sample version of Blockers!, packaged with Zatre 2 in 1 Schnupperspiel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version plays 2-3, unlike the full-size version, which plays 2-5. The grid is 5x5, rather than the 9x9 of the regular version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It uses one game board and 48 cardboard tokens:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A, B, C, D, E, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Club, Moon, Diamond, Circle, Star, and Blockers in red, yellow, and blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to have the fewest number of groups of tiles on the board at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns placing one of their tiles on the grid and then draw another tile to replace it. There are three tiles which each player can place on each space: a letter (rows), a number (columns), or the shape on the space of the board (five areas; the corners plus diamonds form a cross in the center).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If another player has placed a tile it may be captured by playing a legal tile in its place, only if removing the tile doesn't break a group of tiles belonging to the player into more than one group. If players tie for the fewest number of groups at the end of the game, then the winner is the one who captured the fewest opponents' tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
