							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Les Boys: Hockey</name>
									
			<description>The game is based on the French-Canadian movie called &amp;quot;Les Boys&amp;quot;. The movie is about a garage league hockey team. The game picks up the hockey theme and is played in 2 teams, for a total of 2, 4 or 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the real hockey game, this card game is played in 3 periods, the first player plays a card, the puck is for the team of that player, until a player from the other team can play a card, the puck stays in the control of the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal is made when a team can produce a card to shoot to the goal and the other team cannot block the shoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is similar to the game called Slap Shot but does not include a board to play on it (as Slap shot has) and predates the game by a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
