			<description>Character Guessing Game&lt;br/&gt; Players randomly choose one of 10 character cards which depict one of the cast of characters.  Accountant, Bootblack, Clergyman, Doctor, Editor, Financier, Grandfather, Hobo, Investigator, Judge. Places which players visit as they move around the board give clues as to who they are. The Hobo for example can visit the Soup Kitchen, The Police Station, The Bus Line and The Drug Store - but, of course, cannot visit the Country Club. Players try to guess the identity of their opponents while remaining unidentified themselves. Disguise Caps spaces on the board allow players to move onto spaces they normally would not be allowed to visit. The winner is the player who manages to conceal his identity from the other players until he alone remains in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
