							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords &amp; Magick Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>The core rules for the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...what if you want a warrior who is good at sneaking, or a sorceror that is good at fighting? In some games, this is impossible. There is no way that a sorceror will ever equal a warrior in fighting ability. Doesn't happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other games, you can have a sneaky fighter, or a thief who can cast spells, but getting one is very difficult. Thieves aren't supposed to study Magick. Warriors don't really need to be sneaky, do they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Swords &amp;amp; Magick, none of these restrictions apply. There are no character classes. You, the player, have 100% complete control over who your character is and how he became that way. By picking skills, your character becomes adept at whatever you want him to be adept at. Because there are no classes, there is no penalty for doing something you're not supposed to do. You can have a character who is good at fighting, sneaking, and casting spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
