							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battleships Forever</name>
									
			<description>Battleships Forever is a freeware tactical Real Time Strategy game that put's you in command of a small fleet of warships in space. Combat and damage mechanics are extremely detailed. Everything is simulated in game if possible. There are no abitrary &amp;quot;to hit chance&amp;quot; values in Battleships Forever. The game also features many innovative mechanics that you've never seen before. For example, the Cronus Battleship sports a Flux Shield generator that allows you to draw a defensive force shield around your ships in any shape you want. Another example are the Deflector modules that are used extensively through the game. These modules make a single section of a ship totally invulnerable to fire. This means that you will have to manoeuvre your ships to attack sections of the enemy ships not protected by Deflectors while keeping your own protected sections facing the enemy. Position is paramount!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will command picked fleets made up of Battleships, Destroyers and Patrol Craft. The completed game will include ten campaign missions and multiple skirmish modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battleships Forever is inspired by and loosely based on Warning Forever by Hikoza.T.Ohkubo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer's Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Redeveloped from: Warning Forever&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
