			<description>Chikken is a game of dice, risk, strategy, and luck.  It's designed for two to six players of any age, as long as they can understand how to make matches with dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to get as high a score as possible without losing your turn. To do this, you roll five special dice (four white, one red), each with one side blank. The red die is called the &amp;quot;Danger Die.&amp;quot;  If at any time you roll all white blanks, or you roll a red blank, your turn ends without scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You score points by making three/four/five-of-a-kind matches or a straight (1-2-3-4-5). After each roll, you can stop and bank your points (gaining bonus points for matches, plus the total of all spots on the dice), or you can set aside dice of your choice and reroll what's left. However, you MUST set aside any blank white dice after each roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An added element of risk management comes when you have a bonus score available, such as from four-of-a-kind. When you do, you have the extra choice of hanging onto those bonus points and rerolling all five dice, with the bonus score still in jeopardy if you should roll blanks and lose your turn. This lets you &amp;quot;start over&amp;quot; with a higher starting value, but all the same risks of losing your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Value&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chikken teaches kids to understand and analyze risks. For younger kids, it's a matching game, and for slightly older ones, they can count up spots, or add up the numbers as they go. And it's still fun for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
