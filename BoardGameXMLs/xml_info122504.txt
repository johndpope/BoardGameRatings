			<description>In this game the players take the roles as antique dealers, trading antiquities on the auction market. &lt;br/&gt;There are 42 antiquities in the game, (fairly realistic in their representation with photos and descriptions). The 42 antiquities are sorted in 11 series of 3-5 antiquities each.&lt;br/&gt;The players are to collect them and the one who has 2 (short game) or 3 (longer game) complete series with no outstanding money loans is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players start with some cash and 5 antiquities each. All antiquities ar kept secret until a complete series is collected.&lt;br/&gt;as the game progress they move around a board where they land on squares that causes auction to occur; new antiques enter the market, opportunity to loan more money, more money (salary) or random event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central mechanic is the auctions and the players auction antiquities as well as the bank. Asking price and acceptance price is set by the player. What is to be auctioned, asking and acceptance price is kept secret until the auction starts. Players that win objects include them in thir hands and keeps them hidden until a series is completed, (but as the game moves along you can get more and mor knowledge about what the other players have, based on what auctions they won, if you remember this)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
