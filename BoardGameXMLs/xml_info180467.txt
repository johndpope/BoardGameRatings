							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vegetable Race</name>
									
			<description>Vegetable Race is a racing game with varying point values given for finishing.  Your primary goal is to manipulate your neighbors to finish based on your secret objective.  Vegetable Race is played over multiple rounds and is anyone's game until the final round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a vegetable from the eight available (Carrot, Tomato, Bean, Pepper, Eggplant, Onion, Corn, and Lettuce) and takes the appropriate vegetable card and player pieces.&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each race, each player is given a secret objective and dealt 2 playing cards.  The secret objectives relate to yourself or your neighbors finishing, i.e.: &amp;quot;Finish any time after the person to your right. 3 pts&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Finish Last. 4 pts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a players turn they draw a card then play a card.  Or, they can use their vegetables ability.  Cards move themselves or other players.  Cards also allow you to play from another players hand, swap places, and more.  &lt;br/&gt;There is a single &amp;quot;Finish First&amp;quot; card that gives a player 7 points if they finish first with it in their hand and causes their opponents to lose 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points for finishing in each race are awarded as follows: &lt;br/&gt;First: 0pts&lt;br/&gt;Second: 4pts&lt;br/&gt;Last: 3pts&lt;br/&gt;Other: 2pts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, in the span of each race, you go from not wanting to finish, wanting to finish, then not wanting to finish again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race is run on a 10 space racetrack.  After all players have finished, points are tallied on a separate score track.  Play continues until a predetermined score has been met (20 or 30 points) or number of races have been run (3 is usually a good number to determine the top vegetable).  Each race runs 5-10 minutes, more or less depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing with 6-8 players additional rules and objectives are added to help speed the game along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vegetable Race Consists of: (subject to change prior to release)&lt;br/&gt;54 Standard poker sized playing cards (10 Secret Objective, 42 playing cards, 2 rules quick reference cards)&lt;br/&gt;10 Large playing cards (8 Vegetable Player cards, Race Track, and Score track)&lt;br/&gt;18 Molded plastic pieces (2 of each Vegetable and two additional pieces for tracking starting player with 6-8 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vegetables used in Vegetable Race are vegetables in the culinary sense.  The designer is aware that some vegetables used are botanically fruits.  Since a lot of different colored vegetables are the same color (Onion, Leek, Bok Choy, etc.) and/or look similar (radish, turnip, beet, etc.) the designer just went with what he thought would be the most amusing (and the name Vegetable Race had a good ring to it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vegetable Race is scheduled to be released on Kickstarter right now!!!  Pledge now!  Running now until August 26th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
