			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New York City Is Brought To Its Knees -&lt;br/&gt;SUPERVILLAINS RUN RAMPANT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such terror has never been known before.  In this exciting game of role playing for multiple players and a gamemaster, players become Supervillains or Superheroes, struggling for control of modern-day New York City, battling other super-beings on its streets and in its buildings.  Employ such special powers as flying, density control, levitation, heat or cold control, the ability to leap super-human distances, super-speed, explosive demolecularization, telekinesis, or any of numerous others.  Wreak havoc! But lay your plans carefully.  The agents of DAGGER, the government's unparalleled force of elite fighters, may well seek you as actively as your fellow Supervillains.  The city is in uproar.  But can you gain control?&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;  SUPERVILLAINS includes scenarios which may be played as board games, and complete rules for setting up and running a role playing campaign game.  The game contains a strategic map, a tactical map, die cut playing pieces, and all the dice, charts, and rules required for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also listed in Board Games: Supervillains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
