							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Codex Bash</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Codex Bash is a problem-solving installation using four custom-made wireless buttons. Players must solve coded messages to tell them what sequence to press the buttons in, before the virus reaches the mainframe! To find the sequence they have to decipher jumbles of symbols, solve a tangled maze or find clues in maps and circuit diagrams. Played alone, Codex Bash is a challenge of jumping between logical problem-solving and an adrenaline-filled dash between the buttons. Played as a team it's a challenge of communication where everyone must pitch in to decipher the codes. Real-world props need to be used in the puzzles, and encourage the player to think outside of the screen and even recruit people watching to help them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
