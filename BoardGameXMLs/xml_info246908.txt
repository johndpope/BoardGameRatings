			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 books on cryptozoology that players might find on a bookshelf. The books are mostly suitable for a modern setting, as the vast majority were first published in the late 20th century, although some are older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These books cover cryptozoology, from unverified creatures such as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, to more down-to-earth creatures such as the giant cats of different countries, to giant birds and prehistoric holdovers. All the books listed are genuine books, some of them by well known names in the field, covering many of the most famous monster tales. Whether or not the books have any in-game value other than decorative is up to the GameMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries have the book's name, author, if known, and in every case other details, in particular the area that the book covers. They can be used to pad out a bookshelf with other genuine material, although it is unlikely that any one person would have books on the whole range of subject material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;87. The Locals: A Contemporary Investigation of the Bigfoot/Sasquatch Phenomenon by Thom Powell (Why Bigfoots exist, why they behave the way they do and why they haven't been successfully found and identified)&lt;br/&gt;88. The Loch Ness Monster: The Evidence by Steuart Campbell (The origins of the belief, the myths surrounding the story, and the problems with the truth of the alleged sightings)&lt;br/&gt;89. The Mystery Animals of Pennsylvania by Andrew Gable (An amateur details the various mysterious animals reported in the state, including historical references)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
