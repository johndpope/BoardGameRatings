			<description>Subtitle: Experimental Paradigm of Cinematic Horror&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;EPOCH is a game of character-driven survival horror. The goal is to deliver a tense and scary experience in a single game session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be blood&amp;hellip; EPOCH is a game of survival horror, and much like a movie, not all of the characters can expect to survive until the final scene. Unlike many other games, EPOCH players have complete control over the fate of their characters. They may know the rules of the horror genre, but who becomes a victim, and how, is different every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be drama&amp;hellip; EPOCH rewards interesting character play with increased chances of character survival. Players are not just the protagonists, but also act as the audience who hold the fate of all the characters in their hands. Using a simple, flexible, character creation method, players shape their back story to reveal interesting facts and surprising twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be a reckoning&amp;hellip; EPOCH assumes a high level of character competence. Skills and abilities are streamlined, placing the focus back on the characters&amp;rsquo; story and the personal impact of the horror. But victory is never assured; evil may prevail, and the true cost of the horror is never fully revealed until the final credits roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
