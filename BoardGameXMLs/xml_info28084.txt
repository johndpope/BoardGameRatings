			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dracos dominates the Galaxy, his power over it is complete. The only hope for the Planetary Systems under his domain lays in their representatives, who must cross the Maze by their own means, against the full power of Dracos&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a light maze/exploration game played on a 22x26 grid where 1-4 players assuming the roles of each of the Planetary Systems emissaries try to take their ships from one edge of the labyrinth (the board) to the opposing edge. The &amp;quot;walls&amp;quot; (or energy screens)that the labyrinth is made of are secretly deployed on a control sheet by the Dracos player, and are not visible at the beginning on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emissaries and Dracos take turns moving their ships, the emissaries trying  to find a path to reach the edge of the board or in the case of Dracos, trying to destroy the ships of the emissaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their movement, the emissaries can use several tools to avoid the dangers, such as scanners, lasers and shields, and in addition can cooperate exchanging these tools. Dracos has its own ships and the labyrinth itself to stop and destroy the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player that reaches the goal square scores a marginal victory, while a total victory can only be achieved if ALL emissaries reach the goal, so cooperation is encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
