			<description>Strategic wargame with a game board showing a map of most of Europe with a square grid overlaid. Playing pieces are steel miniatures of different types of military units. Rules are included for three types of games. The first type of game is played with infantry units only and movement controlled by rolling dice. It is intended for younger players. The second type also uses only infantry, but with deterministic chess-like moves and no dice. The third type adds all the other types of units. The goal in all games is to capture the flag in the enemy capital or reduce the enemy army to less than half of the own army's size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the game are miniature armies for Germany and France allowing for a two-player game on a war between those two nations fought on land only. Expansion armies for 15 other European countries were sold separately as well as expansions adding navies for 12 of the nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules recommend playing with one player per major country, but that two players play Germany as a team if fighting a two-front war against both France and Russia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
