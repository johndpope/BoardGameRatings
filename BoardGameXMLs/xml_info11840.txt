							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Flips 8: Auto Racing</name>
									
			<description>Triple Flips 8 includes Indy Pit Stop, Le Mans 24 Hour Race, and Off-Road Challenge Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Indy Pit Stop simulates an Indy 500-style race between 2-4 players.  This is a roll-and-move game with some unusual pitfalls along the track.  Once you have car trouble and have to make a pit stop, you roll a die to determine what the pit crew finds wrong with your car.  1-3 indicates a refueling is in order; 4, tire change; 5, spark plugs; and 6 means it's overheating.  The various problems can take different amounts of time to fix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Le Mans 24 Hour Race is a 1-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Off-Road Challenge Race is a roll-and-move race game with some zany track elements.  Spaces such as &amp;quot;Other cars go ahead 4&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Go behind lead car&amp;quot; provide unusual interaction of the vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
