			<description>&amp;ldquo;Welcome to the World of the 25th Century. Help Buck defeat the Han Empire! The Decks: One player gets the Org Deck. The other player gets the Han Deck. Victory: The first player to win 5 hands is the winner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hand the players fill their hands to seven cards (Arrival Phase), can discard and redraw up to four (Reinforcements Phase), and then the players reveal some, none or all of their cards (Adventure Phase). Each player adds up the Force values of their cards, the player with the higher total wins the hand (Cliffhanger Phase.) The winner of the hand then makes an improvisational narrative of the Episode reflected by the turn using some or all of the cards played as a basis (Narrator Phase.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
