							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moon Alert</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moon Alert was a side-scrolling buggy game for the ZX Spectrum, in which the player had to negotiate rough terrain on the moon, jumping over obstacles and shooting rocks in the way and aliens over head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The buggy could be moved left and right on the screen while in contact with the ground, could shoot forwards and upwards simultaneously, and could be made to jump in order to avoid obstacles. The slow speed with which the buggy moved through the air when jumping was meant to reflect the lower gravity of the Moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
