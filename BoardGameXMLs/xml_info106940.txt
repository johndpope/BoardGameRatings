			<description>Majin Tensei (魔神転生?) is a SNES Tactical role-playing game developed by Atlus and was released on January 28, 1994. On March 14, 2006, the Microsoft Windows version ported by i-revo went on rental and download sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features tactical RPG styled battles. Battles start with a Top-down perspective and enter first-person when actual combat begins, similar to other Megami Tensei games. The player is allowed to recruit demons and use them to battle with, but Magnetite, the game's money, depletes with each use. Therefore, it becomes necessary to finish battles quickly and to not overuse demons.[1] Players also have the ability to fuse demons to create stronger ones. There are healing pools scattered throughout stages which will heal wounded characters. Majin Tensei takes place in a modern Japanese city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Majin Tensei&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
