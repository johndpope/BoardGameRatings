			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb effortlessly through the ranks of the Rebel Alliance with Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Specialization Decks! Created via FFG's in-house manufacturing, Age of Rebellion Specialization Decks each come with twenty talent cards for a single specialization, so you can keep the text of your character's abilities at your fingertips. Whether you're learning the ropes, flying starfighters into battle, or exchanging blaster fire with Imperial Stormtroopers, Specialization Decks will help you spend less time reviewing the rules so you have more time to battle the evil Galactic Empire! As the Rebellion confronts the Empire on multiple fields simultaneously, its Slicers go to battle with codes, data packets, lightning-quick programming skills, and the ability to rewire communication networks to unmake the enemy's plans and reduce its technology to heaps of useless metal, plastic, and wires. When they go to work, speed is of the essence, and the Spy Slicer Specialization Deck ensures that you'll be able to cut swiftly through any distractions and focus more fully on the task at hand. This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook is required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
