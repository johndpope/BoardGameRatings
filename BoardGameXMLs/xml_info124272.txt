			<description>In this card game players try to replace cards in their hand of three cards so that it gets close to the target of 31 points. The twist is that they can't look at their initial three cards unless they are discarded in favour of other, hopefully better, cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pagat.com says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game by Gary Woitzik combines the objective of 31 (Scat, Blitz) with a play mechanism similar to &amp;quot;Golf&amp;quot; (the card game). It uses a special 65-card pack which consists of the 52 cards of a standard Anglo-American deck plus 13 cards with special functions reminiscent of those found in UNO and other games: 2 Wild, 2 Reverse, 2 Skip, 5 Take All, 1 Scramble and 1 Swap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
