			<description>Lost Ones is a cooperative map tile exploration game. Up to 4 players take on the role of youths who have been kidnapped and taken to the Otherworld, home of the Fae. They escape during a conflict and must explore this magical realm of dreams to find a way home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a set number of successive Turns, where players can perform certain actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Explore a new area by placing a map tile, moving there and reading the description in the Story Book&lt;br/&gt;     Move to an adjacent map tile that has already been placed&lt;br/&gt;     Activate certain Powers&lt;br/&gt;     Investigate a map tile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When investigating a map tile, the characters may encounter denizens of the Otherworld and have to make choices on how to proceed. An encounter often requires a player to use an Ability card from their Hand, which is compared against a drawn Conflict card. Success could mean learning more valuable information, overcoming an obstacle or even gaining magical powers. Failure wastes a precious Ability card and could mean gaining an Affliction to hinder further progress. &lt;br/&gt; Players must locate and find a way to open one of several Gateways so they can get home to their own world. They must do this before they run out of time, have an empty Hand or are caught by Fae sent to hunt them down. Careful use of resources, piecing together clues and cooperating with other players are key to winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
