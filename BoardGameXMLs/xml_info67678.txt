			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many times your players have started a tavern brawl? How many times they unmasked the timid glass blower who was actually the master of this famed thieves&amp;rsquo; guild? How many times your players went into the stables in a hurry and found their enemies there, waiting for them. With this product, you now have the perfect battlegrounds for your city adventures!&lt;br/&gt;This accessory features the amazing rendered 3d maps produced by &amp;Oslash;1 Games. You will not find this quality in other products, since these maps are carefully modeled and rendered by professionals. These new battlemaps feature a stunning 150dpi resolution, allowing you to get an incredible print quality.&lt;br/&gt;Each map shows a room from a top-down perspective with stunning lighting effects and superb 3D-rendered objects. You can easily print out these maps and place your favorite miniatures on them. Highly detailed, these maps add flavor and facilitate tactical movements while running combat encounters. A one-inch square grid is drawn on each map but blended in perfectly with the environment.&lt;br/&gt;Each map is printable on a single sheet of paper, except for one map (the Stables) that comes divided in two sheets. You can print out the map you need in full color, or choose its grayscale-optimized version if you do not want to consume too much ink. Even if you decide to print them in color, these battlemaps will be always more cost-effective than a printed version, as you can print out just what you need... even multiples of your favorite ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
