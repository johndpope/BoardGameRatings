							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from Enigma</name>
									
			<description>You have all been trapped in a room by the psychopath Enigma. There&amp;rsquo;s only one means of escape and you must get the correct tool to unlock the exit. Only one person can escape while the rest will perish. Beware as you do not know the other players&amp;rsquo; identities and Enigma might just be one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 ways to win in highly-addictive game of strategy, deduction and deception from the creators of Mystery Manila:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Be the first person to escape&lt;br/&gt;(2) Be the last person left alive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are playing the character of Enigma, the only way to win is to kill everybody else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game box contains the following components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 7 Character Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 7 Exit Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 7 Tool Tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, each player is handed at random a Character Card with a specific ability. An Exit Card is randomly drawn and placed faced down in the middle of the table. This card is now the Escape Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All remaining Character Cards and Exit Cards are placed in two separate piles near the center of the table. All Tool Tokens are also placed individually at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone closes their eyes. While one person counts loudly back from ten, the player holding the Enigma Character Card opens his eyes, looks at the Escape Card, and places it back to it's original position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every game of Escape from Enigma, players take turns doing one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Take an Exit Card&lt;br/&gt;- Take a Tool Token&lt;br/&gt;- Do Character Card's ability&lt;br/&gt;- Bluff and do another Character Card's ability&lt;br/&gt;- Change your Character Card (except if you are Enigma)&lt;br/&gt;- Attempt to escape (except if you are Enigma)&lt;br/&gt;- Pass&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Escape, a player must call out a Tool Token he owns and peek at the Escape Card. If they match, the player wins the game. Otherwise, that player is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player is eliminated, all his Exit Cards and Tool Tokens are returned to the center of the table, and the game resumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second way to get eliminated for the game is through bluffing. When a player bluffs and is challenged, the defender and the challenger must show each other their Character Cards. Whoever loses the challenge is eliminated and gives the winner all his Exit Cards and Tool Tokens. The winner may also assume the loser's Character Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the survivor of Escape from Enigma?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
