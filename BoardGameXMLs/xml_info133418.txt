			<description>This is a two player (black and white) abstract game played on a 13 square by 12 board. The two centre squares of the opposite long sides are coloured white and the rest of the squares are each coloured one of six other colours.&lt;br/&gt; Each player starts with 26 pieces, one king, two queens, two rooks  four bishops, four knights and thirteen pawns. All except the king have a colour matching one or other of the board square colours and pieces start on the same rank as their king on their matching board square colour, pawns doing likewise on the second rank.&lt;br/&gt; Pieces mostly move as in chess but the king can move up to three squares, the object being to be first to get your king onto the opposing player's king's starting square.&lt;br/&gt; Pawns can be promoted to any piece that has been captured so that loss of your king is not necessarily fatal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
