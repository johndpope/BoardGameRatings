			<description>At the beginning of the game, each player secretly receives a team card. They don't know who will be their partner, so they'll have to judge everyone fairly.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the round, each player gets 7 cards with a piece of lyrics on them. They proceed to draft all the cards until they receive one last from their neighbor. Then, they all try to compose a short song with 5 of their cards. They can choose to use the lyrics, or to flip the card over to the &amp;quot;Tralalaa&amp;quot; card instead. When everyone is ready, players take turns singing the song they just wrote (humming, shouting or beatboxing on each card on the &amp;quot;Tralalaa&amp;quot; face), with the tune and musical genre of their choice. After each performance, other players each award one point or zero to the player who just sang. But don't be to harsh: remember, anyone can be on your team!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
