			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACK FROM THE PAST TO HAUNT THE PRESENT....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, there were things things called newsgroups. They were kinda-sorta like Facebook and message forums, only without pictures and with even more rude people. They existed in the days when there were only four television networks and your parents had to walk up hill to and from school. AND THEY LIKED IT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some of these newsgroups, gamers, wanna-be game designers, and even honest-to-god real professional game designers would post rules and monsters and musings and writings of  all sorts for their favorite games. Sometimes, entire game systems would appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in those ancient times in the summer of 1995, the first version of ROLF! was posted to one of those fabled newsgroups... rec.games.frp.misc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, unearthed from the deepest recesses of the Interwebs--proving that whatever is on the web really is there forever--and converted to PDF, we proudly presents that historic game for your enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Supplements for the current edition of ROLF! are more or less compatible with this hoary original iteration, although some rules have changed... for the better, we like to think!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
