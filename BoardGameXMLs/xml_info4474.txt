							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Deck</name>
									
			<description>This game consists of four dice and a deck of special cards.  They come in three suits (blue, green, red) and range from 2 to 12 in value.  The frequencies vary (one each of 2, 3, 11, and 12; two each of 4, 5, 9, 10 and three each of 6, 7, and 8).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for ten games.  Two family games: Cancellation and Dice Deck Rummy, two children's games: Give And Take and Crazy Dice, two casino games (you will have to supply the betting chips): Three Card Down and Make My Point, two strategy games: Pathfinder and Admiral, and two solitary games: Dice Deck Bingo and Stack 'Em Up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To give but one example, in Dice Deck Rummy you are dealt 8 cards.  On your turn, you draw a card from the stock or the top discard.  You then roll two dice.  You can play any sets of the number rolled (two or more cards of that value), or any runs (three or more same color cards that follow each other in sequence) that end or begin with the number rolled (counting the dice as an extra card).  Finally you discard.  You can also freely increase played sets and runs on your turn.  First player to go out scores the total value remaining in the other players' hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Deck is similar to the Deck of Dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
