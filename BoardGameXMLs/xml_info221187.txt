							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Witches of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Double, double, toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Porphyra&amp;rsquo;s violet light, witchcraft will be done tonight!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witchcraft exists outside the more commonly understood magical practices of arcane wizards and divine clerics, tied to shadowy powers that will not reveal themselves, patrons of hidden influence and obscure purpose.  On the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra, witches sometimes aid the God-proud Deists, sometimes the ancient, aboriginal Elementalists- but mostly serve their own mysterious purposes and goals, or those of their shadowy patrons!  Meet these special spellcasters in Witches of Porphyra, the newest class-book from Purple Duck Games!  Within this arcane tome you will find 12 new witch archetypes, like the breath-weaponed insufflator, combat-oriented warweaver, otherworldly-sensed sightless seer, and the amazing mentor, who teaches a cohort-like heir the ways of magic until he can become a Patron of witches himself!  Also contained in Witches of Porphyra are 3 new familiar types, 13 new Porphyran patrons such as Beauty, Filth and Desert, 4 new familiars like the hoop snake and flying monkey, 18 new hexes including Major and Grand hexes, 9 new feats, 2 new special materials dear to witches and an exciting sample character!  Packed full of material for your favorite wiccans, Witches of Porphyra from the creative crones at Purple Duck Games is the one to get right away, because at PDG, our games are what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
