			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic role-playing approach in Rules of Thumb is to resolve all situations through collaborative narration.  If this becomes impossible or undesirable, the Narrator (Game Master) will call for a Task Resolution.  The Narrator determines a Base Difficulty, applicable modifiers are applied, and the player rolls (usually) 2d10 and compares the result.  The rules provide substitute statistics if other dice types are desired (&amp;quot;if players prefer other types of dice&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Traits and Attributes, but generally character creation is free-form with narrative tags providing characterization and capability.  Combat is slightly more detailed in terms of difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system as presented is utilized with a post-apocalyptic setting.  However, the rules would be usable with any traditional genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
