			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dominion Online is expected to be one of the first releases from Goko and is currently in Beta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dominion Online is based on the popular card game Dominion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the play area is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them. These include Victory Point cards, Treasure cards and Kingdom cards. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards available to buy change from game to game. The basic game in the physical version came with 25 types of Kingdom cards, of which 10 are selected to play each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several expansions have added additional Kingdom cards and other game mechanics. Reportedly these will also be available for in-game purchase in Dominion Online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its initial release, the game can reportedly only be played with a live internet connection, whether playing single player or multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
