			<description>Pour It To 'Em Boys is an accurate fast play rule set for the American Civil War. It is designed for an evening's fun with a few figures or for a large battle with no paperwork. As written the rules are for 15mm, 20mm, and 25mm models. For 5mm to 10mm substitute centimeters for inches. The rules are written for reasonable people.  If there is a disagreement during a game each player rolls 2 dice and the high scorer makes his/her point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published without copyright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules were previously published as a broader period rules set titled &amp;quot;Kepi &amp;amp; Pickelhaube&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
