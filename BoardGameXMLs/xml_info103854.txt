							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beer Tic Tac Toe</name>
									
			<description>A drinking and more strategic version of Tic tac toe, to be played in pubs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;a 3x3 grid is necessary for (at most) 9 glasses of beer.&lt;br/&gt;The first player opens with ordering one glass of beer and placing the glass on one of the 9 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;From then the play alternates between the two players.&lt;br/&gt;A player can always choose one of the two possible options:&lt;br/&gt;- order and place another glass of beer to an open space (available only until there are open spaces left)&lt;br/&gt;- or drink a half glass of beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever there is a line (column, row or diagonal) consisting of 3 full, 3 half-full or 3 empty glasses, the player achieving this wins (and the other player pays the bill).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
