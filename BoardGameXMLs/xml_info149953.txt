							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Kingdoms Full Metal Fantasy Game Master Toolkit</name>
									
			<description>From the Privateer Press website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equip yourself with the Game Master Toolkit, loaded to enhance your Game Master experience in the Iron Kingdoms Full Metal Fantasy Roleplaying Game! This toolkit includes a four-panel Game Master screen made from high quality hardcover stock. It is big enough to conceal the Core Rules book as well as adventure notes and secret dice rolls, yet it remains ideally sized to allow unobstructed access to the player area beyond. Featuring full-color art on the player side and frequently used tables and charts on the Game Master side, this screen is perfect for keeping your head in the game and out of the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of ten reusable dry erase initiative cards easily tracks the order of initiative for player characters and NPCs alike, while ten dry erase life spiral cards make it simple to track damage and healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a pad of 25 full-color encounter sheets designed to help build your encounters and track their outcomes and a pad of 25 full-color character sheets for your full-fledged NPCs as well as your players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Game Master screen&lt;br/&gt;10 initiative cards&lt;br/&gt;10 life spiral cards&lt;br/&gt;1 encounter sheet pad (25 sheets)&lt;br/&gt;1 character sheet pad (25 sheets)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
