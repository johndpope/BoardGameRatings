			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;User Notes: Level 3-5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King is dead...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in frozen wastelands and surrounded by untold treasures is the Kingdom of the Seven-Day Sun, and home to wise King Jarrod. But times have changed. At the peak of the winter festivals, the head of Jarrod's guard finds his lord dead upon his throne- murdered. As the castle and its grounds close by both snow and suspicions, Crown Prince Hess and his council, the Table of Lords, begin an investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his coronation, Hess is also targeted and everyone is suspect. Even his own kin, the Table of Lords, is not above suspicion, for each is a potential heir to the throne. Fingers point and old rivalries return as the truth is sought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dead of winter, among murderous alliances and old bonds of blood, regicide looms large. The greatest terror the land has ever seen grows terrifyingly close to the throne, and all that stands between the Kingdom of the Seven-Day Sun and its fate is a band of foreign warriors untrusted by all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...long live the King!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
