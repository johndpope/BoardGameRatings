							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlestations: Midway</name>
									
			<description>[From the instruction manual]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlestations: Midway represents a radical advance in naval war gaming.  Now YOU can control and direct every aspect of naval warfare, with genre-defining control systems and strategic interactive maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From your early days captaining a wooden-hulled torpedo boat, your challenge is to advance through the ranks of the United States Navy to command the largest battleships and aircraft carriers of World War II.  Ultimately, you will direct entire battle groups of ships and subs, as well as squadrons of aircraft, to strike against the jewels in the crown of the Japanese Navy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This may sound like a tall order, but with training at the Naval Academy, you'll grow in skill and experience.  With resolve, focus and determination&amp;mdash;plus a little bit of luck&amp;mdash;perhaps you can triumph against a deadly opponent, an enemy equipped with weaponry and units that equal those of the Allied forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pacific is at battlestations.  Are you equal to the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
