			<description>Warframe is a free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter video game, developed by Digital Extremes for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Although the game is free to download, players may purchase in-game currency called Platinum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control members of the Tenno, ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war with the Grineer, a race of militarized humanoid clones; the Corpus, a mega-corporation with advanced robotics and laser technology; and the Infested, disfigured victims of the Technocyte virus. To fight back, the Tenno use advanced exo-armor with unique abilities&amp;mdash;the titular Warframes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Warframe, up to four players work together to complete missions, such as eliminating enemies, retrieving data from terminals, assassinating high ranking/dangerous targets, defending an artifact, or surviving as long as possible. Players wear a battlesuit called a Warframe, each with its own set of abilities and statistics; and are equipped with three weapons&amp;mdash;a primary weapon (such as a rifle, bow, or shotgun), a secondary weapon (typically a pistol), and a melee weapon (such as swords, axes, and hammers). Players earn Affinity (experience points) for killing enemies and completing challenges and missions, which allows them to level up their weapons and armor. Warframes and weaponry have access to modifications, or &amp;quot;mods&amp;quot;, that can be installed, removed and upgraded before and after missions; the higher the Affinity rank of any one piece of equipment, the more mods it can accommodate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The camera is positioned over the shoulder for third-person shooting. The player can jump, sprint, slide, and roll, as well as combine techniques to quickly move throughout the level and avoid enemy fire. The game also allows players to utilize parkour techniques to evade enemies, bypass obstacles or gain access to secret areas. Maps are generated procedurally; with prebuilt rooms connected together so that no levels have the same layout. At times, the enemy faction can initiate a lockdown of the area, forcing players to hack security terminals by completing a puzzle minigame within a small time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits, ammo, resources, and mods can be found in set locations, such as lockers and destructible containers, as well as dropped by enemies. New weapons, Warframes, and equipment can be purchased in the market (either the items themselves or their blueprints), using either Credits earned in-game, or Platinum purchased via microtransaction.[3] Blueprints can be constructed using resources found during gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Warframe,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
