							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medieval Alliance</name>
									
			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;It is the late Middle Ages (1000 - 1500 AD.) You are a knight from a distant kingdom seeking to make an alliance with the wealthy kingdom of Agrafor.  To win the king's favor, you are bringing gifts to present to him, but beware: the king's head guard is overly protective.  If he catches you in the castle, he will evict you.  The first player to get to the king's throne and presents their gifts wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You will receive a mission card that tells you what items to collect as gifts for the King of Agrafor.  Included in your gift will be armor, a well-crafted weapon, a luxury item from he East, and a work of fine art (a painting, engraving, mosaic, or sculpture.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The chance cards contain historical facts and information about the period...As part of the play, students will meet and travel with prominent figures from these centuries, including artists, scientists, and authors.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
