							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doom RPG</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Doom RPG is a mobile phone game developed by id Software and Fountainhead Entertainment. It combines the Doom first-person shooter franchise with role-playing video game elements. The storyline incorporates many similar events of Doom 3, but involves different characters than those in the third game. The game retains many of the elements of Doom, and is shown in the first person like the original. It is also visually similar to the original Doom. However, the game is fundamentally different in that it is a turn-based role-playing game, rather than a shooter, with greater emphasis on the plot. Combat and movement are turn-based, allowing the player time to select their responses in combat. The player turns at 90 degree angles and moves space by space. It is very important to speak to the scientists and access computer terminals to attain vital information in order to progress through the game, similar to Doom 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many features of the original are retained, including the status bar face, sound effects and the majority of the weapons and monsters. Notably absent are the Chainsaw, Arachnotrons and Spider Mastermind. A difference from the original is that each monster is one of three levels of difficulty, and is colored to indicate this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also adds several new elements. New weapons include the fire axe and fire extinguisher which are useful in combat against certain enemies. The dogs from Wolfenstein 3D appear as a new enemy, known as Hellhounds. A dog collar-like mind-control device allows the hellhounds to be captured as pets, which can then act as both a melee weapon and a shield.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_RPG Doom RPG]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
