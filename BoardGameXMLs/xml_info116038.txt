You must avoid being caught for the 'Mischief Doings', and arrive at the finish with an exact throw. Instructions on squares must be obeyed (miss a turn, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a Mischief Square it is read out. The player who holds that Mischief Card is deemed to have caused the mischief and must miss the set number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two routes to take in the bedroom - If you cannot get over the bed in one throw, you will miss extra turns (so, you cannot 'bounce' on the bed!!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;1 3D Game Board.&lt;br/&gt;3 Card Sections.&lt;br/&gt;15 Mischief Cards.&lt;br/&gt;4 Playing Pieces With Stands.&lt;br/&gt;1 Die.&lt;br/&gt;Rules Are Printed on Inner Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
