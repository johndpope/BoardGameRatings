			<description>A PnP game set in the fictional world of the Chrysanthemum Empire. Players control Houses to ultimately control the empire within the time of the Changing Winds, which lasts for 2 years. Any means is possible, be it by showing off your House's wealth, military might or even influence in the courts. Treachery is of course, the bread and butter among the Houses of the Chrysanthemum Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A role selection and worker placement game for 2-6 players, inspired by Citadels and Stone Age, this game thrives to give the most gaming experience possible while expending as few resources as possible in making it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple six-sided dice are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 pieces of A4 paper are required to build this game, mounting onto chip boards and some kind of thin cardboard for the counters are recommended. 9 playing cards with the size 2.5&amp;quot; x 3.5&amp;quot; and sleeves are also recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
