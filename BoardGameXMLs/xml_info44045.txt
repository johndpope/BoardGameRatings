							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquer the Horizon: A Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a game in which the players take on the roles of an expeditionary mission from the Old World, exploring the unknown wilds of the New World. The players collaboratively create the New World while simultaneously competing to fulfill their own agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as the Governor, General, Naturalist, or Merchant, applying your individual skills and history to your continual quest to discover new features of the New World and exploit them for your own purposes. Make alliances with your compatriots, harbor your own ulterior motives as you contribute to their discoveries, and double-cross them for your own agenda when the time is ripe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquer the Horizon is a game for two to seven players. You will need a pile of dice, some pens and paper, and a couple hours to spend collaborating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
