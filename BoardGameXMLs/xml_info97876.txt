							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Chicks 3.1: Naked Distress</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to set out the battle map.  You're going to be staring at this fight for the next few hours.  What better thing to look at than HOT CHICKS... and what better way to keep your players' eyes on the map than with &amp;quot;Hot Chicks 3.1: Naked Distress?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOR MATURE GAMERS ONLY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the figures from our popular &amp;quot;Hot Chicks 3: Dangerous Curves&amp;quot; set, in considerable trouble.  In the tradition of classic Ral Partha figures, the ladies are naked and terrified - Damsels in distress, PCs on the wrong side of the fight, prisoners to be rescued, or extras in a B Horror movie - You Decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of Forty-Eight high quality 25mm paper &amp;quot;Standies&amp;quot; features women of beauty and strength in helplessness and distress.  Each figure is crafted as an individual character with a unique identity, easily recognizable as one of the unique figures from our &amp;quot;Hot Chicks 3&amp;quot; set.  Positions and facial expressions have been lovingly adjusted to reflect true distress.  Scatter them throughout a dungeon for atmosphere, or lay them in front of Nameless Horrors as the perfect sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also ideal for portraying a female PC having a very, very bad day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need atmosphere?  Need to keep your players focused on the map?  Then you need &amp;quot;Hot Chicks 3.1: Naked Distress!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
