			<description>Madballs in Babo: Invasion is a shooter from a top-down perspective. Players roll their Babo, a heavily-armed sphere, around in an arena, attempting to kill enemy players. There are ten unique Babos spread across two teams: the B*D*I and the Scorched. Each Babo has unique stats and abilities to utilize. For instance, the character Robo has high defenses, lacks speed, and can disarm enemies with his special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the characters, weapons, and abilities in the game are locked. A campaign mode spanning ten levels must be played to unlock characters and weapons, but downloadable content is available for purchase for players who do not wish to play the campaign.Weapons are unique in the fact that they have two modes of firing. Most weapons may switch between ballistic and laser firing modes, with other weapons switching between heat and cold. Players may gain an advantage over opponents by switching to a weapon the enemy is weak to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Madballs in Babo: Invasion&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
