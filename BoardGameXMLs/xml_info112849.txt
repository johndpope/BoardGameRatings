			<description>Based on the popular board game Free The Box, you must play a card and your opponents must match it if possible. By doing this, you are tying to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; your opponents and they, by making a match, are tying not to be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To be the first player to rid your hand of all cards. Each hand is one round and each game consists of several rounds. The game is over when one player reaches 60 points.[&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
