							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clinton, the Game of Scandal and Statesmanship</name>
									
			<description>The &amp;quot;box&amp;quot; for this game is a simple brown tube, adorned by a Clinton-faced band to give the tube the appearance of a cigar. A cigar-shaped spinner is also included as one of the game components. The object of the game is to have your &amp;quot;Clinton&amp;quot; make it through two terms in office before his popularity falls to zero and forces him to resign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
