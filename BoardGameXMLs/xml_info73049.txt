			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Over is a an hybrid platform-shoot'em up game developed by Dinamic Software for 8-bit computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other Dinamic games, the game was split in two part, the second one protected by a code the player could get by completing the first part. Unlike the others though, the two parts were rather similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows Arkos, former lieutenant of the evil galactic queen Gremla as he attempts to overthrow her by finding and defeating her guardians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay-wise, the first part of the game is a side-scroller, where the player has to travel through screen after screen of enemies while collecting power-ups and battle the guardians he encounters. In the second part (also side-scrolling), the player has to explore a fortress to find and confront the final guardian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
