			<description>Dystopolis is a strategic board game taking place in a not-so-distant future where the free market has run amok and resulted in a decadent society. Each player represents a ruthless investor in the megacity Dystopolis. The aim is to outmanoeuvre  the rivals through clever investments and by maximizing the profit from companies. Money can also be used to shamelessly bribe others into obedience. Action cards can be used to remove competing investments or to take over threatening companies - as long as the voting succeeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics is a combination of area control, stock holding and economic negotiation through bribes and bidding. The strategy in Dystopolis is centered around the placement of company tiles and investment tokens. The players add company tiles to the modular game board during each round. To claim ownership the players then need to invest money in the companies. The companies establish connections to each other. More connections to other companies increases the revenue, but also makes the company more vulnerable to attacks. A player with limited influence in an area can compensate for this by saving pleny of money for bribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
