			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still in active development and available to the public for purchase in it's unfinished state, either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select your weapon, your gadgets and then your play style as you enter ready to take down all the enemies patrolling the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you along your way is a large selection of gadgets and weaponry to assassinate your targets in any way you like. You can either go in guns blazing, with a mad desire to re-colour the walls red or take a more delicate approach as you sneak your way around the level avoiding detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your main weapon can either be a sword which can deflect bullets, chop down your foes or be thrown for maximum bloodshed. A shield which can be thrown at multiple enemies at once or to reflect their bullets right back at them. A bow for silent long range kills without worrying about ammo. And finally a machine gun because sometimes the best solution is the loudest one. You also have a selection of bad ass gadgetry, starting with ninja stars and gas grenades leading into the more ridiculous pocket sized black holes and self destructive crabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
