							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fleet of Battle</name>
									
			<description>Fleet of Battle was developed out of Field of Battle by Brent Oman (published by Piquet Inc.).  The rules are for ancient naval warfare from Salamis to Actium. They are best for the Punic, Successor and Roman Civil Wars where the quinquireme (five) was the most common 'line of battle' ship. Fleet of Battle is intended for use with fleets of between six and 20 ships per player with an optimum of a dozen or so for an evening&amp;rsquo;s play. Larger battles can be fought without difficulty, but more than an evening should be set aside for such games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no set ground scale or ship scale. The rules were devised for what felt right using 1:600 model ships. Fleets in classical times were very large, often several hundred ships strong, manned by tens of thousands.With this in mind it is suggested that historical scenarios should be fought using a ratio of one model to 10 - 20 ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If using 1:1200 scale models or smaller, use centimetres instead of inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
