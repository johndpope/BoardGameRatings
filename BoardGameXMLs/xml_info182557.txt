							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Druid</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can feel the pulse of the world as it beats through the ground, and hear its sibilant whispers carried by the winds. You can channel this energy to heal those deserving few, or unleash it upon any who would defy the forces of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blurring the line between man and beast, you can also shed your own flesh, assuming the shape of one of nature&amp;rsquo;s myriad children. Your form is boundless: prowl through dark forests, soar through the open sky, and swim in the vast seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with knowledge of the wild and its primeval power, do you simply try to survive, coexist with the kingdoms men strive to carve out for themselves, or will you drag civilization back into the untamed darkness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survival of the fittest, and all that that entails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The class presents an alternative to the druid class found in Dungeon World. For starters, you don't roll to change your form, and you don't spend hold and revert back. Instead you choose a benefit and penalty. Another key difference is that you also have access to a few magical tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you level up, you choose where you improve: master your forms by gaining passive benefits and make more choices, enhance your healing, or devastate your enemies with primeval magic. You can also learn new tricks, like finding resources any time you venture through the wild, attract animal followers, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Director's Cut provides extensive detail on the skin-walker move, and ways to tweak both it and the core druid (such as by removing shapechanging entirely, focusing more on magic).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains four files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two are letter-sized character sheets that use our new character sheet layout. One has a complete blank gear section, while the other fills in the initial choices if you want to just check some boxes and start playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized books, one in color, the other in black and white (to make it easier to print off at home if you want). They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The druid class, complete with 22 advanced moves.&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons, armor, and dungeon gear.&lt;br/&gt;    A pair of new magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut with questions to ask yourself, explanations and suggestions for some of the moves (especially skin-walker), and some extra moves that didn't make the original cut (including some to further modify skin-walker, as well as ritual magic and ritual sacrifice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
