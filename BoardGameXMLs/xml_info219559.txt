			<description>Total Extreme Wrestling 2016 is the seventh and best game in the award-winning TEW franchise by Adam Ryland and Grey Dog Software. Bigger and more packed with enhanced features than ever before, the game takes its extremely popular predecessor TEW2013 and adds over 500 new features and improvements, including many long-awaited additions requested by the fans themselves. With new options that allow users to tone down the complexity of the game, TEW2016 is the ideal jumping on point for new fans too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
