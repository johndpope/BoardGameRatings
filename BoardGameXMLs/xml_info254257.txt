							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Out of Line: Nature Calls</name>
									
			<description>Out of Line: Nature Calls is a leg-crossing game of Russian roulette.  A stand-alone expansion of our Out of Line series, players race to the front of a line of portable toilets at an outdoor concert.  The deck is full of cards to help you cheat your way to the front, but you never can tell when nature might strike.  The further you get into the deck the more desperate the race becomes because the clock is always ticking on a full bladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you simply have to be the first one to get to a portable toilet without having any accidents along the way.  Nature could call at any moment and no one may make it to the front of the line, so use all the tricks up your sleeves to cheat your way to the front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn consists of 3 easy steps:&lt;br/&gt;1. Roll a dice and move that line up &lt;br/&gt;2. Draw a card and hope nature doesn&amp;rsquo;t strike&lt;br/&gt;3. Take an action (play a card, move to the back of a line or just discard a card)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player cards allow you to do things like:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Move a player to the end of a line&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Force a player out of line&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Let a foodie cut into the front of the line&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Add people to the end of a line&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Temporarily close down a portable toilet&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Stop another player from playing a card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
