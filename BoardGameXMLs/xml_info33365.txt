							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battling Space Ships</name>
									
			<description>Battling Space Ships is exactly what its title suggests:  The players build their fleet of spaceships from miscellaneous ship parts that are dealt out at the beginning of the game.  Then the filthy pirates (the players) raid the space lanes, fight the other players' ships, or maybe even carry cargo in peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since this has been turned down by a couple of publishers, Tom Wham decided to self-publish it for those fans who want it now.  It includes a bag full of tiles, cargo counters, six dice, asteroid bases, transit counters, rules, and a box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
