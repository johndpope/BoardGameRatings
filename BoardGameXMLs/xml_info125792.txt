			<description>&amp;quot;El Viento (エル・ヴィエント Eru Viento, derived from Spanish meaning 'The Wind') is a 2D platform video game released by Wolf Team and published by Renovation Products for the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis game console in 1991. It is the second in a trilogy of games, which include Earnest Evans and Anetto Futatabi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game possesses many references to H. P. Lovecraft's esteemed Cthulhu Mythos. As with many Wolf Team games, the music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game shares the same fictional universe with Earnest Evans, and happens several years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New York City, 1928. A mad religious leader known as Henry seeks to awaken the ancient and malevolent god Hastur. A sorceress named Restiana offers herself to Henry as a sacrifice for a cause which will bring the inevitable down fall of mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some people that have descended from Hastur's ancient bloodline, one of which is the young Peruvian sorceress, Annet Myer. With some assistance from Earnest Evans, Annet attempts to stop the cult from resurrecting Hastur using the very spells of this bloodline.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;El Viento is a platformer. The player has access to an endless supply of boomerangs and eventually up to five spells: fireballs, water currents, explosions, arrows, and the wind cutter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;El Viento&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
