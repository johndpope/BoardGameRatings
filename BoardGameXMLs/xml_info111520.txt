			<description>Everyone knows the garden game where you have a tennis ball attached to a rope so that when you whack it, it spins around a central pole so that the other player can hit it back again. Well, this is the indoor equivalent. All made of plastic and a soft ball, you can recreate the garden game beautifully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual with a new Aurora Skittle game, Don Adams (of Get Smart fame) is on the cover, but here he looks a little bored. Maybe he is thinking &amp;quot;I have done too many skittle games.......&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
