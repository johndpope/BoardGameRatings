			<description>Each player choses a miner and sets them near one of the 6 coal product groups. The goal of the game is to produce coal from the mines and transport the coal to the 6 circular spaces of one&amp;rsquo;s product group. At the start of the game 36 coal cubes are placed into the mine tunnels. The players spin the wheel on the winding tower. The wheel segment that stops at the opening of the mining shaft, determines from which mining tunnel (1-6) the coal is produced and where is goes:&lt;br/&gt;1 - factory (on the right side of the shaft)&lt;br/&gt;2-5 - factory or storage pile &amp;bdquo;Teer&amp;ldquo;, &amp;bdquo;Koks&amp;ldquo; or &amp;bdquo;Gas&amp;ldquo;&lt;br/&gt;6 - factory&lt;br/&gt;mound - from the tunnel matching the players product group to the mound (on the right side of the shaft) or if there isn&amp;rsquo;t any coal left, buy coal from the mound&lt;br/&gt;joker - any of the above&lt;br/&gt;If a player spins his own color, he may put the produced coal cube on one of his product spaces. If a player spins the color of another player, this player may take a coal cube from the factory or the storage pile assigned to his product group.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to place an coal cube on every of his 6 product spaces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
