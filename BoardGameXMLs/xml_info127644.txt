							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Slice</name>
									
			<description>This pizza-themed educational board game teaches fractions. There are seven pizzas on the table, with each pizza divided into a different number of slice pieces. Each player has a hand of four cards numbered between 1 and 8. Players use the cards to construct fractions and claim slices of pizza.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If player takes the last slice of a pizza, that player receives a &amp;quot;Yum!&amp;quot; counter. When all the pizza slices are taken, the player with the most &amp;quot;Yum!&amp;quot; counters wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of two original board games published in July 2012 by the Love2Know Website as part of a &amp;quot;Printable Board Games&amp;quot; article.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
