							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Big Hoodoo</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The stories of rocketships and rayguns you read under cover of dark are coming to life before your eyes. Will you become a victim of Parsons' &amp;quot;Big Hoodoo&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Hoodoo is Lovecraftian noir in 1950s California with a ripped-from-history plot centered on the explosive death of real-world rocket scientist, science fiction fan, and occultist Jack Parsons in a garage laboratory in 1952. The investigators are iconic figures active in the science fiction scene at the time of Parsons&amp;rsquo; death, and their inquiries lead them from the mean streets of Pasadena to the edge of the Mojave Desert and the mountains of southern California as well as the beaches of Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play sci-fi great Robert Heinlein, his ex-Navy engineer wife Virginia, renowned editor and mystery writer Tony Boucher, or a young Philip K. Dick as they confront the lunatic fringe in La-La Land, and find themselves caught in a charlatan&amp;rsquo;s web of chicanery, mendacity, and deceit&amp;ndash;laced with a strong strand of Mythos menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure includes brief biographical hooks for the PCs to orient players to their investigators as well as suggestions for alternate and additional investigators. Brief rules for a magic system intended to evoke the Enochian &amp;quot;magick&amp;quot; invented by John Dee and Edward Kelley, adopted by Aleister Crowley, and passed on to Jack Parsons are appended, and are used in the adventure. It can be played as a convention one-shot, or serve as the basis for a slightly longer set of episodes covering two or three evenings of entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the latest adventure from acclaimed Castle Bravo author Bill White.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
