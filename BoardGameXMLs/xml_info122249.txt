			<description>You have been sent to Space Station Alcatraz; the hardest rock this side of the galaxy, for crimes you did not commit.  Alcatraz is a semi-automated prison placed on an asteroid floating around a black hole.  No-one has ever escaped from Alcatraz, but that's about to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player will take the role of the Prison Station Officer, charged with keeping everyone in prison until the end of his shift on the station, the rest of the players will take the part of the prisoners; working together (or sometimes against each other), to escape before the current shift ends and they are all placed into cryo-stasis for the next hundred years - trapped until their next opportunity to try and escape comes along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an action point based system, with the prisoners using their points to search for escape items, hide in vents, avoid patrolling guards and construct their escape plans and the Station Officer using his to perform sweeps, change robot patrol orders, search for stashes and activate the deadly, deadly vent cleaning laser grid.  Play continues for a number of turns until either one player has managed to free their entire team of convicts or cryo-sleep time kicks in.  If escapes have happened, but enough prisoners have been kept in Alcatraz then the Prison Officer gets a stern telling off but is the winner, otherwise the player who has managed to free the most valuable members of their team (or escape first in the case of a tie) wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So bolt together your space glider, hitch a lift on a passing transport ship or just make a break for it across the asteroid towards an arranged rendezvous and get the heck out of here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Draft has neared completion, and testing is underway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
