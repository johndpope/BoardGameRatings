			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One-Shot Adventure&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with Most Fantasy RPG systems&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for 4-6 player characters of levels 2 to 4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traveling faire&amp;rsquo;s prized pachyderm has been stolen by an evil wizard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He plans to kill and carve up the great beast for spell components!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you rescue the wondrous beast and save Wyatt&amp;rsquo;s faire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure your players will meet and help the ringmaster of the &amp;ldquo;Faire Fantastic&amp;rdquo;, a charismatic young man named Wyatt Ferris. Wyatt needs the players&amp;rsquo; help because the prize attraction of his faire, a rare and exotic elephant named Nellie, has been stolen by a dastardly mage named Rickard. The man tried to force Wyatt to sell Nellie to him but Wyatt repeatedly refused the offer, as the evil mage told him he intended to kill the glorious beast and use the body for spell components and its head as a trophy! Rejected, the mage returned later and when he left again the elephant had vanished! Now Wyatt needs the party&amp;rsquo;s help to rescue his prized pachyderm, preferably before the next night&amp;rsquo;s show!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your hands is a one-shot adventure I designed specifically for inclusion in the #PlayForWyatt movement which was begun to honor the life of fellow gamer Wyatt Ferris, whose young life was tragically ended far too soon. By including Wyatt in our adventures, GMs like me want to pay tribute to him and allow him to live on within the fantasy worlds he loved to play in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wrote this module to be generic and system agnostic, and it is useable with most fantasy RPG systems, including ALL EDITIONS of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous role-playing game and OSR retro-clones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement was written to honour the memory of a fellow gamer, lost far too soon to the scourge of self-harm. If you or someone you know is in crisis, please reach out for help: you are not alone and help is available. If you or anyone you know needs help, you can find it by reaching out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module provides wonderful background information and additional areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in the author&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding campaign world, which now comprises four different kingdoms: Jarlburgh, Alderburgh, The Red Eagle Barony, and D&amp;uacute;n Loachas. This adventure takes place in southern Alderburgh, southeast of the Harquebusier Academy which is the focus of the the Starry Knight Press / Unseen Servant module S1 The Trials of the Shootist; it lies due south east of the ancient crumbling mage&amp;rsquo;s keep that is the focus of module SK2 Scoundrel&amp;rsquo;s Run. (all available for purchase on DrivethruRPG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
