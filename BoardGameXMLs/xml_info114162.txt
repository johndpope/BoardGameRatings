			<description>In-app description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spin the wheels and take your chances. Bet big or small and build your winnings. Play alone or against a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slot Machine is a simulation of a simple fruit machine for the Atari 2600.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (or the computer and player) are given 25 coins each, and the game ends when one player's coins reaches zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to score the most points, see below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eight game modes made up of any combination of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One or Two Players&lt;br/&gt;     Jackpot Game or Payoff Game&lt;br/&gt;     Center Pay Line or Up to 5 Pay Lines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jackpot Game has just three winning combinations, which can score 20, 100 or 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Payoff Game has ten different winning combinations, scoring from 2 to 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can stake from 1 to 5 coins. When playing with the &amp;quot;Center Pay Line&amp;quot; option, the stake acts as a multiplier - if you get a winning combination, then the win is multiplied by your stake. When playing with &amp;quot;Up to 5 Pay Lines&amp;quot;, each additional coin activates an additional potential Pay Line, therefore increasing the chance of a winning combination. The five possible Pay Lines are the three horizontal lines of symbols, plus the two diagonals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
