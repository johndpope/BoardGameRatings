							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Roman Legions Guide (EGS)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few words conjure up as much grandeur and splendor as the Roman Legions. For 900 years they marched across Europe, Africa, and Asia, laying low any opposition set before them and adding vast swaths of new lands to the Republic and later the Empire. They performed this miraculous chore through superior arms and armor, remarkable training and discipline, and a tradition of unparalleled organization and pedigree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Roman Legions Guide is a catalog of tools of the trade utilized by the Roman Army. The legions underwent drastic changes over the years moving from seasonal, offensive citizen soldiers, to professional, garrisoned warriors; from infantry based cores to cavalry-heavy mobile units. As the scope of all the drastic changes are quite abundant, this guide focuses on the armies of the Late Republic and Early Empire, roughly from 27 BCE to 284 CE, commonly known as the Principate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Roman Legions Guide includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Historical equipment utilized by the Roman Legions&lt;br/&gt;    A look at the structure of the Roman Legions&lt;br/&gt;    A listing of Roman Emperors&lt;br/&gt;    A comprehensive timeline of Roman battles during the Principate&lt;br/&gt;    Options for making a legionary characters&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure hooks&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip; and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Roman Legions Guide is your source for building Legionaries like those of history, or building the foundations of a historical or alternate history game set during the Principate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
