			<description>The Game of WordHound is played by two to four players. The Object of the game is to make an answer belonging to the category in play from the letters on your letter rack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn you draw letters from the letter bag, one at a time, until you draw a letter you want to keep. When you keep a letter, your turn is over and you pass the bag to the player on your left. Letters you don't want are placed face up on the letter board where they may be taken by other players. Letters you keep are placed on your letter rack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to make an answer using all the letters on his or her rack wins the round. The winner scores two points for each letter in his or her answer, plus a bonus equal to the number of the round being played. Other players score one point for each letter in their partial answer if every letter on their rack is used in the partial answer. Players score zero points if there are any unused letters on their rack when the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An answer may consist of one or more words and may be singular or plural. Blank tiles may be used as any letter and are scored as a letter. Spaces between words and other punctuation are assumed and do not affect scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score after six rounds of play wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
