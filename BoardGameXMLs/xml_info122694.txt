							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abandoned Hamlet</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the world there are villages that have been abandoned and fallen into ruin. What waits around the corner, maybe a group of vicious bandits or poor townsfolk trying to survive in the decaying village, or perhaps a group of animals have made this their home. The only way to find out is to explore the entire hamlet.&lt;br/&gt; Based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast, this campaign map measures 20&amp;quot; x 30&amp;quot; and is printed on durable vinyl, allowing you to mark the surface with wet-erase markers to tailor the maps to your individual campaigns, record the paths that your heroes travel, or make notes about encounters and locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
