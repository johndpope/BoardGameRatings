							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frankenstein&#039;s Monster</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frankenstein's Monster was created by Victor Frankenstein as an experiment in the creation of life. The monster itself is nameless; Frankenstein never saw fit to name his creation, and the monster's lack of identity is a source of despair for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 feet tall, with yellow skin, the monster was hideously ugly. The towering, grotesque figure was shunned by all who see him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon creating his monster, Frankenstein fled from it in horror and disavowed it. The monster was forced to wander the wilderness and eke out a meagre existence. During this time it managed to educate itself - no mere golem, this, the monster became eloquent and well-mannered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
