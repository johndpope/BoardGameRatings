			<description>The entire rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a particular coloured Aeroplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No player can start until he has thrown a 6 with the dice, this counting as his first move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game proceeds by moving the Aeroplanes according to the number shown by the throw of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must observe all the hazards his Aeroplane alights upon, whether in his favour or otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exact number required to reach the 100 must be thrown and the first player to do so is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board comprises a track of 100 spaces spiraling around a painting of a Gloster Gladiator with RAF roundels.  There can have been little playtesting: a player can never land upon the 3 space but it bears the penalty &amp;quot;Fail to rise: miss one throw&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gloster Meteor depicted was notable from 1944 to 1955.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
