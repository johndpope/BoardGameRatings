			<description>From website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZynVaded!&amp;trade; is a tabletop miniatures game unlike any you&amp;rsquo;ve likely seen before, because you literally fight battles on a table top (or desktop, or counter-top, etc.)! In it, you assume the role of one faction of the Zyn, an inch-high, insectile alien race determined to &lt;br/&gt;conquer our planet, one cluttered surface at a time!  You can choose to play as either the Kyll&amp;rsquo;al, the militant arm of the alien invasion, or the Sav&amp;rsquo;m, the  rebellious faction looking to halt the invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control small teams of 28mm miniature aliens, usually 3 or so figures per side, one Leader, one Support and one Scout or Assassin. These figures represent the alien factions fighting to either get a foothold on Earth or to stop the invasion.  Since these figures represent inch high aliens the battle field can be your desktop, itchen table, or any suitable surface, using what ever happens to be there as terain to give your figures cover as as they battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Figures are given stats such as Speed, Melee Combat, Ranged Combat and Body Points (hit points) and can have special abilities.  Combat is D10 based and rules allow close combat and ranged combat.  Players roll against each other for initiatie each turn.  The winner gets to use each figures action points to perform move or combat actions.  Once done the next player does the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playsheets are included.  Players use these to track the status of their figures, one per sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are simple campaign rules allowing figures to gain special abilities or improve their stats over a course of several games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is scenario based and each side is given objectives, the winner is the side to first complete their objectives or alternately the last side standing.  Scenarios can be found on the publiher's web forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with six figures, two Stat Card sheets (which may be copied and should also be available on the publisher's website), two pencils, two 10-sided dice, one measuring tape and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
