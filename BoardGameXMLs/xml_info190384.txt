							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy of Faust</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a witch hunter during 1500's Europe. Go to exotic location, meet exciting people - and burn them for being in league with the devil (after some good old fashioned torture).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy of Faust is another in the d6 Productions line that explores ways in which we can exploit the humble d6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy of Faust is set in the era of the 1500's when the Catholic Church was being split apart by the Protestant reformation. It takes its inspiration from Marlowe's Dr. Faustus with players taking the roles of priests, soldiers, even diabolists trying to keep themselves alive in a world of change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy of Faust presents a simple system where players assign six abilities which affect a subset of skills based upon a character's profession. Characters also have three derived abilities that come into use during combat and spell casting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
