			<description>Promotional Canadian game, issued by the tyre supplier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a track, taking you from Halifax to Vancouver. As usual in these sort of games, if you land on a space with instructions, then you must follow those instructions, be they good or bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you get to one space from winning, you must stop there. You cannot get to Home without rolling a double on the dice. This probably means that you will be there for a few turns which helps others to catch up and make the end of the game a little more exciting. First to Home (Vancouver), wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
