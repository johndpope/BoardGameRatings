			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For thousands of years the dead have invaded the living, haunting our towns and stalking our streets.  Now, it's our turn.  The veil has been torn and the living have found the methods to cross into the Hereafter.  Play as the blessed, exemplars, faekin, magi, psychics and were creatures.  Encounter several secret organizations or even join them on their mission to expand their influence across the globe and into the Great Beyond.  Hunt monsters, uncover mysteries, thwart the advance of evil undead.  But remember, death comes for us all and once your character falls to the darkness they will emerge in the Great Beyond themselves able to continue their adventures in the afterlife or find a way to return to the Land of the Living to take care of their unfinished business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
