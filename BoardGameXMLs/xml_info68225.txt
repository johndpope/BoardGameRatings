							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shards of the Stone: Core</name>
									
			<description>Sourcebook containing Fuzion core rules and some setting information for Shards of the Stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When the lesser gods were instructed to create Life, they cast their powers into the creation of the mystical CoreStone. This nexus of all of the powers of each of the gods carried within it the perfect symbiosis of passion and reason, of order and chaos, of reality and unreality. It was unparalleled in its beauty and simplicity but became the source of envy among some of the gods and soon became the centrepoint of a grand struggle of gods versus gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon, the CoreStone shattered, and with it came the devastation of the Core world in the centre of which the CoreStone was entombed. Shards of the Stone were scattered to the poles of the world and great schisms wracked the landscape as mountains fell and lakes rose from their beds to form the peaks of craggy sentinels of the world's distress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the world into which you are entering. This is the conflict that you will soon become an active participant... or victim of. This is the vision that will become your dream... or your nightmare...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shards of the Stone features the greatest talent in the gaming and fiction industry including Ed Greenwood, Jason Engle, Matt Forbeck, Dan McGirt, Kevin Ranson, Aaron Acevedo, Jared Nielsen and many more. Shards of the Stone is many realms made into one marvelous setting, each with a distinctly unique and imaginative feel with a ShardMaster moderating the realm and helping each one of you as you contribute to the grand setting.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
