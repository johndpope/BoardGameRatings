							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Model 48-B</name>
									
			<description>This game is very similar to Jim Prentice Electric Baseball Model 505, however the pitcher physically rolls a steel ball to down a pathway on the board and the batter has to push a button that will trap the ball between the 'bat' and a contact. With a successful 'hit' various lights will light up either singly or in combination, indicating the outcome of the play. If the batter misses the ball, the pitch can be a strike if it stops in front of a small rise in the pitching track. If the ball goes past the rise, then it is considered a ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introduces some dexterity into the gameplay rather than the outcome being determined by electronics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
