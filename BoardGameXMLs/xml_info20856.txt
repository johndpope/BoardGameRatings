							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batter Up! Spelling</name>
									
			<description>Here's a great game that incorporates a baseball theme using first through sixth grade level spelling words. At three levels of difficulty, students with different learning abilities may play in pairs or small groups in a learning center. Get the whole class involved by creating an overhead transparency from the black-line master included. The game may also be adapted for weekly spelling and vocabulary drill, as well as remedial classes. Grades 1-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
