							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marathon Infinity</name>
									
			<description>Marathon Infinity is the third and final game in the Marathon Trilogy of science fiction first-person shooter computer games from Bungie Software. The game was released on October 15, 1996 and included more levels than its predecessor Marathon 2. These were larger, and formed part of a more intricate plot that spanned both space and time. The underlying engine of the game changed little from the one in Marathon 2, and many levels can be played unmodified in both games. The only significant additions are the Jjaro ship texture set, multiple paths between levels, vacuum-enabled humans carrying fusion weapons (called &amp;quot;Vacuum Bobs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;VacBobs&amp;quot;) and a new weapon. Marathon Infinity, unlike Marathon 2, was originally released only for the Apple Macintosh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer in Marathon Infinity is identical to Marathon 2, except for new maps, such as &amp;quot;Beyond Thunderdome&amp;quot;, an extension on the &amp;quot;Thunderdome&amp;quot; level in Marathon 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Marathon Infinity,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
