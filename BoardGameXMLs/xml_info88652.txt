			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Crude Dudes is an action title for the Sega Mega Drive system. The game takes place in the year 20XX and pits players against the sinister &amp;ldquo;Big Valley&amp;rdquo; organization. A series of nuclear explosions have decimated New York City and transformed its inhabitants into dangerous mutants. An evil scientist, through the &amp;ldquo;Big Valley&amp;rdquo; organization, is conducting experiments on these mutants and trying to make an army of minions out of them. Two operatives have been hired to enter New York City and stop the scientist&amp;rsquo;s diabolical plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control one of two super-powered mercenaries (codenamed &amp;ldquo;Crude Dudes&amp;rdquo;) in their mission into the city to defeat the scientist. The characters are extremely powerful physically, and are able to pick up cars and other objects to use as weapons or projectiles. It is even possible to use the other player as a weapon by picking him up and throwing him at the enemy. Each level is crawling with enemies that players must defeat with punch and kick combos. Players can restore health by punching &amp;ldquo;Power Cola&amp;rdquo; machines which drop soda can pickups when struck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a range of enemies, including werewolves, skeletons, and hunchbacks. Each level is capped with a boss fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
