							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SUP2: Races of Lore</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides classes, races are what really help set apart different characters. It differentiates them not only on physical abilities, but with flavor, personality and color. A part containing a half‐elemental, a dwarf and a Cthulhuoid creature is, in my opinion, more interesting than one composed of only humans and half‐elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What follows are 12 fully‐fledged races for your Blood &amp;amp; Treasure or similar old‐school fantasy game. Some, like the primals and taninim, are based on classic or new races from the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular fantasy roleplaying game. Others, like the tuloids and the gaunts, are entirely original but are based on some familiar characters. You can pick‐and‐choose the races you want to include in your campaign, or just throw them in as a giant free‐for‐all. Either way, I hope you can find something suitable to every player&amp;rsquo;s palette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
