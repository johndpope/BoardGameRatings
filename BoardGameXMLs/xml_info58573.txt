			<description>Players roll dice to determine how many pieces they have to stack on a tower. The dice have numbers from 1 to 3; on a 2 one can decide to challenge an opponent who has to stack one's own pieces or roll a two to defeat the challenge. The first player to run out of pieces gets 50 points; when the tower collapses, the player who caused it gets as many negative points as there were pieces inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
