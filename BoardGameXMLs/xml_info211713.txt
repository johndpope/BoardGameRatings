							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snowdonia: The Battlepuppy Express</name>
									
			<description>The Battlepuppy Express is a double-sided card which is added to the locomotive pool in the Snowdonia board game.  This locomotive introduces a luck based mechanic to Snowdonia. &lt;br/&gt; During the Jack Vasel 2015 charity auction, Tony Boydell offered his services to design a card for Snowdonia.  This is the card which was produced.  For this reason, the Battlepuppy Express is one of the rarest Snowdonia cards as only a few were printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The locomotive is based on the Double Fairlie engines which are used on the Ffestiniog mountain railway in North Wales.  This 'double-ended' design dates back to 1869, and is characterized by the locomotives having a central cab with a firebox, boiler and smoke stack on either side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battlepuppy (a small knitted dog) is a boardgaming celebrity, most often found in North West England. Battlepuppy is well-known for improving the luck of the player is he with.  When a gamer takes possession of this locomotive card, he chooses which side of the card he wants to play with, and he may also borrow the Battlepuppy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
