							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Night Clan</name>
									
			<description>In the northern city of Bergen there lived a duke with seven beautiful daughters. One day, a masked man appeared before the duke with a warning: that night, when the sun set, the Troll &amp;ndash; Giant of the Forest &amp;ndash; would assail Bergen and carry off the duke&amp;rsquo;s daughters and wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the duke, you must hide your Daughters and Riches in various locations around Bergen to hide them from the Troll. For protection, you have enlisted the mysterious Night Watch and allied yourself with the Mistletoe, whose mystical powers can drive off the Troll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Clan is a fast-paced area control game with a hint of deception. Each player is dealt an identical deck of 13 cards. The players take turns placing their cards, two at a time, on the game&amp;rsquo;s locations. Once all cards have been played, the cards placed in each location are resolved and any remaining cards are used to determine which player has achieved victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daughters are played face up and will award their owners 1 Victory Point each if they are not eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;Riches are played face down and will award their owners 2 Victory Points each if they are not eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;Trolls are played face down and will eliminate all cards at their location if not countered by a Mistletoe. If succesfully countered they will award their owners -2 Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;Mistletoes are played face down and will eliminate Trolls at their location. They will award their owners 1 Victory Point if they succesfully counter a Troll.&lt;br/&gt;Nightwatchmen are played face up and allow cards to be moved between locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
