			<description>Head to Head is a crossword game that is played simultaneously between two players. Players grab 14 random plastic letters from a bag, then race against each other to form words on the board, crossword-style, that score points. Squares on the board have varying point values. Players are timed with an egg-timer during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
