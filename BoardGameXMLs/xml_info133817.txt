			<description>The goal in this game for very young kids is to collect as many sets of four equal tiles as possible. The sets are collected on tractor boards. &lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls a die and flips over as many tiles as the die shows. If there are several tiles with the same image, the player takes these and places them on his/her tractor board. All other tiles are flipped back and returned to the middle of the table (everyone tries to remember where). If all tiles are different, the player just chooses one. If a Johnny (the name of the tractor) symbol is rolled, all players pass their incomplete tractor boards to the left (they can keep complete ones). When all sets have been collected, the player with most sets is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
