			<description>In Party Boss, take on the role of the backroom political operative guiding the strategy of one of America's great political parties. Nominate your cronies to challenge incumbents and manage their campaigns. You decide where your party's vast resources will be concentrated. Will your efforts to influence the electorate succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once your politicians have taken office, plot your legislative strategy for the term: select the bills to bring to the floor and how you will go about passing them. Will you use the brute force of your majority, or the crafty tactics of backroom deals and parliamentary maneuvers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of 5 cycles, the boss with the most impact on American governance wins, while the other must retire in obscurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
