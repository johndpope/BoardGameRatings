			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity has reached the next stage in evolution. Men and women all over the world have begun to develop extraordinary powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there are those who fear these new super humans and will stop at nothing to see them destroyed. This has divided the evolved community into two segments: A brotherhood of millitant mutants who want to rid the world of prejudiced humans to user in a new era for mutantkind, and a group of peaceful mutants who believe through mutual compassion and understand humans and mutants can coexist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soldiers in this war live dramatic lives full of heroism, heartbreak, and angst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...You will not be playing as those noble heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, you will be playing the miserable bastards who, inspite of all that is going on around them, are prone to petty jealousy, misplaced ambition, and poor impulse control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
