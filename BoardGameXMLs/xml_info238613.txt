			<description>Rolling CUBES Pytagora is a game to have fun with math and numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains 13 dice made of FSC&amp;reg; wood:&lt;br/&gt;4 green dice with odd numbers&lt;br/&gt;4 blue dice with even numbers&lt;br/&gt;4 red dice with operations&lt;br/&gt;1 orange die with &amp;lsquo;equals&amp;rsquo; signs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play THREE different games PLUS an adaptation of YAHTZEE.&lt;br/&gt;The idea of all FOUR games it to throw all 13 dice and to make an equation from the numbers and operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 point for each die used&lt;br/&gt;- a multiplication sign scores 2 points, a division sign scores 3 points. However, this rule does not apply if you are multiplying or dividing by the number 1&lt;br/&gt;- a double digit number (e.g., 78) scores 3 points (2 for the 7 + 1 for the 8), a three digit number (e.g., 678) scores 6 (3 for the 6 + 2 for the 7 + 1 for the 8) and so on&lt;br/&gt;- 1 bonus point for using 12 dice&lt;br/&gt;- 2 bonus points for using all 13 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME N.1 - ONE BY ONE&lt;br/&gt;Each player throws all the dice in turn, and turns move round clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;There is a target score to win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME N.2 - ALL TOGETHER&lt;br/&gt;Each player needs a sheet of paper and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;The 13 dice are all thrown and left on the table in clear view of all the players. The dice must not be moved.&lt;br/&gt;Each player makes the longest possible equation from the numbers and operations, and writes it on his/her paper.&lt;br/&gt;There is a target score to win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME N.3 - THE LAST DIE&lt;br/&gt;The first player throws all 13 dice and makes an equation with the numbers and operations, moving them around to try and use as many dice as possible. When he/she has finished, it is then the turn of the player on his/her left, who throws only the dice not used for the first player&amp;rsquo;s equation, and tries to make a new equation using at least one new die. The dice used in the initial equation cannot be changed, but can be rearranged to make the new equation.&lt;br/&gt;The round continues with fewer dice at each throw, until the player throwing the dice is unable to add any new ones.&lt;br/&gt;The last person to add a die to the equation wins the round and is awarded 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;The game starts again with a new throw of all the dice&lt;br/&gt;There is a target score to win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME N.4 - YAHTZEE&lt;br/&gt;The 5 combinations are:&lt;br/&gt;- Blue: the equation contains at least 3 blue dice.&lt;br/&gt;If there are 4 blue dice, you have a bonus of 3 points&lt;br/&gt;- Green: the same as Blue, but with green dice&lt;br/&gt;- Red: the same as Blue, but with red dice&lt;br/&gt;- Poker: the equation contains 4 dice of the same colour&lt;br/&gt;- 101: there is a number greater than 100&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
