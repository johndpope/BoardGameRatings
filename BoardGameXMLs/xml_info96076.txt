			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;The timeless distant mist-shrouded isle of Aya-ooya! is marked on no maps, and its location is known to but a few neighbouring island peoples.  To them it is simply known as &amp;lsquo;The Isle of the Volcano God&amp;rsquo; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Aya-ooya! The people live, as they have done since time began, in perfect (if somewhat perilous) harmony with their environment.  There are six main tribes on the island, each with their own land and traditions, and all competing for the resources and the respect of the Volcano God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players on their turn must tend to their needs of their tribe, as well as paying appropriate homage to the Volcano God. The winner shall be the player who&amp;rsquo;s tribe escapes most unscathed from the apocalyptic &amp;lsquo;Wrath of the Volcano God!&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE ISLE OF THE VOLCANO GOD&lt;br/&gt;The board represents Aya-ooya! also known as The Isle of the Volcano God which is separated into six numbered segments, know as lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each land (from edge to centre) consists of shore, light forest, deep forest, lower, mid and upper mountain slopes and terminates at the Mouth of the Volcano God.  The borderlands, exist in two lands simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also printed on the board is the Heart of the Volcano God where unclaimed lava tokens accumulate and the wheel of sacrifice, where sacrifices are recorded for each tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
