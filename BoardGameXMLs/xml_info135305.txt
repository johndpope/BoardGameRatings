							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Take It Easy</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s a puzzle, it&amp;rsquo;s a brain teaser and it&amp;rsquo;s a game! It&amp;rsquo;s all three and much more! It is bingo with strategy! Place your pieces one at a time on the board. To score points, try to form continuous rows of the same color from edge to edge. But one wrong tile and the whole row is worthless. It gets harder as the number of empty spaces on your board, and your possible choices, diminish. Because once a tile is placed, it can&amp;rsquo;t be moved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take It Easy is a simple, yet surprisingly addictive and thought-provoking game that will give you endless hours of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains three game modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Classic Mode: Introduces you to the basic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Puzzle Mode: Test your puzzle solving skills with 100 fun and well-designed puzzles. This exciting new twist to the game will have you swapping pieces in your sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Progressive Mode: Offers 30 stages of different challenges specifically designed for the iOS version. Conquer all stages beforetime runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
