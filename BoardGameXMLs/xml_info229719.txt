							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Estates</name>
									
			<description>A card and board Game for 2-4+ players. The theme is the finances and status of the great country houses built in England and Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries. Each player controls one noble who is making improvements to his estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a circular track with 16 spaces. Pawns are utilised to track movement around the track&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 decks of cards: The Income Deck and the Status Deck. The top 4 cards of each deck are always kept face up and are available for purchase. &lt;br/&gt;-    The income deck has six types of cards: Agriculture, Mining, Industry, Trade, Titles and Credit. These 6 card types correspond to six of the spaces on the game board. Each card has a cost and an income value. &lt;br/&gt;-    The status deck has six types of cards:  Architecture, Style, Collections, Accommodations, Features and Construction. These 6 card types correspond to six of the spaces on the game board. Each card has a cost and a status value&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 20 coins and starts with an Estate Size = 10. Players elect to be one of 5 different aristocrats which gives them a unique starting position (larger estate, extra coins etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn roll one die. You may go either forwards or backwards. If you land on a space that has one or more matching cards face up, you may buy them and place face up in front of you OR if you land on a space that has an income type matching income cards you own you may collect income from them equal to their total income value. &lt;br/&gt;-   If you land on the Country space you may discard all the face up income cards and go again. &lt;br/&gt;-   If you land on the London space you must pay 2 Coins then you may discard all the face up status cards and go again. &lt;br/&gt;-    If you land on the Land space you may pay 2D6 Coins to increase the size of your estate by 1. &lt;br/&gt;-    If you land on the Rent space gain 1D6 Coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any player has more than 30 improvements. End game scoring is then conducted as follows:&lt;br/&gt;-    Add up the status points of all of your status cards.&lt;br/&gt;-    Get an extra 30 points for each complete set owned &amp;ndash; a set is one card from each of the 6 status types.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most status wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
