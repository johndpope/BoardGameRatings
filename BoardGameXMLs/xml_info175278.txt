			<description>Kids dice game. Roll two dice per turn, and pick up either one or two bones, based on the dice combination, or claim an empty bowl. The player with the most bones (or puppies in empty bowls) at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;The box states a starting age of 7, but kids age 5+ should have no problem playing this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: Rolly, the tiny and ever-hungry Dalmatian puppy, is not the only one intent on hoarding as many bones as possible for himself. All his cute little friends are just as eager and make a dash, barking loudly, to empty the doggy bowls. The one who retrieves the greatest number of bones is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
