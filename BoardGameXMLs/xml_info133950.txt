							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RPG Creatures: Bestiary 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains 54* original creatures, made primarily for fantasy role-playing games. Unlike many other manuals of monsters, the artwork in this book has been given a major role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every creature is professionally illustrated and occupies a full color page for visual presence. The statistics are system-independent, easily understood, and the descriptions are imaginative and thorough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This resource was created to enrich the games, campaigns, and settings of those who seek new and inspiring creatures for their rpg experience, but non-gaming fans of fantasy monsters and imaginary life-forms are also likely to find this book rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(This is an interactive eBook. The Table of Contents is thumbnailed and linked directly to the illustrations and descriptions of the creatures. The TOC is also swiftly accessed from most pages of the book.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The PDF was updated 12th of September 2012, and is now an extended version of the original publication. It has grown from 50 to 54 original creatures, and ten extra pages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
