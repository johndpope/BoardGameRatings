			<description>An observation, memory and dexterity game for 2-4 little detectives.&lt;br/&gt;Inside the box there is a castle with ghosts, and a tower in the middle. The ghosts are encrypted cards, hidden in the castle&amp;rsquo;s walls and players can see them thanks to a special red lens.&lt;br/&gt;Inside the tower there are 4 bags, one for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to find the ghosts and try to drop them from the tower inside their bags.&lt;br/&gt;During the game, each player has a target ghost.&lt;br/&gt;During his round, the player moves his detective in the room he wants. He looks with the special lens the ghosts in the room.&lt;br/&gt;After 10 seconds, the player can indicate one ghost:&lt;br/&gt;- if it&amp;rsquo;s the same ghost of his target, he takes 3 little ghosts (each ghost is a small ball). He tries to put them in his bag from the tower. The player draws a new target ghost.&lt;br/&gt;- otherwise, if it same ghost of another player, this player will drop 3 little ghosts. This player draws a new target ghost.&lt;br/&gt;- if nobody has the ghost, the other players will drop 1 little ghost.&lt;br/&gt;If the player thinks that his ghost isn't in the room, he doesn't choose any card: nothing appends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When targets or little ghosts finished, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;Players remove the castle and look at the bags: the player with more little ghosts wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
