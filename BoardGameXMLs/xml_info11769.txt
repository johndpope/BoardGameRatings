			<description>From the Manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s website: Antics is the game guaranteed to get any party going or to make any family gathering the best ever! It's a board game, yes, but don't think you will be spending all your time sitting  round the table. You could just as easily be called upon to imitate a ship's steward during a storm, curl up in a ball and roll across the room, or even rave dance! Worse still, you could find yourself having to tell a joke - and you can't tell the same joke twice. The nervous or shy can opt out of paying a forfeit if they wish - but they then have to move back several spaces. It's a lively, energetic game which allows everyone to display hidden talents. You might even win - that's if you can stop laughing long enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
