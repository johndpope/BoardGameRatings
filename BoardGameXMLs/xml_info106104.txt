			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome is a Japanese professional wrestling video game developed and published by Varie for the Super Nintendo/Super Famicom in 1994.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '94 has a roster of twenty wrestlers from the New Japan Pro Wrestling, including big names like The Great Muta, Jushin Liger, Tiger Mask, and Chris Benoit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wrestling engine uses an energy bar and a power bar. The energy bar indicates how worn out the wrestler is, and the power bar is used for special moves. The grappling is timing based with the strength (strong or weak) of the move taken into account to determine who wins the grapple contest and pulls off their move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few game modes represented including title matches, single matches, tag matches, and tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
