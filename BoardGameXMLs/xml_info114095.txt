							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deeds of the Ever-Glorious</name>
									
			<description>Excerpt from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Military units are just as susceptible to &amp;quot;personification&amp;quot; as any other organisation.  Each Legion tends to take on an identity of its own.  Its deeds are recorded and held in esteem by bards and epic poets.  Its trophies are housed in its headquarters and venerated by successive generations of officers.  Its defeats are over, may take on a religious and clan identity; some Legions bear the honour of a whole temple upon their collective shoulders; others represent the aspirations to glory of an ancient and honourable clan...In view of all this, it is very important for students of Tsoly&amp;aacute;ni culture to have access to some of the more important events in the histories of the Imperial Legions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User notes:&lt;br/&gt;Much of the broader history of the Tsoly&amp;aacute;ni Empire is covered in the individual legion histories making this a valuable sourcebook for game masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
