			<description>A witchcraft themed card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck of 36 cards. The deck is divided into four suits (Ankh, Pentagram, Familiar, and Item) numbered 1 to 9. The players attempt to win each turn by playing the highest ranking card from the same suit as the first card played on the turn. The winner of the turn receives all cards played on the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player who scores the most points. Points are generally based on the value of the Pentagram cards held by your opponents. In addition, bonus points are awarded for holding certain cards or combinations of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
