			<description>Queen of Waves, Lady of the Sea, the Third Storm are all and yet just a few of her names. Her eyes as deep as the ocean, her temper as terrible as a storm, as beautiful and inspiring to her crew as she is fear and reviled by her enemies. Her mere presence in the heat of battle staying her shipmates nerves, her tongue a weapon with which to strike at the honor of her opponents. For their captain her men would gladly make the ultimate sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
