			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flint and Feather is a 28mm, individual figure, tabletop skirmish game system of tribal warfare between the First Nations of the Great Lakes region in the legendary Pre-Contact era. Unleash your Great Warrior and assemble your Warband to raid and plunder your opponent and grow your Orenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack and Defense Card System: This unique combat system gives you the ability to choose the attack or defense maneuver of your key characters providing a critical decision point in the game during each and every melee you may fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medicine Roll Initiative System: This creative initiative system allows interesting aspects of the Native American Indian mythology to be added into the game play and provides the game with more of a feel for the Legendary Pre-Contact period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orenda: This word is the Iroquoian name for the spiritual power inherent in people, animals and the environment. The rich Iroquoian mythology introduces aspects that allow us to creatively add magic, spells and spirit creatures to the game. Of course the wargame purist does not have to add these rules to the game if your inclination is for standard combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
