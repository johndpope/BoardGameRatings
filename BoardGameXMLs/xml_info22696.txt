							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">This Is Your Capital: Canberra Game</name>
									
			<description>What is This is Your Capital Game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Your Capital is a fun-filled, race &amp;amp; chase property game, which all the family can join in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard is a full color representation of your capital and the players compete with each other to race to targeted destinations on the gameboard.  The first player to arrive at the targeted destination will buy that property and recieve a destination card.  The first player to purchase 12 destination cards and return home safely, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there are a couple of catches; firstly, each player receives only a limited amout of This is Your Capital money and in the course of the game, players are required to visit a financial institution to obtain cash, meanwhile giving opponents the opportunity to buy other property's.  Secondly, if an opponent lands on you, he or she can buy one of your destination cards, therefore reducing the number of destination cards you own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the object of This is Your Capital. is to successfully budget your money, buy 12 property's and return home safely, without running out of money and by out manoeuvreing your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AVERAGE PLAYING TIME: 40-60 MINUTES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: OPEN, RECOMMEND 2-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
