			<description>Each player, in turn, rolls the dice and moves one&amp;rsquo;s pawn along the gameboard. A player may buy the property if it is unowned. If the property is owned, the phasing player must pay the owner a fee. (Does any of this sound familiar?) However, the landing player can take the property away by leaving an Agent behind and rolling a seven on the dice. Players with monopolies can form a cartel and share all rewards. A player who has a monopoly risks losing it to another player. Landing on the Court space can let a player wrest a property from another player because of a lucky dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An individual wins by having two monopolies. A cartel wins by having and holding all the monopolies for three turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic molded gameboard is packaged in a massive 26&amp;rdquo; x 26&amp;rdquo; x 4&amp;rdquo; box. Second game released by Hasbro that was endorsed by Jerry Lewis, following High Stakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
