			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible adventure contains background information, GM notes, five maps, and all the details necessary to run this high-level planar adventure! The adventure is designed to stand on its own, for four to six players with levels ranging from fifteenth to seventeenth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries of unlife do strange things to a lich&amp;rsquo;s mind. Leander d&amp;rsquo;Arstond is no exception; driven insane by his long unlife and past brushes with destruction, the brilliant wizard challenges do-gooders to hunt him down. D&amp;rsquo;Arstond is no ordinary lich, however, and those who treat him as such are in for a dangerous surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to bring the lich down forever, characters must undertake an extraplanar journey of epic proportions before finally confronting the evil-doer in his lair. Failure is not an option for the characters, as the lich will then continue his evil machinations against the forces of good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gaming Paper Adventure Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A stand-alone adventure for 4&amp;ndash;6 players, levels 15&amp;ndash;17.&lt;br/&gt;     6 maps&lt;br/&gt;     Numerous illustrations to help immerse you and your players in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fractured Phylactery is an adventure for 15th&amp;ndash;17th level characters. Written by John Ling, maps by Robert Lazzaretti, and with stunning artwork by Joel Biske this adventure is compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
