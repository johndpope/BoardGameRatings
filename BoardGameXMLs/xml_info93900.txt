			<description>Back of case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once inside the gymnasium the international competition is heavy. It's the Sega Volleyball Championship Tournament where eight nations are competing to be the winning team. And what makes you a winner depends first on what team you choose to represent your playing skills and then, what you choose to make their expert playing features. You're up against a crafty Cuban center with a taste for sideline spikes. How do you receive with a quick set and a slow and evasive return you may just watch their point lead disappear. It's your serve and you aim for their weak point, the corner court, but they've beat you to it. Next time put some spin on the ball and watch that serve win a point in your favor. But this was just a goodwill match, now you've been called against China for some serious tournament play. First hit the practice game to warm up, and then it's on to the true test of your skills. Triple men blocks and delayed attacks are more moves that you can make to close in on your opposition. Because the more sophisticated your playing the faster the game and the sooner the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
