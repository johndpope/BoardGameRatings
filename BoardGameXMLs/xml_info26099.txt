							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a space exploration game for kids.  Players race through space using one of five metal spaceship playing pieces collecting treasure on the planets and space stations located on the board.  Players have the option of selecting one of two numbers after spinning for their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Australian version was produced by John Sands (Sydney) under licence from Parker Brothers. The concept of the game is the same but considerable differences in graphics can be seen on the board, spinner and box. The US version shows the Americas visible from earth while the Australian version shows Australia and south-east Asia. The spaceship playing pieces are the same as the US game although the instructions suggest only 4 players instead of 5 in the US version. As players advance around the board they collect (or lose) gold nuggets which are simply small stones painted gold. This also seems to differ from the collecting pieces in the US version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
