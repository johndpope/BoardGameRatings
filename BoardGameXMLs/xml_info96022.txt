							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Can Be the Stainless Steel Rat</name>
									
			<description>Harry Harrison wrote this book. Players do not actually take on the role of the Stainless Steel Rat; instead, the player is a new recruit in the Special Corps under his command while tracking down an evil scientist trapped on a prison planet. There is no game system as such, though coin flipping comes into play from time to time. The challenge level is decidedly low, since it is actually impossible to fail the mission. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly typical paragraph driven system where players move from one paragraph to another based upon their decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a parody of adventure books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of the book, Dragon advert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
