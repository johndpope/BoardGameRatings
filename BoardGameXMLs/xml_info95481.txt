			<description>Q&amp;bull;bitz 100 Card Expansion Pack includes exactly what it says in the title. For those not familiar with Q&amp;bull;bitz, here's a rundown of game play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Q&amp;bull;bitz players use their special blocks to recreate patterns, claim cards and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round, someone reveals a Q&amp;bull;bitz card (out of a deck of 100 cards), then players race to assemble their specially colored blocks in the pattern shown on that card; the first player to do so claims the card. In the second round, players must roll their blocks like dice to find the iamges that they need to recreate the pattern on the card. In the third round, all players look at the card for ten seconds to try to memorize the pattern, then they work on recreating that pattern by memory; the round ends when someone calls for it to end, with the player who successfully recreated more of the pattern than anyone else claiming the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three sets of three rounds, the player who claimed the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands game: Q•bitz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
