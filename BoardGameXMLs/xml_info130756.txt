			<description>Are you ready for an exciting electoral campaign? In Si la tendance se maintient simulates, in 2-5 hours, a full electoral campaign, day by day. Players represent political party leaders in a generic Western parliamentary democracy using pure proportional representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of the game, players will manage a hand of cards that they, over 28 campaign days, use to attack each other, as they try to increase their voting intentions at the expense of other players. Taking into account their voting intentions and the strength of their partisans, players elect a certain number of MPs. A majority player will automatically win, but a minority situation will allow players to form a coalition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by a well-known member and executive of the New Democratic Party of Canada, Si la tendance se maintient, a French-only game, includes several appendix aiming at generating a discussion about the nature of politics, and of its institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
