							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribes Most Foul: Ogres</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bored of pitting your PCs against boring, one-dimensional kobolds, orcs and goblins? Want to provide your monstrous minions with style and flair in appearance, mannerisms and battlefield tactic? Then, Tribes Most Foul is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each supplement presents three tribes in rich, flavoursome detail and includes notes on the tribe&amp;rsquo;s society, practises, ecology, lair, battle tactics and notable tribal personalities as well as sample stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes Most Foul: Ogres presents three ogre tribes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Masters of the Cauldron: Wastrel bards sing of the greatest feasts held in the royal courts, magnificent decadent orgies of succulent meats, delectable pastries and mountainous cakes. The pinnacle of the chef&amp;rsquo;s art is a trio of mysterious itinerant cooks, the Masters of the Cauldron, whose secret recipes make even these legendary debauched banquets taste like ashes.&lt;br/&gt;    The Cauterised Host: Hulking, scarred monstrosities that bestride the battlefield behind a wall of flaming, smoking steel, the Cauterised Host cannot be stopped, or reasoned with, but they can be bought for the right inducement. The warriors of the band spend their blood gold on feeding their addiction to the insidious drug Zerk, before repeating the cycle of death, gold and dissipation.&lt;br/&gt;    The Mottled Lurkers: Hidden in the foliage of the towering forests, the green-skinned Mottled Lurker tribe clambers from branch to branch, waiting for unsuspecting prey to pass beneath. The Mottled Lurkers drop from above to crush their victims in their vice-like grips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
