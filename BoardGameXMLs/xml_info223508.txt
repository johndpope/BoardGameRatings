			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two screams cut through the fog. Two screams from men as they died. Death did not come naturally. There was talk of murder, bestial murder, committed in hatred...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A girl in a narrow street. She is afraid, tears disfigure her heavily-painted face. She keeps to the side of the street, seeking anonymity in the shadow, as she tries to avoid the many puddles that fill the gaps among street rubble. She passes a sleeping man. His tattered uniform is covered with vomit, his breath stinks of cheap rum...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is autumn in London, 1951. Over a hundred German divisions have put an iron ring around the Empire's capital. Besieged in the third year, the defenders are on the brink of collapse. Only Churchill's staunch defense will keep the light of hope burning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario was played at Fastaval 1996 and Fastaval 2009. It is provided as three PDF documents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        58-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;        20-page print-and-play pre-generated characters&lt;br/&gt;        11-page print-and-play handouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
