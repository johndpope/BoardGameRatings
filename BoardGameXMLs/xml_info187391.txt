			<description>Masters of the Tourist Trophy is a motorcycle racing sports replay game simulating the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. The Isle of Man TT has, for many years, been regarded as the most prestigious and oldest motorcycle race in the world... and also the most dangerous motorcycle road-race in the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is typical of Lambourne's sports replay simulations in that it takes place on tables and charts (no board or counters) with minimal player decisions required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation has been developed to capture the confused progress of the Isle of Man mountain bike races. With drivers setting off at different times, the system is able to record both the positions on the course from a spectator viewpoint as well as keep track of the actual driver times for determining a race winner. As in the actual Tourist Trophy, crashes and mishaps are common and not all riders can be expected to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes race control sheets for six different classes of race, from the ultra-lightweight 125cc bikes to the Formula One 1200cc monsters. The famous TT sidecars are also represented in a class of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drivers represented and rated are drawn from the &amp;quot;all-time greats&amp;quot; from over 100 years of Tourist Trophy events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief outline of the Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race is set up on a Race Control Sheet that lists Driver Name, Driver Rating and Start Time. For each stage of the race every driver rolls two pairs of dice (red and green) to advance their progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference between the green &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; and red &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; dice, when added to the driver performance rating, determine whether the driver performance improves or degrades on each stage of the lap. Comparison of the driver performance ratings will reveal the order of the drivers on the circuit as they pass each checkpoint on the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling doubles on either pair of dice may improve or degrade the driver performance rating, but rolling double &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; requires a further roll on Rider Mistakes or Mechanical Trouble charts. Such problems usually result in a performance loss, but can also cause retirement through a crash or serious mechanical failure. Game charts will determine the precise location of each such accident on the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drivers must also elect to Pit Stop at least once during the race. This can be dome at a time decided by the player and requires a die roll and chart reference to determine the effect the pit stop has on race time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the lap the cumulative performance for each of the four lap stages can be cross-referenced against the game charts to determine the lap time and average speed for each driver on the circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
