							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Card Counting: A Strategic Player vs. Player Game</name>
									
			<description>Players place bets on their own game board. Stackem up high, or place smaller bet amounts. Part of the challenge is bringing in a profit that keeps your bankroll growing. Watch out, the person next to you may just overbet the same winning number resulting in you having a smaller payday then what you should have earned. It's just like betting horses. The odds of a card being turned over are determined by the cards you see face up. The payout odds however are determined by the bet value on the winning number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bankrupt your rivals before the end of a round, or have the most chips at the end of a round to win the game. It's that simple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
