							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hybrid Class: The Psychemist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Spirits Are Real, They Can Be Harnessed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the thin film of reality exists the deeper unknown of the spirit world; a haunted realm that connects mortals to strange entities that live beyond the veil of death. Some cultures worship the spirits dwelling in these occult realms. Some fear them. Others seek to connect them, sequestering them for aid, advice, or guidance. The psychemist rejects all such pursuits. To the psychemist, it makes no difference which well he draws spirit essences from&amp;mdash;real or imagined. He sees them as strands of power to be distilled and bottled. Four Horsemen Present: Hybrid Class &amp;ndash; The Psychemist presents a new occult class combining the occult nature of the medium with the tinctures and distillations of the alchemist. This character&amp;rsquo;s radical philosophy allows him to use power such as occult alchemy, pnumea, spectral mutagens, psychic haunts, and spectral grenades to achieve his often self-serving goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes the psychemist class, new class-related feats, spirit legends the psychemist can access with spiritual mutagens, and a list of spectral grenade effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
