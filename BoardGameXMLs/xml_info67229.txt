							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vale of the Mages</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vale of the Mages houses four wizard&amp;rsquo;s towers. A river forms a &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; through the vale&amp;rsquo;s cliffs and woods. The first tower is a classic old and cozy round wizard tower; a small three-storey building constructed with smooth river rocks. The tower features all the necessary for a wizard and an apprentice; a small laboratory, a kitchen, and bedrooms. The second one is a larger square tower, it&amp;rsquo;s perhaps a tower built to house more than one apprentice and for a more ambitious sorcerer. The third one is the largest tower of the vale; perhaps it is an archmage&amp;rsquo;s tower. It features a large garden surrounding the main building, stables, a small dungeon and a central six-levels tower. The last tower is a ruined one; few things remains of this ancient round tower, but adventurers will find for sure something for them!&lt;br/&gt;You can use the vale as it is, with all the four towers together or use each tower singularly, as best fit in your ongoing campaign. Some hints to use the vale follow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The four wizards dwelling in the vale are battling each other from centuries for a magic items buried somewhere in the vale, they eventually slew one of them blasting his tower with fiery magic; the PCs enter the vale and meet the ghost of the dead wizard who has discovered the magic items and asks to the PCs to retrieve the item in order to prevent the other wizards from finding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The PCs receive a letter for an old friend wizard inviting them in the vale. When arrive they find the tower destroyed and their friend dead. The last annotation in the old wizard journal says one of the wizards dwelling in the vale was arriving in visit. The PCs must find their friend&amp;rsquo;s murderer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Four wizards were researching a powerful magical item for their king, but from weeks, nobody receives news from the vale. The PCs are sent to investigate; once in the vale, they find the towers empty, and one of them destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
