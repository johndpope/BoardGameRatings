			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the high flying adventures of the Lucha Libre world and masked wrestlers, this RPG is as much about wrestling as adventure.

Using a point based system to create your Wrestler, you can choose skills and from a number Moves, Holds, and Pins to do battle inside and out of the ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start out in the lowest rungs of La Liga de los luchadores enmascarados, The League of Masked Wrestlers, on a tour that criss-crosses the countryside looking for places to hold matches to you may advance up the rungs and to get yourself ready for the eventual return to the big cities where the real competition will held during the winter. Along the way you will meet other Luchadores both friendly and felonious and quite possibly from the corrupting and cunning counter league of La Liga de los Diablos Magn&amp;iacute;fico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures you can have will range from defending towns from invading aliens to wrestling ancient Aztec mummies to possibly saving the world from unknown dark gods all with the power of your Lucha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
