			<description>From the Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Frantic, Fast-Paced Game of the Lunch Hour Rush&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DING! Order up! It&amp;rsquo;s the lunchtime rush at Flo&amp;rsquo;s Diner and the place is packed. You and your fellow servers are busting hump to get customers their food and get them back to work. The short order cook sends out food as fast as he can make it, but the orders just keep coming. Your feet are killing you as you give the trucker in the corner his fifth free refill on his coffee when Flo herself calls you all together. Whoever serves the most customers this rush gets to go home early. Sounds like a dream come true, because Trucker Bob just finished his coffee and is eying you for yet another refill. Time to get out there and sling some hash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short Order is a high-speed turnless card game where players race to complete as many orders as possible before the end of the lunch rush. It&amp;rsquo;s all the madness with none of the mess!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/short-order&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/short-order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
