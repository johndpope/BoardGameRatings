			<description>You Must be 18 or Older to Enter recreates the feeling of being a prepubescent kid looking at porn for the first time. Through interactive fiction elements combined with ASCII styled art, &amp;lsquo;You Must be 18 or Older to Enter&amp;rsquo; blurs several genres together to create an anxious experience. It is akin to horror yet the fear is of being caught by parentals and being embarrassed of looking at the human body. The ASCII art makes the images hard to read close up, making the player embody a child-like role. Audiences at farther distances will be able to see the pictures more clearly, casting them in the role of adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;In December 2017 the game was banned and pulled from Steam as it was considered as a porn game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
