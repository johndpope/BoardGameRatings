							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I SPY Spectacular</name>
									
			<description>20 years ago, Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick created the first title in their bestselling I Spy series, I Spy: A Book of Picture Riddles.   What's a 20th anniversary without a &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot; kind of game? Introducing I Spy Spectacular, a one-of-a-kind game with a 3-tiered spinner that will send you over the edge looking for picture matches. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the I Spy series, new riddles from Jean Marzollo are paired with 13 of Walter Wick's photographs from the classic I Spy vault to create a spectacular search-and-find game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Spy Spectacular Game is a matching game that centers around a 3-level spinner with cards to match the items on the spinner complete with I Spy's trademark riddles. This game contains one three-level spinner, which when spun locks into place one level at a time for hundreds of possible combinations of items on the spinner. The 36 double sided cards have a different combination of items on each one. Every spin will have a card to match one of the combinations it produces. Kids scramble to be the first to find a match and score 1 of the 50 score chips. The rules cotain more than one game play depending on the age group playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And don't forget the riddles that become a fun and creative activity at the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
