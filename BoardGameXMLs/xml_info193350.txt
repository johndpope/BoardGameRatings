			<description>1980's Apples to Apples Snack Pack can be played as a standalone game or combined with any other Apples to Apples games to bring new choices into play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apples to Apples consists of two decks of cards: Things and Descriptions. Each round, the active player draws a Description card (which features an adjective that might be &amp;quot;Gnarly&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Mental&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Harsh&amp;quot;) from the deck, then the other players each secretly choose the Thing card in hand that best matches that description and plays it face-down on the table.  (Things might include &amp;quot;Wastoid&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bootleg CD&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Pac-Man&amp;quot;)  The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Thing card that, in his opinion, best matches the Description card, which he awards to whoever played that Thing card. This player becomes the new active player for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box suggests 3-4 players because of the number of cards available.  But with integrated sets it easily plays with 8 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
