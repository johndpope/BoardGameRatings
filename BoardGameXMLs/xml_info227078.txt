			<description>Chwedlau Cymru / Legends of Wales is a card game featuring creatures and monsters from Welsh mythology such as the Twrch Trwyth or the Red Dragon itself. Each of the cards features a different creature along with a value attribute (up to 10) and a set of attribute scores: Strength, Skill, Magic and Fear, as well as a &amp;quot;size&amp;quot; attribute that can either be small, medium (i.e. man sized) or large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On its simplest level, it can be played as a deck of Top Trumps cards for 2-4 players. The set however also comes with rules for playing a slightly more complex 2-player card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this version of the game, players take it in turns to draft a hand of 5 cards from the deck, with a maximum total value of 30. Both players will be able to see which cards their opponent is drafting. The undrafted cards form a draw deck. One of the four main values is then drawn at random by drawing the top card of the deck a, and the players decide on an order for their cards; this order cannot then be changed. The cards will then face off against their opponents in order, comparing the values drawn. The players thus need to try and second-guess which cards they think their opponent will place in which order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This initial first round is won by the player who won the most of the five faceoffs between the cards. The &amp;quot;defeated&amp;quot; cards are discarded and replacements are drawn randomly from the deck (back up to five cards) for the next round. The game is decided by a best-of-three of the three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This initial set focuses on monsters and creatures. The publisher claims that more game modes will be added with future card sets / expansions, which may feature more individual characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most distinctive feature of the game is the unique artwork by cartoonist/designer Huw Aaron. The initial print run featured separate Welsh-language and English-language sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
