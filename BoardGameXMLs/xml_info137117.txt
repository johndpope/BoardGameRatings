							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unique Magic Wands, Staves and Rods</name>
									
			<description>from How to Use This Document:&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of Unique Magic Wands, Staves, and Rods is to give Dungeon Masters a way to add some spice to the magic items found in their games without the need to create lots of potentially overpowering special cases. Every item listed in this document has a name, description, and powers. By using this document, you never have a simple &amp;ldquo;wand of fireballs&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;snake staff.&amp;rdquo; Instead, each wand, staff or rod discovered in the game is unique in some fashion, so that the characters discover &amp;ldquo;Turjan's Ineffable Wand&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Aaron's Staff of the Serpent.&amp;rdquo; The item descriptions can by used by a DM as rumors, adventure hooks, or as fruits of PC research within the game. In many cases, the description may give a hint of a wand, staff or rod's functions. The fact that each item listed here has a name and description should signify to players that it is an important item. They can also be used as starting points for PC research into command words or powers of the items found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stats involved are derived from the Mentzer Basic, Expert and Companion sets and the AD&amp;amp;D DMG, and should be compatible with all Classic editions from Gygax/Arneson ('74) through Allston ('91), as well as AD&amp;amp;D and retro-clone systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;Unique Magic Wands, Staves and Rods offers categorised listings of new, unique magical items for D&amp;amp;D (Basic/AD&amp;amp;D) and its retroclones.  The items have a description and an explanation of their properties and effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
