			<description>Rows of three fruits are the aim of the game! Strawberries, grapes and pears are depicted either in a square, a circle or a triangle in yellow, blue or red. The tiles are heaped face-down and  each player draws three tiles. In your turn you place one of your tiles on the board to complete a row of three either of the same fruit or the same color or the same background shape. Each completed row of three earns you a chip, and of course you can complete more than one row with one tile and use rows already placed as part of a new row. When all spaces on the board are filled you win with most chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
