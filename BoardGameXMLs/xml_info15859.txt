			<description>This game is based on the Grimm fairy tale featuring Little Red Riding Hood. Each player picks a character, which, unlike most other childrens games, have different goals: Little Red Riding Hood must get to grandmas house without being caught by the wolf. The wolf must try and catch Little Red Riding Hood and at the same time watch out for the hunter. The hunter wins the game if he manage to shoot the wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
