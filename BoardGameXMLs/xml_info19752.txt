			<description>Bring home the excitement of a Las Vegas casino into a board game.  Players work their way around the board as a group and play all the great casino games, including Poker, Blackjack, Roulette and Craps.  The winner is the player with the most money when crossing the finish line.  The journey around the board is alive with activity and has its own brand of Vegas-style pitfalls and inspirations. &amp;ldquo;Real Vegas&amp;rdquo; is a new concept that combines all the extremely popular elements of casino play into one outstanding game. Great fun for when friends or family get together for theme nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
