							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delivery Duck</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a duck, in a truck, delivering packages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately ducks aren't very good at doing deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;Crates fall of vehicles and other players can steal your cargo!&lt;br/&gt;Delivery Duck is a strategic family game for 2 - 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay centres around picking up and delivering cargo. Depos are placed around a dodecagon shaped board. Each turn a player picks up cards that determine the starting location and destination of cargo. Then they place a terrain tile to help them traverse the board or stop others, before moving their vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to earn 10 victory points. Cargo comes in multiple types, each with its own monetary and VP value. Strategy comes in deciding which vehicle to use considering terrain, resources on the board and other players actions. Action cards further modify the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
