							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Citibank Worldwide Banking Game</name>
									
			<description>This game was designed for the First National City Bank of New York, which has since become Citibank. The objective of the game is to collect the cards representing the 7 banking services offered by the bank in 1964, Savings Account, Checking Account, Trust Service, Overseas Service, Personal Banking, Travelers Checks, and Loan Service. Once a player has collected he or she can declare CITIBANK at which point all of the players total up the dollar amounts on the cards that they have collected and the player with the highest total wins. Cards are collected by landing on spaces around the board after rolling. Once cards are collected they are placed face down on the table in front of the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
