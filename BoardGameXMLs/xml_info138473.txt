							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Granny Drake</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every village seems to have one - the village Granny. The old woman who has lived forever in a tidy, but small hut out by the outskirts of the village. She never hurts anyone and always has a kind word for people. She owns a good pair of sturdy boots has a great sense of family dedication and loves to cook. She often has several generations of offspring and seems unnaturally long lived and energetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She's also a bit off, often wandering in to the creature infested woods at odd hours of the night. Inevitably she returns several hours later none the worse for wear, occasionally with a bugbear cub in tow and saying things like &amp;quot;Isn't he just a darling?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a reason these elderly ladies can traipse through monster infested, deep woods without receiving anything worse than a twig in the hair. They have been literally taken under the wing of a Granny Drake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
