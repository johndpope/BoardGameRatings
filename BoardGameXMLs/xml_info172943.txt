			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 700 System Neutral Ways to Describe Combat on 120 Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all been there. You're running your favorite table-top RPG and it's combat time. You roll the dice, hit, then calculate damage. What does the GM say?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You hit for 17 damage.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will he say next time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You hit for 16 damage.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Booor-ing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the game is so imaginative, so immersed in the world; let's not let combat be the one thing that breaks the flow. Instead, we propose enhancing your combat narrative with this easy-to-use descriptive card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the Cards: Use these cards as inspiration to add depth, excitement and drama to your fight scenes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Choose from the below categories, a suite of cards that best match the type of damage your character inflicts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BLUNT: Damage caused by non-penetrating force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SLASHING: Damage caused by a sharp edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIERCING: Damage caused by a sharp point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Choose one of the styles below, based on the style of combat being performed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FINESSE: A character who fights with style and grace, like a Swashbuckler or Martial Artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POWER: A character who fight is based on strength and vigor, such as the Barbarian or Thug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RANGE: A character who is using a thrown or distance weapon such as a javelin or bow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action Word and Card Stacking: You can select one or multiple action words to describe your attack. For example, 1 card could provide a 'Stylish' attack while 2 could provide a 'Stylish' and 'Deceptive' attack.  Draw as many cards as you like and use action words provided to enhance your description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, each action word contains two descriptions to serve as examples. There are one non-deadly description and one killing blow description (skull). Use them as written or modify them to best fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This storytelling tool:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Encourages writers to show the effects of strikes, not just say it was painful. &lt;br/&gt;     Adds depth and drama to any of your story's combat scenes. &lt;br/&gt;     Is great for Gamemasters who wish to better express their players' hits, damage or injury. &lt;br/&gt;     Players can have cards that describe their characters' combat style the best. &lt;br/&gt;     Can tip your essay, blog, novel or gaming table from good to great! &lt;br/&gt;     Is written for any genre. &lt;br/&gt;     By design, is system neutral and super flexible. &lt;br/&gt;     Is both a reference and a brainstorming tool. &lt;br/&gt;     Offers fresh ways to describe death blows. &lt;br/&gt;     Includes a collage of beautiful card art from Rafael Dorsz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
