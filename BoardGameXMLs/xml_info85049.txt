							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Market Square</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Market Square lies at the heart of any rural village, growing town or bustling city. Merchants and traders from every land come to sell their common goods and exotic wares. If adventures seek basic supplies, a rare reagent or even information for their next quest, they are sure to find it here. This map depicts a number of intersecting streets lined with vendor booths and stands. A proud statue stands in the middle of the square overseeing all of the shady dealings. Numerous buildings surround the square, including a livestock pen and a burnt out ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Game Mats are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal battle grids for staging encounters during your adventures! The mats lie flat for ease of play and are sold in a sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. The Game Mats measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and are marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
