			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A debilitating illness has crippled Waterdeep&amp;rsquo;s city guard, leaving no one to deliver much needed supplies to the city&amp;rsquo;s northern outpost Swordhold, or relive the troops there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile a patrol of rangers from Swordhold recently stumbled onto the lair of the white dragon Borealis. They found the lair empty as Borealis was hunting during the discovery. Realizing what they had found, and recognizing that the creature was not long gone, the rangers only took a few select items from the dragon&amp;rsquo;s stash, and made their way back to Swordhold to report their find and muster the reinforcements they were expecting from Waterdeep any day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
