			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Konami GT (also known as Konami RF2 - Red Fighter) is a 1985 racing video game released by Konami, using their GX400 architecture. The player drives a sports car which must reach various checkpoints without running out of fuel. A turbo mode (activated by the gear shift) increases the car's speed but uses more fuel and puts the player at a higher risk of hitting an obstacle. Fuel power-ups can be found on the road which the player must pick up to make it to the final checkpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
