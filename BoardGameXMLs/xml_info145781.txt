							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Command: The Physical Edition</name>
									
			<description>War Command is a physical edition of a computer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a card game which borrows elements from tabletop RPGs and tactics games to create a new strategic experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Company information states; &amp;quot;It combines the deck building elements of a Trading Card Game with the strategic positioning of a battle field environment. Players move Character Cards around on a board, playing Support Cards from their hand in concert with Character movements and attacks in a mad race to destroy the other player's Commander Card first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game takes place in the far future on the planet Haven, which, due to a cataclysmic wave of radiation, will soon be the last livable planet in the galaxy. Upon learning of the impending disaster, Humanity quickly scrapped what civilization remained on earth and took to the stars; arriving at the shielded planet just in time to survive the interstellar catastrophe. Unfortunately for them, they hadn't planned on its pulsing gravity field or violent magnetic storms. Doubly unfortunate for them, they weren't the only ones.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
