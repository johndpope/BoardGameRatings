			<description>Tricky Trigon is a game for two, played on a hexagon-shaped lattice of triangles with 91 points, six to each side.  The lines alternate in the colors red and blue, and a central section of six triangles is shaded in red.  Along the outside edges of the board are alternating starting positions marked for red and blue, nine for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving one of their nine pieces towards the center of the board, where to win the game they must form a triangle with six of their stones, with at least two of those stones in the shaded central area of the board.  Players move one space at a time and may trap opponent's pieces by blocking them on either side in a straight line.  The trapping player then gets an extra move, and the trapped piece is removed and replaced anywhere on the outer points of the board.  The first player to form his triangle wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
