							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HTML Double Solitaire</name>
									
			<description>The game is designed to promote a holistic view of html programming. Beginning learners often practice the parts that make up a html document, but many times, do not put together entire documents. The game will help students see how to construct entire documents. It will provide opportunities to try various ways of constructing html documents. It will also serve to aid retention of the structure of html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to play all of the cards in your pile. All players use the center piles to build documents. There may be up to four documents in the center area. When a document is closed, by playing a card, the cards are removed from the center area and a new document can be built in its place. Documents begin with a card. All documents must have: a title, a header, a picture, text, a link. Play continues until one player has played the last card in their pile and become a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;212 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
