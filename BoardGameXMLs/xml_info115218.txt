			<description>Nobody knows how the enigmatic Prince Lucanor selects his agents. The motivations that bring someone like him to choose wholly disparate individuals to join their organization are also a mystery. Regardless they are all bound to Wissenschaft by ties stronger than loyalty. Some owe their lives to the Prince or have found in Wissenschaft the only place they truly feel at home. While they may not all appear to have anything in common, Wissenschaft is the focus of their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Wissenschaft Prowler - Lv. 20+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 4 | Dm 3 | Df 9 | Ar 0 | LP: 10 | Re 8 | Mo 8/12 | AP 2/4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agent: Wissenschaft Agents are not unique characters and you may include 1 for every 150 Levels in an Wissenschaft Party.
