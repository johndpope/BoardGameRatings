			<description>Help the plants to defend the garden from being invaded by sneaky beetles. A swarm of beetles is heading to your garden, help the garden-inhabiting plants withstand the severe attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you will have to fight against hordes of insects that are trying to demolish your garden. In this battle you will stand shoulder to shoulder with the plants living in the garden. Earn coins, upgrade your garden, place more plants, it's all in your hands alone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A serious menace has approached the gentle and snug garden, where various plants have been quietly living - masses of voracious insects rushed to it to fill their maws. The green defenders had to lay aside their everyday jobs to save their tiny motherland. But who will command the defense, who will lead them in action? Head this little army of garden defenders, rescue them from impending doom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
