			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tall figure was alone at the stern of the old decrepit cargo in the bay, striking white flesh in the darkness of the Night; alone against a backdrop of blinding neon lights and monstrous shadows, buffeted by the winds of fate...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He lifted his head against the now raging wind, blue eyes locked on the city nearby... Lights everywhere... but they were hurting. Buildings, immense, omnipotent, choking the life of the city... And at the center, the darkness, ominous, permeating everything and everyone ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was this everything there was to life?... Constantly living on the edge, courting both light and darkness, sanity and madness, peace and violence until a11 is but blurred into a massive swirling grey cloud, and you lose your life to the punk's knife or the drug overdose, cut open by the Edge ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will he too fall prey to a fiery death like so many innocent victims before him? Will everything he has learned and felt just disappear... Faded memories, washed away like tears in the rain? Will he dream?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the cast, and outcasts, of SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST, into an intricate adventure for up to six players in the shadow of the Night's Edge. Become children of the night struggling against an implacable enemy set upon your utter destruction. Wage a desperate battle against ARASAKA, Sun Knights and kin alike. Whatever happens, you will never be the same ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
