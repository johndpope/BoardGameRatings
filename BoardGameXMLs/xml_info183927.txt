			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what we have here is an old school style of a dungeon crawl.  Simple and short, but one of at least three I have planned for this series.  There is something about a graph grid, some ninety degree angle rooms and corridors that make me salivate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I kept this one as honest as I could with old time adventures I would have written back when I was in high school without having Tiamat in the third room and a small army of ghouls in the room connecting.  Those were the grand old days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
