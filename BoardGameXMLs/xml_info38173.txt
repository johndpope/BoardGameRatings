			<description>&amp;quot;Players control rival Thieves Guilds in a Medieval Middle-Eastern city.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an area map displaying the city. The city is divided into nine areas, some of which have special effects. The game uses a custom deck of ninety cards which provide for various events. Each turn a card is placed face down in each section of the map of the city. The players compete to win cards by placing thieves on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Object: Have the most gold at the end of 10 turns. Each thief you control at the end of the game is worth 2 gold.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
