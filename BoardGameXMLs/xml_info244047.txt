			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the fledgling kingdom of Stromar, dark forces conspire. Unholy forces pair with the brutal and conniving goblins in order to control the region, piece by piece. The people of the area have tried their very best to brave such onslaughts but unfortunately their defenses have worn thin. In a last effort, the lady of the village of Narros has sent out a missive to brave heroes looking for aid. With promise of gold, glory, and good reputation a group of heroes have before them a great challenge; will they be strong enough to thwart the attempts to seize the village of Narros? Will they have what it takes to journey out to the foul coves where evil lies? What is the grand scheme behind all of these efforts and is it already too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6-8 hour adventure module for 3-5 characters of 1st and 2nd level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
