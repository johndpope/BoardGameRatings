			<description>From the Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-Tally-8! A mathematics board game that is an excellent teaching tool for grades 2-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: Four children or teams assemble, open the box, unfold the board, take number tiles and start. Little preparation required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score by putting equations on the board and adding up the numbers. Level of involvement is high, the atmosphere is gently competitive and encourages appreciation of the number skill of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children can also play as buddies or in teams, creating a fun route to a smiling classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
