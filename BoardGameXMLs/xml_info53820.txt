			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;3 Solo Adventures in one book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Cat's Away &lt;br/&gt;by Catherine DeMott&lt;br/&gt;In your first adventure you are an apprentice to Servald the Wizard, who has left you alone in his sanctuary, while he is on business. For the first time, you have a chance to really explore the place. What mischief can you get into before he gets back, and will you survive long enough to find out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerer Solitaire &lt;br/&gt;Rewritten by James L. Walker&lt;br/&gt;The Aged One sends you out on a quest to the Cursed Vaning House in search of the Princess Nanus and to solve the riddle of what happened at that dark place some 50 years ago. There are great magical treasures and just as many evil guardians hidden in the old ruin. Can your wits &amp;amp; magic succeed where others have failed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo for the Intellectually Challenged&lt;br/&gt;by Rick Loomis&lt;br/&gt;You are a peasant, tending a flock of sheep, when you find a cave in the mountains. The cave looks as if its filled with dangerous magic ... so you decide to go in! Are you stupid enough to survive the ultimate solo parody?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the inside:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sorcerer Solitaire was originally published by Flying Buffalo as Solo #10. That book (by Walter Vanning) has been out of print for some time. This new version is completely rewritten, with some of the concepts from the original Sorcerer Solitaire integrated into this new version.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
