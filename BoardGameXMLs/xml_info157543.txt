							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizards &amp; Wastelands</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Wizards &amp;amp; Wastelands provides rules for magical spells in the Mutant Future role-playing game. You will need an extra rulebook to make use of this system &amp;hellip; the Labyrinth Lord rulebook and you will need it for the magic used in this supplement. This is a world where technology and magic collide. There are ones who can cast spells, which will be discussed later. There are robots and laser rifles, buried within the ruins. Some believe that magic is merely a product of a powerful mind. Others believe it to be what they see it to be...magic. Some may find a flashlight, only to think it is a magical torch that does not burn. There is definitely a fine line between what is truly magic or misunderstood science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
