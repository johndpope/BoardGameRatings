			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a lair? A place where living creatures sleep and eat? A haven from an unsure world? Your own home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look around you. Most likely, you are sitting in your lair right now. You have many things around you, all of them arranged with thought and purpose. Whether at home, at work, or at school, you are in an environment in which you have spent a great deal of time and have put considerable mental effort toward optimizing for your comfort and safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, we will discuss the significance of the lair, how the Game Master can make it more interesting for everyone involved, and we'll provide a handful of detailed examples. That way, when the Paladin lops your lopsided head from your ugly&lt;br/&gt;shoulders, at least you will not have died in vain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
