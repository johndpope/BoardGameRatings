							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mosquito Madness</name>
									
			<description>Mosquito Madness is a bug-slapping matching game.  Players frantically race to find the nine mosquitoes pictured on their card. The goal is to be the first to collect all your mosquitoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 72 mosquito discs for all players to see. Each player has a collecting board for the mosquitoes they need to find. Once all players turn over their collecting board, the madness begins as they frantically race to find their matching mosquitoes and slap the disc before another player grabs that mosquito.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is typically played in 5 rounds before declaring a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
