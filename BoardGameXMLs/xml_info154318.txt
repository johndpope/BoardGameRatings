							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kami</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kami are little gods, otherwordly spirits with a single cosmic task or duty to perform, who walk among the mortals of the Tatakama on missions imposed by their divine (or infernal) masters. Kami come in an assortment of kinds, and are as unique as the stars in the sky. All tend to be a bit quirky, obsessed with their task and possessed of unique talents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the celestial (or infernal) hierarchy, Kami are young godlings. Though immortal, and wise in their own way, few are more physically powerful than a mortal man or woman. Often, they are confused by the mundane workings of the everyday world, having known nothing similar in Heaven. They throw themselves into adventure, into warfare, into lovemaking, into craft and artwork, with a zealous passion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
