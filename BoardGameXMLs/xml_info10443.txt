							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cabbage Patch Kids Card Game</name>
									
			<description>On most days, the Cabbage Patch is a quiet, peaceful place. Stumble Bumble BunnyBee and the BunnyBees buzz about, sprinkling their magic crystals onto row after row of ordinary cabbages. And it's these cabbages that magically grow up into The Cabbage Patch Kids! The BunnyBees carry all the Cabbage Patch Kids to BabyLand General Hospital. And from there, Colonel Casey, the Stork, delivers them to caring people like you. But today, Cabbage Jack, the mean old rabbit, is trying to make the Cabbage Patch Kids work in Lavendar McDade's gold mine nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's up to you to rescue the Cabbage Patch Kids from the mine and then bring them home from BabyLand General Hospital. The BunnyBees will help you as much as they can &amp;mdash; pointing you in the right direction. Colonel Casey, the Stork, will help you too. Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
