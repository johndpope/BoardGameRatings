			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;You pause in your search. Dust that has lain in these ruins for centuries claws at your throat. Lifting the wineskin to your lips you notice an oddly-shaped stone just below the ruined carvings at the edge of the ceiling. Strange, you&amp;rsquo;ve looked there a dozen times and never noticed it before.&lt;br/&gt;A shallow symbol is etched in the stone. Brushing away the accumulated grime and dirt, you see the Merithian character for &amp;ldquo;right hand&amp;rdquo;. Smiling at that hard-won bit of knowledge, you turn to your right with renewed confidence in your quest. Ahead, something slithers in the shadows, and your sword seems to leap to your hand&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Wonders Out of Time presents a series of vignettes that can be used individually or together to enrich any fantasy campaign using the d20 game system. In it, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    an overview of the ancient Merithian civilization&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    an abandoned manor filled with great and deadly secrets&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    an old Merithian farm infested with marauding goblinoids&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    hidden knowledge locked away in an ancient fortress that has become home to group of ruthless brigands&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    a mysterious temple ruined by exposure, failing magical wards, and destructive beasts&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    a legendary library that may contain the keys to understanding the Merithians&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Derimos, the fabled capital of the Merithians, now ravaged by time and guarded by its most loyal defenders&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Detailed information on Merithian Blood Sorcery, new items, new monsters and a new Prestige Class, the Centurion Knight&lt;br/&gt;An (sic) vignette sourcebook for characters of 1st &amp;ndash; 12th levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
