			<description>&amp;quot;Crikey! Jerries Over Blighty!&amp;quot; is a print &amp;amp; play game set in the skies of the Second World War, and created by the designer as a Christmas present for his dad after seeing his collection of Spitfire Ale bottle caps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a dexterity game using bottle caps, where two players - one representing the RAF and the other the Luftwaffe - fight to determine the outcome of the Battle of Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win, the RAF player must destroy all of the Luftwaffe's bombers; the Luftwaffe player, on the other hand, wins the Battle of Britain by destroying all of the RAF airfields on the board and by also ensuring that no RAF planes remain on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The files to print for the game  are in the Web Links section at the bottom of this page - the board is the file called &amp;quot;Print and Play Files at Google Docs&amp;quot;, and the rules are under &amp;quot;Game rules at Google Docs&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make the game, just print out the board at A2 size and laminate it (to help with flicking the pieces). All other components are designed to be easily provided by common household items, or by components scavenged from published games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
