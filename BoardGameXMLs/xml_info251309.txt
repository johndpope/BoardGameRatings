			<description>50 Large Cards featuring your favorite Sonic the Hedgehog characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great fun and easy to play! The first to get rid of all their cards is the winner. Beware though, in this game of thrills and spills, you won't be able to win quite as easily as you suspect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this variation on UNO, the deck of cards is dealt evenly out to all players. Each player places his or her deck face down in front of them. The player who is to the left of the dealer turns over the top card of his or her deck. If it is a ring card they place it next to their deck. If it is a character card, they can play it to the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can play an enemy character card on an opponents hero character card to engage in a battle. Players will use one of their ring cards to 'boost' their character in the battle. However, this card is chosen in secret and revealed simultaneously. The player with the smaller ring card is the loser of the battle and takes all cards from the battle and places them in his or her discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player runs out of cards and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
