							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DK Bongos</name>
									
			<description>DK Bongos are bongo-like controllers for the Nintendo GameCube video game series Donkey Konga, Donkey Konga 2, Donkey Konga 3, and Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat. There are two bongos, each shaped like a classic Donkey Kong barrel with a rubber drumskin fastened on top. It also has a built-in microphone to detect clapping. In Japan the controller is called the &amp;quot;TaruKonga&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;TaruConga&amp;quot;) controller. The name is a multilayered pun, combining &amp;quot;Taru&amp;quot; (the Japanese word for &amp;quot;barrel&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;Kon&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Con&amp;quot; (a suffix used by Namco when naming their original peripherals, such as the &amp;quot;GunCon&amp;quot;, or the &amp;quot;TaTaCon&amp;quot;), and Konga (or Conga).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DK Bongos are featured in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as Donkey Kong's Final Smash attack, the &amp;quot;Konga Beat&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Donkey Kong Barrel Blast was originally designed as a GameCube title to be used with the DK Bongos. Eventually the game was moved to Wii, and bongo support was scrapped in favor of the Wii's built-in motion controls. The WiiWare title Pl&amp;auml;ttchen Twist 'n' Paint was also going to support the peripheral. However, N-Europe revealed Nintendo wanted DK Bongo functionality removed to avoid alienating users who do not have them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;DK Bongos,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
