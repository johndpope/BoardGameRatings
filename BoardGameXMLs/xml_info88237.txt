							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hugo&#039;s House of Horrors</name>
									
			<description>Hugo arrives at the house where his sweetheart Penelope was last seen entering on a babysitting assignment. Alas the door is locked, nobody is answering and he is wondering how on earth he can get inside. Aha! Once through the front door he arrives in the hall to see the mad professor Dr. Hamerstein heading for his laboratory upstairs. Hugo decides to scout around before following him. In the third shot Hugo is about to tangle with a particularly nasty pooch. Is it curtains for our hero or does he have the wherewithal to deal with it? Finally Hugo finds himself in a room full of hungry monsters plus one pesky butler that just won't leave him alone. Will he get the chop or can Hugo turn this seemingly hopeless situation to his advantage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
