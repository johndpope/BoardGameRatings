			<description>Dargammon is a game that takes the classic game of backgammon and gives it a new spin. Play backgammon like you've never played before in this clever card game of modified moves and devilish twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game you need a classic set of Backgammon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective, as in classic backgammon, is to remove all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent can do the same. Whoever achieves the objective first, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of some classic backgammon variants and cards that modify gameplay by playing one card during a regular turn. The basic backgammon strategy of trying to move pieces along the playing area remains the same, but many elements may change, from dice results to pieces and their allegiance. Each card in Dargammon has that element of twist and take that, which makes the game even more strategic than before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
