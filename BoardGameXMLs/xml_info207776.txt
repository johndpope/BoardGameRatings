			<description>Last Will is a digital Escape Room experience, where the players need to infiltrate a grand old mansion, where it's deceased owner has filled it with cryptic riddles and weird puzzles, to keep away intruders. They need to work together, to solve the puzzles in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to beat the game, the players need to make their way into the center of a grand old mansion, made by a eccentric and paranoid old professor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will be tested in all manner of skills like logic, perception, maths, communication, timing and riddles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played alone, or in teams of up to 4 players. The mansion is randomly generated each time, so the experience is fresh and challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in ESCAPE ROOM MODE with a countdown clock, or in FREE PLAY where you can set your own pace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has some mild occult and creepy undertones, without going all out on a horror/slasher limb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
