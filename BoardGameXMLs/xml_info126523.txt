							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mega Mindy Bandieten Bowling</name>
									
			<description>Twenty Bandits escaped but Mega Mindy is ready. Try to bowl the bandits of the board with the die. Each bandit you aim of the board is worth one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a dice flicking game where you take the roll of Mega Mindy fighting bad guys. At the end of the board 20 bandit shaped pawns are place and one player starts by flicking the die to the bandits. Knocking them over is not enough you have to flick them of the board to score a point.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of play is dictated by the color on the die. Each player has a color, there is also a neutral side so play goes to the next player or the current player can choose who may go next. If the die drops of the table the next player goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
