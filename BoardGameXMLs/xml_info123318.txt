							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wanted! The rewards</name>
									
			<description>Theme: &amp;quot;In 1808 at Oak City, a mutiny in the prison ends with the escape of all prisoners. The authorities then distribute posters depicting the fugitives, promising appetizing values for each catch. Each player represents a group of armed cowboys who wants to get the opportunity to enrich easily, while working with the sheriff and his co-workers. But the prices set for each capture are not invariable and it will take as much force as diplomacy to pocket.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanted! The rewards is a tactic game of area control, where players must capture the most fugitives they can, for the highest price. Each player has 16 cards (cowboys) with a specific strenght (0 to 5) and special habilities. Each card is played to influence the meeples (fugitives) that borders it. When an area containing meeples is completly surrounded, the player with more strenght wins the current money for each of them (if there is a tie, a duel happens!). Besides surrounding areas containing fugitives, players must also make the better use of their card habilities to obtain the best rewards. This happens because the prices are variable. The player who uses best the &amp;quot;prices market&amp;quot; will take an important advantage, because it's preferable to capture less if the price is higher. Cards may be played face up and face down. For each card side players may choose do to the card hability or not. When playing a card face down, besides the bluff, you may move the &amp;quot;sheriff&amp;quot; of your color up to two intersections. This pawn has a strategic interest, because he strenghts all the player cards of his color by +1 (only the ones he touches). Some strategic combinations of cards can be made to prevent other players to gain a lot of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the basic game players may choose to play it in the advanced mode, which includes a Horse which helps the player who controls it to move his sheriff further, while being stronger, and a Prison (for an ending score).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In June 2012 the game was finalist in the Plateau d'Or Boardgame Design Contest (Canada).&lt;br/&gt;In April 2013 the game was finalist among 138 in Granollers Boardgame Design Contest (Spain).&lt;br/&gt;In April 2013 the game won the &amp;laquo;Coup de Coeur&amp;raquo; prize in the NTPSLM Boardgame Design Contest (Canada) among 124 games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
