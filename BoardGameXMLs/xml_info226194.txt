			<description>Kickin&amp;rsquo; Your Ass is a set collection / take that card game where you try to build your Ass, while kicking other players&amp;rsquo; Asses.&lt;br/&gt;You try to collect each piece of Ass you can get your hands on. Once you have enough Ass to complete your Ass, you win. But along the way, other players are trying to kick your Ass. This of course results in you losing your Ass, or at least some of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a hand of four cards.&amp;nbsp; All cards are drawn from a common deck.&amp;nbsp; You build your Ass out of&amp;nbsp;5 cards, Tail, Back Legs, Middle, Front Legs,&amp;nbsp;Head.&lt;br/&gt;All the while, you play cards to Kick someone&amp;rsquo;s Ass which makes them lose pieces of their Ass. You can try to stop this by playing Get Off My Ass cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can find your ass with both hands, you can play Kickin' Your Ass!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from publisher)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
