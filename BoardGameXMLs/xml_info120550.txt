							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bagdad Tank Invasion</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bagdad (sic) Tank Invasion is a browser game available on newgrounds.com and elsewhere on the web.  The game asks the player to use his tank platoon to secure a landing zone for the Delta Force to enter Baghdad and take out an enemy facility.  In a manner somewhat similar to Conflict on the NES, the player is faced with various tactical dilemmas, such as whether or not to fight an Iraqi recon patrol and whether or not to press into the city.  Battle is automatically resolved, being predetermined and depending on the decision that you made.  If the Delta Force manages to destroy the facility, then you win.  The game was released by October 2002, before the outbreak of the Second Gulf War, thus making it mildly prophetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screenname of the individual who designed the game is HOODLUMinc and he has created two other games in a similar vein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
