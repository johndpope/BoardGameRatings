			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescue the Slaves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the slums of Beggartown outside of Riverton, people frequently go missing, never to be heard from again. However, this time, a halfling family has been kidnapped and someone powerful wants them rescued. Thanks to your connections, you have been tasked with locating the kidnappers' hideout, infiltrating it, and rescuing the missing family. Problem is, everyone is pretty sure that gnolls are to blame...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against the Slavers is the second part in the Shadows of Riverton adventure path and is designed to be played during the course of two or three four-hour sessions. The scenario can also be run as a standalone adventure in your sandbox campaign as it can easily be adapted for use with any campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against the Slavers is an APL 2 or 3 module designed for four to six characters and uses the medium XP advancement track. Successful completion of the adventure will take 2nd-level characters to 3rd level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario also includes a settlement stat block for the large town of Beggartown as well as information about the town's places of interest and notable NPCs. In this adventure, you can recruit mercenaries to help you rescue the slaves, become embroiled in local gang politics, and pit your characters against a wide variety of opponents in gladiatorial combats to the death in the infamous Chapel of Slaughter-winning fame and (small) fortune. This adventure also contains a new spell, as well as new drawbacks and magic items, and more advanced gnolls than you can shake a stick at (not recommended, gnolls hate that).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
