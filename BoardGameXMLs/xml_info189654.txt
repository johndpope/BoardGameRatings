			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1544; Stage One: Josh T. Jordan; Stage Two: Guillaume St-Pierre; Stage Three: Zane Dempsey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules text:&lt;br/&gt;In King of Bones, you play the role of one of many musicians in the jazz band of the same name. With a group of your friends, you will use all types of dice (From d4 to d20) and improvised instruments from your surroundings to partake in jams and try to win the favor of the boss played by one of your friends. The King of Bones is a lighthearted music roleplaying game that can fill a rowdy lunch or take a whole night to play. No matter how you decide to play, the King of Bones is a simple game which you and your friends can play anywhere. &lt;br/&gt;Although the King of Bones is a musical game. No significant musical knowledge is needed. All that is really needed is the ability to keep a beat while others are playing their game. For the sake of fun in the game world, the Boss should consider his band&amp;rsquo;s overall ability level when setting the difficulty for the night. Additionally, players that might not be rhythmically gifted may have other ways that they can benefit the group. Players that feel self-conscious about their beat keeping skills may want to create a character that has more to offer the boss than simple musical skills. Bands always need someone with stage presence or pizazz in their playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
