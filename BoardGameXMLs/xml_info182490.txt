							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasury of the Orient</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold the Riches of the Exotic East! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasury of the Orient brings you over 30 magical items ideal for Asiatic explorers, transcontinental caravans, and any campaigns set in the exotic East. Exotic woods and jade, ivories and silks, the treasures of the Asian lands are carved, embroidered, and embellished with a beauty to match form with function. Whether crafted to maximize tranquil contemplation or to bring elegance to bloody executions, craftsmanship is devoted in equal measure to the appearance of an item as to its mechanical effects. Whether PCs are themselves native to Asian-inspired fantasy kingdoms or are outlanders venturing into strange and foreign kingdoms and empires in search of wealth and glory in a land far from that of their birth, they may wrest these treasures from the dusty tombs of exiles and emperors, uncover them in the kami-haunted spirit-forests that blanket the land, or wrest them from the hoards and hands of oni, bakemono, weretigers, nagas, and wingless sovereign dragons. This tome contains items perfect for followers of the paths of peace or the ways of war, from the teapot of serenity and feathered mat of paradise to the stalking serpent, typhoon fan, and beheading blade. There are items of great practical utility like the ink set of shifting, ki capstan, and samisen of the seven spheres, from the simple alchemical kokowai salve up to the divine artifacts known as the lucky mallets. Some items carry great power but potential danger, like the malicious skull and the circlet of the imperial dragon, while others bring great beauty alongside deadly efficiency, like the sovereign lungguang, kimono of the honored ancestors, rod of the monkey king, and the biting blade of ten thousand blossoms. From the sublime artistry of the cane of butterflies and the rod of shadow puppetry to the simple brutality of the bloodthirsty blade, your heroes are going to love what they find in the Treasury of the Orient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
