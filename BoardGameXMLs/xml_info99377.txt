							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Journey to the End of the Earth</name>
									
			<description>From the web publisher Nimble Books LLC&lt;br/&gt;Even to the Russians, a hardy race with much experience at living in a cold land, swept by bitter winters, the Kola Peninsular and the Murman coast represented the very extreme of a distant, harsh and God forsaken place. Hence, they named their first colony there Murmansk. The end of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Allied sailors of many nations who sailed there during WW2 it certainly seemed to live up to its name. Getting there was bad enough with all the hardships of freezing cold conditions, massive storms, and seas that could swallow up a ship leaving little trace. If forced to abandon ship in such waters they were under no illusions that they chances of survival were slim. There were some remarkable stories of survival but the privations endured by those who made it back alive were just as remarkable in that there were so few who lived to tell the tale of being sunk on the Murmansk run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, although the port facilities available were Spartan and poorly equipped to handle the huge amount of stores delivered, then there was the problem of getting such cargoes there in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having arrived, there were almost no amenities for the crews of ships to use in order to rest up after fighting there way to Murmansk. Indeed the Soviets were reluctant to give the crews much freedom to go ashore at all. Food was scarce. That supplied was grudgingly given, boring and lacking nutrition. So for those who had arrived, the long wait until they could join a convoy back to the UK was like a prison sentence. Perhaps the only thing the Russians seemed to have plenty of was Vodka and with that they could be extremely generous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the thriving community around this intensely popular war game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game sclae is of 20cm or 8 inches per nautical mile, so  1cm equals 1 knot. If a ship is moving 14 knots, will plot a 14 cm movement in the game, for example. Players are encouraged to play with any sclae, although the desinger suggest 1:3000 as the best one.&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of and allied convoy from or towards Murmansk or Anchangelsk during the IIWW and try to protect the ships from the German player, who will try to shunk them with either vessels, submarines or the Luftwaffe.&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with a comprehensive way to generate merchants convoys and its adecuate escort of warships, meanwhile the German player will have his own forces. All this will change according to the year and nationality played, so for 1942 the forces will be different from those of 1945 and also those avaliable to the Royal Navy or the Soviets.&lt;br/&gt;The game has also an event generator to add some flavor, and full tables to calculate combat and the damage and critical hits taken by the diverse forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
