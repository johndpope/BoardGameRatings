							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolverine</name>
									
			<description>Wolverine is an action video game developed by Software Creations and published by LJN for the NES, and was released exclusively in North America in 1991. It is a licensed game based on the Marvel Comics super-hero of the same name, as well as the X-Men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player controls Wolverine, who has been imprisoned on a vast island, through various stages, in to finally battle evil mutants Magneto and Sabretooth. Along with icons to restore health, or to gain extra lives, special icons can be located to allow other X-Men characters, such as Jubilee, Havok, and Psylocke to offer advice or temporary aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolverine's basic moves are jumping, ducking, punching, and kicking. He can bring out his legendary powerful claws with a push of the &amp;quot;Select&amp;quot; button, but every time the claws are used his energy is depleted. Energy is regained by consuming food and beverages, such as hamburgers and soft drinks. If you kill enough minor characters, Wolverine will temporarily shift into a &amp;quot;Berzerker&amp;quot; mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many other NES games, where the player character is given a grace period of invulnerability after sustaining damage, Wolverine's energy is simply drained for as long as he is in contact with an enemy or hazard. Another difference is the fact that at the end of a level, except for the final one, there is no boss to defeat and no effort is made to explain how the indoor and outdoor themed levels manage to fit onto an uncharted island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wolverine (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
