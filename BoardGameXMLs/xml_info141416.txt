			<description>The game re-creates the Battle of Ravenna, fought on 11 April 1512 (tragic Easter day), by forces of the Holy League and France. The players are divided into two camps and guide the opposing armies with the sole purpose of defeating the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;This game introduces a new mechanic like referring to a real circumstance. At that time give orders in battle was very difficult and in the chain of command it happened that someone not obey to the orders: the same thing will happen in the game where each team can decide whether and when to comply with an order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
