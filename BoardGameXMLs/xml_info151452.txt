							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzar</name>
									
			<description>Panzar is a third-person action game in the spirit of modern competitive multiplayer games. The emphasis is on team-based play. Since it features character growth and experience-based leveling, Panzar is frequently mistaken for an MMORPG. However, we consider Panzar to be an MMO/action game with role-playing elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will find themselves in a world of swords and sorcery - a whirlwind of intense melee combat and devious spell-casting. The four races at war are the Dwarves, Orcs, Elves, and Humans. The gorgeous landscapes on which their battles are fought will immerse you in a world of fantasy and wonder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
