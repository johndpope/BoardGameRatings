			<description>The goal is to bring the poor Cody from a nest perched a top a mountain to his home.&lt;br/&gt;The plateau is a landscape with a mountain in the center (the nest at the top) separating the game board into 2: one side of the hut Cody, and another is departure for pawns.&lt;br/&gt;Initially, tokens are placed on each square of the board (except the starting boxes and boxes Jake). At each turn the player moves his pawn one square in the direction of his choice, it then returns a token located on a square adjacent to his. Any box with token returned is impracticable; boxes passable by the pegs are empty boxes, boxes with chips and boxes not returned to Jake. The token returned can be used as a token-enabling move by 2 in 4 boxes or token &amp;quot;Albatross&amp;quot; to climb the mountain, these chips are to keep by the player who can use them next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some chips are disadvantageous with either back to square one, or loss of a token already won (penalties or both!), Or the return of Cody on the mountain if the player picked it up. These chips are on the box and make it impassable. Other tokens can counteract the disadvantageous chips.&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you must pick up Cody at the top of the mountain, passing through the passages between the two sides of the plate and bring it back to his cabin, avoiding many pitfalls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
