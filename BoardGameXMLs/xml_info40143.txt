							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of 31</name>
									
			<description>A normal deck of cards is used. All the aces through sixs are removed and placed into their appropriate stacks. Players take turns removing one card and keeping a running total of the pips. The first player to take a card that makes the running total go past 31 loses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an old con man's game. Con men have spent years studying the game to get some easy money. If you are offered a game of 31 from a complete and total stranger, don't take it... you're not going to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
