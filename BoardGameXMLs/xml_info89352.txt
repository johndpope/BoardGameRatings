			<description>From the Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famine is coming to Egypt! It will take strategy and luck to gather enough supplies to save the House of Israel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joseph, son of Jacob, advised the Pharaoh to store a surplus during the seven years of abundance in order to survive the seven years of famine that were ahead. Will you acquire all the supplies you need before the famine begins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feast side one:&lt;br/&gt;Players have seven rounds to gather food during Egypt&amp;rsquo;s seven years of plenty. Players exchange labor points for food tiles (oil, water, wheat, corn, fish, and cattle) in order to obtain Pharaoh Medallions. The player who earns the most Medallions wins! Or players can keep Medallions and continue with Side Two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famine side two (Coming soon in an update as an In App Purchase):&lt;br/&gt;Players use their Pharaoh Medallions to rescue the House of Israel from the famine. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s family members are worth different point values determined by birth order. Using their Medallions, players bid against each other in order to find and save Joseph&amp;rsquo;s family. The player who obtains the most points survives the famine and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feast &amp;amp; Famine for iPad is based on the best selling board game Feast &amp;amp; Famine, by Good Knight Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
