			<description>Pinball Illusions is an Commodore Amiga and MS-DOS computer game from 1995 developed by Digital Illusions CE, as a sequel of Pinball Fantasies and Pinball Dreams. The original Amiga release featured three tables - the PC CD version added a fourth, 'The Vikings' (this was written for the Amiga version but not considered good enough for inclusion). This was the first version of the series to feature more than 1 ball in play at a time (known as 'multiball'), and the first to be released for AGA based Amigas. The game also marks its nationality as a Swedish product in The Vikings table (at the top left corner)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Illusions used the four tables from this game to produce True Pinball on the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation which presented the tables in a more realistic perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pinball Illusions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
