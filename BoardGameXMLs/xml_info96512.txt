			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meggagrid is a teeming new industrial capital build on the remains of the city once known as Los Angeles. As a specific enterprise zone, the city has encouraged unlimited financial growth by suspending all restrictive measures such as taxes, drug laws, and environmental regulations. In this free-market atmosphere, large corporations thrive... and so do Meggagrid's criminals. Because the government no longer funds prisons, courts, or hospitals, there are no real sanctions against criminal behavior, and no treatment for those whose bodies and minds have been poisoned by the increasingly toxic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small Underground movement, which includes the few remaining police officers, small buisness owners, and others concerned about the rising crime level, has coalesced to take back the streets of Meggagrid. As the only HeliPak pilot in existance, you are their hero, and their most important ally. Count on the Underground to support you with information as your missions progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
