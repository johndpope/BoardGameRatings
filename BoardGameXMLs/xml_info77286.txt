							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">EverQuest II: Desert of Flames</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first expansion to EverQuest II brings an Arabian feel to the game.  Desert of Flames introduces the Island of Ro, a continent covered in deserts and mesas, a land filled with intrigue and mystery.  Adventurers can traverse the 2 overworld zones, or they can explore the 4 shared dungeons.  For those who fear nothing, there are many new solo, group, and raid instances, each with their own valuable rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desert of Flames raises the maximum level to 60 for both adventuring and tradeskilling.  The expansion itself is tailored for characters between level 45 and 60.  All new spells and abilities have been added for each class, and the ability to climb certain walls is introduced.  An arena is brought to each major city where players may take on the roles of arena champions or simply enter the arena as the character themselves and engage in PvP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
