			<description>Chaos Tactics is a dexterity game where skill and strategy are needed to defeat your opponent by using your army of eight units. Players battle over a series of rounds by flicking their units until one player claims the entire board. Each army contains seven different unit types with one type, the soldier, having two units per side. The six non soldier units have special abilities that can be used throughout the game. The constant action will create chaotic battles making each round feel like an entirely new game.&lt;br/&gt; The player using the blue pieces starts the game by choosing one of their pieces and flicking it. Once the piece is flicked, resolve any special abilities if applicable. The red player then takes their first turn by doing the same. Play alternates like this until the round is over; with the goal being to knock all of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces off the game board entirely. If any part of a piece is still on the game board, it is still in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round is won when only one color remains on the board. With each round won, the winner claims a new row allowing them to place a piece or pieces in that row in the next round. For the following rounds, players may place their pieces in any of the spaces of the rows they own, with at least one piece in the row closest to their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when one color has claimed all eight rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Chapayev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
