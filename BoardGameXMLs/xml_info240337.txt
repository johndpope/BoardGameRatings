			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Storm began the sacred chant. Beginning quietly, he sang the words of power, ancient when his people were still wide-eyed with wonder at this new land. The land that had now been taken from them by the pale interlopers with their strange tools and stranger ideas. The old medicine man had seen too many of his kinsmen die at the hands of the intruders. Victims of the thunder sticks, or strange plagues, or the peculiar-tasting beverage that caused more braves to fall under its spell every year, leaving them uselessly lying in camp, wetting themselves in their endless cravings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Storm sang his anguish into the words, giving them extra potency. After what seemed like hours, he finished his rite with a final shout. The area fell deathly silent. Red Storm looked up at his companions, weary but satisfied. &amp;quot;It is done,&amp;quot; he said with a slight smile. &amp;quot;The strangers will soon feel the wrath of the People.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the distant horizon, a storm cloud tinged the hue of blood took form&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lakota Terror is a short, no-frills adventure for Under Western Skies: Twilight Trails and other tabletop RPGs using a 2D6 mechanic based on the Traveller SRD (which is itself based on The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
