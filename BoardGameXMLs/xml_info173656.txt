							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gomora: Down Town</name>
									
			<description>COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;Base set contains 54 unique Cards, Token Punchboard, the game's Board and Rulebook. The Extended version contains 84 unique cards, as opposed to 54 cards in the regular set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;Gomora : Downtown is a Neo-noir card game for 2-4 players. It can be played 1vs1, 2vs2 (co-op mode) or Free for all. The game is for ages 15+ and it lasts 15-45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a detective in the city of Gomora. You will take a path between good and evil in a corrupt city full of eccentric and controversial characters. Nothing can be taken for granted. Your goal is to try and solve perplexing crimes that implicate multiple powerful interests. Gomora's criminal underbelly is after you....so hurry up detective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game consists of 84 cards each with a unique photo-realistic artwork. There are 4 tokens representing the 8 Detectives and a game board with 4 locations to move around in order to find clues and complete your case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;When your turn starts you draw a card or you store cards under your case. Then you have to move to a different location and play it's ability if you wish to. The third step allows you to play your cards. Alternatively you can rest during the third step so that you recover one life point. After you are done playing cards, make sure to keep only 4 cards in your hand and you turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROLOGUE&lt;br/&gt;How did you get here? What did you do? Why are they after you? In the city of Gomora the rules are made by those who rule the streets, and those who govern the masses are in their back pocket. The city is corrupt to the bone. Nothing is clear and no man knows what is true and what is fiction, which is convenient for some. Pacifism is not an option. If you pretend to be &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;lsquo;ll probably end up in a ditch, or worse. If you pretend to be &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;, vengeance will be upon you sooner or later. The only way forward is to lurk in the shadows, stay unseen until the day you&amp;rsquo;ll do what needs to be done. Believe in what you feel rather than what you see, because in this town nothing is what it seems.&lt;br/&gt;Every day in Gomora is a struggle for survival and as far as I know&amp;hellip; today is not a good day for you to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show them what you 've got detective..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY&lt;br/&gt;Bloody Sunday 6am.... Agent's Kiran and Mark have just arrived in the crime scene three miles away from Casino Montenegro.&lt;br/&gt;Mark:- Morning Mike...so what&amp;rsquo;s the story?&lt;br/&gt;Officer Mike:- Good day to you Sir...&lt;br/&gt;Mark:- It doesn't seem like one...but please continue.&lt;br/&gt;Officer Mike:- It looks like this poor guy has been shot several times by a Niner last night. The doc said the hit was around midnight.&lt;br/&gt;Mark:- Any evidence gathered?&lt;br/&gt;Officer Mike:- Not yet Sir. We are still examining the surroundings. Just got here half an hour ago.&lt;br/&gt;Kiran:- Ok then we will be down town taking our breakfast so if you have any news from the morgue or the crime scene contact Gloria in 4237. We will take it from there (Agents walking away).&lt;br/&gt;Deputy Jones: (shouting)- Agent Kiran...!!&lt;br/&gt;Kiran:- Yes how can I help you Deputy Jones (walks towards him).&lt;br/&gt;Deputy Jones:- May I have a word with you in private?&lt;br/&gt;Kiran:- Sure...lets walk.&lt;br/&gt;Deputy Jones:- I have found this note. The guy was holding it but in a way that if somebody placed it there...in his grip.&lt;br/&gt;Kiran:- And why are you giving that to me old friend (smiles)?&lt;br/&gt;Deputy Jones:- Just take a look and you'll understand why (Deputy Jones grasps Kiran&amp;rsquo;s shoulder).&lt;br/&gt;After a while in the car&lt;br/&gt;Mark:- (after a few minutes of silence) What's wrong man? Come on spit it out... &lt;br/&gt;Kiran:- It's nothing... Old Jones just wanted to give me some guidelines... Not a big deal.&lt;br/&gt;Mark:- Sure thing...now pass me over that note he gave you.&lt;br/&gt;Kiran:-(surprised) Ok Mark you win....the note was from Fox. I guess we will have to cover that up again....any ideas?&lt;br/&gt;Mark:- (speaks with emphasis) And again she strikes without warning....that crazy b#*@$. &lt;br/&gt;Kiran:- You know that this will start a war right?&lt;br/&gt;Mark:- This was Viny's little brother there&amp;hellip; I am prepared for everything....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
