							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Handbook of Hazards and House Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the website:  &amp;quot;The Handbook of Hazards and House Rules&amp;trade; is, quite frankly, a mish-mash of all those rules that just didn't seem to fit anywhere else.  That doesn't lower the value of its content, however.  Its pages include a wide variety of traps and other natural hazards.  Also included are a number of optional &amp;quot;house rules&amp;quot; dreamt up by the LQ play testers and used in various worlds over the years.  Some may be to your liking while others may seem too cumbersome.  After all our extensive play testing, all we know for sure is that no two referees want exactly the same set of rules.  That's why this book really exists.  The Handbook of Hazards and House Rules is not mandatory to play the game, but is appropriate for all players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
