			<description>&amp;ldquo;Who are the Union? A mismatched bunch o&amp;rsquo; mercenaries, scum and criminals for the most part. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to meet any of them in a dark alley late at night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Flint, Mason&amp;rsquo;s Guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despised by the righteous, Blackheart&amp;rsquo;s sole motivation is wealth. A trait befitting a former marauder of the sea. With a body count as far-reaching as the depths of his brutality, he's as swift as shadows. Only death and ruin can keep up with this tyrannous captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Union is a team of criminals with specialized strengths. Under the nefarious rule of Blackheart, this gang of thugs can quickly match his speed or strike with more damage for precision take-outs. Each a deadly tool with a purpose, the Union is the perfect team for Coaches who want a band of ruthless cutthroats with clear-cut strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merciless mercenaries out for coin, this set includes a ball, 6 player cards, bases, and 6 players: Blackheart, Decimate, Gutter, Rage, Avarisse &amp;amp; Greede (and standalone Greede), Coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
