			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was based on a WizKids constructable card game. The video game is in the style of a top-down dual-stick shooter with some RPG elements (similar to Smash TV). The player can create a character that will gain upgrades as the story progresses. Players can choose to play as a male or female; a human, Venusian or Mercurian; and one of the game&amp;rsquo;s three classes: Warrior, Outcast or Engineer. However, this does not actually alter the gameplay in any discernible fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay allows for up to 4 players to play co-op. Each player will have a standard weapon, but can pick up short term, powerful weapons that will disappear after a predetermined amount of time. Mission stages have a central goal, as well as secondary goals (gather elements, rescue prisoners, construct new weapons, etc)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
