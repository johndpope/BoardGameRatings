							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Captain is Dead: Avatar Pawn Set</name>
									
			<description>The avatar pawns were originally intended to be included in the game The Captain is Dead. These plastic components are not dissimilar from rounded meeples and are considered by some to be a better design for the game board as the stretch goal acquired visual pawns images are too busy.&lt;br/&gt;This set was able to be purchased from The Gamer Crafter website following the The Captain is Dead Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;The set included:&lt;br/&gt;1 x yellow, orange, red, blue, purple, green and white pawns for players&lt;br/&gt;12 x black pawns for aliens&lt;br/&gt;The pawns can still be purchased individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
