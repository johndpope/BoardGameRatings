							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">James de Pedis: Seller of Supernatural Secrets</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it comes to knowing about the world that no one sees, there are few people more in the know than James de Pedis. He has information owing to him from so many places, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonder he can keep it all organized&amp;mdash;and he does it all with his own mind; no computers, no hard copies, just him. It&amp;rsquo;s uncanny and supernatural, but his information is always good, even if it&amp;rsquo;s expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
