			<description>&amp;quot;WWE Raw 2: Ruthless Aggression, known as simply WWE Raw 2, is a video game released for the Xbox console by THQ in 2003, and developed by Tokyo-based company Anchor Inc. It is the sequel to the WWE Raw game that was released in 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time in the series, a season mode is included in the game. It allows players to set up wrestlers, call others out from the locker room, form alliances, and hire managers. To successfully complete a season, the player is required to play through 12 months of Raw and SmackDown! shows, as well as Pay-Per-View events, and finish the season with either the WWE Championship, or the World Heavyweight Championship. Successful seasons earn points, which can be seen in the 'Hall of Fame' section of the main menu of the game, which in turn unlocks items of clothing and entrance videos which can later be used in the creation or modification of characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raw 2 allows players to edit WWE's wrestlers into the way they want them to look similar to the N64 games WWF WrestleMania 2000 and WWF No Mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several arenas that WWE held events in during 2002 and 2003. There are also arenas based upon each WWE television show. The game also features Raw and Smackdown! referees in the game that the player can choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New match stipulations are included in the game: Hell in a Cell, TLC and Royal Rumble matches are available in Raw 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon its release, the game was praised for an improved and more current roster. The game received 'average' reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Many praised the creation modes, but criticized the gameplay.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw_2 WWE Raw 2]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
