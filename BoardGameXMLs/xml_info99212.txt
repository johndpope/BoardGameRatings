			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a virtual card game similar in play to Magic the Gathering.  There are twelve different colors of cards, you choose one to start in and can then customize your deck by buying and selling cards.  Money is won by defeating seven levels of AI or playing against another person.  After defeating the harder AIs, you have a chance to win random cards from their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are available in normal and upgraded forms, upgrades are available when all the quests are finished for 1500 coins per upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning is done by forcing the other person to draw a card when they are unable to or reducing their life to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournaments are held regularly, often with themes your deck must adhere to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is available on several sites and is very popular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
