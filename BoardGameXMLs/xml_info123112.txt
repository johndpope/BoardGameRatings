			<description>Fatum is a fast-moving civilization game set in the year 600 BC in the world of ancient regions around the Mediterranean Sea. Each player is in the role of a king whose task is to bring prosperity to his lands: alleviate famine and plague, establish trade routes, build alliances, found new cities and improve culture, defend or expand his territory and secure peace. But first he must win favour and support of capricious divinities&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose different actions (building, fighting, trading etc.) which, directly or indirectly, bring them victory points. Their starting positions are different, but well balanced. Strategic planning and a bit of divine benevolence could turn each of them into one of the most glorious rulers of ancient times!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
