							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swordquest: Waterworld</name>
									
			<description>The room structure of Waterworld was based on the seven centers of chakra. It was originally released only through the Atari Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon reaching Waterworld, the twins become separated. Tara travels to a ship made of ice, forgets her name, and meets Cap'n Frost, who desires to find the &amp;quot;Crown of Life&amp;quot; and rule Waterworld. While Tara's doing all that, Torr travels to an undersea kingdom, forgets his name and meets the city's ex-queen Aquana, who desires to find the &amp;quot;Crown of Life&amp;quot; in order to regain her throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a brief war between the ex-queen and captain, Herminus sets the twins to duel each other. They then pray to their deities for guidance, which summons Mentorr who allows them to regain their memories. The twins throw down their swords, causing the crown to be revealed and split in half. Each half is given to both the ex-queen and the captain, who then rule as equals. The &amp;quot;Sword of Ultimate Sorcery&amp;quot; then transports the twins to Airworld where they would have to do battle with King Tyrannus and Konjuro. Or they would have, if the series hadn't been cut at this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Swordquest,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
