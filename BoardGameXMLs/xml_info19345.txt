			<description>SECURICOR - An exciting game of chase involving banks, bullion and banditry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Securicor Operator and the other player or players the thieves.  The Securicor Operator's aim is to move the Securicor vans  with the bullion loads safely from the banks to the factories.  The Securicor Operator can choose whether to load both lots of bullion into one vehicle and use the other as a decoy, or load one lot into each vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the journey the thieves try to intercept and rob the Securicor vans and take the bullion back to their own Headquarters.  If a robbery takes place, the Securicor operator uses the police cars to try and recapture the bullion from the thieves.  The thieves also can try and capture bullion loads from each other after a Securicor van has been robbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete game consists of five rounds (2 bullion loads per round).  Players take it in turns to be the Securicor Operator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of five turns the winner is the player to have collected the most bullion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
