			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Kings and despots, a queen or two as well, they all call the King&amp;rsquo;s Club home. Dorrian Wells, a crafty charmer, welcomes all that ilk &amp;ndash; people just like himself. After all, he sat upon another&amp;rsquo;s throne unsuspected a year or more and when he got discovered, where else was he to go? He found a lot of subscribers to the place he calls the King&amp;rsquo;s Club, a place set up to meet the special needs of those just like himself. What better a place to hide than one where no one wants to fight on any pretext? Nothing more important than the market. This is coffee country, the place where the absolute best coffee in the world grows. Business comes first. Don&amp;rsquo;t interfere with the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
