			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Public Access is a storytelling game in which players portray a group of adults who have come together to discuss their memories of a short-lived public access TV show they watched as children. During the course of the game, one character will remind the others about a mystery surrounding the show. Characters will then relate their memories of specific episodes of the show, in the hopes that clues to solving the mystery are contained within. The characters then engage in their own research and investigation, and later confer with each other about what they discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
