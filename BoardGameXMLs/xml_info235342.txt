Map scale is 1:33000, with hexes that represent 1,1 kilometer along each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wooden-block units in the game represent regiments for the Germans (with some assault battalions) and brigades/divisions for the Soviets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has one campaign, covering August 23 to November 20 and taking from 1 to 2 hours  to play. There are several shorter scenarios in development, such as the September attack to the southern part of the city and the October attack to the industrial sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unit wooden blocks provide fog-of-war and easy recording of strength, while a card-driven system that allows for key historical events and dramatic surprises in battle...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers FOUR different modes of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire (German player versus Soviet AI)&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative (two German players vs Soviet AI)&lt;br/&gt;Competitive:2 (German player vs Soviet Player)&lt;br/&gt;Competitive:3 (two German players vs Soviet Player)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity level is medium/high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played out over a detailed 84x60 cm (33&amp;quot;x24&amp;quot;), laminated multicolor mapboard.
