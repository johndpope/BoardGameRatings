			<description>This game plays like UNO with dice: Players race to empty their hands. The first player who managed this gets score points for the cards left in the opponents hands. &lt;br/&gt;In turn, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or symbol to the topmost card on the discard pile. The player may only discard a suitable card if he succeeds in throwing a special combination of three dice: e.g. Street (2-3-4), High-Score (sum more than 15), Sandwich (1-5-1) or OleO (3-3-3). If unable to play, players draw one card from the draw pile. &lt;br/&gt;The player who got the most points after a specific number of turns wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
