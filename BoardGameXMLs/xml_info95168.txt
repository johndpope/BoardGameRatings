							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Electric Yo-Yo</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This obscure Taito arcade release tasks you with collecting a series of squares arranged on a top-down playfield, all while avoiding enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You control the titular yoyo, which moves about by casting it's string out like a grappling hook.  If it latches on to one of the squares, the string will quickly retract, pulling the yoyo to the target square.  If no square is in your line of fire, you will merely move ahead one space on the invisible grid on which the game takes place.  This play-mechanic enables speedy movement around the playfield for a player of sufficient skill, but unfortunately proved somewhat troublesome for newcomers to grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded based on the distance the target square is from the yoyo, which rewards players for approaching each level as a puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, despite it's fresh ideas, The Electric Yo-yo proved ineffective at diverting arcade-goers' attentions (and quarters) away from a wide range of other, often more approachable &amp;quot;collect the dot&amp;quot; games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
