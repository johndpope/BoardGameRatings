							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Staff of Power</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eldritch might of the staff of power is truly a thing of legend and the envy of mages across the planes. Save for perhaps the coveted staff of the magi, there is no greater treasure in an archmage's arsenal than the staff of power. Made from the finest mahogany wood and worn smooth by the hands of time and its many wielders, the glittering ruby atop the staff of power is the true focus of the staff's many wondrous abilities. Originally crafted when the world saw its first flourishing of magic and the gods were still young, the staff of power started out as a simple gift from a humble jeweler but would later became the instrument of death and destruction that it is often used as today?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creator Of the Staff of Power&lt;br/&gt;     History Of the Staff of Power&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Item: The Heart's Sliver &amp;amp; The Ring Of Divine Might&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
