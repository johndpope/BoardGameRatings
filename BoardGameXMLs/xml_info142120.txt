							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Pirate Bay</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Battle of Pirate Bay, the player defends their island base, maneuvering three distinct ships with different weapon ranges, speed, and ammunition to best head off incoming enemy pirate attacks.  The game is played in real time, with the player directing the ships, which will automatically fire on any incoming vessel.  Occasional supply ships will allow friendly ships to restock spent ammunition.  In addition to the ships under the player's control, the island base can, if necessary, fire a cannon as well (although the base has a very slow recharge rate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
