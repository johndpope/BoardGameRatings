			<description>From Spielbox . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Opiumkrieg 1839-42 (The Opium War 1839-42), the goal is to be at the right place at the right time and then do the right thing. On the eve of the first Opium War, the players sail their junks through the China Sea and buy silk, spices, porcelain or tea from the various harbors. These wares are sold for a heavy profit in the canton where the English freighters are. But the freighters also bring a trading good with them, one out of India that is worth much gold in the harbors along the sea: Opium! The only catch &amp;ndash; dealing in Opium is punishable by death. Each player can choose in this game: a long life, or get rich quick. After war breaks out, the needs of the dealers change on a daily basis, forcing flexibility: A harbor that might have been shut yesterday is now open again, where Opium trafficking might be punished heavily today, tomorrow the English might allow it again. The historic events of the time are also included and have an affect on the way the game goes. And yet, there&amp;rsquo;s still enough variety in the game to make it play out differently each time and allow the players to influence the game in many ways!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
