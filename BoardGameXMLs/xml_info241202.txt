			<description>A maze adventure game (from the intro screen), by Don Priestley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you move your character through a maze in search of a treasure that you need to bring back to the entrance. The maze is populated by large bugs that fight you. If you equip a sword, you can defeat them, but you lose the sword. You can find swords along the way. Prisoners in the walls will tell you which way to go, and you can follow the directions for a short time until they disappear. When picking up the treasure, you drop your sword, so beware of the bugs! If you make it back, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
