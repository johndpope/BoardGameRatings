							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">God Calling: Build an Ark!</name>
									
			<description>You&amp;rsquo;re sitting on your deck under a cloudless day, when the phone rings. You answer it and a voice says &amp;ldquo;God calling, build an ark.&amp;rdquo; Before you can react, it hangs up. You look out your window to see storm clouds rolling in. You&amp;rsquo;d better get going!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God Calling: Build an Ark is an irreverent game that combines the biblical story of Noah and the Great Deluge and the timeless tradition of crank calls.  Be the first to gather your Animals, Wood, and Nails, but be warned, everyone else wants the same, and competition is fierce!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players play Supply cards, trying to fulfill the minimum requirements for their ark: three Wood cards, three Nail cards, and three Animal cards.  However, everyone also has God Calling cards that aid or hinder the players, making them require more cards to complete their ark, discard cards, or counter other God Calling cards.  Play is fast and frantic, as players play their cards as fast as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
