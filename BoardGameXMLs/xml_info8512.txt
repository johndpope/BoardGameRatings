			<description>This game teaches children about animals and their habitats. The board is a map of the world. Players move around the board drawing cards most of which are pictures of animals. If an animal is drawn the player must identify it by name and place it in the area of the world it is commonly found. Others can challenge the choice at which time a guide sheet is consulted. The correct player gets credit for the placement of the card. The first player to place ten cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will encourage children to learn more about the world around them and the creatures they share it with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
