							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aether Captains: Clockwork Cabal</name>
									
			<description>As a Free Captain, adventurer, and member of the Society of Clockwork Engineers, you travel across the breadth of Arkady. Recently, you find yourself in the back room of Rasmuson's Bookshop in the heart of Easley by the River. There, on shelves heavy with dust, you find a leather bound volume and from between its pages a letter drops. Its author describes a fabled ancient brass clock and navigation device, the Antikythera, whose 6 parts were disassembled and hidden in the city of Val Justinia to prevent it from falling into the hands of a shadowy cabal operating within the S.C.E's very halls. The letter goes on to say that if the cabal and its allies, the Federation of Air Pirates, were to discover this device, they could wreak untold havoc, potentially circumnavigate the globe and attack Arkady&amp;rsquo;s eastern border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first you dismiss this letter as rumor and hoax but rumors have a way of sometimes becoming truth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clockwork Cabal is a game for one player lasting about 20 minutes. You win by locating all 6 parts of the Antikytheria before time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Required to play:&lt;br/&gt;1 player pawn&lt;br/&gt;1d12&lt;br/&gt;13 small eurocubes&lt;br/&gt;and the deck of 54 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;there are 3 types of cards in the deck:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Sector cards form the map of the city that you move across during the game. You build the city as you progress&lt;br/&gt;Location cards list events that need to be resolved and let you find the parts of the Antikytheria&lt;br/&gt;Player cards keep track of your health, knowledge, strength and items found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
