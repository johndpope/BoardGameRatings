							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babylon 5 Component Game System: 2258 Starter Kit â€“ Minbari</name>
									
			<description>In the Babylon 5 Component Game System, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
