							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Radical Re-Alignment</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever thought that the two dimentional Good vs Evil and Law vs Chaos alignment system was a little bland? Have you ever wanted to come up with your own alignment scheme, but didn't want to invalidate all the normal creatures and planes of existance that are standard to d20 and based on the normal alignment system?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a look at Radical Re-Alignment! Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Six alignment dualities, including an adjustment of the base two and four new philosophical and psychological constructs to define conflict and character traits arround&lt;br/&gt;     A deconstruction of the standard alignment magic and a reconstruction again allowing quick and easy addition of your own alignment structures with the same base spell concepts, including a 6 page .rtf template file for alignment spells with instructions on find and replace for your own alignment systems.&lt;br/&gt;     Examples of character archetypes and their alignment matrix as a demonstration of how the system works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
