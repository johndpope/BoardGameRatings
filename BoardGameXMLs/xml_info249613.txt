			<description>Do you have no family, friends, pets or lawyers? Are you finally realizing you&amp;rsquo;re not contributing to the future of humankind? Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re one of those people weirdly fascinated with taking unnecessary risks? Have you always wanted to donate your body to an unknown cause? Are you content with being paid with purpose instead of money? Do you like rabbits?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well it&amp;rsquo;s your lucky day, because I am here to give your useless life meaning. We're looking for new recruits - just like you - to bestow upon the honor of working with me as part of the Alpha team. You get to be among the first recruits to take part in our secret project - and with that comes extra prestige and risk! It's a win-win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
