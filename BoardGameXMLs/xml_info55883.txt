							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ionia Treasury of Olympus</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction to the book:&lt;br/&gt;Ionia is a sleepy mountainous land steeped in history, a land of ancient cities that are home to philosophers, academics, poets and playwrights. Lost and forgotten beneath Ionia are the artefacts and treasures of the Olympian gods, harkening back to the Age of Heroes when Zeus, Ares and Athena walked the earth in disguise, when heroes like Achilles fought with magical invulnerability, when witches like Medea ruled secret enchanted islands.&lt;br/&gt;Today there are adventurers who seek out the magical artefacts of the gods. They search for secret ways into the Underworld, hunt for clues to the location of magical swords or helmets, and dig into tombs and under cities for hidden catacombs and labyrinths. Who would not be tempted by the famous Shield of Achilles? Or the Skin of the Nemean Lion? The Bow of Paris? The teeth of the Colchian Dragon? The Girdle of Hypolyte? The list is an endless one. Fantastic treasures, imbued with awesome powers await the brave and adventurous.&lt;br/&gt;Of course the search is never easy. Myths and Legends give clues to the artefacts&amp;rsquo; whereabouts, and the universities scattered about Ionia provide wonderful opportunities for research and fact-finding, but the adventurers have rivals. Every Emperor since the magician-King Tiberius has coveted these amazing artefacts. Imperial agents are at work in Ionia, stealing important scrolls and breaking into long-dead tombs. In the hands of the Emperor these divine weapons and items would turn him into a living god, a divine monster with the powers of Zeus on earth. Imperial savagery and tyranny would bring out a hell on earth for every citizen.&lt;br/&gt;The meaning of this &amp;ldquo;Campaign Guide&amp;rdquo; - or call it a &amp;ldquo;Sourcebook&amp;rdquo; if you want to - is giving the players and the gamemaster alike, some information on adventuring in the environment of the Classical Civilizations. In this particular case we will take a &amp;lsquo;closer look&amp;rsquo; at Ionia. This geographically by mountain ranges devided land was the birthplace to a great nation; in fact one of the greatest and most civilized the world has ever known for it was indeed the cradle of human civilization. The greatness of the Empire was for a (big) part also the realisation of Ionia itself. In fact the Eternal City stole its knowledge and its gods for a great deal from Ionian scholars and religion, knowing that this - together with the Ionian language - formed the backbone of so strong a nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
