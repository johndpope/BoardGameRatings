			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metahuman Mystics &amp;amp; Supernatural Supers brings you new ways to look at magic and the paranormal in your 2e Superlink game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find four new PL-10 character archetypes focused on the various facets of mysticism and/or the supernatural. But these aren't the simple archetypes you&amp;acirc;'ve come to expect because each provides information on the concept behind the archetype, hints on defining such characters' origins, tips on building powers and how to improve the character with experience while staying true to the concept, as well as several variations on the basic archetype to allow tinkering. Also included are some new game mechanics for all-purpose use and a character of higher PL to illustrate what how the archetype can improve with experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The included archetypes are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Avatar is a mortal shell bestowed with the paranormal might of a Patron Force, such as Time, Life, Death or Magic. This archetype includes several customizable features that allows room for abilities suited for your Patron Force; several such abilities are provided as examples. Includes three variations (avatar of balance, polytheism, and lost identity) and the character Panacea, avatar of Life Force.&lt;br/&gt;     The Houngan, a Vodoun (Voodoo) priest. Aside from stats for the Met Tet, a Houngan's companion spirit (think of a Voodoo version of a guardian angel), there are also rudimentary stats for Loas (Voodoo spirits), and a number of example voodoo spells, rituals, and charms. Includes four variations (gris-gris man, left-handed sorcerer, urban houngan, and zombie lord) and the character Papa Crane.&lt;br/&gt;     The Hybrid Vampire, the result of mortal blood mingling with that of the bloodsucking undead. Includes three variations (bloodline, changing the mix, and drinker) and the character Crimson Day.&lt;br/&gt;     The Necromancer, master of the undead. Includes some examples of necromantic spells and the character Lord Bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are the Requires (Skill) Check flaw and Timed drawback for customizing your basic archetype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
