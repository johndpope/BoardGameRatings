			<description>From the inside of the box (game description of the rules):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a stock market game for 3 to 6 persons.  It is played with 4 loaded (8-sided) dice called Quotes which are designed to give the effect of a constantly changing market. The black Quotes are weighted so they usually come up with low numbers and the whole Quotes are weighted so they usually come up with high numbers.  Only 2 Quotes are used at a time so that a market can be low (both black), mixed (a black and a white), or high (both white).  Object if ge game is to buy stock at a low price, hold it for awhile, and sell it at a higher price.  The game ends when one player doubles his money or when someone goes broke.  Winner is the player who first doubles his money or the player with the most money when someone goes broke.  Each game lasts about an hour.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
