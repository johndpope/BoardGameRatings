			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After winning a contest to manage the best restaurant in his hometown, Snowy the Bear grew restless. Upon seeing a newscast reporting on a mysterious castle from which no treasure hunters have emerged, Snowy packs his pick axe and satchel and sets off on an all-new adventure! As he makes his way through three beautiful environments, Snowy must collect all of the jewels and other trinkets on which he can get his paws while avoiding court jesters, dungeon masters, vampires and more!&lt;br/&gt;Snowy: Treasure Hunter III is an arcade puzzle game in which you climb ladders, dig through platforms and use a variety of items to collect goodies and either trap or avoid enemies. As bears like to keep their feet on the ground, there isn't any jumping involved, although you will have to perform mental gymnastics to figure out how to gather all of the riches on each level while staying alive. If you loved the first two Snowy: Treasure Hunter games, you'll enjoy the third one even more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Game Features:&lt;br/&gt; - 85 challenging levels &lt;br/&gt;- Three beautiful game worlds &lt;br/&gt;- Unlimited game time &lt;br/&gt;- Free upgrades to newer versions &lt;br/&gt;- Full technical support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
