							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Burger Time: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Data East's Burger Time the Card Game takes you back to the arcade of the 80's. When we were all young and had pockets full of quarters! Burger Time is a 2 player (can be played by 1 player) card game in which each &amp;quot;chef&amp;quot; tries to build the burgers from their menu first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards from the deck and build their burgers in order. Each burger is different and requires unique ingredients! Watch out for the bad guys...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns drawing cards from the deck.  Each card is one part of a burger. The goal is to assemble a burger one part at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over as soon as a player assembles the predetermined  number of burgers (shorter games require fewer burgers).  This player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
