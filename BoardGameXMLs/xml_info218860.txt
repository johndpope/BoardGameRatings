			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extinction Crisis is a Co-operative board game for 1-6 players. Working together as a team, players must stabilize the global populations of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles before time runs out or the damage done to the planet&amp;rsquo;s biodiversity is beyond repair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using unique character skills, combined with team strategy and a bit of luck, players travel the globe encountering real-world destruction events and conservation strategies as they try to bring an end to the worldwide Extinction Crisis. The overall health of the global animal populations is tracked on the Population Growth Index (PGI) chart on the board. For victory, each animal population must be &amp;ldquo;stabilized&amp;rdquo; by raising its PGI marker above the zero value. The primary method to do this is for a player to successfully complete a Reaction card during their turn. These scientifically accurate cards are a major determining factor towards the team&amp;rsquo;s overall success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, at the start of each player&amp;rsquo;s turn an Occurrence Card is drawn. These cards guide the story and introduce real-world events and challenges that must be overcome. But be careful&amp;hellip; Just when you think you&amp;rsquo;re in the clear you could be hit with a Destruction Event, causing an entire species to become endangered or a local habitat to be destroyed. Other actions allow players to meet these challenges and progress towards their final objective. Players must also pay attention to the health of the world&amp;rsquo;s waterways, invertebrates, and plants. Neglect any of the 3 main charts (PGI, IP, and Ocean) for too long and the consequences could be disastrous: a smart team balances the needs of all 3 charts continuously throughout the game to achieve victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extinction Crisis presents players with a daunting task and requires them to find solutions, adapt to challenges, and overcome the very real crisis facing the planet.  With only 10 turns each, how will you rise to the occasion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
