							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Eternal Rest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eternal Rest is an inn that treats its patrons to a most macabre experience. Staffed by animated skeletons and operated by an eccentric necromancer, the inn provides a complete, ready to use setting when the game master needs to serve up a quick meeting place or overnight stay for the party without resorting to &amp;quot;just another inn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 19-page supplement is suitable for any game system. It details the inn, its staff (both living and dead), and the unusual &amp;ldquo;regulars&amp;rdquo; found at the bar. The inn, the neighboring graveyard, and the catacombs-turned-private-rooms are all mapped in detail. In addition to plot hooks seeded throughout the profile of the inn, several more adventure hooks appear at the end, and all material can be easily placed in any fantasy setting you might choose to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eternal Rest can serve as a departure from the usual layover for adventurers, or it can become a base of operations for characters who like a little gloom with their drinks between quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
