							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cowards and Carrots</name>
									
			<description>The Middle Ages presented many challenges for people in Europe. Day-to-day life was made increasingly difficult when monarchs decided to send all of the able-bodied men off to fight in the Crusades. Could circumstances get even worse? Yes, when a creature of legend arrives at the local castle, eats the Regent and demands tribute. All that&amp;rsquo;s left to deal with the creature are old men, women, children and cowards. It&amp;rsquo;s time for the cowards to step up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a village elder in this coward-placement game, you are to assign tasks to your village&amp;rsquo;s cowards. &lt;br/&gt;Cowards can go to the lists to learn to become warriors, to the forests to become better hunters, to the monasteries to learn about their foe or to get boons, or to the fields to plant and harvest carrots (tribute to the Dragonbunny is paid in carrots&amp;hellip;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, you will have to send your cowards to face the dreaded Dragonbunny in the castle.&lt;br/&gt;The player whose coward eventually kills the Dragonbunny is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game time is 30 minutes per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
