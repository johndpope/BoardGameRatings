			<description>-=Make A Connection You're Sure To Get A Charge Out Of=-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Love Connector is a party game for any sized group of people in pairs.  Partners spin a spinner of body parts to see what two parts they must connect.  They then attach, via a strap, two plug ends to those portions of their bodies, respectively.  They are then timed on how quickly they can connect them.  While some connections are as mundane as 'arm' to 'chest'.  Others can be much more racy, with connections like 'head' to 'privates'.  Once the connection is made, the plugs beep, signifying that the timer should be stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
