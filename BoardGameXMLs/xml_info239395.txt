			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let Chaos Reign is a role-playing game where players and the Game Master (GM) share in designing the game to fit the setting and campaign to be played. This requires an open mind and removes any restraints bound by rules. The goal is to hearken back to early games where rules were few and the GM would create them on the fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players work with your GM to design your character how you want it.  This is YOUR game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GMs relax and let the chaos happen.  Free your mind from relying on a rulebook.  This is YOUR game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
