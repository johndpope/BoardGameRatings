			<description>Greek Salad is a 2-6 player card game for ages 6+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help the chefs prepare a Greek Salad! Obey their orders, add veggies and seasonings, mix the ingredients and the salad is done! The first player to get rid of all of his cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of your cards. You accomplish this by playing a card with a more of one type of ingridient that the last card played. For example if the last card played had 2 peppers, 4 tomatoes &amp;amp; 1 peice of feta cheese the next card played must contain either 5 tomatoes, 3 peppers or 2 pieces of feta cheese, if you can't play a card you must draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special 'seasoning' cards which skip alayers turn and mix up the discard pile. There are also two more special cards: the chef allows you to declare an ingredient you either want or don't want and the subsequent players must abide and the salad bowl card which reverses the logic of the rules so that for the example above with the peppers, tomatoes and cheese you would need a card with less than one of those ingredients. First one to discard all his cars wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
