			<description>Victory is ever sweeter when it&amp;rsquo;s stolen from your opponent&amp;rsquo;s hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the Shell is a new kind of board game that gives you amazing satisfaction. Oh No, this ain&amp;rsquo;t your traditional five-in-a-row game, but an original invention that is fast-paced, deeply strategic and dynamic. Nothing is inevitable, and the game is never won or lost until the very last moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our unique twist of simultaneous play makes every turn exciting and unpredictable. If both players go for the same space, a neutral egg blocks the space. Players can capture each other&amp;rsquo;s turtles by sandwiching them, which also allows them to claim a neutral egg. This encourages aggressive play and makes for dynamic back-and-forth gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the look on your friend&amp;rsquo;s face when your capture leads to a chain combo that devastates their beautifully set up position. What the Shell&amp;rsquo;s simple yet deep gameplay will keep you on your toes and always coming back for more! Challenge a friend today in this modern battle of wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Dynamic and original gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play a friend: on two iPads or even just one&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Practice against the AI&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Gorgeous graphics and music&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; English, German and Esperanto&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Online play coming soon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
