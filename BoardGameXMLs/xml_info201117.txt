							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack Of The Mids</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A small remote rural town has been attacked by strange gelatinous pyramids know as &amp;ldquo;Mids&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br/&gt;Communications to the outside world were cut off as the Mids Assaulted the town, dissolving every thing in their path. &lt;br/&gt;Attempts to fight back were useless, as any attack would only temporarily disperse the gooey Mids, Which would simply reform unharmed shortly thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Survivors of the initial attack have gathered in the last safe place in town, The School. It was there amid the townspeople&amp;rsquo;s despair that a local Professor made an announcement that gave them a glimmer hope. &lt;br/&gt;He proclaimed that he could devise a Formula to destroy the Mids for good. But he needed Samples of the Mids to complete it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can a few heroic individuals work together and gather the needed samples before the Town is overrun? Only you can answer that&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Is a Cooperative game Designed to be played with a 3house set of Looney Pyramids with gameplay similar to Flash Point:Fire Rescue or Pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will each take control of one of six characters,each with unique special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a players turn they have two action points to spend to perform actions such as moving across the board,smashing Mids to remove them from the board or taking samples to deliver and advance the game winning formula toward completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a player has finished their actions they must roll dice to spawn new Mids onto the board or trigger random events from the event die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win if they are able to deliver all the necessary samples to the formula before the town is overrun by the Mids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
