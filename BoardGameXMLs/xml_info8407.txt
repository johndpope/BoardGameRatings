							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indiana Jones and the Wrath of Hecate</name>
									
			<description>A three part solitaire adventure game featuring you, as Indiana Jones and his sidekick, Ko Chi. The game was included as an insert to Shadis Magazine #36:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Indiana Jones and the Wrath of Hecate, the game of narrow escapes and rumpled fedoras starring everyone's favorite archeologist.  Wrath is a solitaire game in three parts, designed to be played in a few hours; the player takes the role of Indiana Jones and his sidekick Ko as they attempt to thwart another dastardly Nazi plot to take over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part One: Secrets Revealed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL: Indy has entered the cult's tomb in search of a mystic cerimonial dagger.  He must reach the central chamber and grab the dagger, then exit the Temple by moving back to the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYER: selects path for Indy, rolling 2 dice to determine the number of action points for that turn, and navigates through the maze and various encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Two: Chase to the Docks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL: The Nazis have plans for Hecate and don't want our heroes to spoil the party. Indy and Ko have to reach the Bantu Wind before they get turned into Swiss cheese. The road however, leads down a narrow canyon, so maneuvering options are limited.  To make matters worse, the floor is littered with rocks and other debris, turning an otherwise straight roadway into a deadly slalom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYER: navigates Indy and Ko's jeep down the canyon avoiding rocks and debris and the Nazis, utilizing action points.  Game uses a moving map to represent the trip (Indy needs to survive the 5 mile trip to the Bantu Wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Three: By Darkest Moonlight:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL: The ceremony is underway, and Hecate will soon walk the Earth again. It's up to Indy and Ko to stop the ceremony from happening.  To do that they must fulfill two goals: Kill the Priest and rescue the Maiden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYER: uses Indy and Ko's action points to move around the map of the Temple of Hecate and disrupt the Nazi's reincarnation ceremony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each segment is played on a different board using a variety of pieces and straightforward game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[NOTE:  Actually, the cover of this issue has a typo.  The cover says Issue 35, but it's actually Issue 36.  Throughout the inside of the magazine, it's listed as #36.  Therefore be careful when buying the magazine for this Indiana Jones game so that you get the issue you're looking for.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
