			<description>A strategy game for 2 players, 10 years old and more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By properly placing your pawns,&lt;br/&gt;You will generate chain reactions&lt;br/&gt;That will destroy all your opponent's pawns!&lt;br/&gt;Except if the opposite happens...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game&lt;br/&gt;Remove all of your opponent's pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components&lt;br/&gt;A 19-hexagons boardgame&lt;br/&gt;35 pawns, one side white, the other side black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game mechanism&lt;br/&gt;The player who starts the game is randomly determined.&lt;br/&gt;The first player places one pawn of his color on an hexagon he chooses on the first circle (the circle of 6 hexagons around the central hexagon).&lt;br/&gt;The opponent places a pawn of his color on another hexagon of the first circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From now on, each player will place a pawn of his color on his game turn by applying the following rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a player cannot place a pawn on the central hexagon,&lt;br/&gt;     a player cannot place a pawn on a hexagon on which there are already 1 or 2 opponent's pawns,&lt;br/&gt;     a player can place a pawn on an empty hexagon if it touches a hexagon on which he already has 1 or 2 pawns,&lt;br/&gt;     a player can place a pawn on a hexagon on which he already has 1 or 2 pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explosion&lt;br/&gt;If, at the end of his turn, a player has 3 pawns on the same hexagon, an explosion happens: the 3 pawns are distributed in a Y shape on contiguous hexagons, and pawns that may have been on covered hexagons before the explosion now belong to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chain reaction: successive explosions&lt;br/&gt;It is possible (and it is even the good way to win!) that, after this first explosion, other hexagons have 3 pawns or more of the player's color. The player must proceed with the explosions until there is no more hexagon with 3 pawns or more, or until there are no more pawns from the opponent (he has won in this case!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The player must start with one of the hexagons having the most pawns on it (it is possible that there are 4 pawns on the same hexagon).&lt;br/&gt;     After each explosion, if there are still possible explosions and pawns from the opponent, go back to step 1!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has no pawns left on the board. His opponent is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
