							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Election Day</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leave Nothing on the Table&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the campaigning is done, the debates are over, and the voters are heading out to cast their votes, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the final push. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re fighting for a particular candidate or a specific cause, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to feel like there was more you could have done, that there was one more gambit you could have pulled to put your side over the top. Now is your final chance to make a difference before the votes are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Election Day in Seattle, and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty up for grabs, including the future of the Ork Underground. The power players of the sprawl want things to go their way&amp;mdash;whatever way that may be&amp;mdash;and they&amp;rsquo;re not pulling any punches. They&amp;rsquo;re dumping out their bags of tricks, and naturally some of those tricks involve giving money to shadowrunners. Whether they&amp;rsquo;re being asked to start riots between voters or find an operative who is sitting on too many secrets, they&amp;rsquo;re going to have a busy day, and their actions will shape the future of Seattle. With any luck, they&amp;rsquo;ll be alive to see it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SRM 04-11: Election Day is the latest in the Shadowrun Missions series, the living campaign for Shadowrun. Involving players in the chaos and power plays of a Seattle election, it&amp;rsquo;s a great next step for players who have played through this whole series of Missions, or a great first step for players looking to step in when the action gets hot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous publisher blurp:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buried Underground, Part 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vote Early, Vote Often! Its election season in Seattle and the hot topic item this year is the Ork Underground. Will it become a fully recognized and funded district of Seattle, or will it be abandoned by the city completely? Over the last year, the runners have gotten their hands on a lot of dirt about both sides of the election that if made public can sway public opinion. Which way will it go? The fate of the Underground is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
