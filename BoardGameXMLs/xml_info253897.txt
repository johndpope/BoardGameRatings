							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Theft of the Moon</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF: &lt;br/&gt;When:&lt;br/&gt;A company may undertake this adventure at any time from 2946 onwards, but in later years the Festival of the Full Moon is more established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place somewhere in the land of the Beornings. The preferred setting is the village of Stonyford, but any village or settlement of the Beornings is acceptable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What:&lt;br/&gt;The company visits (and may participate) in a harvest festival and its celebrations. When a powerful artefact is stolen, the heroes are tasked with its recovery. They track the artefact and confront the thieves at their secret meeting place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why:&lt;br/&gt;The Sickle of the Full Moon is a heirloom of a bygone age. Beorn has lent it to his people, but his generosity has put his treasure in peril. Also, Viglund is behind the theft and this adventure can introduce that conflict for Loremasters who wish to work this adventure into the framework of Heart of the Wild and Darkening of Mirkwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;This is a fan created supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
