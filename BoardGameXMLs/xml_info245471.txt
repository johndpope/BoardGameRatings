			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still in active development and available to the public for purchase in it's unfinished state, either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Society is made by a dedicated group of devs. They failed on KS, but has pushed on regardless. The game is available from their website in alpha-state. It is coming to Steam Early Access in the first half of 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is a post-apocalyptic city-builder. Your city, your laws. You decide the moral values of the city and its inhabitants, as you try to make it in a harsh world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is as much about the moral choices you have to make, as it is about building a city from the ruins of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
