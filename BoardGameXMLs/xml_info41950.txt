							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GYBE-OH! Round Britain Sailing Race</name>
									
			<description>Fun sailing game for between 2-8 adults or children.  Uses a mixture of good luck, skill and chance as is the way with sailing.  Object is to race over a set course, say Plymouth to Castle Bay in the Hebrides first home being the winner.  On the way you'll have changing forecasts (32 real ones from a previous Round Britain come with the game), tide and Perils! to contend with.  At the end of the race, which can last as you like it, from 10 minutes to 2 hours, you'll have found out amusing and interesting things about sailing offshore, all without necessarily having to know a thing about sailing.  So Good sailing.  Gybe-Oh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gybe-Oh! is printed on plastic, rolls up and comes with two unusual dice, eight boats and Gybe-Oh! and Peril! cards plus, of course, the forecasts.  And it is all packed in a tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
