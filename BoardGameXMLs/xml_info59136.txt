							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thirteenth Wheel: Broken Sanctuary</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book explores the intricacies of political conspiracies and espionage in the Mechanical Dream universe.  It is divided into two sections.   The first part, The Thirteenth Wheel sourcebook, describes the machinations of an underground movement dedicated to opposing the Core's expansion at any cost.  It covers the conspiracy's history and goals; it's thirteen component groups; their rivalries and alliances; the movement's current projects, and the puppeteers that pull the strings behind the scenes.  Three groups are described in minute detail, along with their current schemes, resources, respective ideologies, and key agents.   Also featured is the Veiled Tribunal, an independent intelligence agency dedicated to the Core's security, along with a new character profession: the counter-espionage agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book's second section is a complete adventure, Broken Sanctuary, featuring the machinations of the Thirteenth Wheel.  The player characters take on the role of special operatives for the Veiled Operatives to investigate the mysterious events occurring to an isolated Secure Stock A.E.S. orpee repository at its adjoining town, an eerie place harboring sinister secrets.  As the investigation progresses, evidence reveals a complex web of intrigue with ramifications that hint of a far greater menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 20 game aids, an extended character index, and mysterious revelations galore, Broken Sanctuary can be played either on its own or as the first volume of the greater Thirteenth Wheel campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
