							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Shamans</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The healing of the sick and the restoration of the dying are his most important functions, but he has other skills as well - he can curse, he has control over fire, he can exchange souls with an animal or another man. As an adept of high prowess he can fly, control the wind, rain, and sun, and can transform himself into an animal. At his most powerful he can hide his soul, making him almost unkillable. He is the Shaman!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
