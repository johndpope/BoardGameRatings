							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stop Caution Go</name>
									
			<description>This card game has a deck of 56 cards: 10 each of Vehicles Inward and Outward and of Pedestrians Left and Right; 15 traffic light cards (five each Stop, Caution, Go); and a single Policeman card. The rules refer to a board, but a diagram on page 4 shows that it is very basic, essentially a square enclosing two diagonals. One diagonal is for the vehicles and the other for the pedestrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are included for four different games using the set. The first is a suit-following game. One player places one of the four vehicle or pedestrian cards on the appropriate space. Everyone else must either follow suit, pass, or play a Stop card on top of the pile. The next player must pass or play a Caution card on one of the other three spaces. Then a Go card must be played, and the player after the one placing go leads off the new suit in the location designated by the Caution/Go cards. The policeman card allows a player to stop the play in the current suit and immediately start a new suit in its proper location. The first player to empty his hand wins the round and each other player is penalized for the values of the cards still held. A game is four rounds, with lowest total points winning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules do not specify a publication date, but the box has a &amp;quot;Patent applied for 9963/38&amp;quot;, which suggests a 1938 publication date. The clothes on the people in the illustrations scream the 30's. Also, Zebra Crossings were introduced to Britain in the 30's and this game may have been published to take advantage of the interest in such things. Indeed, the rule book notes that this was one of a series of &amp;quot;Road Sense&amp;quot; games being published as &amp;quot;a splendid means of encouraging thought in road usage&amp;quot;, adding that &amp;quot;Police Chiefs, Local Authorities and Safety First Associations, etc., recommend this series of games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
