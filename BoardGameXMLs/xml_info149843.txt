			<description>In this game the players are stock market share holders, trying to put their opponents out of the game by bankrupting them. The game is based on the Greek Stock market of the 90s and the press of the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has many similarities to Monopoly, but in place of real estate now there are company shares. Houses and hotels are replaced by percentage of the company in stocks, owned by the player. Paying money based on stocks they own to other players as well as various taxes and public service bills may cost money to the players similar to monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting change is the fact that two players can merge their shares in order to get a bigger percentage payment from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of course is to take out of business your opponents by causing them to go bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
