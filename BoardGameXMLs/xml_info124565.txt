			<description>Age of Steam: Las Vegas and Korea (N&amp;amp;S) is another pair of expansions for the Age of Steam board game, with new maps and new rules for each setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Las Vegas, players visit the famed gambling town, trying to build their network as usual while also paying attention to the money on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Korea (N&amp;amp;S), the cost to build track varies depending on which side of Korea players build upon &amp;ndash; but in the wealthy South, there are more cubes to deliver than in the poor North. Delivery between North and South becomes more and more difficult as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
