			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two sessions.  In the first session players collaboratively detail the play region (an agrarian community in northeast Thailand), it's topography, and its geology.  They also divide the play region into parcels and then determine which crops are allocated to which parcel.  The two major crops are sugarcane and rice, though others are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second session involves the creation of characters (generally, all local farmers) and is played in rounds where characters make harvest and planting decisions, as well as disposing of their harvests at a commercial market.  Every two turns, the players have the option to modify the game rules - the game subsequently proceeds under the new rules, if any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
