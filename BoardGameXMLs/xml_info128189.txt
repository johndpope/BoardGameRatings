			<description>Dragon Clash is a game of strategic combat between mighty dragons of legend and is set in a war-torn, modern-day world. After centuries of abuse from mankind, the dying spirit of Earth has called out to the dragons with hopes they&amp;rsquo;d help better humanity and reshape the world in elemental harmony. However, the destruction and violence that gave rise to their birth also tainted the dragons, driving them mad with a lust for war. Now the dragons not only battle humanity, but themselves. Ruthlessly hunting for the dragon eggs to satiate their endless hunger for power, the dragons wage an eternal struggle for dominance and the very soul of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dragon Clash, you are the dragon, hatching your beast from a variety of decks geared towards a specific breed and play style. The core set of Dragon Clash includes the Red Breather, Blue Adept, Silver Channeler, and Brown Mauler decks. Each deck of 72-cards includes a dragon and a variety of attacks unique to that deck&amp;rsquo;s theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To claim victory, your dragon must win the opponent&amp;rsquo;s Dragon Egg Card. You can do this by either forcing your opponent to discard his Dragon Egg or by consuming your opponent&amp;rsquo;s hoard with a Feast card, while a Dragon Egg is hidden there. Players take turns feeding their dragon&amp;rsquo;s hoard, aging from hatchling to elder wyrm, training a variety of attacks, and engaging in combat. Executing attacks, playing effects, and taking damage depletes your dragon&amp;rsquo;s Essence (the playing deck) and when a player&amp;rsquo;s dragon has exhausted all of their Essence, they must flee and lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
