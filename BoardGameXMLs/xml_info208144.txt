							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperial Ogres</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This character supplement provides you with all of the rules required to include Ogre Player Characters in a game centred in the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game Masters] thinking of adding Ogre PCs to their game should seriously consider the impact of such a move. Not only are Ogres particularly strong in combat, which can imbalance certain scenarios, they are also very weak in social situations, which many WFRP adventures focus upon. Ogres are not as accepted by the general folk of the Old World as Elves and Dwarves (primarily due to their belligerent natures), which can have massive repercussions on the enjoyment of playing an Ogre, who may have to miss, or will simply ruin, subtler adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
