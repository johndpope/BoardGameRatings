			<description>Doggerland Miniature Skirmish Game is a fast-play, skirmish-level fantasy miniature system that has been co-written by S.E. Lantry and Andrea Sfiligoi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with Songs of Blades and Glory, it uses an action-point system that requires no book-keeping. The rules are designed to be simple, fast and fun so that a mini campaign of several games can be played in a single evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basic Game follows closely to the SoBG model, i.e., the game includes statistics for 180+ monsters and heroes, and details to be able to create your own. Also there are campaign rules where your warband grows more powerful after every battle, and six basic scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Rules include the use of an expandable and customizable deck of cards used fro initiative, environmental effects, defence and building a result into historic proportions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers co-operative and competitive play Adventures, and can be played in 15mm and 28mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
