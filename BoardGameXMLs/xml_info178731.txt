							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terraforming: The Druidic Craft</name>
									
			<description>In this terrain tile manipulation game, 2 to 4 Druids match wits to transform the terrain to match their own personal goal. Every Druid has a unique ability, and with the use of movement, standard actions, action cards, and well planned strategy, they set out to transform the land to their liking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not worker placement, it's not tile placement, it's tile manipulation! No dice to decide your fate - just your cunning, wits, and planning. Are you ready to transform the land to the way you want it? After all, you are a Druid; you should be able to do that without any problem. But watch out for the other Druids disrupting your terraforming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game by completing your personal goal - even on someone else's turn! To complete your goal, all terrain tiles specified on your Goal Card must be face-up on the game board in the layout specified. While you are trying to complete your goal, your opponents are also trying to complete their own - which could disrupt your tactics and planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard game is played on a field of Terrain Tiles laid out in a 5 x 5 configuration. On your turn, you may Pass (take no moves or actions) and draw a Spell Card. Or you may take one Move Action, one Standard Action, and as many Free Actions as you desire (in ANY order). Then at the end of your turn, draw one Spell Card (yes, that means if you Pass, you get two Spell Cards). Download the Rules to learn how all the Actions work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Terrain Tiles are double sided and represent many types of terrain like mountains, water, desert, grassland, and frozen tundra, as well as special areas like a village or a tavern. But there are two very special terrain types: there is the Mystical Wild Tile that is a wild Terrain Tile, and then there is the Void Tile that no player can move through or land on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the game are four variants: one to make the game easier, one to make the game longer and more challenging, one that increases the size of the game area (to 6 x 6 tiles), and then there is the Black Druid variant, who adds a truly chaotic element to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
