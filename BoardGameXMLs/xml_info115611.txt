							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paper Trails: Hiking!</name>
									
			<description>50 tear-off sheets in each Paper Trails pad make this an ideal travel game. Each game combines the luck of the dice and strategy in the attempt to reach the destination before your opponent. Be the first to hike to the Trail&amp;rsquo;s end in the HIKING! edition. Each Paper Trails includes a 50-sheet Game Pad, a Pencil and Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts from a starting position. Players roll dice to see how far they move. A bad roll results in damage. If a player receives too much damage is out of the game. Once players reach a checkpoint, they must roll dice each turn until their total equals/exceeds that checkpoint's number. The first player to clear all four checkpoints and reach the finish wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
