			<description>WATCH YOUR GARDEN GROW is a simple and enthralling game for children Ages 5 - 10.  Each player has a garden which, starting from seeds has to be brought into bloom.  The garden goes through a natural growth cycle and through the seasons.  But you have you watch out for pests and bad weather!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to roll the die and move their gardener playing piece clockwise around the board.  The square that is landed on provides instructions on which plants can be put in the garden, which are in bloom, which have been killed off by frost etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeds, bulbs and flowering plants are taken from a tray known as &amp;quot;Mother Nature's Garden Shop&amp;quot; and placed in the appropriate place on the player's garden card. In so doing the garden becomes populated with seed, bulbs and plants which mature and flower as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get their whole garden into bloom is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
