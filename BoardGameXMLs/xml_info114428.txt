			<description>From the publisher's site: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Infinity Dungeon is a casual dungeon crawl game that is light on rules and heavy on fun. If you like using ridiculous, inane, or unimaginably powerful spells and tools to overcome similarly improbable situations, Infinity Dungeon is the game for you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Infinity Dungeon, players receive randomly generated characters with unusual abilities and powers, such as Postman, Opera Singer, Space Marine, or Evil Overlord. The players are then put through a series of randomly selected dungeon rooms, each featuring a different puzzle or obstacle and a set of randomly selected tools that they have at their disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the powers of their characters and the tools in the room, the party must come up with a solution to the puzzle. Once the solution is announced, players vote on whether they believe the proposed solution will solve the puzzle. A die roll is made, with the target roll adjusted by the party's confidence in the plan. If it succeeds, the players move on to the next room. If it fails, then the player in charge of devising the plan is killed, and must roll a new character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a lightweight storytelling/improvisational RPG that requires no setup or pre-planning, and is playable by groups with little to no prior roleplaying experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
