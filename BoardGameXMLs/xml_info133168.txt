							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thunder Megazord&#039;s Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Simple card game set in the universe of the Power Rangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards and lay them all face-down on the table with no over-lapping. A player turns over two cards. If they don't match, he puts them back face-down on the table (in the usual fashion of a Pairs game). If they match, he keeps the pair and has another go. He stops when he doesn't draw a pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twist in this game is the Lord Zed card. If a player reveals Lord Zed, that player must return all his pairs won so far to the face-down area in the centre of the table and must start collecting again from scratch. Once Lord Zed has made his entrance, he is removed from play so that it can only happen once a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
