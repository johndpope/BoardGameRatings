							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Clear Round?</name>
									
			<description>Game featured in the 1978 Black Beauty Annual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple die rolling game. Each player is a rider in a show-jumping competition. As usual with Goose-type games, there are special spaces (illustrated by a horseshoe). Each special space represents faults earned by the rider that round. These fault points have to be written down as they are earned. A slight twist with this game is that the order of finishing also generates time-faults; 1st to finish, none; second to finish, 5 time-faults, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all the players have finished, the player with the fewest faults, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
