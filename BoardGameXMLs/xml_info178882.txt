			<description>Players decide either to set a time limit for the game, or to stop the game when one player has scored a pre-set number of goals (a target of 3 is recommended). Each player flicks the spinner three times and the one who 'scores' the most goals kicks off the game. The ball is placed at the centre of the board on a member of the team who will start the game. The player can move any one piece on his team (except the man who has possession) at the start of each turn, one or two sections in any direction on the board, to 'cover' the ball. Then he uses the spinner and follows the instructions, moving towards his opponents goal. The goalkeeper cannot move out of his box (which consists of six sections).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
