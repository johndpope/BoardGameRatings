			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faeries race from opposite ends of the board for the safety of the central line while bombarding each other with cheese. Helpful trolls blunder about, collecting up the cheese to replenish the faeries' cheese stock, but also impede their faerie friends' progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comprises a leather board (11 x 5.5&amp;rdquo;) and hand-finished wooden pieces; with plastic dice. Each player has six faeries, one troll and six wedges of cheese. In a turn a player rolls four dice - one pink, one green and two yellow. Using the number rolled on the pink die, the player moves a faerie towards the middle safe line on the board. With the green die the player moves the troll, who can pick up cheese that has been thrown by the opposing player. Using the two numbers rolled on the yellow dice as co-ordinates, the player &amp;lsquo;throws&amp;rsquo; cheese into their opponent's half of the board. Any faerie this lands on is eliminated from the game; cheese also blocks the movement of faeries towards the safe line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player aims to move as many of their own faeries as possible to the central line and off the board, while eliminating or blocking the movement of their opponent's faeries by throwing cheese at them. The winner is the player who, once one player has no more faeries to move, has most faeries safe. If the result is tied, numbers of remaining faeries and cheese on the board can determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
