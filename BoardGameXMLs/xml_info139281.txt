			<description>Official Website Description&lt;br/&gt;Before you even sit down to Duel, show everyone you&amp;rsquo;re ahead of the game by carrying your cards with style in the all-new, limited edition Yu-Gi-Oh! Double Deck Case. This Double Deck Case bears the full mark of the Crimson Dragon from Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&amp;rsquo;s, letting all your opponents know you mean business!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Double Deck Case comes with two removable full-size Deck trays, each with a card divider, so you can keep 2 full Decks (including Extra Decks!) side-by-side without mixing up any of your cards. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re bringing just 1 Deck to a tournament, you can use the other side to store your tokens, calculator, dice, coins, and more! The Double Deck Case is a great companion for any Duelist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Double Deck Box is made of sturdy material, capable of handling the rigors of intense Dueling for hours at a time. It&amp;rsquo;s flexible, so it won&amp;rsquo;t break easily, and it&amp;rsquo;s magnet-fastened so your cards will stay inside and protected even when the Double Deck Case is tossed around in your backpack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
