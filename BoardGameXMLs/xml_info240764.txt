							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 More Traditional Chinese Medicinal Herbs to Find</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different herbs that are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM. TCM has been around for over 2,000 years, so these herbs are suitable for most time periods, and could be found in a modern TCM shop or a fantasy herbalist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although they are called herbs, many are not herbs in the standard sense, as they also include spices, insects and animal parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The herbs are listed with what they are used for, as well as their Chinese name and what they actually are. Most herbs are combined when used, and whether or not they have any game value is up to the GameMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;32. Huang Jing - Siberian solomon's seal rhizome, used to invigorate Qi, moisten the lung and nourish Yin, to treat dry coughs, to strengthen the spleen, to treat loose stool, lassitude, anorexia and emaciation, to induce appetite and to treat weakness of the waist and knees and dizziness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover and around two thirds of a page are the front matter and introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
