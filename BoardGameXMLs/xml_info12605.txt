			<description>A dice game that comes in a boxing glove. The objective is to be the last boxer standing. You have a 20sided as your max hit level and roll two 10s (for a number from 1 to a 100) to attack or defend - If defending and your power number is lower than the attackers power number you take a hit and your 20d is changed to 19 - The game moves back and forth like that until only one player is left. Not very complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
