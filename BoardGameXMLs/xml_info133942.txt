			<description>No more waiting on the hard shoulder in Europe to be rescued! Tow Truck Simulator places you in the role of the driver and operator of a rescue truck as you become the hero of the hour and rescue broken down vehicles and attend accidents. Or perhaps you will prefer to take the role of the driver of a dreaded towing truck and tow away illegally parked cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four models of tow trucks for you to choose from each with a crane and winch to remove every kind of vehicle. You will learn how to handle different cars to get them loaded as quickly as possible! &lt;br/&gt;The large detailed 3D environment allows you to freely explore the roads around you whilst searching for drivers in distress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
