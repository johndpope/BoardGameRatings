			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s ready to tear up the streets&amp;hellip; Road Hazard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 Rogue, Road Hazard is a highwayman with a need for speed! Road Hazard is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Hazard&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;ldquo;Blue&amp;quot; to identify the super-normal technology that he uses in his crimes. That technology takes the form of a powerful vehicle he &amp;ldquo;liberated&amp;rdquo; from an advanced weapon development company. No ordinary car, the X-9 Assault Vehicle gives Road Hazard a deadly array of weapons and speed when he hits the streets. He&amp;rsquo;s constantly looking for races or other opportunities to test the limits of this supermachine, and will quickly identify heroes with super-cars of their own as rivals to be challenged. His criminal activities will earn the attention of any hero who wants to make their city, and particularly their streets, safer by putting him behind bars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
