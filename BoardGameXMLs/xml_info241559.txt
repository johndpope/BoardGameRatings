							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruins of Mars</name>
									
			<description>Ruins of Mars is a deceptively simple, strategic board game. Players are stowaways in the year 2179 who somehow managed to get aboard a flight to Mars. Excavators have uncovered lost ruins that show that Mars was once a hotbed of activity. As Earth's ozone depletes hope is waning. Uncovering what caused the demise of martian civilization and understanding their technologies might be the only hope Earth has left!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays with 10 communal cards which are located around the center board. Players can chose any pile and then place cards down for their effect (first on the spot they took the cards from and then on each successive spot until they run out of cards - similar to mancala).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
