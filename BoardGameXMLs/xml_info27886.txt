			<description>From the Patch Products Press Release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loose Lips&amp;trade; is more than a drawing game, more than an acting game and more than a talking game. It's all three games in one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play Loose Lips, you'll give clues by talking in some rounds and acting or drawing in other rounds. Your goal is to get your teammates to guess the answer without letting forbidden similar words slip off their lips. If they guess the right word, your team scores. But if your team has loose lips and says the forbidden words, the other team scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's an example: If the answer is Hawk and the forbidden Lip Slips are Bird and Buzzard, you'll have to give clues to get your team to say Hawk without saying the similar forbidden words&amp;mdash;Bird or Buzzard. And you only have 60 seconds! This fast-paced party game will keep your teammates' lips moving while you talk, act or draw your way through each word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loose Lips is played with 4 or more players in 2 teams, ages 12 to adult&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
