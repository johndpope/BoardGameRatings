			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guilty Party is a mystery party game for the Wii. The plot centres around the Dickens Detective Agency, a sleuthing group led by the Commodore. The Commodore is retiring, and his arch-nemesis Mr. Valentine plans a crime spree to spring in his absence. The players play members of the detective agency and must find the villain&amp;rsquo;s agents before time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During gameplay each player has a number of action tokens that they can use each turn. Play is turn based, and each action taken uses up a token. Some actions activate a mini-game which the player must complete to earn clues to build a profile of the crook. There are a number of different scenarios for the players to undertake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
