							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wyrmkeep Dungeons BW1: Temple of the Dragon Kin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learned sage, Gaspar Uberbellum, has made it known that he seeks to hire a party of stalwart adventurers to find and explore a lost temple dedicated to the veneration of dragons and their humanoid children, the dragonborn. Within this Temple of the Dragon Kin is supposedly a powerful magic item that the sage covets: the Helm of the Dragon Lord. The group will be paid handsomely for successfully locating, extracting, and returning the Helm to Gaspar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds like a profitable arrangement! Simple really. Well, the adventurers should expect to encounter deadly traps, inscrutable puzzles, and powerful guardians along the way. Nothing that a strong and resourceful party of adventurers cannot overcome. Although they might still want to be a bit wary about dragons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you a game master looking for an interesting and challenging adventure for your players that can be completed in one session? Well, I believe I have just what you want: Temple of the Dragon Kin is a mini-adventure module designed for a band of 6-8 5th Edition DnD characters of 6th to 8th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module has over 20 encounter areas, a half-dozen new monsters, maps of Temple and the lands arouns it, and stat blocks for all NPCs and opponents. Both a set of pre-generated player characters and a ready-to-print,  poster-sized version of the cover are included as seperate PDF files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
