							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der gestohlene Harem oder die falschen Eunuchen</name>
									
			<description>The sultan's harem is the goal of many a fake eunuch - actually competitors of the sultan, as the man with the greatest harem becomes the next sultan in this country.&lt;br/&gt;One player is randomly designated as being the guard eunuch. Another player tries to kidnap one of the ladies. This is done by rolling six dice. Now both the guard and the potential kidnapper try to calculate a result of six from the die rolls by using multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. If the kidnapper manages this first, he gets a lady. If the guard is faster, the kidnapper has to say something in a ridiculous high eunuch's voice and it's the next kidnapper's turn. When all the ladies are gone, the player with most ladies is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A memory variant and a &amp;quot;Turbanspiel&amp;quot; (turban game) are also described in the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
