			<description>&amp;quot;Unique Race Game for Young and Old&amp;quot;, so say the rules.&lt;br/&gt;48 cards, depicting horses. 24 are 'white' and 24 are 'black'. The horses are numbered 1 to 48. Cards are sent round the table by passing a card to the player on your left. If it matches the colour of the recipient's horse, it is passed to the next left. If not, it goes on the bottom of your stack and you will have to try again when it reaches the top of your stack. Little skill needed. Going round all the players and back to you, is considered as 'going round the course'. First player to get all his horses 'round' wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
