							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypts &amp; Creatures Campaign Adventure: The Ruins of Zikx</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the Adventure Begin!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Ruins of Zikx! This is a campaign adventure designed for four to five characters at level seven, whose total combined levels should be between 26-33. The difference between this book and the Dungeon Adventures series is that this is a narrated campaign story. The Ruins of Zikx was specifically designed for use with the Shaleria Campaign Setting book. The majority of this story takes place within the Orwid Swamp, east of the Great Ga'Ruun Empire. It is highly advised that the GM read the Crypts &amp;amp; Creatures: Shaleria Campaign Setting book before running this campaign adventure. The following is a description of the &amp;ldquo;dungeon shorthand&amp;rdquo; used for each trap and some monster abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a deadly encounter in the dwarven town of Shagour, the players have stumbled upon a dark secret which had been hidden for centuries, away from the prying eyes of the world. The local inhabitants have been raised on the legend of Orwid Swamp: an unknown deadly disease that spread throughout the land long ago, and the rise of the undead from the dark murky waters. Now, the players find themselves being called upon to put to rest the twisted foulness of the swamp once and for all. Information from the local sages leads the players to a&lt;br/&gt;crazy witch living on the edge of the swamp, northeast of town. She will help, but can she be trusted? Can the players solve the swamp's dilemma before they become too involved in undead and magical politics? Will they discover the ancient powers and treasures of the Orwid? Can they survive the intense powers at the heart of the Ruins of Zikx?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
