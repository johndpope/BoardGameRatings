			<description>The Deer Stalking Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a deer park divided into two Chases by a high wall which has gaps through it. If a huntsman moves on to the same straight line as the stag (providing there is no obstruction of wall or rock in between) the stag is counted as dead and is removed from the board. There are five stags to bag and the winner is the huntsman who bags the largest number of stags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The huntsmen throw the dice in turn and move along the brown dots according to the number cast. They can only move from dot to dot along the straight lines. They cannot turn corners and they must move the exact number or not at all. If a huntsman moves on to the same straight line as the stag (providing there is no obstruction of a wall or rock in between) the stag is counted as dead and becomes their trophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The part of the stag is played by the two huntsmen in turn as follows: a huntsman moves his own piece first then if he wishes he can move the stag either one or two dots in a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
