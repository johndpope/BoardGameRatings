			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of you have spent a rather busy yet refreshingly uneventful day in the Ravens Bluff Bazaar. The market place is always lively and interesting with colors flowing from every tent and pole. Now the square is closing down for the day, and you hustle out of the area to avoid the rush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the side street along Chandler Way you deftly manage to skirt the early tavern crowds as people rush from their daily work. Only a few individuals have taken this way out along with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, you hear a cry for help coming from inside an important looking building bearing a banner that marks its owner as a member of the merchants guild. By the look of the building, the owner must be a very wealthy merchant indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
