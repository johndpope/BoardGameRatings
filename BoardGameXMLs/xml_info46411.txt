							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poll: The Game of Politics</name>
									
			<description>The Art of Election&lt;br/&gt;It's Your Age Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is intended for children from 8-80. We have designed it to be both reflective and representative of electionary politics as they operate today. Each facet has a relevance and significance to the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; game itself, and our only alteration is to have injected a sorely lacking sense of humour. Enjoy and be entertained.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As from the blurb this is a game of politics set in Australia with players attempting to win the election by securing a majority in the House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board is a large circle with a series of concentric circles within representing different city &amp;amp; county constituencies. At the center is a grid representing the House, with a Hereditary Seat space at the center of this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll die to gain a number of move points used to move vote blocks around the board in an attempt to gain control of seats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also pick up &amp;quot;Contingency &amp;amp; Complication&amp;quot; cards to add some variety to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
