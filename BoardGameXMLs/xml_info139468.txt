			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Red Rain is a role-playing game about boxers dealing with serious issues inside and outside of the boxing ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires three players. Two players take on the role of opposing boxers getting ready for their fight against one another. And, one player takes on the role of the &amp;ldquo;referee,&amp;rdquo; overseeing the drama that builds around these two fighters, their relationships, and their ultimate confrontation in the ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two distinct phases. First, players explore the tough lives of the two boxers, resolving the fighters&amp;rsquo; personal issues and working through their difficult choices as they prepare for the big fight. Then, players actually play through the boxing match, round by round and blow by blow, to decide which of the two fighters emerges the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need a deck of poker-style playing cards (remove the jokers), and a couple pieces of paper to keep track of the fighters and their relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
