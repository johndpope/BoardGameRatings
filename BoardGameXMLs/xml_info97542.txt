			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amtgard is a not-for-profit, free, non-sectarian group dedicated to the recreation of medieval and fantasy genres. Amtgard has a vast array of new experiences to offer the interested adventurer, from making clothing appropriate to a certain time period, to wielding a foam-&lt;br/&gt;padded replica of an ancient weapon on the field of battle. The recreation of medieval and fantasy combat  is the core of Amtgard and the main concern of this rulebook. The rules set forth herein are as detailed and complete as possible, but not all situations can be covered. Common sense and fair play should be used to resolve any problems. Anyone may join&lt;br/&gt;Amtgard by: &lt;br/&gt;1.  Obtaining a copy of this rulebook and reading it. &lt;br/&gt;2.  Developing a persona and a persona history. &lt;br/&gt;3.  Making a costume for yourself that is fitting to your persona. &lt;br/&gt;4.  Filling out a membership form and waiver and turning them in to the Prime Minister. Minors must have their waivers signed by their parents or legal guardians. Minors under the age of 14 may not participate in combat without special permission from the Monarch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
