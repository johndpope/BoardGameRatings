							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Puppeteer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though similar to other types of Bards, the Puppeteer is unique in his or her mastery over the arts of puppetry and the mystical nature in which he or she controls the puppets. They are masters of illusion and can mesmerize the average person with the wiles of their deft handiwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the majority of the puppetry involves the traditional marionette, the Puppeteer is equally adroit in the use of shadow puppets, hand puppets, rod puppets and the like. Likewise, the Puppeteer is skilled in the art of puppet making and should never find him or herself lacking for a puppet to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for Lamentations of the Flame Princess, but compatible with all OSR systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
