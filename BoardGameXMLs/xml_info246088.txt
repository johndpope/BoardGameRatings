			<description>A balanced strategy game with attitude that's designed to get your drinking friends into card games and your card game friends drunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammered Heroes is a kickass battle card game that is great for any gaming night. Why waste time with friends playing silly games like quarters or king's cup, when you could play something with a little more brains, and a lot more treachery?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammered Heroes is a great way to introduce new friends to tabletop, and the initiated will find plenty to love as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your numbered HAMMERED HEROES compete with your opponents' numbered heroes, for QUEST CARDS. CHEAP SHOTS are used by players to disrupt your opponents' plans, or increase your chances of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After FIVE ROUNDS, the player with the most QUEST CARD POINTS wins. But be wary, CURSES and PARTY FOULS abound!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
