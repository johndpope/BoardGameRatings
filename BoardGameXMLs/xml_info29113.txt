			<description>Simple dice game simulating a hole of golf.&lt;br/&gt;A player first rolls the green die to try to get on the green (2 out of 6 chances). Once on the green the player rolls the white die until he sinks the ball (2 in 6 chance). &lt;br/&gt;On the first roll of the green die only, the player has a 1 in 6 chance of hitting a hole in one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a sand timer, which is not used for the main game as described above - players just try to roll certain outcomes on the die as many times as they can in a fixed time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other games in this series - Tennis, Soccer and Cricket&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
