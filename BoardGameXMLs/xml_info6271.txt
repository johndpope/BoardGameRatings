							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Need Drew&#039;s Truck</name>
									
			<description>A cute little game where you have large items you need to get home and a mutual friend Drew has a truck that can transport those things for you.  Competition revolves around getting the truck to go where you want it to go and arranging for there to be room in the truck for your things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from moving the truck around the board,  there are also cards you can play to repack the truck, drop things off the truck, give other players flat tires or bad backs or otherwise impede their progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truck is metal and the things are differently shaped magnets. Very much like Tetris in a moving vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     CCG Workshop (no longer available)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
