							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return of the Mountain King</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Mountain King has returned. Now he has settled down a few miles north of Larm and is attacking ships that travel the river, Dolm. Thus the trade between the capital of Dolmvay in the south and the Dwarven Kingdoms is in peril. This module was written as a tournament scenario for the Role Play Convention (RPC) in Cologne (April 3rd to April 5th 2009) for 3rd level characters and presents a complete scenario with maps (for GM &amp;amp; players), seven pre-generated tournament characters, a scoring sheet, a chart with all of the monster stats and the obligatory OGL in just 15 pages. The descriptions of all rooms have purposely been kept short for the tournament, and the adventure contains more monsters and treasure than is usual for a scenario of this size. This has been done to keep the scenario interesting. and to introduce new players to many different situations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
