							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">KABOOM!</name>
									
			<description>The old man stepped into the arena, inhaled one last time on his cigar and flicked it onto the ground, grinding it into the dust with his heel. He looked up, squinting as the setting sun glinted in his eyes. Seven other figures stood in a wide circle, each armed with an array of weaponry - a sniper, a famous action hero, a modern day samurai, a no-nonsense paid assassin, a post-apocalyptic survivor, a huge musclebound powerhouse, an anti-terrorist soldier.....All armed to the teeth and ready to fight to the death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The retired spec-ops Colonel flicked the latch of the sturdy missile launcher that was slung across his shoulders, checked the magazine of the machine gun hanging across his chest, andd fiddled one last time with the sights of the sniper rifle in his hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overkill was underrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KABOOM! is a party game for all ages for 4-8 players. Each player receives one of 8 characters and, using dice, chooses weapons with which to attack their opponents, wearing away their life points until they are the last one left standing. Each round of KABOOM! can be played in a matter of minutes, especially if played at a high tempo, and so although players are eliminated, they never have to wait long for a new round to start! Players are encouraged to hold grudges, get into character, mock, cajole, beg and target the player who keeps winning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is about shooting eachother, it's abstract enough that it's suitable for children, in fact much of the playtesting was carried out on children aged between 7 and 14....But is also fun and suitable for adults, especially adults who are letting their hair down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
