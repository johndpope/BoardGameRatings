			<description>It is the age old question: what would you do if there was a zombie apocalypse?  How would you find food?  Or ammo?  Where would you hole-up to protect you and your loved ones from the hungry dead?  Could you survive with the people that you call your friends or would you be forced to leave them on the side of the road?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Deadworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Deadworld, you and your friends play yourselves by choosing the trait cards that best fit your true personas; this is done at the start of the game.  After everyone makes their &amp;quot;game-self&amp;quot;, players take turns searching the ruins of civilization for supplies, fighting off the growing legions of undead, building defenses and improvements to their home base, and doing their best to live with those they considered their peers before the world fell into chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful: the allure of anarchy and unbridled wickedness is powerful in Deadworld.  You and your friends may choose to follow the path of good or you all may quickly descend along the road to evil.  It's your choice.  But that choice will affect how you interact with events and other survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the goal of Deadworld is to survive.  If all players can make it to the end of the chosen scenario, then the player with the highest survival points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive a Deadworld?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
