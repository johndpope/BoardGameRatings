							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dearg Due</name>
									
			<description>Long before famous Irishman, Bram Stoker, penned his famous novel, the vampire stalked the night in the Emerald Isle. The Dearg Due is Ireland&amp;rsquo;s original vampire. A woman of stunning beauty, the Dearg Due was forced into a marriage to a man she didn&amp;rsquo;t love by her controlling father. Distraught about never being able to be with the man she truly loved, she killed herself, but death could not hold her in the grave. She rose up and exacted revenge on her father and husband, and drained their bodies of blood. Now, she rises from her grave in County Waterford to spread her curse upon the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her vampire minions must drink in the counties of Ireland, vying to become the top vampire of all the island. Or, choose to be a werewolf and try to thwart the vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gampeplay&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is designed so that the game is interesting and fun, even for those not drinking, but simple enough that people who are drinking can play the game. The game will still be quite enjoyable if the drinking aspect is omitted entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 25 victims, and make it safely back to the Waterford Cemetery, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel from adjacent county to county (or by train, if they wish to skip to a different part of the island). They then roll the dice to determine how many victims they will get that night (if any). Drinks are determined by the number of victims. The players may also attack each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the players wish, one player may take on the role of the werewolf, whose mission is to kill all of the vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
