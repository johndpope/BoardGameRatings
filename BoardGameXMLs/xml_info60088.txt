							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">House Marik: The Free Worlds League</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When the Civil War of 3014 was over, Captain-General Janos Marik emerged triumphant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But at what a cost...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marik has lost his brother, his wife, and his confidence. The realm he rules, the Free Worlds League, weakened by over two centuries of warfare with the Lyran Commonwealth and the Capellan Confederation, is being torn apart by the diversity that was once its greatest strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet the winds of change blow throughout the Inner Sphere. Marik has entered into an alliance with the Draconis Combine and his former enemies the Capellans, an alliance that may tip the balance of power for centuries to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ComStar report on House Marik and the Free Worlds League includes dozens of full-color illustrations depicting League personalities, daily life, and military regalia. Classified documents on League and various League factions' armed forces, military structure, and political intrigues are also provided. In addition, the large history chapter stretches from the initial unification of the Marik Commonwealth, the Principality of Regulus, and the Duchy of Oriente to form the League through House Marik's consolidation of power and its position today as leader of the now divided Free Worlds League.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
