			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An arcade-style flight combat simulation by Digital Integration. The game consisted of equipping your fighter with enough weapons, setting course for the intended target, fly there, shoot it down, back to base for next mission. Starting and landing did need some coordination, else most was quite arcade-like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The landscape the fighter plane was flying over was grid made up of vector lines; the ground was not always level, which was novel at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
