			<description>A free download-and-print board game released in response to the 'Ground Zero Mosque' looniness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game board: &amp;quot;Many people thought the attacks of 9/11 were about terror, but the truth is far more sinister. Yesterday, extreme Muslimists built a Giant Mosque, planted like a victory flag, at Ground Zero. That's right, the flattening of the World Trade Center nine years ago was part of a broader Islamofacist terror plot designed to circumvent local planning laws and lower the notoriously expensive NYC ground rent at the same time. Why? So that the entirety of downtown Manhattan can be turned into the world's biggest mosque - a project they refer to as The Giant Mosqtapus. If we don't stop this Megamosque now, it's tentacles will strangle the life out of this, the greatest city, in the greatest country on earth. Only you can stop Mosqopoly!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
