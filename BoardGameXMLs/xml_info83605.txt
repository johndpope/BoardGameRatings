							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abandoned Temple</name>
									
			<description>From opening paragraphs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The abandoned temple described herein was once dedicated to the god of the sun, and its purpose was to house a holy relic. A GM can run the temple with very minor modifications if he wishes it to be dedicated to a different god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the temple was abandoned, the priests secreted the relic in the bowels of the structure, and then summoned several creatures to guard it. Why the temple was abandoned is intentionally left up to the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the current residents of the abandoned temple are monstrous creatures who have claimed sections of the structure as their personal lairs. They are content to ignore most commotions, and will ignore the PCs until they set foot in their Encounter Area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
