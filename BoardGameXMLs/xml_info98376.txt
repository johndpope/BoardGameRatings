			<description>Armed with just cameras, binoculars &amp;amp; some other equipment, we leave our camp &amp;amp; hike into the park to learn about wildlife. We may be surprised what we learn about ourselves as well.&lt;br/&gt;As with all Family Pastimes games, players play cooperatively. A co-operative card game about bus tours, this game's theme is &amp;quot;How was your vacation?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take a bus tour, with three long stopovers, during which they draw memorable moments (both sweet and sour). After the three stopovers, players head home and compare their memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the designer (from the publisher web site), this game is based on the many senior bus trips he's taken, and is dedicated to seniors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;21 travel trip cards&lt;br/&gt;55 memorable moments cards&lt;br/&gt;album chart&lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
