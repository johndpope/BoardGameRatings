							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diagonal Blocks</name>
									
			<description>Diagonal Blocks is an abstract strategy game modeled after Blokus, and playable with a Blokus set.  The pieces, (same as Blokus) consist of a complete set of all polyominoes up to size 5.  The board is 20x20 (smaller in 2 or 3 player variants) with the six squares nearest each corner removed.  Play begins at a starting square for each player, and each players subsequent move must contact his previously placed pieces only at a diagonal points.   The game ends when no further pieces can be played.  The winner is the player who covered the most squares with his pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vis-a-vis Blokus, the differences are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) The corners are removed from the board so there are barely more squares on the board than pieces to be played.&lt;br/&gt;(2) There are no special scoring bonuses. The count of squares covered is the entire score.&lt;br/&gt;(3) In two player variants, A &amp;quot;swap&amp;quot; rule applies to the second move.   This removes the first player advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations:&lt;br/&gt; Diagonal Blocks (3 player, intermediate size board)&lt;br/&gt; Diagonal Blocks Duo (2 player)&lt;br/&gt; Diagonal Blocks Classic (2 player, 4 color)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     BoardSpace (real-time, AI option)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
