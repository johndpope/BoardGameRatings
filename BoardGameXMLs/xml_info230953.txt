			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're meeting with powerful alien diplomats in a space station nightclub or just trying to avoid security in a spaceport dive bar, no Game Master wants to spend time drawing every booth and dance floor. Fortunately, with Paizo's latest Starfinder Flip-Mat, you don't have to! This line of gaming maps provides ready-to-use science-fantasy set pieces for the busy Game Master. This double-sided map features a sleek space station nightclub on one side and a gritty colony world tavern on the other, providing the perfect setting anytime your players need to meet a contact, invade a gang's hangout, or simply relax after a long voyage between worlds. Don't waste your time sketching when you could be playing. With Starfinder Flip-Mat: Cantina, you'll always be ready the next time your players decide to hit the bar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
