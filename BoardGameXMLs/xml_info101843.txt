			<description>Released in Spielerei No. 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game based on an idea from the movie &amp;quot;Quintett&amp;quot; from Robert Altmann.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 3 playing pieces in one color. Additionally 3 dice are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game is played in three rounds, each round consists of two phases: At the start of a round, a game chief is determined by rolling dice. This chief places one playing piece of each player on the hunting circle, to determine the hunting order: The order shows, which color can be attacked or must defend itself from the other colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afterwards the players place their remaining playing pieces on the game board. Depending on the dice numbers they move their pieces and try to attack the appropriate colors. Certain dice combinations are keeping the own playing pieces safe. The game chief can redistribute the hunting order during the round. The winner of this phase plays against the game chief in a second phase. The player with remaining playing pieces on the game board wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
