			<description>Catch is a game from the 1970s where the objective is to catch fish.  Points are scored per poundage of fish and when all of the fish are caught, the player with the most points wins.  There are bonus points for collecting three of the same fish as well as for collecting bait cards.  The board is depicted as a flowing river and movement is governed by use of a die.  Landing on various special spaces allows players to obtain bait and enter fishing contests, along with other encounters.  A spinner is used to determine the outcome of these events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;Catch - the fishing game for all ages&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
