							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Body Talk</name>
									
			<description>Body Talk is a charades game.  A phrase to be guessed is drawn from one of over 700 difficulty rated cards.  One player attempts to describe this phrase by pointing to icons on a board.  The main twist here, and the reason the game is called Body Talk, is that both the game board with the icons and the pointer used are worn by the players.  The gameboard is in the form of an icon-covered apron and the pointer is a bib with a pipe-cleaner protruding from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small plastic clothespins indicate the scores or positions of the players and also indicate by color the difficulty rating of the phrase to be guessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
