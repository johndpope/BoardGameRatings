			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of creepy items, events and occurrences that could be found by players in a haunted or creepy house. Most of the results are suitable for any setting or time period, but some require a technology level of at least the 19th or 20th centuries depending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some encounters and items may not be immediately obvious as being disturbing; some will require that players pay close attention or think about them. Other encounters are more noticeably wrong. The encounters may or may not have a negative effect, depending on what the GameMaster decides. The various results tend more to supernatural and cosmic horror than to gory or slasher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list has one hundred results, which can be chosen randomly by using a d100, but appropriate ones can also be chosen. The results are laid out in a table with the various entries having the type of encounter then details of the encounter itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover, one and a bit the front matter and instructions and the remainder is the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corridors - This is most likely in a large building with lots of corridors, whether something like a school, hospital, office building, castle or mansion. There seems to be something wrong with how the corridors are arranged. Players who walk down them often arrive in parts of the building that they weren't expecting to, perhaps on the opposite side of it. Mapping the layout of the corridors proves to be extremely difficult, as if they were actually changing their relative positions. Mapping the same area twice can give two different layouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
