							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thomas and Friends: Maze Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is one of the many Thomas and Friends games available in New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game involves moving around the board to collect passengers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move around a 4 by 4 board (15 tiles each with a picture of track on both sides of them and one station) from a central station following the track.  The 4 x 4 grid is randomly created at the beginning of the game and the tiles can also have the 'action' or 'passengers' attribute on them as well as the track.  Players move by rolling a die and moving around the tiles following the arrows and only on track that can connect, if they end on an 'action' tile then they take an action card, if they end on a 'passenger' tile then they collect 3 passengers.  The next player then continues to play from the position of the last player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action tile cards have different effects such as flipping the tiles over to the other side, making the player lose all their passengers, moving them to the bottom of the board, or cause them to end their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until either a player decides to end the game, this gives the other players 2 turns to get additional passengers or the game ends when there are no more passenger cards left.  In both situations the player with the most passengers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box includes 16 track maze cards, 14 action cards, 40 passengeer cards and 1 player token (which is used by all players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
