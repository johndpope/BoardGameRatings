			<description>The Odynauts are a competitive race of aliens that prosper from the feeling that winning brings them. The one place on Earth where lady luck truly smiles at you is the casino. The Odynauts decided to take the gamble and spread out to the foremost gambling cities on our planet, from Macau to Monte Carlo and from Las Vegas to Amsterdam. They turned the casinos upside down and won at every game the casinos have on offer. Slot machines were cleaned out and poker tournaments were won. The casino bosses were not amused and quickly banned the Odynauts from their casinos. To still their voracious appetite for winning, the Odynauts have made their own casino game. Casino chips are bitten into pieces and slot machines are stolen. All these well-known items from the casino form the basis of new and unique game: Chipleader. The Odynauts challenge you. Are you brave enough to accept their challenge? Are you a smart gambler and do you have the strategic insight to score the most points in putting casino chips back together? Can you protect your chips from your opponents' attacks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chipleader is card game for two to four players. The goal is to collect as many points as you can with strategic gambling and by making casino chips before four different casinos have been visited. Players have to protect their casino chips against their opponents' attacks in an effort to become Chipleader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casino chips are made with chip fragment cards of different colors and values. Every chip fragment card has a quarter of a chip depicted on it. Four chip fragment cards can form a casino chip and only when a player has formed such a chip can she place those cards on the table. The value of a complete casino chip placed on the table can increase or decrease with the use of Odynaut face cards. By playing these cards, a player's opponents can even entirely eliminate the value of one of her chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To obtain chip fragment and Odynaut face cards, a player has to make sets with five types of &amp;quot;gamble-suit&amp;quot; cards. Five suit cards are randomly placed face up alongside each other on the table. This row of cards is called the &amp;quot;gambling row&amp;quot;. Each player also receives three suit cards at the beginning of the game. A set is created whenever three, four or five suit cards of the same type are aligned in the gambling row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
