			<description>Everyone hides secrets, even from their friends, but in Privacy Numbers you get to discover some of those hidden secrets &amp;mdash; you just might not know to whom that secret belongs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players are presented with a question that has a numerical answer, e.g., how many hours each day do you surf the internet? Everyone secretly writes their answer on an &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; token, then each player guesses what the sum of all these answers are with their &amp;quot;We&amp;quot; token. Whoever is closest to this sum advances three spaces on the scoring track, while the second- and third-closest answerers advance two and one spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever first reaches the scoring line on the game board wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
