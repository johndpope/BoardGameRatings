			<description>Platoon Leader 3.0 CG rules for ASLComp with color cover and CEMETERY HILL campaign game and overlays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Platoon Leader 3.0 is a system for playing tactical-level battles using a series of Scenarios referred to as a &amp;quot;campaign game&amp;quot; or CG. This campaign game lets players recreate, in detail, the fighting of various great battles. Players take up the part of both the overall commanders, choosing which units will reinforce the initial troops, as well as the local commanders, fighting it out for each objective of the campaign. Players use a 'purchase' method to select troops for the first Scenario for the campaign. They set up their troops, determine who will attack and defend in that action then play that Scenario. The end of the Scenario brings the players to the Reorganization Phase, where they resolve the location of the front lines, determine the fate of disorganized and damaged units, and then purchase new units for the next Scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PL 3.0 aims to provide a concise, enjoyable campaign experience, playable by the average gamer over a couple of evenings. Critical Hit regularly releases new CG's for use with Platoon Leader. The latest version of PL is available at Critical Hit as a free download. This new version supersedes versions 1.0 and 2.0 and all errata. PL 3.0 remains compatible with all previously-released campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
