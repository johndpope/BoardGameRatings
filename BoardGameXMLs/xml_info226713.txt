							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dragon: A Fellowship Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons represent strength. They have the power to save the world. Dragons represent wisdom. They have the foresight to save the world. Dragons represent greed. They do not want to save the world if nothing is in it for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So they won't. Instead, I will. I have been gifted their power and named their champion. I am here to save the world on their behalf. I will do what they have decided is beneath them, and I will become glorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Overlord is my stepping stone. Their war and their plans amount to nothing before the fire of the dragons. We will defeat them. We will destroy them. And I will take my place in history as the greatest champion this world has ever seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am the Dragon, champion of fire. And my enemies will burn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon is the second Fellowship expansion pack, and it is not too different from the playbooks in the core game. The Dragon is a champion of fire. The Dragon may be a literal dragon, or The Dragon may be a title they hold. The one thing all dragons have in common is an affinity for fire and dangerous skill in melee combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon has more customization than any other playbook. While other playbooks have 2-4 Core Moves and choose 2 Custom Moves, the Dragon has 1 Core Move and chooses 4 Custom Moves during character creation. This gives the Dragon a wide variety of different things they can do reasonably well, but they won't improve upon a core kit of abilities like other playbooks do. If you want an expanding bag of cool tricks at your disposal, The Dragon is the playbook for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
