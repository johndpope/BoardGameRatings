			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet M.U.L.E. is an official remake of highly influential videogame M.U.L.E. (Multiple Use Labor Element) from the 80's is faithfully redone, commissioned by the M.U.L.E. designer, Dan Bunten's children. Bunten's was working on a networked version of M.U.L.E. but passed away before finishing and his children finished what he started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M.U.L.E. was one of the earliest multiplayer video games created and thus many gamers have fond memories of playing with their buddies on the Commodore 64 or Atari 800.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M.U.L.E. was a forerunner in game design because it plays like a modern European economic management board game with auctions and variable board setup. Furthermore the auction mechanic is innovative in that the bid (buyer) and ask (seller) prices are adjusted simultaneously--sort of like how the stock market works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet M.U.L.E. is client that can connect to a central server to play with others or a stand alone to play with the the AI. A free registration is required to play with other people while playing with the AI does not require registration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Official reimplementation of  M.U.L.E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
