							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exodus Trading Card Game: Crystal Forge</name>
									
			<description>Crystal Forge is the 3rd set in the Exodus TCG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guild Wars on the Horizon: &lt;br/&gt;Ever since the galaxy-sized nebula creatures collided in the skies over Eeventide, there's been a surplus of stardust &amp;amp; other magical compounds that rained down during the aftermath. This excess supply has led to Drifters far and wide forging new creatures. The emergence of 2 new Guilds, Treeforge &amp;amp; Shardveil, brings all to the brink of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shardveil, their ice not limited to any part of the color spectrum, seeks to bring a halt to the chaos by permanently freezing the world. Treeforge and their vast forests of living trees &amp;amp; mushrooms fight to uproot the spreading ice. Which Guild do you choose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Competitive Expansion (Set 3) Crystal Forge:&lt;br/&gt;With new Rarity mechanics, new creature types, &amp;amp; new effects like Reveal and Freeze, the Crystal Forge expansion set introduces all-new cards with new themes &amp;amp; new artwork all jam-packed into 2 new decks that are ready-to-play &amp;amp; fully customizable! None of these cards can be found in other sets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set consists of 2 Competitive Decks. The Treeforge Competitive Deck revolves around Treefolk &amp;amp; Mushfolk and the Shardveil Competitive Deck features ice creatures of all colors, shapes and sizes called Shardfolk. These decks are geared for advanced players who are already familiar with the basics of the game and heavily feature type and rarity mechanics. The decks can be played standalone or customized, and many players purchase 2 of each deck to get a playset (x2 copies) of each card since the set contains 100% new cards. This set contains extremely powerful Ability creatures that combo well with their respective types, and both decks feature a completely blinged-out 20-card foil energy deck with new artwork and a new foil treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two new Guilds are given official recognition with this set, with the emergence of 2 new Guild Leaders. Oliver Rose leads the Treeforge Guild and Crystallus is the self-proclaimed leader of the Shardveil Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Breakdown:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set consists of 43 cards, including:&lt;br/&gt;8 Rares&lt;br/&gt;15 Uncommons&lt;br/&gt;20 Commons&lt;br/&gt;In addition to introducing new mechanics like freeze and reveal, Existence Games wanted to spoil players by giving them a full foil energy deck in these decks for no extra cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creature Types:&lt;br/&gt;This set introduces the following creature types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mushfolk&lt;br/&gt;Storm&lt;br/&gt;Shark&lt;br/&gt;Phoenix&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
