			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of &amp;quot;Ad Astra&amp;quot;, a SF campaign setting. This document shall give players and game masters a quick overview about the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primer is presented in a system-free format to allow the GM to use any rules system he likes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ad Astra&amp;quot; is set into the far future. Humanity has ventured to the stars. Aside from a few artifacts found in the lifeless deserts of Mars, there are no signs of intelligent life. Humanity is all alone in space. Or so it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ancient jumpgate found near Jupiter allowed us access to a far away region of space: the Omega Centauri star cluster. In the early years of the 22nd century millions of humans travelled to the stars, seeking a better life among the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scattered among these human colonies live the espers, humans with amazing psychic abilities that are the legacy of an alien species, called the Elohim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then suddenly the jumpgate was destroyed, the colonists where stranded in a far away sector of space. Hundreds of years later Earth is just a distant memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
