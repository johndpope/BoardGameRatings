							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Modern Ship Cargos</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today more than ever, the ability to ship goods world wide has led to the creation of a new global market place. But with this new surge in shipping, old problems have resurfaced. From pirates to natural disasters to civil unrest, much threatens the shipping routes of today and there is just as much need for brave, daring young adventurers to become involved in shipping today as in times past. However, with this involvement comes one question: so what is it that we are carrying anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
