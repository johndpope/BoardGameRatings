			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO THE CITY OF SPIRITS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Meriquai Falls, where Native American culture blends seemlessly with modern contemporary society to form one of the most beautiful cities in the United States. It is also home to one of the largest concentrations of metahuman activity in the Midwest. Between the schemes of Galvakar and his Imperions and the genocidal plots of the Manitou and his Totems of Retribution, the crazed antics of the Pooka King and the dark secrets of the Night Sparrow, there is plenty to do for an intrepid hero in Meriquai Falls. Save the city and perhaps, in so doing, save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEET THE IMPERIONS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Imperions are one of the longest running, and most dangerous, villain teams in Meriquai Falls' history. Currently led by the devious doppleganger Galvakar, the Imperions will stop at nothing to conquer the city--and even the world--in an attempt for Galvakar to ascend to godhood. Along with Galvakar's werespider wife, Arachne, his sorceress daughter, Cyber Dreamer, and others like strong and fast Cougar, the photokinetic monster Incandentus, and the portal-creating Nexus, it seems as though they cannot be stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meriquai Falls - The Imperions includes HERO System 6th Edition stats for the various villains of the Imperions, as well as two of their former members, the android archer known as The Huntress and the gadgeteer known as Tripwire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
