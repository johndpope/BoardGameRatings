			<description>Des Crus et des Vins is a French game about exploring French wineyards and collecting fine wines. The game can be played by 3 to 6 players, one of them acting as gamemaster. The goal of the game is to be the first to collect 300 bottles of wines in a week (7 turns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game by creating a character by rolling dice and consulting tables to determine what type of car she has, her driving style, and where in France her family is located (the character can spend the night in this region for free). The gamemaster prepares a secret list of hazards (car accidents, police controls...), and each player picks a town to start from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, each player takes turn telling the gamemaster what her character's actions for the day are (driving, resting, visiting wineyards and ordering wine, where to spend the night). The gamemaster consults his list of hazards and the game tables and resolves the consequences (a character who is a fast driver will gain more fatigue points than a cautious driver for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the seven turns, the player with the best wine collection and the most money left is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
