							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Night of the Convict Dead</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They're Coming To Get You, Convicts!&amp;quot;. The Dead Walk Again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The penal colonies of early Australia are places where death is a common occurrence. Whether due to disease, starvation, violent flogging, or execution -- people depart this life at an alarming rate. This creates practical problems: where to bury so many corpses, and how to maintain a degree of sanitation? These are tasks that the early colonists tackle in a remarkably haphazard way -- while there are allocated burying grounds set aside, graves within are dug wherever seems convenient, and no written records are kept of who has been interred where. This laxity creates some interesting jumping-off points for a tale of horror or the macabre -- after all what would the noxious necromancers of H.P. Lovecraft's tales have achieved with an almost infinite supply of corpses which nobody would miss? And what foul forces of the Cthulhu Mythos might thrive in such a charnel house?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ticket of Leave #6 is a double-size supplement which describes the historical burial practices and cemeteries of the early New South Wales colony. It also provides an extensive mini-scenario which features some dark necromantic experimentation (and its spectacular, if unexpected, consequence). Do your investigators dare to brave the Night of the Convict Dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
