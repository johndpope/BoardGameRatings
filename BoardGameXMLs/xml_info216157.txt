			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caesar&amp;rsquo;s Glory is a card game of fast-paced gladiator combat built around the classic principle of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game is played over a number of rounds. In each round, you will play a card face down. Your opponent will do the same. You then compare the cards played, and whoever has played the winning card will deal damage and may play combo cards from their hand. Each point of damage you deal forces your opponent to discard a card. Whoever runs out of cards, collapses in the arena and loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
