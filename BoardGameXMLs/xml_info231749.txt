							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Realms of Etherium</name>
									
			<description>From the Portal they came, Mages wielding great power, able to shape and forge reality to their will.  Gathering the fuel of Etherium, they use these immense energies to battle for control of the ever expanding, ever changing Realms.  Those who dominate the most Realms claim victory over all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Realms of Etherium, 2-6 players will each control a small group of Mages that start together at the center of an ever expanding, ever changing board.  Each Round their Mages will take turns activating, moving to existing Realms, or expanding the board by summoning new Realms either randomly drawn or chosen from an existing pool. Each Realm has a different power to gather resources, gain Mage abilities, alter elements, affect other Mages, and even alter the layout of the board itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has gained enough resources they can begin to take control of the Victory Point Realms to gain victory points in order to win.  All the scoring is based on the layout of the board relative to these Victory Point Realms, so points can be gained or lost every time the spaces are shifted or swapped, making for a tense, dynamic game that&amp;rsquo;s different every time you play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
