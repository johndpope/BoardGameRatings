			<description>This action/dexterity game has a deck of 33 Category Cards and 55 Letter Cards. At the start of a round, twelve letter cards (in two colors: blue and red) are revealed, along with one category card. The first person to think of a concept that matches the category and slaps a letter card that matches the starting letter of the concept, gets that letter card as a reward. Blue letter cards are worth one point, and red letter cards are worth two. The player that won the last card reveals the next card, and the game continues until the last letter card is taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
