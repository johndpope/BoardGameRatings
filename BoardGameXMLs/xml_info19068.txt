							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Iraqi Freedom: 2003</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Operation: Iraqi Freedom 2003 took only three weeks for the Coalition to conquer Baghdad thus bringing the tyrannical reign of Saddam Hussein to a close. It seemed that the demoralized army in Iraq had no chance against the superiority of American technology. Or did it? Could Saddam have held out against the United States, inflicting unexpected loss of life that would send weak-kneed diplomats to sue for peace? Or would the United States finish the job by not only removing Saddam, but eliminating all foreign fighters and resistance units thorough the country and securing Iraq as the first democracy in the region?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this, you'll be provided with the game's mapsheets, rules, charts, etc., while you will utilize the components from Axis &amp;amp; Allies or related games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
