							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical Pope Joan</name>
									
			<description>A card game but without the board associated with Pope Joan games. And the cards are not traditional at all. They feature British Royal 'houses', such as the Normans or the Tudors, etc. Because of the uneven number of monarchs in each family, the suits are uneven. For example, the Norman suit consists of five cards, four being monarchs and the fifth is an honour card and features illustrations of the four monarchs in that House. However the Tudors consist of 6 cards; Five monarchs and the honour card showing them all. Others vary according to how many monarchs were in that lineage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark out on the table four areas (called Pools). In order they signify;&lt;br/&gt;Ace of Fleur-de-Lis or William the Norman&lt;br/&gt;The 5 of the Red and White Rose, which is represented by Elizabeth the 1st&lt;br/&gt;The five of the Oak, represented by William IV&lt;br/&gt;and just one known as Game&lt;br/&gt;Each player puts 1 counter into the William the Norman Pool and 1 into Elizabeth Pool and 1 into the Game Pool. And each player puts two counters into the William IV Pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is one of following suit really. If a card is chosen as the first card in a suit, the 'next' card in the suit can be played on it, and so on. If the highest card in a suit is played. that player can choose to start with a card in one of the other suits. Play goes on until one player plays their last card. That player gets the Game counters. In addition, every player pays the 'out' player one counter for every card still in their hand (or two counters for every card if you happen to still hold the Cromwell card) The other Pools are collected during the game. If a player plays the next card in sequence and that card happens to be William the Norman, Elizabeth or William IV, then that player takes the counters in the associated Pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as many games as you want and the one with the most counters when you stop, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes:&lt;br/&gt;There are seven suits:&lt;br/&gt;Fleur-de-Lis (sic) or the Norman line&lt;br/&gt;Broom Tree or the Plantagenets&lt;br/&gt;Red Rose or the House of Lancaster&lt;br/&gt;White Rose or the House of York&lt;br/&gt;Red and White Rose joined or the House of Tudor&lt;br/&gt;Thistle or the House of Stuart&lt;br/&gt;Acorn or the House of Hanover&lt;br/&gt;Plus one special card representing Oliver Cromwell (the Usurper as the rules describe him). He does not belong to a royal house at all so does not have an emblem. He can only be played between the two Charles cards. In other words, when Charles I is played, then Cromwell can be played and then Charles II could be played. If you are caught with Cromwell in your hand then you have to pay double for the cards in your hand once someone has gone out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 42 cards and the rules run to 16 pages but do include a sample game. That must have been pretty rare. I have dated it 1838 because the last Monarch is William IV and Victoria was crowned a year later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
