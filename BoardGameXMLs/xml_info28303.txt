			<description>K Cricket consists of 50 cards: 17 Bowling cards and 33 Batting cards, each showing a particular type of delivery e.g. Good Length, Bouncer, Cut, Hook. Play consists of the bowling player playing a card and the batting player trying to match it with a scoring or defensive stroke. If the batting player has only a dismissal to match the ball bowled, he must play it and his batsman is out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in six-ball overs, the bowling player drawing a new hand after each over while the batting player continues with the hand they were initially dealt but draws to refill his hand after each ball bowled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can play an agreed number of overs or a full 10-wicket innings each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
