							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Mine of Klängdenstürm</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several dwarven generations ago, the dwarven city of Kl&amp;auml;ngdenst&amp;uuml;rm, located deep in the Underdark,  operated a mithril mine several miles away from the main city.  Not only was it a particularly abundant source of the rare metal, but it was also the only such mine to be found for hundreds of miles.  The dwarves of Kl&amp;auml;ngdenst&amp;uuml;rm were therefore very protective of their mithril and guarded the mine with a battalion of dwarven soldiers and a cunning maze full of deadly traps. Other denizens of the underdark made many attempts to wrest control of the mine away from the dwarves of Kl&amp;auml;ngdenst&amp;uuml;rm, but all were thwarted.  The dwarves thought their defenses were unbreachable, at least until the cunning Bitzune Ca&amp;rsquo;Theran learned of the mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dungeon crawl for mid-level characters.  Distributed as an RTF adventure file and three GIF image files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
