			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While returning to their small home town of Hazard, Georgia, from a failed attempted trip to Atlanta, the group of Survivors encounter a bloody, dying man in the road just outside of town.  The man is a farmer who the Survivors all recognize from around town.  The man tells the Survivors that his young daughter is all alone at his farm (and tells them that he has supplies there too, if the Survivors need convincing) but when he was attacked by a motorcycle gang, he swallowed the key to his house so the gang would not get it. &lt;br/&gt; After killing the farmer as he &amp;ldquo;turns&amp;rdquo; and retrieving the key from his guts, the Survivors set out on an adventure that involves a possibly dangerous river crossing, a trip across unkept fields with waste high grass and a farmhouse that may be more than it appears.  &lt;br/&gt; The Body in The Road is a quick one-shot adventure for 4-6 players with level 2 Survivors, usually lasting 3-4 hours.  The adventure is divided into four main segments:  The Body, The River, The Fields, The Farmhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
