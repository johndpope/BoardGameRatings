			<description>Objective of the game is the construction of a far branched family dynasty. There is no board; every player builds up his own dynasty by skillfully connecting special pieces. The clan with the most widespread structure wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10 different pieces made of strong cardboard have recessions and connectiong cones similar to a jigsaw puzzle. They stand symbolically for love, night, luck, possession, life, success, youth, mind and power.&lt;br/&gt;The player can can 'purchase' them by rolling a 10-sided die and include them into the existing dynasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning every player receives four figures: Two adult figures, a heart and a cloverleaf which stand for love and luck. A family is founded whith these and can be extended with dice-luck and also with tactical planning. In addition to the dice result you can receive points from chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples of dice results:&lt;br/&gt;With a thrown '4' you purchase a house, which stands for possession and security. Mind and enducation (symbolized by a star) are added into the dynasty by rolling an '8'. When a '2' is rolled, the moon signals night, end of luck and a stroke of fate; the player should get rid of it again as soon as possible. With a '7' a child (boy/girl) comes into the dynasty, which stands for future and development. A second child in the dynasty will form the foundation for further generations in the construction of the dynasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numerological and color-psychological background on which the game is based are explained in the appendix of the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
