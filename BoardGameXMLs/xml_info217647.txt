							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atlas Class Freighter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 17 covers the Atlas-class freighter which is the second most commonly found ship in Clement Sector.  Building on the information found in The Clement Sector Core Setting Book, Ships of Clement Sector 17 lovingly details this shipping legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by Cascadian legend James Lancaster, the Atlas is perhaps his most enduring legacy.  The vessel was first used by Lancaster Shipping and, later, by his Cascadia Colonization Authority (before it became a Cascadian government agency).  Following Lancaster's voluntary break-up of his shipping company, the Atlas started being used by corporations, governments, and individuals across the sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, you will find the standard Atlas as well as these popular variants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Colony Ship - Based on Lancaster's original design to ferry colonists to new worlds in Clement Sector, the Atlas-class Colony Ship is still in use today on the frontier.&lt;br/&gt;    Armed Merchantman - Used by some governments as system defense and some corporations as escorts, the Atlas-class Armed Merchantman and its particle beam barbettes pack quite a punch.&lt;br/&gt;    Missile Ship - Trading the cargo pods for missile bays, the Atlas-class Missile Ship can form the backbone of a system's defense forces when they cannot afford to build or purchase a warship.  Pirates beware!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 17: Atlas-class Freighter comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The Atlas is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy, and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as two short stories written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Atlas will be at home in any science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
