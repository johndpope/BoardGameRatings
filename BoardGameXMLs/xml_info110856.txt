			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of Titania is a Tragedy for 3-5 players (and no GM). To play you'll need a few friends, a pile of six-sided dice and some index cards to write details about your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set on Titania, a huge colony ship drifting through deep space towards&amp;hellip; somewhere. A central biosphere generates food, oxygen and recycles water for hundreds of habitation pods floating at the end of trailing umbilical connections. Each habitation pod is ruled by a family, lords of their domain. Lords of Titania is the story of the downfall of one such family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will play the flawed rulers of a habitation pod; a family enclosed by Nature and divided by their own natures. Each of you will control a particular component of the pod and you will use that control to gain power over your family members. This will not go smoothly. There will be oath-breaking, betrayal and murder, and an exile will return to seek vengeance. But if you survive&amp;hellip; How sweet will your victory be then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
