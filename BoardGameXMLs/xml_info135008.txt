			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A guessing/bluffing dice game. All players have special dice showing either sheep, sheepdog, wolf or cow. All players roll their dice so that only they see, and one by one, they put forward a die, making a claim (guessing) how many there are total of that sort. The trick is that sheepdogs may be claimed to be wolves, and wolves may be claimed to be sheepdogs &amp;ndash; or even sheep (as wolves go clad in sheep's clothing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher claim (guess) you make, the better, but at a certain point, someone will call out an exaggeration, and all animals (dice) are accounted for. If you've over-guessed, you get a penalty, but if you haven't, you get points. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components are language neutral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
