							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Santa Claus vs. The Easter Bunny</name>
									
			<description>A tactical game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So Santa and the Easter Bunny were sitting down in a cafe, drinking lattes, and Santa casually mentions that Christmas is more exciting that Easter. To which the Easter Bunny says that Easter brings more joy and happiness than Christmas. Santa, slightly miffed, says &amp;quot;Oh, I doubt that!&amp;quot;. The Easter Bunny suggests &amp;quot;Perhaps a friendly contest is in order then. Let's see who can bring the most happiness, joy, and excitement to the children this year!&amp;quot;. Santa chugs his latte and says to the Easter Bunny: &amp;quot;Bring it!!!&amp;quot; And the game was on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a print and play game for two players. It was designed to be relatively quick (29 turns; all quick) and be easy on the print cartridge. It also has basic strategy that may not be apparent at first. All images were public domain and taken from&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a series of bidding contests in which the winner of each contest receives a card. Cards that are won will later be used in future bids for new cards. Most contests are won by playing a card with high Excitement, Joy, or Happiness. Each card will have numbered values for each of Excitement, Joy, or Happiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online play will be available shortly on Vassal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
