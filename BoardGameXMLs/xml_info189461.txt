							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soviet Method</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do not want to touch his ass. I want to make him talk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the classic unlikely duo. On one side, the classic American cop; hard-drinking, hard-talking and hard to get along with. On the other, a Soviet special agent with just the right combination of skill, murderous intent and multiple personality disorder to get the job done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together, they fight crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soviet Method is a storygame about over-the-top crimefighting and the ridiculously violent methodology common to cinema. You use a deck of cards as prompts for witnesses and suspects, the pseduo-GM role that is the American cop sets the scene, then the various players controlling the Soviet cop compel him to various levels of violent action in an attempt to mill the deck and pin the crime on one of the face cards. It's a game of one-upsmanship that encourages players to come up with excessive, nonsensical bullshit, egg each other on, and have a good laugh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, this is the game of Red Heat. It's one of the lesser known Arnold movies, but I was dead serious when I said I was doing all the Arnold movies. It can also be used for any Buddy Cop situation where one cop is way more violent and psychopathic than the other, above and beyond the normal good cop/bad cop dynamic. Think Mad Bull 34.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
