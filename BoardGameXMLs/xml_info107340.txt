			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was one of the winners of Microsoft's 2007 Dream-Build-Play contest. It is based on the traditional game of badminton, but uses robots instead of the normal players. The game is presented as a one-on-one in a 2D plane with a side-on view. The major difference between this and normal badminton, is that this game also uses &amp;quot;power shots&amp;quot;. These unleash a variety of powers during the hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single player has two modes: Arcade Mode (a 20-match series against AI players) or Elimination Mode (competing in a tournament against 4, 8 or 16 AI players where one loss end the tournament). Multi-player modes involve: Exhibition (1, 3, 5 or 11 rounds), a Round Robin tourney (from 3 to 20 players); or an Elimination Mode battle (4, 8 or 16 players). Multi-player is only available locally. There is no network support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
