			<description>Make 'n' Break Architect Mini follows the familiar Make 'n' Break formula of players being given a challenge &amp;mdash; typically a building or constructing challenge &amp;mdash; then racing to complete it first in order to claim the card or score the points for the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Make 'n' Break Architect, each player has a colorful folding ruler, and the challenges demand that players create particular shapes with the ruler or (more difficultly) create particular shapes with specific colors in specific locations. Whoever does so first can slap the card to claim it, and whoever claims six cards first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make 'n' Break Architect is a miniature version of the original Make 'n' Break Architect with components only for two players and with twenty cards showing forty tasks that was available with a McDonalds Happy Meal during September 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
