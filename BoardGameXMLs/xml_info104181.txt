							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Muscle Challenge: General Motors Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;Be the first player to completely restore their muscle car.&lt;br/&gt;Players travel the board buying, selling and swapping car parts. A player has completely restored their car when they have collected all twelve parts inventory cards as listed in their car's parts book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a vaguely Monopoly feel to it it American Muscle Challenge is played by traveling the game board with dice rolls in order to acquire parts to build their respective muscle cars. Game play consists of; following the instructions on the squares, choosing to play a &amp;quot;Muscle Card&amp;quot;, swapping parts with players, challenging the other players as well as Corvette Ken, who is a player controlled NPC who runs the Custom car shop (the banker) to dice based drag races in the center of the board for cash and car parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board has Squares for buying parts, buying insurance cards, racing Corvette Ken, or racing players squares. There is a &amp;quot;Go To Garage&amp;quot; square (go to jail), &amp;quot;Violation&amp;quot; (income Tax), as well as &amp;quot;Lose a Turn&amp;quot;, Take a &amp;quot;Muscle Card&amp;quot; (Community Chest), Take a &amp;quot;Corvette Ken Card&amp;quot; (Chance), The &amp;quot;Drive In&amp;quot; square (Free Parking) and the receive &amp;quot;$1000&amp;quot; square&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muscle Cards allow a player to dictate terms of a parts deal and have cards such as &amp;quot;NO Deal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; that allows you to take a part. A muscle card that forces you to purchase parts may require that you sell back parts you own to the custom car shop at half value if you can not afford the part listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corvette Ken Cards are played against opponents to cause them financial loss. Money lost in this way is put under the &amp;quot;Drive-In&amp;quot; square and won by the next person to land there similar to the house rules for Monopoly's &amp;quot;Free Parking&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insurance Cards protect players from &amp;quot;Corvette Ken&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First player to finish acquiring parts and upgrading his muscle car is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
