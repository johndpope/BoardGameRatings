			<description>This game depicts, in a very abstract way, the essence of insurgent warfare. The game is for two players, the State (representing the existing government or leadership of a country or organization) and the Insurgent (representing the opposition to that government or leadership). The State has powerful forces but little information; the Insurgent has complete information but little actual power. Whichever side overcomes its disadvantage wins (the State by gaining information on the Insurgents and killing them; the Insurgents by penetrating to the centre of State power).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Insurgent wins by capturing the Capital. This is accomplished by having, at the end of any his player-turns, Insurgent pieces occupying either four connected spaces in the Inner Circle (that is, there are at least four Insurgent-occupied spaces in the Inner Circle that also share a border with one or two other Insurgent-occupied spaces in the Inner Circle), or occupying any six of the twelve spaces of the Inner Circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The State player wins by killing 12 Insurgent pieces (so making an Insurgent victory impossible).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally designed in 2011 for an online game site, from an idea by Michael Freeman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
