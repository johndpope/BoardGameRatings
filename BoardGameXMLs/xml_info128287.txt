			<description>The object of the game is to be the first to fill one's tiara with all five of the gems.  There are four boards, one for each player.  The player spins the spinner and if it lands on a space with a gem that she (it's mostly a little girls' game) doesn't have in her tiara, she gets it.  There is a &amp;quot;lose a gem space&amp;quot; as well as a &amp;quot;spin again&amp;quot; space (although it has little effect on the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;4 Game Boards&lt;br/&gt;20 Gem pieces&lt;br/&gt;Spinner&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
