							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Keepers of the Woods</name>
									
			<description>January 1935 - an unexpected letter invites members of the Miscellany Society from the safety of bustling London to the isolated village of Postbridge in the heart of Dartmoor. On their arrival, they discover the professor they were to meet has died in a tragic car accident. Some attribute the crash to a local ghost legend. As they inquire into the professor&amp;rsquo;s death, the investigators quickly become embroiled in a cycle of murders and sacrifice, underlain by a centuries old conspiracy involving the local populace. Behind it all lurks an ancient horror, one that will force them to question their moral outlook on life and potentially change them forever&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Keepers of the Woods is a scenario for Trail of Cthulhu. It has been written as a one-shot adventure for the Purist style of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an expanded version of The Keepers of the Woods, which was the winning entry to the 2015 One Sheet Gumshoe contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
