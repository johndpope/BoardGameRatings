							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Through the Breach: Core Rules (2nd Ed.)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story-driven, roleplaying experience set in the world of Malifaux, where steam power collides with magic, monsters, and the wild west, players in Through the Breach take on the role of the Fated, men and women who have caught a brief glimpse of their destinies.  Through the Breach uses cards instead of dice to resolve conflicts, and each character has a hand of cards they can use to alter their destinies, changing failure into success and defeat into victory.  Characters shift fluidly from one profession to the next as they meet the challenges of Malifaux head-on, and even the most naive Academic might find themselves becoming a lethal Gunslinger, hardened pioneer, or power-mad Dabbler with the right twist of fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
