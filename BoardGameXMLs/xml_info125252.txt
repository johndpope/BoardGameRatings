							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reikert Lloyd, Captain of Verlaine&#039;s Guard</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verlaine, the head of the Captains&amp;rsquo; Council of Freeport, is no fool&amp;mdash;when he hires personal guards, he gets the best muscle money can buy. And for the captain of those guards, he chose the toughest, smartest fighter in the crew: Reikert Lloyd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most thugs-for-hire, Lloyd came from the right side of the tracks. For decades, his family made candles and shipboard lanterns out of a large shop in the Old City. Lloyd, the third-youngest of four children, didn&amp;rsquo;t stand to get his hands on the family business; at the same time he resented his older siblings, he found the idea of being cooped up in a shop all day stifling. At school&amp;mdash;one of the finest in Freeport&amp;mdash;he was a sullen and distracted student. For kicks he took up with the sons of other merchants for all-night carousing sessions. After a few benders, his parents threatened to cut him off. He took them up on their offer and headed to sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
