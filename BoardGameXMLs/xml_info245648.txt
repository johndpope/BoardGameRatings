			<description>Small printrun game by a small and already extinct German publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time it's mouse-racing instead of horse-racing although the goal of the game is pretty much the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can acquire mice and try to make them win the race and/or you can bet on the outcome of the race. During the race every mouse has a base movement of two spaces plus or minus everything it gets from the influence of the players (which can be -1 / +1 / or +2). Also the players can move the cat (which 'runs' in the opposite direction) and try to catch the mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever makes the most money out of a certain number of races wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
