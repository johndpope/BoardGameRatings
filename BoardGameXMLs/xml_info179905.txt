			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a match-3 style game, so popular with cell phones, that has been married to a beat rhythm game.   You can load in your own music and there also bombs and bonuses that appear throughout the game, so there are plenty of options.   The beat is not exactly correct, which dooms the game for most, and instead of a marriage of games, it seems that there are two games here playing against each other.  The graphics are basic, which for an abstract is not that detrimental, and the music that comes with the game is techno, and a bit lame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
