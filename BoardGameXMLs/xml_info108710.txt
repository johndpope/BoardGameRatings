			<description>Later in 1979, game developer David Mullich created Space II, an expansion pack for the original Space role-playing game. The game consists of the character creation module and two additional game scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shaman: Characters launch their career as a religious practitioner who is tasked with building a cult on a new world, using an all-terrain vehicle to travel across the planet and accumulate followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Psychodelia: Characters experiment with mind-altering drugs, which may boost or retard various traits, which is the only way they can be altered once a character leaves military service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space II was written as an exercise in risk-benefit analysis, as the player's character is presented with dangerous options throughout the game, and the player must determine whether the potential rewards are worth the possible risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
