			<description>'Hockey' is an ice hockey simulation game played with a standard deck of 52 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to match the card played by their opponent to create a &amp;quot;breakaway&amp;quot; (also known as &amp;quot;clearing the ice&amp;quot;) and then also matching the opponent's following play to score a &amp;quot;goal.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each play through the deck is considered a &amp;quot;period.&amp;quot; Five cards are dealt to each player at a time, except the last deal of the period when all remaining cards are dealt. Three periods constitute a complete game. The deal switches after each period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns playing one card from their hand face up in a common playing area. All cards are played on top of one another so that only the most recently played card is visible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a played card matches the rank (number) of the top card of the pile (e.g. a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; is played on top of another &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;) it creates a &amp;quot;breakaway&amp;quot; for that player. Jacks always create breakaways when played, regardless of the previous card in the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a breakaway has been created, that player now needs to try to match the rank of the next card played by the opponent. If able to do so, a goal is scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most goals at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
