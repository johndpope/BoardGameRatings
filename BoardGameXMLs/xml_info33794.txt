			<description>A French card adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;One player is the evil player and the others the adventurers that try to achieve 2 quests before a certain number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board built with cards little by little during the game. Adventurers can move and place a 'good' location card next to where he is (among 3 he has in hand). The evil player can place 'evil' locations and advance the turn token (among 3 too).&lt;br/&gt;The locations have types (forest, river...) and some of them can only be placed next to a location of a certain type.&lt;br/&gt;Some special locations allow to draw a quest card (possess a certain object, kill a certain monster, go to a certain place and discard an object...).&lt;br/&gt;Some good locations allow to draw Event cards, containing objects (weapons, shields, potions...) and good encounters (helpful people and animals).&lt;br/&gt;Some evil locations allow the evil player to add evil events (dangers) to the good events stack. Evil locations also contain evil encounters (monsters) that adventurers must fight when they enter their card or the 4 cards next to it (but it's weaker there). The combat is resolved with a simple die throw plus bonuses of both adversaries. adventurers can ask for help of the others in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
