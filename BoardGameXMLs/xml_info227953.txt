			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holy decopunk campaign setting of Askis is ruled over by the nine legendary Celestial Heroes, epic adventurers that stamped out evil from the world&amp;mdash;almost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mad scientist Gespadrieux has foreseen that the death of the distant offspring of the Paladin of Samovi (Lellwyn Fethyrwal) will cause great discord among her retinue, allowing for a great evil to fester among the countless spirits she governs. The youths&amp;mdash;a boy named Kristoph and a girl named Deardra, each just 13 years of age&amp;mdash;are currently at their most vulnerable, the defenses provided by the Legio Admiristad Institute of Higher Learning feeble compared to those in the confines of their great-great-great-great-great-grandmother&amp;rsquo;s homes. Gespadrieux has waited for this moment for more than a decade, carefully acting through stooges and fools to prepare agents in Ourianos positioned to assassinate these youngling angel-touched and therein wound the Celestial Hero Lellwyn Fethyrwal herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to succeed the adventurers must bribe, cheat, lie, and sneak to where they can commit a truly heinous act (which they&amp;rsquo;ll find is not as easy as it might at first seem to be). If they are able to stomach the murder of innocents and escape with their own lives the mad scientist Gespadrieux knows the value of competent servants and will reward the PCs with forbidden knowledge, evil power, and wealth aplenty. After the murder the party are bound to become fugitives but with their new gifts and coin staying ahead of authorities should be no problem&amp;mdash;it will be the vengeance of an immortal Celestial Hero that might be a problem down the line. Of course by completely embracing darkness and the rapid paths to power that can grant, their situation may not be so dire...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2nd level, evil, characters.  This scenario uses 5th edition rules in a very atypical 1920s-era &amp;quot;decopunk fantasy&amp;quot; setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
