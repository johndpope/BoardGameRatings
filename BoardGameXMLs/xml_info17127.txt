			<description>A tactical level wargame on the battle of Sekigahara at the end of the Sengoku period.&lt;br/&gt;激闘 関ヶ原 (Gekitoh Sekigahara) means fierce fight in Sekigahara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit represents 400 soldiers. High lords or generals are included in some units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control either the Eastern army (Tokugawa) or the Western army (Ishida and Mori). Each army consists of many clans. Each clan are composed by a lord, generals and soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, there are opponent's defensive fire step between movement and combat step.&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of combat, fire fight and melee , in both case, basic combat result is morale check. So unit's most important ability is morale.&lt;br/&gt;Not only undermining the troops of their clan, the loss of the lord also decreases army morale. Reduction of army morale reduces it's combat effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes seven scenarios, two historical and five hypothetical.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is determined by elimination of opponent's highest lord or victory points based on elimination of units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
