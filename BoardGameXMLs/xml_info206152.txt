			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There lies a quiet village on the brink of chaos, full of hard working salt of the earth peasants. Their lives of toil are made harder by the wild beasts, savage neighbors, and strange magics that plague them. Their one line of defense against the dark are the heroes.  These stalwart men and women are beacons of hope, righting wrongs, completing daring quests, and most importantly bringing much needed trade and wealth to this beleaguered village.  But it seems as if the heroes work is never done, almost as if the village seems to draw trouble and more adventurers with a will of its own.  In the following game, players will explore the actions and motivations of a seemingly quaint fantasy village as it struggles to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During development this game was titled All That Remains and Village Council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
