							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mayfair Games Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #5</name>
									
			<description>The Mayfair Games' Limited Edition Promo Expansion Set #5 is composed of 3 expansions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Points: Gangs of New York – Flophouse&lt;br/&gt;Includes 1 extra building tile. If you control this building's space at the end of the round, then you can remove up to 3 of your rabble from any neighborhood tile and return them to your headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steam: City Growth Special Contracts&lt;br/&gt;Includes 5 city growth markers on 5 colors. They can be used instead of the normal gray city growth markers. You place 1 of these markers on to the city when you are using the City Growth action. Now this city has a one-time demand for that color cube. When 1 cube of the marker's color has been shipped to the city, then the marker is turned to the other side, which is exactly the same as a normal city growth marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemist: All for One, Two for All&lt;br/&gt;Includes a new variant cauldron and a 3/7 potion value tile which can only be played on the new cauldron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
