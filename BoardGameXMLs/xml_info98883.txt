			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you think the good guy always win, eh?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil arch villain Butch Cavendish has been a burr on your saddle ever since he did in your dad. Now he's kidnapped the President just to lure you to your doom. And there's nothin' but a trail of trouble between you. In fact, Kemosabe, there's eight wild west stages of pistol packin' danger to run, shoot and gallop through. Including first person &amp;pound;-D stages that put peril in a whole new perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll have to ride trains and wild Indian infested plains. Comb caves and mountain hideouts. Hunt for treasure and survive hotel shoot-outs. Gunsling your way through more than 20 towns, camps and forts. Dodging outlaws in ambush, and an ugly assortment of rough-necked riffraff like the bowie knife throwing bandit, Juaquin Fingers. The infamous Berg Brothers who make Jesse James look like a schoolmarm. Not to mention slimy Su Linchay, the School of Hard Woks graduate with breath will melt your mask. And when you start out, all you have to defend yourself if your trusty six-shooter, Zapper or LaserScope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, each bad guy you bag is worth bucks. Use 'em to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or patch work from Doc. And along the way look for handy hints from Tonto and some friendly townfolk. But whatever you do, Masked Avenger, choose your trails carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So hop on your fiery horse Silver, track down that cad Cavendish, and rescue the Pres. Or with the speed of light and a cloud of dust you'll wind up a mere tumbleweed in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
