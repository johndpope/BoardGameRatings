							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ekimae Taxi</name>
									
			<description>Number 9 (of 12) in the Epoch Manga game series.  Bookshelf game based on the comic strips of Fujio Akatsuka.  All movement is spin and move.  Each player controls a taxi and picks up fares from the train station.  Destination and fare collected is determined by a card draw.  Opposing players can move police cars when they land on a police icon to impede other players and force them to draw an event card.  Event cards are generally misfortunes, but there are occasional good events (tipping customer, a bonus fare, etc).  The winner is the player with the most fares collected once the are deck is exhausted.  Art on the board, pieces, and cards are a mish mash of characters from Fujio Akatsuka comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
