			<description>Dice game with elements of Shut the Box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player lines up a set of cards in two rows:&lt;br/&gt;6 7 8 9 10 &lt;br/&gt;12 13 14 15 16&lt;br/&gt;First player throws the numbered blocks (i.e. dice) and turns face down the card that corresponds to the sum of the top numbers of the blocks. If he should throw 11 on the first turn he merely misses turning over a card, but at all later turns he must turn up a card he has already turned down if he has any.&lt;br/&gt;Play passes to the right. On the second and all other turns, if a player throws a number that he has already turned over, the first player to the right who still has the number may turn it over and have a turn throwing the blocks. &lt;br/&gt;Play continues to the right, it does not go back to those who lost a turn. If every player has turned over the number that is thrown, it is &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;quot; and the one who threw it may throw again until he throws a number that he or some other player can use, or until he throws an 11.&lt;br/&gt;If a player throws 11, it is good strategy to turn up a number that is &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; or one that has three chances to one to be thrown. For example, only 3 and 3 make 6, but 3 and 7, 4 and 6, or 5 and 5 make 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all the cards turned over is winner and the first player next game. Four to six players recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
