							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chief Inspector</name>
									
			<description>Master criminals are freely walking the cobbled streets of London town. The scuffers are clueless, but the reliable old Chief Inspector is on the case and making good progress. That is, until he turns up dead in a ditch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any of you desk jockeys want to be the new Chief Inspector?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chief Inspector is set in the Gaslight Empire and follows the events of Ruse and Skyway Robbery. In Chief Inspector, each player takes on the role of a junior inspector walking the streets of 1800's London, hot on the trail of a Master Criminal. The King wants results, and the player to make the biggest arrest will become the new Chief Inspector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game 5 suspects are placed in a line up and beneath each of them face down clue cards of four types: Intelligence, Reputation, Status and Prior Arrests. Hidden on the other side of these clues are truths about the suspects and related numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must use their hand of three Inspector cards to uncover clues about the five key suspects, procure the necessary evidence, and arrest the suspect with the highest total value (the most notorious criminal). But beware, certain actions corrupt, and the player with the most corruption automatically loses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
