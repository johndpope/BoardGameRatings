							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apokalypse</name>
									
			<description>Apokalypse was a miniature wargame set in a dystopian future, the aftermath of the final war. It simulated the desperate skirmishes, firefights and encounters taking place in the last 120 days of humanity. The players took the role of powermongers, leaders and warlords of what armed forces still existing in the postapocalyptic wasteland, using remaining survivors as tools to enforce their agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was stated Apokalypse used 25mm miniatures but since that scale later came to be known as (non-heroic) 28mm you could generally say that 28mm is the default standard for the game. The length measure unit, &amp;quot;meters&amp;quot;, was intentionally meant for being adapted to whatever scale of minis you had access to, making the game playable with all scales of miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Hardcore Media was liquidated, around 1998-99, the game faded into obscurity and very much stayed that way.&lt;br/&gt;In 2016 it was made available online, as a freeware document with the creators' consent, through a fan-made PDF of the original rulebook (available in the Web Links section).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were occasional references to expansions throughout the core rulebook. The material for all of these was sadly destroyed when Hardcore Media folded and its creators moved on to different projects. Apokalypse was a fully finished product and contains all the rules and information needed to play, despite this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
