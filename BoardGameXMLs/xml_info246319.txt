			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Constellate never fell. It faded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is Y3260. The Ocath subsector is free, after many years under The Constellate&amp;rsquo;s brutal rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free, but in turmoil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario for M-SPACE introduces The Weaver setting, telling an epic story about a dying empire, collapsing under a baroque cornucopia of empty gestures and brutality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A starship fleeing from the The Constellate&amp;rsquo;s armed forces disappeared 170 years ago. Now the characters must go to the Qioria system to search for it. But time is short. The planet is on a slow course for destruction and the hell holes of ignited gas grow every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their only hope seems to emanate from the long forgotten teachings of the Weavers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents Include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Scenario with investigative elements, social conflicts, puzzles and action&lt;br/&gt;- The rules for Extended Conflicts are used at focus points in the story to increase tension without having to resort to violence&lt;br/&gt;- Background on The Weaver setting, describing the major forces&lt;br/&gt;- Several alien species and their cultures&lt;br/&gt;- Stats and deckplans for a PC starship&lt;br/&gt;- Map of the Ocath subsector&lt;br/&gt;- Planetary maps of Anobe and Qioria&lt;br/&gt;- Town maps of Anobe City and Yllm&lt;br/&gt;- Location layouts: Cantina, Security Forces HQ and the Bone Caves&lt;br/&gt;- New rules on communications, FTL travel and three new careers&lt;br/&gt;- New equipment&lt;br/&gt;- Organisation stats&lt;br/&gt;- Suggestions on how to vary the difficulty level of the scenario&lt;br/&gt;- 106 pages, 10 in colour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main rulebook for M-SPACE is required to get the most out of this book, but the scenario is useful with any BRP-based game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
