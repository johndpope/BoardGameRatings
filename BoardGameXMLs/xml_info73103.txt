			<description>It&amp;acute;s the year 2888, players are in control of megacorporations who rule the earth. They all have the goal to colonize the galaxy and for this purpose they are building huge space ships, hiring the colonists ( with soldiers, scientists, farmers and more amongst them ) buying equipment for their ships and finally take of to fight for the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 3 Spaceships throughout the game wich have to be launched one after another.&lt;br/&gt;Players are bidding for equipment, fuel and colonists and when they are satisfied with the outfitting of their ships they will launch them to colonize the different planets wich are laid out at the beginning of the game by players choice.&lt;br/&gt;The equipment will prevent damage to your spaceships, give them more speed or even weapons to kill Aliens or enemy colonists.&lt;br/&gt;Most planets have some sort of requirement in order to be colonized.&lt;br/&gt;If there are Aliens present you can kill them with soldiers or send a diplomat and share the planet with them.&lt;br/&gt;You can discover rare ore and receive equipment for the next ship for free and many more.&lt;br/&gt;But you always have to send enough farmers to feed your colonists, unless you have the hydroponic farm equipment of course.&lt;br/&gt;Spaceships are moved by different dice ( D4, D6, D8 ) but whenever you throw a 1 your spaceship gets damaged and loses either equipment or colonists.&lt;br/&gt;Players earn the most points for the majority on a planet but they also earn ( less ) points for having a minority.&lt;br/&gt;After every player has unloaded his last spaceship the game ends and the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every player there will be 5 randomly drawn planets ( out of 22 ) on the map, so no game will ever be the same.&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 different equipments and 7 different types of colonists to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;The planets can be empty, have Alien inhabitants, accidic atmosphere, rare ore or they can be fertile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
