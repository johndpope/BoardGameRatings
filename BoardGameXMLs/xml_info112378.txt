			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Japanese amateur card game, featuring characters of Shrine Maiden fame. The game simulates a race, and the deck of cards consists of character cards with numbers 1&amp;ndash;6 and special powers of varying sorts. Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards, and each turn draws a card and may choose to play a card on theiur own &amp;quot;route&amp;quot; (representing that they are advancing), onto another player (representing an enemy), or generally using a card's special power. The player may also choose to score one of their route cards. Defeating enemies that other players have played on you may also generate points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once at 5 route cards, the stage is cleared and the player receives one of the route cards as stage clear bonus, and once a player has cleared 4 stages, the game ends at which point the player with the highest amount of points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
