			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the Gnuma.  A new creature I&amp;rsquo;ve designed for use with Pathfinder (or d20/OGL games).  It&amp;rsquo;s a free download, so enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnuma are very small, humanoid looking insects.  They have been found in just about any location provided that it is fairly dry and that there is a nearby clay deposit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They feed primarily on clay deposits, from which they obtain nutrients and then regurgitate a moist, extremely sticky substance that is part clay and part mucous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They then take this substance and use it to create fantastically elaborate cities in miniature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These miniature cities, often encompassing areas as large as forty feet square, are always models of nearby cities, in minute detail. Every shop, house, palace, bridge and fortress will be replicated in tiny scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
