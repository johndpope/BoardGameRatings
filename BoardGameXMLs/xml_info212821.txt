							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TRIATHLON Series: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This turn based game takes place in your real life.  You are an amateur triathlete struggling to find the time for training and balancing your lifestyle to be as ready as you can be for the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game-flow is divided in two big areas. A card management phase where you need to develop technical skills for swim, bike and run and still be able to hold a good level of energy and mindfulness just before the race. Immediately following this phase is the first dice based triathlon split. And then another management phase, giving you the time to adjust your strategy before the next split.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Event cards are the engine beyond the game. Some days are better, some days are worse but this will not stop you from training. &lt;br/&gt;You collect icons from different kind of cards (regular training, personal trainers, workout bonus etc.) and convert them into dice to maximize your chances in race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every big dream starts small and so are you. Your initial level of dice is red, and you need to find the ways to become green on technical skills, as well as mental and energy levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Find Your Inner TRI&amp;rdquo; is what Triathlon Series pushes you to search for, either if you&amp;rsquo;re a non-professional athlete or you just want to spend some cool quality time with your family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
