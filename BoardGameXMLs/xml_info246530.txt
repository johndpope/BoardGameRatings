							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek: The Next Generation Fluxx</name>
									
			<description>Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. By playing cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game. There are many editions, themed siblings, and promo cards available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can beam yourself aboard the Enterprise-D for a game of Star Trek: The Next Generation Fluxx! Join Picard, Riker, Data, and the rest of the TNG crew to gather the Keepers you need for victory &amp;mdash; but don't let Creepers like Q or the Borg keep you from your mission! With new cards like &amp;quot;Darmok&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Rule of Acquisition&amp;quot;, this version of Fluxx will take you into the 24th century!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
