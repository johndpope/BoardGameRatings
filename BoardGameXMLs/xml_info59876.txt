			<description>This game is played with a special D6 which is marked with 2 different markings per face for the 2 phases of the game. First you serve using the small words on the dice face. Rules are exactly like in Tennis. Hit &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; two times and your opponent gets the point. When service has been successful (you roll &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;) the second phase kicks in. You and your opponent roll in turns, hitting Lobs, cross or Stop balls. That is as long as nobody hits a failure giving away a point to the opponent. Scoring is done in the typical tennis way, counting from 0(love), 15, 30, 40 to a point and with 3-5 sets of so many games as it takes to have one player at at least 4 points and 2 more than his opponent has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
