			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Whispering Road is a GM-less tabletop role-playing game built to tell stories that reward exploration, pacifism, and helping others.  If you've ever wanted to tell a story in the worlds of Hayao Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli, this is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These stories do not focus on physical combat, though they may include a lot of action. The heroes are mostly ordinary people, thrust into a strange world where they try to do the right thing and get back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes are rewarded for helping others, and discouraged from acting selfishly. You hero will learn how to get along with others during a big adventure in a strange, beautiful world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules include specific guidance on creating heroes, launching them into a new world, resolving conflicts, getting them home (maybe!) and advice on what to do in each of the game's five Acts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses 6-sided and 8-sided dice and is intended for players aged 8 and up. One game will play in about 3 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
