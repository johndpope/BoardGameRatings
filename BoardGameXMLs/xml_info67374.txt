			<description>From the website: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A game of Super Heroes with Chess like strategies. &lt;br/&gt;You can play many combinations of Heroes and Powers, and in each game you can combine different heroes with different Side Kicks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;XtraHeart is a two player card game. Each player controls three home base zones where they secretly place their Headquarters and two Auxiliary bases. Players attempt to occupy their opponent's Headquarters or both of their Auxiliary bases to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;The cards consist of Heroes, Side Kicks and Powers cards. Players build combinations of these cards and move out in to one of the three central outer space zones in order to battle their opponent's card combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
