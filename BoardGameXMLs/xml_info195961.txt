			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase. Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A follow-up to the critically acclaimed* release of Oddworld: New &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Tasty, Oddworld: Soulstorm picks up from Abe&amp;rsquo;s genesis and directly follows on from the overthrow of RuptureFarms and the liberation of his blighted workmates.Having defeated Molluck The Glukkon, his former boss and RuptureFarms&amp;rsquo; meanest inhabitant, Abe soon finds himself - along with 300 newly emancipated Mudokons - without food, water or a place to call home. Stranded alone in the desert, they find solace in a strange new brew - a delicious drink that has insidious ramifications for their newfound freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddworld: Soulstorm will continue to chew up the themes of environmentalism, capitalism, consumerism and addiction that critics and fans found so engaging in the &amp;quot;AAA Indie&amp;quot; release of Oddworld&amp;rsquo;s last pensive platformer, New &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Tasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
