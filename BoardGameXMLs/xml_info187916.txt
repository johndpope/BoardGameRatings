							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">U Mad Bro?</name>
									
			<description>Cthuhulu awakens, promptly dies from pollution, and his corpse washes up on the Jersey shore. You're a boardwalk bro looking to impress some babes, but these girls are demanding you grab some tentacles off that nasty dome and don't care about the stuffed banana you won at ring toss! Keep grabbing tentacles until you either give up or go crazy in this pub style push your luck card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of cards: tentacles, junk, and madness. Players want to get as many tentacle cards as possible to win the round, but anyone who draws a madness card goes crazy and is out. Dawn cards are kept face down, so players don't know how many of anyone else's cards are tentacles, and how many are junk. First to win three rounds, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
