			<description>Slide cells up, down, left, and right to match colors with cores on 100+ stages of puzzle gaming bliss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dream of relaxing with a great puzzle game? Gameplay in Art Style: ZENGAGE revolves around sliding cells (squares) to match colors with cores (beads) located on the board. Clear each stage by matching all of the cores and cells. As you progress further into the game&amp;rsquo;s 100+ stages, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter cells with special characteristics (such as ones that can&amp;rsquo;t be moved), which further add to the challenge. To truly master ZENGAGE though, you must keep your mind sharp and employ careful strategy to complete stages in as few moves as possible. By combining wistful graphics and mesmerizing sound, ZENGAGE creates a surreal world that should be experienced by all puzzle game fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
