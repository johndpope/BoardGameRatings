			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bravery was Khepri&amp;rsquo;s stock and trade. She was an explorer, a grave robber and a professional. In this world any tomb&amp;rsquo;s occupant might object to intrusion. Something about this cavern chilled her to the bone. The light scraping of her sandaled feet against the stone walkway echoed into a continuous rustling sound. But no monster or guardian answered the noise. She pressed on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the center of chamber she found what she was looking for. The stone was a ruby or red sapphire a foot across set into an obsidian pedestal. Golden flecks sparked within the gem in the light of Khepri&amp;rsquo;s torch. She paused for a moment. Her imagination turned the gemstone into a great crimson sky filled with golden stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gently she raised the priceless stone from its resting place. There are few things Khepri Satisis would ever regret as deeply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A soft cracking, like that of an egg being slowly pulled open, rang through the air. This sound was followed by the distinctive ring of sundering stone and shattering glass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something was waking up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dragons keep their secrets close. Among these are shameful secrets, like the forbidden half-dragonkin. Others are relics from a bygone age. These are the forgotten, failed attempts at breeding a new servitor race as their greatest age drew to a painful close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone or something has awakened both these things in a long-forgotten mountain cavern. Once released, these horrors have no interest in returning to their slumber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Forgotten: Three new hybrids of modern animal and dinosaur, created during the fall of the ancient Dragon Empires. Recently wakened from their sleep, the Ozan, R&amp;rsquo;zaous and Skored are free to rampage across the world. &lt;br/&gt;     Half-Dragonkin Template: Of all the dark secrets of dragonkind, the fact that dragonkin may breed with other species just as pureblooded dragons can is the most closely guarded. The half-dragonkin template allows for halfbreeds of behir, chimera, dragon turtle, dragonne, jabberwock*, pseudodragon and wyvern. Includes example monsters for each dragonkin species.&lt;br/&gt;     The Hyeneel: A prototype of the forgotten, this horror fuses the traits of hyenas and electric eels.&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Weapon Abilities: Seven new magic weapon abilities discovered during the unearthing of the forgotten&amp;rsquo;s tomb: Arrowbane, banishing, chaotic surge, chaotic burst, demolishing, impact and screaming for use in both traditional and modern games. &lt;br/&gt;     Multi-genre Support: Background information and story suggestions for quickly adapting the included creatures to modern fantasy, modern science-fiction, post-apocalyptic and space opera settings.&lt;br/&gt;     Variant Rules Support: Like all Octavirate products, Octavirate Presents: The Forgotten provides quick-reference variant rules support for each creature Including: wounds/vitality, defense bonus, armor as damage reduction, modern/3.0 damage reduction, sanity loss, taint, magic rating, spell points, honor and reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
