			<description>From box back:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is the year 2099 A.D. and inter-planetary space travel is commonplace.  Creatures from all planets are Galactic citizens  of the Solar System.  Earth is the capital of the Solar System.  Both good and evil forces exist on Earth.  The evil command -- The Alien Space Patrol -- has just captured the space jet which you are traveling on -- The Constellation. You are one of eight space travelers now being held captive by the Alien Space Patrol.  to hinder your chances of escape, the Alien Space Patrol has stripped you of your Planetary Passport.&lt;br/&gt;Your Mission:&lt;br/&gt;1.Escape from the Constellation.&lt;br/&gt;2.Make your way to your planet's embassy to pick up a new Passport.&lt;br/&gt;3.Prove your galactic citizenship by answering questions about your planet.&lt;br/&gt;4.Continue on to the Sky Launch where, once you have cleared customs, you can board a space jet home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... teaches players intriguing facts about the solar system.&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of P.t.t.P. is the Total Family Play concept.  Whereas Mom and Dad have to know the exact distance to the planet Jupiter to the Sun, the Juniors in the family need only know that Jupiter is the 5th closest planet to the Sun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
