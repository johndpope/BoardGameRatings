			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cook, Serve, Survive! &lt;br/&gt;As a Chef, face a Zombie horde and make the best meals in order to bait the Zombies towards your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feeding Zombies is a &amp;quot;cooking survival game&amp;quot; for 1 to 2 players ages 10 and up. It's a quick but challenging filler game offering 3 different game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as a Chef facing a horde of Zombies invading your Kitchen, to survive this apocalypse you will have to gather every bit of food you can get your hands onto and throw it towards your opponent in order to attract the Zombies to her instead of you! Make special meals and unleash more effective attacks, arm yourself in case the Zombies get too close and choose carefully your play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 5 random food cards, on your turn you may choose 2 of the following actions. &lt;br/&gt;Each action may be repeated, but you may not target the same Zombie card twice per turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Attract 1 Zombie by playing the required Food cards. Then refill the empty spot with a new card.&lt;br/&gt;2. Trade 2 Food Cards for 1 Menu card from the display. Apply the Menu&amp;rsquo;s  effect or take the card into your hand for a later use.  &lt;br/&gt;3. Play a Menu Card or a Knife. &lt;br/&gt;4. Discard any number of cards from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then complete your hand by drawing Food cards as you must always finish your turn with a total of 5 cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Zombie reaches the fourth row of your opponent's side, she is bit. &lt;br/&gt;If you are playing the classical game mode you have won the game and your opponent is gently devoured!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
