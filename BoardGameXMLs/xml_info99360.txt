			<description>Booty for Booty Introduction&lt;br/&gt;You are the captain of a surly pirate crew, hoping you can one day get enough booty to trade it in for a mansion and a wife. Not before you've had a few more years of adventure though!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two Resources that the Pirates must keep track of.&lt;br/&gt;Grog: The fuel of the crew. The crew begin with forty barrels of Grog.&lt;br/&gt;Booty: Gold and rubies flowing out of huge chests. The crew begin with no Booty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of every week spent at sea each pirate consumes one barrel of Grog. Any pirates that do not get their barrel of Grog will immediately roll on the Sober Pirate table. A week is similar to a turn in other games.&lt;br/&gt;As well as these the ship must always know it's bearing. This will be either Island or Port and may be changed at the start of any week if the pirates wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game&lt;br/&gt;A captain needs 300 Booty to buy a mansion and a truly impressive hat, which is the best a Pirate can hope for. Booty may be banked at any Port, where it is stored safely but may be removed by the ship's captain at any time. A new captain inherits the ship's Booty savings from the old one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
