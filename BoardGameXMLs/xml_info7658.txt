			<description>From the Box: Maneuver is a game of mobile strategy wherein a player can Maneuver his men aggressively to score points. The play of a card dictates the Maneuvering of men in a clock-wise direction, regardless of how the men are grouped or scattered. A player may also Maneuver defensively to minimize the scoring potential of his opponents. It is not necessary that each of a players men complete an equal amount of laps; a player may Maneuver his men in any manner that suits his strategy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played on a circular board of 25 numbered spaces. 4 men and a scoring marker of each players color are moved around the board using a custom deck of cards, consisting of Ace(1) through 7 with three runs of hearts, two runs of clubs and spades, and one run of diamonds. Players hold six cards, and draw one each turn &amp;ndash; a card of their choosing, either from their hand or their draw, is played to move the number of spaces equal to the number of the card. Four men can be moved simultaneously with a diamond card, three with a club, two with a heart, and one man with a spade. Scoring is accomplished buy landing all four men on a single space; the color of the space - red, yellow, or &amp;quot;terminal&amp;quot;(home) - determines the scoring. Evicting other players from a space by landing a greater amount of your men on the space, and lapping the 25 space board also score points. The players color score marker sits on the numbered space of the board. The first player to move his score marker a complete round to 25 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
