			<description>Players use custom dice as pawns to move around a modular hexagonal board with 12 action spaces. When landing on a particular space, the player may acquire an action card from that space. If all cards have been taken, the player may capture the piece of the board itself, leaving fewer spaces for the other players to traverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player moves through a space that already has an opponent's pawn, the opponent launches an ambush. If the opponent has a higher power level (indicated on the face of the die), the opponent may steal a victory point. However, there are also opportunities for the active player to attack as well. Action cards can be used to alter the face of the die, changing the movement points and power level of the player's pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of the round in which either all &amp;quot;soul shard&amp;quot; cards (acquired by making a circuit of the board) or &amp;quot;destiny markers&amp;quot; (victory point tokens) are gone from the supply. The player(s) with the most victory points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
