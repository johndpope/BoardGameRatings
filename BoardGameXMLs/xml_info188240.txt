			<description>The following is a rough translation from the Dutch manual. Some terms just cannot be translated without loss of meaning, sorry about that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KOEkeloeren is a Moohingly exciting (LOEIspanned) cardgame. Play along with Kittie Cow, Pleuntje kitten, Mistie mouse, Pepper pup, Gagger goat and Bibi piglet.&lt;br/&gt;To help the play KOEkeloeren right, they have put on their glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt;72 playing cards (2*6 cards for each animal)&lt;br/&gt;8 combination cards (showing how to score)&lt;br/&gt;2 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strictly, the box &amp;quot;contains&amp;quot; 5 games, that all use the cards in the box.&lt;br/&gt;These five games are: KOEkeloeren [a8; p3-6], GABBERen [a5; p2-6], BIGgen (&amp;quot;pigletting&amp;quot;) [a5; p3-6], Doe de PEPPER (Do the PEPPER) [a4; [3-6] en Pleuntjes Bluf! [a5; p2-6].&lt;br/&gt;Per game, the minimum age and number of players variate slightly, I have added in square brackets after the name of the game, e.g.: [a5; p2-4] would mean ages 5 and up, number of players 2 through 4. Playing time also differences per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manual and 8 combination cards are in Dutch, the playing card are language neutral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
