							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Landing Zone</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;An asteroid has impacted the moon. There are four large pieces left, one of which is composed mainly of DIAMONDS! You have two ships to use to claim your riches. Unfortunately, the only way to land is to crash land. Avoid the wreckage of other ships and have just the right touch on the throttle and you can emerge victorious.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing Zone is an Icehouse dexterity game in which players attempt to flick Icehouse pieces across a table in hopes of being  the closest to each one of four stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing Zone was designed by Carlton Noles and requires 2 Treehouse stashes and four small stones/gems (3 of one colour, one of another).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing Zone placed 2nd in the Icehouse Games Design Competition, Spring 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
