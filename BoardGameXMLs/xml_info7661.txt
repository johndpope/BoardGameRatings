			<description>Les Blind&amp;eacute;s is a tank battle game for two players. The object is to either destroy the enemy's depot, or to be the last player with a functional tank. No date is given, but based on a sticker on my copy, I believe this game dates to around 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a fuel depot, 6 tanks (divided between light &amp;amp; heavy types), a fuel usage board, and markers for the fuel board. There are also &amp;quot;fuel depleted&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;damaged&amp;quot; markers that may be inserted in each tank. Fuel may be transferred between tanks to extend movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board features a somewhat abstract limited terrain map (essentially river and plain spaces) over which the tanks move. Square spaces are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is dice driven, based on direction of fire and the types of tank(s) involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
