			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens when player characters are defeated in combat? What happens when they don't win the important battle? Most times it is assumed they die, and after some understandable disappointment the players roll up new characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall Into Darkness offers an alternate way of handling the party's defeat at the hands of their enemies. In this adventure the PCs are assumed to be captured (instead of killed), and taken to a legendary place in the desert where captives are tossed into a deep black abyss. Whether taken by raiders or a tribal warband, this adventure gives the PCs one last chance at saving themselves, and an opportunity to get stronger - through gaining experience - in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall Into Darkness is designed for characters of levels 2 to 4, but the party will likely begin the adventure significantly below their normal capabilities due to the adventure's unique circumstances. As a result, parties of even greater strength may find this adventure a challenge as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
