							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heart of Dreams</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a rising, award-winning director with a vision, an excellent script and plenty of funding, from both various public institutions and wealthy investors, the movie was going to be the biggest, most talked about since Star Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things didn't go quite as planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The director insisted on a remote location for the shoot based on some half-spoken dream. He always seems to get mad when anyone brings it up. The conditions are horrible. Weather is a problem on most days and the shoot is over a year behind. Tensions are high, because there seems to be no end to this. The director and the star have been on each others throats for months, but most of the crew just wants to get by day to day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
