			<description>Kalk - The Card Game by By Tommy &amp;amp; Jonathan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun &amp;amp; educational card game for kids and parents! Time to exercise our brain and reinforce our math skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 26 cards in total, full of numbers and colors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0-10 card numbers x 2 &lt;br/&gt;One of each magic cards. These are - square, square-root, timer (pauses the opponent for 15 seconds) and scissors (to remove one of the goal numbers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal each player 5 number cards. Deal two cards between the players; this is the goal-number. They use minus, plus, multiply and divide to the get the two-digit goal number. Whoever gets the answer first, wins the game. You can replace two cards but this takes extra time. You can also use the six as a nine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unsuccessfully funded on Kickstarter March 2015. However, during the campaign, there was a print and play version available and also a few months after on their official website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
