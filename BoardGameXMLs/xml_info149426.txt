			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following are additions and amendments to the Dragon Age RPG by Green Ronin. These will help fill out the equipment available to players as well as provide alternate rules. The materials used are those from the computer game and like that game should probably be used in concert for all types of equipment as the PCs increase in level. The Fatigue rules give more realistic consequences to play and open up a new area for spells and abilities to affect. Hopefully this will be the first amongst many additions to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: None of these are set in stone. If you want a Veridium +3 Damage sword then you should go for it. These are just the material levels found in the computer game and are used to make it simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
