			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At long last, the Kagonesti elves are rising against their Silvanesti and Qualinesti masters. A prophet has come to deliver them from bondage; all of Southern Ergoth rings with the sounds of battle! The Kagonesti flee their arrogant cousins, heading toward a land of legend: The Valley of Perfect Silences. Here only Kagonesti are allowed; no longer will they suffer servitude and wrong. The Gate has been found and the way is open. Kagonesti pass through the gate and into the promised land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or do they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All is not as it seems in the Valley of Perfect Silences. Beneath the idyllic land of the valley lurks an ancient secret. You must journey to the valley and explore its darkest recesses. Unless you uncover the mystery of the valley, the Kagonesti may find that they have entered a new, vastly more horrible servitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wild Elves contains much new information on Kagonesti elves and their society. Take your Dragonlance game campaign to a new dimension with this fourth module in the DLS series. Free the Kagonesti elves from their shackles and lead them to safety in the Valley of Perfect Silences. It is not necessary to have played the three previous DLS adventures in order to play this stand-alone module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
