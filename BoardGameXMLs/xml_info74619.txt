			<description>Warheads: Medieval Tales is tabletop miniatures wargame with some role-playing elements, set in a comical and mythical medieval England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as new scenarios and characters each edition of the Warheads Magazine delivers large sections of narrative and high quality artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control one of two heroes and their followers. Every character in the game has their own statistics, skills and narrative which makes them unique. Over the course of the series characters and parties grow and evolve based on the decisions that players make as well as an experience and equipment based system for customization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are introduced a little at a time in a tutorial style, with just enough presented initially to play the first scenario. Depth is added by each subsequent scenario with range and cover rules presented in the second scenario of issue one before rules for magic are introduced for the third and final scenario of the first book. The game uses a dice based system for determining events such as combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warheads: Medieval Tales saga is to be delivered over 6 magazine installments, each magazine launched with two accompanying miniature box sets containing between 4-8 unpainted 28mm metal miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publishers Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warheads: Medieval Tales is a fast and fun two player tabletop game for players of all ages and abilities.
