			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenaries aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones who see the profits in war. As the Word of Blake crumbles before the might of rallying Houses, the latest surge in military demand could ebb along with it. But there is always another conflict around the corner, and the interstellar arms conglomerates&amp;mdash;from Defiance Industries and StarCorps to Imstar Aerospace and Wakazashi Enterprises&amp;mdash;are all banking on the next surge in inevitable military spending with a plethora of new prototype war machines for the post-Jihad end-user&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Tech Readout: Corporations samples the custom and prototype designs that are still going through their shakedown trials in the corporate research sites throughout the BattleTech universe. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake thunders on. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;have yet to face their first actions in real combat, but each has been tailored for an eventual debut on battlefields yet to come. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, and aerospace units presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
