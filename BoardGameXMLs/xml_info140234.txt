							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Banwok Hunters</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; The Banwok Hunters&amp;quot; is a sourcebook intended for the RIFTS roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's also a snapshot of one of the happiest parts of my life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I ran a regular RIFTS campaign between 1990 and 1996. For my friends in my regular gaming group - and for myself - that was an amazing time. The games back then were filled with a lot of excitement, a lot of fun, a lot of inspired insanity, and a hell of a lot of laughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I spent a lot of time writing adventures and designing new rules and source material for that campaign. At some point, I thought it might be a good idea to formally write up my notes in the form of a book. Little did I know that nearly fifteen years later, this would be the very first step I would take towards becoming a professionally published freelancer in the gaming industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Banwok Hunters&amp;quot; essentially represents a &amp;quot;best of&amp;quot; look at that campaign, and at my own first attempts at writing something for a gaming company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know my old gaming group did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
