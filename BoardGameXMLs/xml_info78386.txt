							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Age of Steam Expansion: Sharing</name>
									
			<description>All you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to do in life is to connect all the locations where there are parties so that everyone can deliver gifts to each other...how fun is that? You know, of course, that people who build railroad companies are the most generous people in the world. They love to help out their competitors, with a motto of &amp;ldquo;all for the greater good&amp;rdquo; while having boatloads of fun. In this expansion, you&amp;rsquo;ll share track with your opponents while they share track with you. And all it takes to share? A share!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re still competing with other players to move all the gifts everyone has gotten for each other to the correct party, but you&amp;rsquo;re doing it with a wink of your eye and a fun little skip to your step. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s still only one winner, but it&amp;rsquo;s really about how many friends you make while playing...and doesn&amp;rsquo;t that make everyone a winner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sharing is for 3 to 6 players who really care about other people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find the &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; Sharing rules for Ted Alspach&amp;rsquo;s Sharing Steam/Age of Steam expansion too competitive for your tastes, try this softer, more pleasant expansion map (on the reverse side of &amp;ldquo;Sharing&amp;rdquo;). You&amp;rsquo;ll be guaranteed to make more friends in Steam/Age of Steam than ever before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if Steam/Age of Steam was a truly cooperative game, like Shadows over Camelot with out a traitor? Or if no one had to die in Clue, so you could just mosey around that neat mansion talking to your friends? Or if there were no diseases in Pandemic, or no ghosts in Ghost Story? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be fun? Sure it would!&lt;br/&gt;Ted Alspach&amp;rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing is for 2 to 10 players who don&amp;rsquo;t have some horribly recessive competitive gene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ted Alspach&amp;rsquo;s *Really* Friendly Sharing, you work as a team to build a railroad. Many of the aspects that cause unnecessary tension in Age of Steam have been removed, like money and the AoS auction, so you can focus on laying track, making deliveries, getting VPs and having fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 8 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double sided expansions. These maps can be preordered from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.beziergames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.beziergames.com&lt;/a&gt; and will ship in October 2010. The &amp;ldquo;bonus&amp;rdquo; Sharing map is only available through preorders. Expansion #1: California Gold Rush &amp;amp; Underground Railroad, Expansion #2: Amazon Rainforest and Sahara Desert and Expansion #3: Atlantis and Trisland have been previously announced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
