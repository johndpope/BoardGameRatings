			<description>Cowboy Bebop: Tsuioku no Serenade (カウボーイビバップ 追憶の夜曲 Kaubōi Bibappu Tsuioku no Yakyoku, lit. &amp;quot;Cowboy Bebop: Serenade of Reminiscence&amp;quot;) has original story based on the anime series Cowboy Bebop.  Events center around a search for a space pirate's treasure, a mysterious song called Diamonds and a mysterious organization that stands in the way of the Bebop's crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable characters include Spike, Faye, and Jet, each of whom are voiced by their respective voice actors of the anime series, while Ed provides objectives, advice and moral support, and Ein appears alongside Ed. Action occurs on foot with both hand to hand and shooting segments, often with small puzzles to solve, as well as items to search for (either essential to the plot or as bonus items to appear in the gallery). Certain sections of the game require piloting spacecraft and at one point a boat. Game play is punctuated by long cut scenes that develop the story. There is also a blackjack mini-game featuring Spike and Jet as rotating dealers; this provides a way to earn additional money to unlock bonuses such as songs for the music player and character profiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soundtrack is composed of music by Yoko Kanno, famous for her music in the series. Three unique songs were composed for the game and were released on the Tank! THE! BEST! album.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cowboy Bebop (PlayStation 2 game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a limited edition box that includes fanmobilia from T-shirts to a music PS2 CD that looks like a vinyl record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
