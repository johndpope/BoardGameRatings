							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crusade of Kings</name>
									
			<description>All the splendor, majesty, Byzantine plotting, and senseless destruction of the first three Crusades, designed for the Wildside Gaming System (but easily adapted to other systems). Contains all the resources a GM needs to build a Crusades-based campaign, whether the players are in the roles of princes or peasants, Crusaders or Caliphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly a century of history is covered, allowing for long campaigns, and the book spills over into a variety of environments in Europe and the Middle East. Want to run a Byzantine campaign? an adventure centered on a mountain fortress in Lebanon? It&amp;rsquo;s all here: everything you need to know to live or die in world-spanning adventures from 1094-1192.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crusade of Kings is filled with information on key environments (How did people dress in Antioch? What&amp;rsquo;s a really bad day to be caught in Jerusalem?) and with profiles of major players in the first three Crusades, including larger-than-life figures like Richard the Lion Hearted and Saladin. It has exactly the information you need to run a Crusades-based campaign without getting bogged down. There are also dozens of adventure seeds for GMs who want to get started in a hurry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Publisher's website, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wildsidegame.net/bk_crusade.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.wildsidegame.net/bk_crusade.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
