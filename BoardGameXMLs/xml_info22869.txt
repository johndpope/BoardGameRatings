			<description>Players draw up to 7 cards each turn, then &amp;quot;publish&amp;quot; as many works as they can.  Publishing is accomplished by holding a &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; which is attributed to a specific city and the city card in question.&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when the deck is exhausted. The winner is the player who has the most published works.&lt;br/&gt;The game is based in California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
