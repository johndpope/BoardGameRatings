			<description>The board is made up of 144 squares, each with either a number (the runs scored with that delivery) or a way of getting out. Each set of six squares is labelled with an over. You start in the first over and end with the 24th over. Players throw a die and move along the row labelled with the first over and check the result. Now the marker is moved back to the start of that over and a die is thrown again, and so on for six deliveries. Then it is the 2nd over, and so on. The publisher thought that it would be a good idea to say it was a game for more than the obvious two players. So three can play (two pair up against the other single player), or four (both teams consist of a pair of players) or five players (two teams of two players and the fifth player just acts as scorer and he gets to shout &amp;quot;Over&amp;quot; at the end of each six deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
