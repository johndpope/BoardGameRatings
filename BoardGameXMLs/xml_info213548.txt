			<description>Mind Wreck is a strategic, downright sexy board game that will spice up any bedroom. It&amp;rsquo;s a two-player game that gives special privileges to the winner. As you progress around the board, you&amp;rsquo;re given sexy tasks. Each task is designed to bring you or your opponent closer to climax. Seduce your way to the winning circle with two ways to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary way to win: Collect three &amp;ldquo;win cards&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Secondary way to win: Drive your opponent to climax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The win cards are collected by reaching the &amp;ldquo;g-spot&amp;rdquo; space on the game board three times. These cards in turn give all-powerful rules that remain in play until a winner is declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
