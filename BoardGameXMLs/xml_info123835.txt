			<description>Taken from publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;AGE Explorations are short, experimental products for the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) that expand the rules in different directions. Each entry in the series presents new game mechanics, systems, or other content to help change the way you play. Add just the Explorations products you want to your AGE campaign to get the style of play you're after. Change your game with AGE Explorations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from the introductory text:&lt;br/&gt;Faith looms as a theme in many fantasy tales. Whether portrayed by stunning cathedrals packed with devout priests and lay people or represented by modest and isolated shamans, faith can be a powerful literal and symbolic force in the fantastical lands of game campaigns powered by the Adventure Game Engine, too. With the game rules presented here, you can create Player Characters and Non-Player Characters who draw on the power of their faith&amp;mdash;power bestowed by deities or patrons either direct or mysterious, through clear contact or mystical secrets, as a reward for devotion and piety that favors the divine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
