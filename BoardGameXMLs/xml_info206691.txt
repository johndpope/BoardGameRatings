			<description>During the Kickstarter campaign Ninja Star offered this set of 8 character standees as an add-on. They would replace some of the cards used during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were only 100 sets made and they were sold on a 'first come, first served' basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
