			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rockman &amp;amp; Forte: Challenger from the Future is a platformer released exclusively in Japan for the WonderSwan. In the year 20XX, a group of robots called the Dimensions attacks Symphony City, led by a mysterious robot similar to Rockman (Mega Man). This robot calls himself Rockman Shadow. Both Rockman and Forte (Bass) are dispatched to deal with the problem, the former by Dr. Light and the latter by Dr. Wily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to play as either Rockman or Forte, each of whom has a unique moveset. Rockman controls the same as he does in other games in the Mega Man series and is able to charge his Mega Buster and slide. Forte, on the other hand, has a rapid fire weapon that can only be fired while immobile and the ability to dash and double jump. There are six robot Masters in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Konro Man&lt;br/&gt;- Aircon Man&lt;br/&gt;- Komuso Man&lt;br/&gt;- Dangan Man&lt;br/&gt;- Clock Man&lt;br/&gt;- Compas Man&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to purchase special bonuses and upgrades using bolts that can be found in the different levels and as random pickups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
