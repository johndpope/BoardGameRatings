							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Schloss von Nachtherz</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the pine forest, high in the hills, sits Schloss von Nachtherz, the ancestral castle home of the von Nachtherz family. For centuries the family ruled from the stronghold, treating people fairly and justly. That all changed when Dietmar became Count von Nachtherz. The castle doors were closed, the windows bricked up, and messages stopped coming down from the castle. Locals spoke of strange sounds and lights coming from the castle, and began to stay away from the surrounding forests. But that's when the disappearances began. Rumours abounded; the Count was sick with plague, the mansion was haunted, the Count was cruel. But one word was repeated again and again in the hushed taverns near Schloss von Nachtherz : Vampire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The map is 50x50, equivalent to 25 of our standard 10x10 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A large Gothic castle in a dark and creepy forest. The castle belongs to a Vampire, and is eerily lit with torches. Rooms include a crypt, great hall, bedrooms and parlour, library, dining hall and long corridors. Perfect for Halloween adventures, where it could also be a haunted house, a murder mystery setting, or just the home of a sinister noble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
