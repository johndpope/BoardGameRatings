							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hexcrawling: Wilderness Exploration &amp; Random Encounters</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;It's...packed with amazing!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-- James Introcaso, The Tome Show - Round Table 106&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following optional rules expand the Getting Lost section in the Wilderness rules (Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide p. 106-112) and Random Encounter checks (p. 86), providing more opportunities for the player characters to interact with wilderness exploration (A.K.A. &amp;ldquo;hexcrawling&amp;rdquo;), and provide a framework on which to hang a slew of new ways to drop their hit points, increase their Exhaustion levels, or otherwise get them in trouble, as adventurers so often do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is a detailed discussion of the theory, science, and art of building random encounter tables, as well as a hex map and five example wilderness encounter tables tied to it. Featuring plenty of combat, exploration, and evocative interaction-based encounters, there's enough material for several months of gaming, as well as a barebones setting that you can expand to create your own low- to mid-level campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll receive:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A detailed system for wilderness exploration that combines the best of 5th Edition's elegance with old school hexcrawling.&lt;br/&gt;     A wilderness hex map.&lt;br/&gt;     Comprehensive discussion regarding building random encounter tables that make sense, feature a great variety of encounters, and enhance the feel of your campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Five expansive tables of random encounters that suggest a bizarre and mysterious setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Hexcrawls in Play is an entire chapter of player-centric material:&lt;br/&gt;     A player-friendly discussion of what hexcrawl campaigns mean to them.&lt;br/&gt;     Tips and tricks on developing both player- and character-driven goals that promote a strong hexcrawl campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     Player Roles, a codification of &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; roles like Caller, Mapper, and Quartermaster with hints, tricks, and tools on making these tasks fun and helping ease the burden of the DM's work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
