			<description>Easy Slider is the first game in a new Piecepack genre: the &amp;quot;B.Y.O.P.&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Bring Your Own Piecepack&amp;quot; game. It can be played solitaire, or with as many players as there are Piecepacks available. It can even be played over the phone or via online chat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players agree on how many rounds of the game they will play. (Three is a good number for beginners.) On each round, a Caller is chosen. (Callers need not rotate.) The Caller creates a random layout of tiles and randomly designates a strict order in which the tiles must be placed. All players then try to slide the tiles on their boards one at a time into the proper positions. The player who does so the fastest over the specified number of rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
