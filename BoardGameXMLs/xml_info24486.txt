							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fund-Raising Game</name>
									
			<description>snip from rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Object:  The object of this game is to set a fund raising goal and raise that amount of money.  There are intervening factors,  such as luck and timing,  that will affect the raising of your dollar goal.  However,  the bottom line is cash on hand.  &lt;br/&gt;   The game is not intended to be competitive.  The main objective is to provide discussion among players on various aspects of fund raising.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a game board,  4 tokens,  2 dice,  25 each of Risk and Opportunity cards,  a pack of Fund raising Goal and Funds Balance cards,  play money,  Rules booklet and ANSWER KEY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes,  ANSWER KEY!  Basically,  this is a game designed to teach fund raising skills to young 'wannabe' fund raisers.  So the cards have real questions on them.  For instance, &amp;quot;15.  To generate significantly more income from mail appeals,  a priority would be to . . . A.  Mail more times in a year   B.  use segmentation data to specialize appeals.   C.  purge lapsed donors to trim your mailing expenses.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And in case you really wanted to know,  according to the answer key,  the answer is . . .  B&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
