							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heat of Battle: FireFights! 2</name>
									
			<description>The &amp;lsquo;FireFights!&amp;rsquo; system continues with FF2. The scenarios are small, intense actions compatible with the ASL game system or other tactical level wargames. Variety and re-playability are key components of FireFights 2. The fog of war and variety remains high with variable reinforcement groups. Each scenario also comes with its own historically based map which also serves as a half board overlay. The half board overlays are compatible with boards 1, 14, 19, 26-31, 33. Designed for those that love a great game that can be played in one week- night setting, while they pit the opposing forces against each other and against time as the FireFight! Series has only 4-5 game turns per scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FF-10 Near Bicske, Hungary, 4 January 1945 - A small group of SS troopers and tanks from the 5th SS Wiking Division have been ordered to fight a rear guard action. In an ancient castle they take their stand against Russian heavy metal... the feared IS-2 heavy tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FF-11 Tug Argan Pass, British Somaliland, 11 August 1940 - The Italian army in Ethiopia needed a way out of the country. The only way was through the Tug Argan Pass... Only the Indian troops of the British Empire stood in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FF-12 Ste. Marie du Mont, France, 6 June 1944 - Scattered far and wide the US paratroopers of the 506th Parachute Infantry, have come down in the wrong place... directly into a German occupied French village. Now, all they have to do is GET OUT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FF-13 Mt. Cochen, Agordat, Eritrea, 29 January 1941 - The British want the Italians out of Eritrea and send the 11th Indian Brigade to roust them out. But on this lonely mountain, the Italians wanted to fight! After 2 days the Italians were counter-attacking and the Indians were in retreat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FF-14 Bodange, Belgium, 10 May 1940 - War has come to western Europe! On 10 May 1940, the German XIX Korps crossed into the Belgian Ardennes. What to stop them? Nothing!, But stiff resistance by the Belgian Chasseurs could sure slow them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FF-15 Haut le Wastia, France, 14 May 1940 - French units of the 5th Motorized Division, in a desperate attempt to stem the German tide, counter-attacked the German 7th Panzer Division near the small hamlet of Haut le Wastia. Surprising the Germans, French were able to reoccupy the hamlet for awhile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Advanced Squad Leader&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
