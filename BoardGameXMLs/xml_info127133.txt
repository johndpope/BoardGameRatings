			<description>[From the back cover.]&lt;br/&gt;In 1982 a 13-year old who&amp;rsquo;d just seen some neighborhood kids play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons decided to create his own game in which knights and wizards explored underground catacombs, defeated monsters, and took their treasure. This book represents a refined version of those rules appropriate for kids interested in transitioning from traditional board games to a more imaginative form of structured play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures &amp;amp; Caverns is a very basic &amp;ldquo;roleplaying&amp;rdquo; game in which players explore subterranean labyrinths, using imaginary heroes to defeat monsters they encounter and collect their treasure. Although it uses a map like a board in a traditional game, it also enables players to assume the roles of knights and wizards exploring underground. These heroes use an arsenal of weapons and spells to slay monsters; die rolls often decide their fate, determining whether they strike their foes and fend off attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peter Schweighofer is a writer, editor, and game developer with more than 20 years&amp;rsquo; experience in the publishing field, including time working for many companies in the adventure gaming hobby. While bestknown for his contributions to various iterations of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game, he&amp;rsquo;s also the author of period sourcebooks Pulp Egypt: Adventures Along the Nile, 1933-1939 and Heroes of Rura-Tonga, as well as numerous other works for various roleplaying games. He pursues his game-publishing activities under the auspices of Griffon Publishing Studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
