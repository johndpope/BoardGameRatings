			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ast&amp;uacute;cia e mal&amp;iacute;cia num jogo de pol&amp;iacute;cia e ladr&amp;atilde;o!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pega Ladr&amp;atilde;o is a brazilian game from the early 80's with a Cops and Robbers theme, where players take turns trying to scoring points. It was published by Grow and there's no info on a re-release of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the &amp;quot;Jail&amp;quot; card on the table. The Cop and the Robber player take turns, placing cards on the table, that shows a maze of streets. The Robber player must lay his cards in a way to form a free passageway as far as the jail as possible, while the Cop player must put him on a dead end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
