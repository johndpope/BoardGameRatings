							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Echoes of Heaven Bestiary (HERO)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Korum stumbled clear of the blast of air, his ears ringing, the skin onhis face raw from the merciless slap of wind. For a moment, he stood disoriented, then the training kicked in. Whatever else his enemy was, he was a witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mountain pass crumbled and wound down the incline bhind him even as the dying light painted the walls of the cleft red and orange, gleamed off the blac armor of his enemy. The man stood, helmetless before Korum, sword held easily in one hand, the other still raised from his last magical blast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. Korum had to get out of here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foul and tainted creatures stalk this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towering Nephilim. Wiked Cambions, Nobel Angels and fallen Devils. The legions of Hell. The dreaded Elemental Wraiths. Since the release of The Echoes of Heaven, our products have been filled with hints and descriptions of these creatures. Some of them are familiar. Some of them are wholly new. Look no further, because here you will find the creatures unique to The Echoes of Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
