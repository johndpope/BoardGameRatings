							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pre-Dreadnought Era 1870-1905</name>
									
			<description>This is a naval combat game designed to recreate the tactics used in the transitional period of fleet actions that spanned the era between sail and steam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only scenario provided in the rules covers the decisive 1898 battle of Santiago during the Cuban Campaign. The designer suggests that players consult reference works like &amp;quot;Jane's Fighting Ships&amp;quot; to create additional scenarios. The battle system uses dice and hits are determined by armor thickness and the penetrating power of the projectile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a map, 60 counters, and a 24 page rule booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
