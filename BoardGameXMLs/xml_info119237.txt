			<description>The games for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS are relatively similar. They're comic book styled and have pretty good graphics, even though they were created when both devices were newly made. The plot is Lubek has a secret base where he's manufacturing robots that turn civilians into zombies. Natasha must destroy every robot and spray the zombies with the dezombifier.your menu selection is located on your BooferBerry where you can select where you want to go. There are three chapters and at the end of each chapter there is a big boss battle. Each level has enemies that you must destroy and zombies you must save. At the end of each level, Natasha holds out two fingers as a peace sign and winks at you. there are a wide variety of robots in the game. there are little spherical robots - medium size spherical robots which when destroyed release two little robots - and big spherical robots which when destroyed releases two medium size robots. If you were to destroy One big spherical robot, you would have to destroy six other robots, 7 in total. There are flying robots which propel themselves in the air. One of the two swoop down and try to hit you and the other fires projectiles at you. There are few robots which stay on the ground. One of them walks back and forth until you stand next to it. Once you're in his path his feet will start spinning at a fast speed. The second just walks backs and forth and won't harm you unless he swings his arms at you. He usually misses every swing.&lt;br/&gt;There are special levels in the game. They can be found on the map at random times and every special level has a different objective. You could either have to save the zombies or destroy all enemies, but you have to do this in less than a minute. If you get hit once, you'll have to redo everything.&lt;br/&gt;Once you beat the game, at the end it will give you a link to a website that will give you codes. You can input the codes in the EXTRA menu screen.&lt;br/&gt;There are three codes: 1 - Infinite lives 2 - More levels 3 - All Gadgets&lt;br/&gt;The link to the codes is no longer up, although you can find the codes elsewhere on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Princess Natasha&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
