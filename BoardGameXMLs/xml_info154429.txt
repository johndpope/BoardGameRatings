			<description>Mystique Guilds is a 2 to 4 player game for The Mystique Deck derived from Nestortiles Duel, by the same designer. You need one Mystique Deck to play the game.&lt;br/&gt; In Mystique Guilds, the combination of suit+colour is called &amp;lsquo;guild&amp;rsquo;. So there are 12 guilds (3 colours times 4 suits). Your goal is to control the most guilds when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the whole deck and place it facing down in the middle of the table. This is the Draw Deck. Next to it a (now inexistent) Discard Deck will be created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determine the starting player by any peaceful means. Players take turns in anticlockwise order during the game until the endgame condition is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players must do only one of these 2 actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Pick one card from the Draw Deck or the Discard Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Buy cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to buy cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Place one of your cards facing up before you. This is the Influence Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Draw up to as many cards from the Draw Deck as the number on your Influence Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Place the Influence Card facing up on the Discard Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, at any moment, the Draw Deck gets exhausted, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player adds up the values of each guild on their hand. The player with the highest value for each guild controls that guild and scores a point (tip: score the 12 guilds in order for clarity). In case of two or more players having the same value for a guild, none of them scores for it. The guild of blue suns is an exception and scores two points. So there are 13 available points in total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ties for the first place are broken by the lowest number of cards. If a tie persists then play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant 1: Cards can be bought from both decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant 2 (the Market): You can buy cards from another player. Both players must agree on the cards being exchanged. The Influence card is given to that player instead of discarding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
