							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DÃ©dalo</name>
									
			<description>In this game two armies clash and the only thing that will discourage them is the fact of losing their king in battle. All the king&amp;rsquo;s men will fight to death for him, regardless of the fact that even the king is a fierce fighter.&lt;br/&gt;This last battle takes place in a very strange land, long tunnels that are always changing to confuse anyone that wanders in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With similar mechanics as in &amp;ldquo;NiMeMo&amp;rdquo; you have to move your army around the board and try to eliminate your opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces by blocking them.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as you eliminate the other&amp;rsquo;s king you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D&amp;eacute;dalo (in Spanish) comes from Daedalus. In Greek mythology Daedalus was a skilful craftsman and artisan. The Labyrinth on Crete was created by him.&lt;br/&gt;So as in this game we have an ever-changing labyrinth I decided to give it Daedalus&amp;rsquo; name on his honour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
