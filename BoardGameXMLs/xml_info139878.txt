							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cimarron Strip</name>
									
			<description>The game is based on a TV show in the 1960's. Players are racing to claim territory in the strip of land between Kansas and the Indian Territory in the old west. There are 23 territories (areas) in the Cimarron Strip which are now open for claiming. Movement is by a spinner. Players start with a stand-up playing piece showing a cowboy and 7(?) claim tokens. The board consists of a map of the 23 areas, the starting area outside the Cimarron Strip, and paths connecting everything. Each area has one red space that the players must land on to claim the area. If 2 players land on the same spot there is a gunfight using a deck of &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;miss&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
