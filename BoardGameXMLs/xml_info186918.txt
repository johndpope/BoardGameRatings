			<description>Each of the 2-4 players control 3 pins carrying replaceable tokens. There are 12 tokens numbered from 1 to 12. The players move their pins on the board horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When 2 pins from 2 different players are located diagonal next to each other their tokens can be exchanged. The game ends when all pins reached their destination. Each player sums up the values of the tokens his pins are holding. The winner is the player which has achieved the highest sum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
