			<description>Crafty Cut is a unique puzzle game which allows the player to explore the relationship between 2D and 3D geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an intuitive cutting mechanic, the player is tasked with revealing new 2D facets from an increasingly complex array of 3D shapes, delivered through &amp;lsquo;Easy&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Tricky&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Fiendish&amp;rsquo; level progression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level presents a target shape which must be revealed within a set number of moves from a specific 3D object. Performance is based on the quality of the match and graded on a three-star criteria: correct number of sides, correct internal angles, and correct length of sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game aims to give students a hands-on experience of manipulating 3D objects, breeding familiarity with the names and properties of 2D and 3D shapes and creating confidence with them generally. The broader aim is to make maths less intimidating by presenting it in a fun and visually arresting way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player progresses through the game, new materials are unlocked for use in the creative sandbox. Sandbox mode allows the student to cut, sculpt and craft their own shapes for sharing with other students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was inspired by the geometry covered in the Common Core Standards and developed in collaboration with the Amplify Math Curriculum Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crafty Cut has been rolled out to a number of US schools as part of the Amplify pilot programme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
