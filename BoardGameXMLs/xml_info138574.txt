			<description>This is not a Memory game variation but it does require a good memory to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a board on which there are a number of circles. Five of these circles show a Pancake Monster. Each player has a quantity of Pancake Tiles and these are placed on your board. The Pancake Monsters must be covered carefully so that the Monster cannot be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;in a turn, a player may lift up a Pancake Tile from the player on his left. If it does not reveal a Pancake Monster, the tile is taken and put on your own board. You may then continue your turn by taking a Pancake Tile from the board of the next player to your left. And so on, until a Pancake Monster is revealed. The tile must be replaced and the turn is over. Now the next player can play accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need a good memory because it is bad to reveal a monster and as they get revealed and recovered, players should get some idea of which tile not to look under.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to completely fill their board with Pancake Tiles, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
