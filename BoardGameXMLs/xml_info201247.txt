							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poking the Emperor</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the players take on the roles of courtiers in the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s palace. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s health is precarious, but the business of court &amp;ndash; and running the empire &amp;ndash; continues nonetheless. In each turn, the courtiers attend to these affairs of state, and curry favour with the Emperor. This favour can be translated into official titles and positions in the bureaucracy, into standing at court, or just into shiny shiny gold. The various courtiers may also try to adjust the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s moods, health and sanity in various ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary role taken by the Games Master is that of the Emperor. As such, the Games Master is encouraged to lounge in the comfiest chair in the house (if you have, as you should, a divan or throne, then those are ideal. A beanbag will do in a pinch), and the players are encouraged to bring him treats, make him coffee/tea/cocktails, flatter him outrageously and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
