			<description>A trivia game aimed mainly at foreign learners of English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 110 cards contain questions about the English language and about England, the US and Australia (arts, politics, geography,...). There are six questions per card, and all questions are written in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled. A card is drawn and the active player rolls a six-sided die to select which of the six questions from the card he/she has to answer. The player next to the active player reads the question and the three suggested answers. If the active player answers correctly, he/she earns a number of chips corresponding to how difficult the question is. (Questions are marked with 1-3 little squares; one square signifies an easy question that earns you one chip, three is for a difficult question.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has collected 13 chips. He/she wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
