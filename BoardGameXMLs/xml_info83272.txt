			<description>Soletrando is a spelling game based on the Soletrando TV Show. It can be played both as a videogame or as a boardgame. The goal of the game is to correctly spell more words than other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each match has 5 rounds. The 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th rounds are played like this: in your turn, the player on your left chooses a card based on your age and level (1 or 2). You must correctly spell the word, including hyphens. At any time you can ask for a tip. The player on your left must read the definition of the word. If you don&amp;acute;t make any mistakes, put a token in the column for the current round. The only difference in the 3rd round, is that a dice must be played to determine the level of the word for spelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
