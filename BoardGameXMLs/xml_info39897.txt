			<description>This game is a loose adaptation of the game Rummikub to the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of each round is to empty your hand by making melds to the table. On each player&amp;rsquo;s turn, the player must either make one or more melds to the table or draw a tile from the draw pile and add it to his hand. When one player has emptied his hand (by making melds), the round is over and is scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
