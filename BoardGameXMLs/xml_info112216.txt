			<description>Super Bases Loaded is a Super NES baseball video game. This game is known as Super Professional Baseball (スーパープロフェッショナルベースボール) in Japan.The game is the fifth overall installment of the Bases Loaded series, and first installment of the secondary series for the Super Nintendo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player loses a game, the player is disqualified and he/she is sent back to the title screen to try again on the lowest level of play. When the player wins the game however, the game gives the player a score between 0 and 100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting 100 once takes you to the toughest level, where getting the perfect 100 score again means that the player has defeated the game and credits start to appear. Achieving a score lower than normal, gets the player demoted to a lower level and a stern message from the invisible drill instructor that is the game. However, getting a higher score than normal gets the player promoted to the next level and admirations from the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advertising in the game consists of spoofs from actual companies that were in existence in the early 1990s. The language of the advertisements are in English in the North American version while the Japanese version (called Super Professional Baseball) has most of its advertisements in Japanese. In addition to this, home run messages appear in either English or Japanese, depending on what version the player has. The player has two edit teams and he/she can edit the names of the player and career statistics in an attempt to either improve the batter/pitcher or to deliberately make him perform worse on the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams&lt;br/&gt;    Atlanta Amoebas&lt;br/&gt;    Boston Buzzards&lt;br/&gt;    Chicago Cyclops&lt;br/&gt;    New York Mercs&lt;br/&gt;    Philadelphia Hawks&lt;br/&gt;    Washington Weasels&lt;br/&gt;    Hawaii Islanders&lt;br/&gt;    Kansas City Kings&lt;br/&gt;    Los Angeles Lizards&lt;br/&gt;    Seattle Storm&lt;br/&gt;    Texas Tornados&lt;br/&gt;    Utah Stars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can also edit their own team in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Bases Loaded&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
