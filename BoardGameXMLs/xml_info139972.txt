							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antagonists</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magi of the Order of Hermes often come to the attention of other inhabitants of Mythic Europe. Some see them as a threat, others as a target, still others as an opportunity. Some even want to help the magi to better integrate themselves into society. These might be mundane humans, supernatural creatures, or other magi, but they all have one thing in common. They're nothing but trouble. This book presents ten developed antagonists for use in your saga. Each antagonist can support an entire saga arc, and the struggle with any of them could become the defining feature of your covenant's history. Whether you like politics, investigation, or straightforward battles, there's an antagonist for you within this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
