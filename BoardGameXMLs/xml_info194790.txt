			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game transpires in a science fiction genre.  It was published as a series of forum posts on a competition page.  Characters utilize a series of &amp;quot;wormholes&amp;quot; to travel vast distances through the galaxy.  All characters in the game are combat pilots of spacecraft.  Characters select a species, one of which can perform a &amp;quot;hive mind&amp;quot; method of communication with all the characters in the party.  Characters also have a Role (e.g. Soldier, Rebel, Martyr) and Attributes, including Physique, Intellect, and Psyche.  These have numeric values assigned from a point pool, with scores ranging from 1-6.  Characters also have several derived Statistics (Attributes) and Skills.  A special type of Skill is called a Song, which is somewhat like a minor spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
