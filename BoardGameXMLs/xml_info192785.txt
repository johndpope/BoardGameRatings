							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polynesian Voyage</name>
									
			<description>Polynesian Adventure is a fun and educational board game for families. The game is a voyage through the Pacific Ocean visiting several of the islands of Polynesia. Players race to the island of Hawaii as they learn about numbers, islands in Polynesia and life in the Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Every player starts their Pacific island voyage at the bottom of the board game. To advance, each player draws a card in turn and follows the directions provided on the cards. Number cards have varying amounts of fish on them, along with the accompanying numeral to help children learn to count and associate numerals with the counting. The player then uses that number to follow the fish along the path. There are also &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; cards in the deck. These cards can instantly transport a player to an island or move other players around the board. For example, the &amp;quot;Hurricane&amp;quot; card moves the player at the front of the game back six spaces. There are also bonus spaces on the board that allow players to take shortcuts on their voyage or to lose turns. The first player to arrive in Hawaii wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
