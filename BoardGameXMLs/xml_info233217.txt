							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twelve Labors of Hercules</name>
									
			<description>A card game for 2-4 players themed around the adventures of the demigod Hercules.  Each player tries to complete the most labours and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a circular track divided into 12 spaces representing 12 countries or locations visited by Hercules. Each space has a specific set of instructions such as draw 1 card or take the top card of discard, draw two cards, next turn roll 2 dice to move and pick 1 etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 common decks of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Labours deck has 12 cards representing the 12 labours of Hercules. Each has 3 to 6 requirements needed to complete it. The deck is constructed so that the easier labours come into play before the more difficult ones. Only four labours are revealed at a time &amp;ndash; every time a labour is completed the next card in the deck is flipped over as a replacement.&lt;br/&gt;     The Adventure deck is similar to the Labours deck but easier. Each adventure only needs 1 or 2 requirements to complete it. The Adventure deck is kept face-up. &lt;br/&gt;     The Hero Deck - each card provides 1 or 2 of the requirements needed to complete labours and adventures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 2 hero cards and take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Roll 1D6 and move that many spaces in either direction. If you land on an opposing player steal 1 random Hero card from his hand and skip the action and labour phases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If you did not land on another player, follow the instructions on the board space you entered. If you land on the Mediterranean you may complete the top face up Adventure card by discarding Hero cards with the necessary requirements. If completed, place the Adventure card in your Victory Pile. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labour Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You may complete a revealed labour by discarding Hero cards with the &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;necessary requirements. When completed place the labour card in your Victory Pile. &lt;br/&gt;Each Labour can only be completed if your pawn is in a specific space on the track (e.g. the Lion of Nemea can only be conducted in Greece, the Wild Mares of Diomedes in Thrace, the Golden Apples of Hesperides in Africa etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Once one player has completed a Labour it is finished and is no longer available to other players to complete.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all 12 labours have been completed. The player with the most labour points, gained by completing labours and adventures, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
