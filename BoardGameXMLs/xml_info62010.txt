							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Clan of Wretches</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wretchers - warped and twisted clanspeople living on the fringes of civilisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exiled to the wastes and remote moorlands, the wretch are nomads forced to wander in the wilderness as they seek out new pastures for their herds.  Sometimes launching raids into the frontiers of the civilised lands, frequently ambushing merchant caravans and explorers, these primitive wretch are a nuisance that cannot be ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But primitive doesn't mean stupid.  These wretch produce art - or graffiti - and strange drum-music that only the most sophisticated of the civilised races fully appreciates.  They may worship the spirits of their ancestors, but this doesn't mean they are lacking in divine power; they may be nomads, but this doesn't mean their society is in any way simplistic.  A summary of their art, music and castes is necessary to understand these complex and enigmatic creatures and their clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here we provide outlines and definitions for three new, related humanoid races at the Heroic Tier for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 4th Edition.  With numerous statistic blocks, new and strange powers, background information and suggestions for playing wretch Player Characters, the wretcher are a solid and vivid addition to your D&amp;amp;D campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
