			<description>Stepping Stones and Stumbling Blocks is a religious card game in which players try to collect Treasure in Heavens. The game is played in a circle with players changing seat order according to the instructions on the cards the draw. Some cards allow players to take a Treasure in Heaven card, others require them to move lower or higher in the circle. Some cards require a player to sit in a special &amp;quot;Last Chair&amp;quot; which requires a repentance action to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when one player has collected 5 Treasures in Heaven Cards - although the number of cards required to win is left open to players to shorten or lengthen the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
