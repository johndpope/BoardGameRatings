			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were defeated. We were without hope. The Enemy took everything from us. Our pride, our dignity. Everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We ran. Helpless and alone, we ran from our Enemy, hoping they would forget us. And then, when we were sure we were out of their sight and memory, we realized we should have let them finish what they began. We wandered the world with only our fear to guide us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were dying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then, we found something that restored our hope. Like an oasis in an unforgiving desert, we found shelter from our despair. We found a reason to live again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We found you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of years later, hidden among your masses, we thought we had escaped the Enemy. But then, on the fringes of the Reign, we heard tales of a wretched dragon race calling themselves &amp;quot;kobolds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that was when we knew... the Enemy had found us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     * *&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy began as a series of articles in Kobold Quarterly Magazine reinventing the &amp;ldquo;standard races&amp;rdquo; in fantasy roleplaying. Now, those same articles have been expanded and revised (five times their original size!) and fit with the PATHFINDER Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living as invisible allies within the Reign of Men, the kuba-chubisi have been invisible alies of mankind for centuries. But now, an ancient foe has returned and sent a greeting card of sorts to the kuba-chubisi. The twisted, disgusting race that calls themselves &amp;quot;kobolds.&amp;quot; A reminder of the defeat the kuba-chubisi suffered thousands of years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reign of Men can no longer protect them. In fact, the Reign of Men may not be able to protect itself. And so, the kuba-chubisi debate whether or not to disclose their co-existance, fearful that men will turn their backs on their ancient ally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy Kobolds: The Invisible Allies contains everything you need for a new kind of &amp;quot;kobold.&amp;quot; A master of philosophy and magic, sacred geometry and the most ancient arts. They are true city shamans, shapers of mankind through philosophy and ideas. It includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     FULL COLOR AND FULLY ILLUSTRATED!&lt;br/&gt;     New Kobold Racial Traits&lt;br/&gt;     New Feats that allow you to be the invisible master of cities&lt;br/&gt;     New Fighter Archetype: The Savu-Kaven (Sin of the Sword)&lt;br/&gt;     New Kobold Only Core Class: The mahsh-Ahtahd (Master of the City)&lt;br/&gt;     And new details on the Secret History of the Known World, including more on The Enemy: the ancient foe mankind has never seen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
