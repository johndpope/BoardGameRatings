			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkfall is a fantasy, massively multiplayer online roleplaying game which features 6 races organized in three factions. You can choose to play as a Dark Elf, an Orc, a Wolf Man, a Human, a Forest Elf or a Dwarf. You have personal physical attributes, namely, Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Vitality and Quickness. There is also the Alignment attribute which also plays an important role in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkfall differs from conventional MMORPGs in the way that it does not feature level advancement. Rather, it is strongly based on skill and proficiency progression which enables you to do a wide variety of endeavors, based on the skills you choose to advance. Such endeavors range from simple things such as swimming all the way to crafting deployable mounts, ships, cannons and magical siege devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Darkfall you can also witness the excitement, (or terror), of unlimited PVP with a full loot parameter. There are no areas entirely safe from potential attack from other players. &lt;br/&gt;You can participate in epic battles when raiding or assaulting player owned settlements or pre-made cities, or defending them from enemy onslaught. &lt;br/&gt;You can join clans, fight non-player monsters, test your abilities in land based and sea based conflict and explore a vast world, one of the largest created to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
