			<description>てづま師 (Tezuma Master) is a trick-taking game themed on &amp;quot;tezuma&amp;quot;, or traditional Japanese magic/sleight of hand such as making a butterfly made of paper fly through the air. Each player secretly chooses one of three scoring cards for themself at the start of the round, and that determines how they'll score for the cards that they've taken. Each player also has a few special power cards that they can use when desired, and each of the four suits has a single trump card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
