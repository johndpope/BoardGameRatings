			<description>This card game is featured in the December, 2008 issue of GAMES magazine on page 86 and is part of the series &amp;quot;new card games according to Doyle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use their color of cards to make five in a row. Each player starts out with either the red or black half of the deck and attempt to make five in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally with their color. Each player can use their cards to build in a direction or block an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
