			<description>Summary from the box:&lt;br/&gt;The race is on! Can you escape the volcano and reach safety evading the Tyrannosaurus Rex as it stalks across the board and without falling prey for the many other prehistoric pitfalls as you go. Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;A monster game for 2-4 players aged 6-adult&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game description:&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple children's game similar to snakes and ladders but with the added twist of a T-Rex. The board has a linear path where players all start from a common starting point and move towards a common ending point. Along the way there are special spots where the player can move forward / backward automatically (ala snakes and ladders), miss a turn, throw again, or cause the T-Rex to move.&lt;br/&gt;The T-Rex twist involves a T-Rex token that starts somewhere in the middle of the board. A player rolls his die and moves the number of spaces as indicated on the die (again just like snakes and ladders). He then moves the T-Rex backwards or forwards the same number of squares as he wishes. If the T-Rex is moved to the same spot as another player, that player falls back 12 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;In this way, turn by turn, players try to advance to the end while at the same time try to use the T-Rex to stomp on their opponents and make them fall back.&lt;br/&gt;The first player who reaches the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
