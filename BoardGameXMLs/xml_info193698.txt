							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chosen Men: Military Skirmish Games in the Napoleonic Wars</name>
									
			<description>Chosen Men is a set of fast-action skirmish rules detailing the bloody skirmishes between light troops in the Napoleonic Wars. The primary focus of the game is on soldiers and NCOs in light &amp;quot;flank&amp;quot; companies, as they scout ahead of larger forces and take part in man-to-man actions against enemy skirmishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game allows for the formation of accurately sized companies of light infantry and cavalry if you wish, these formations are broken down into small groups of up to a dozen men. For the most part, officers are not swashbuckling super-heroes, but staunch commanders who rally and direct their men to achieve the battlefield objectives. Although the games uses an alternating action turn sequence, officers can use their influence to multiple units at the same time in an effort to steal the initiative. With all rolls resolved using standard 6-sided dice, this game combines a classic wargaming feel with modern wargame mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
