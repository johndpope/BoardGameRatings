							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Habits</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a level 13 party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuan-ti sovereign Erut-Ro spent his life enslaving free nations, subjugating masses, and ruling with an iron fist... and continued to do so in death when he became a terrifying mummy lord! Erut-Ro&amp;rsquo;s reign of oppression ended when a powerful group of warriors sealed the mummy and his pyramid away in another dimension for 3,000 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, three millenia later, the mummy lord's pyramid has suddenly sprung back into existence! One might think 3,000 years spent sealed away from society would settle Erut-Ro&amp;rsquo;s sadism, but, as they say, old habits are hard to break. The mummy lord intends to start right where he left off... as soon as he recovers his full power. The party must contend with the ancient monsters that await them in his pyramid before they can wrap up the mummy lord&amp;rsquo;s evil plans for good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
