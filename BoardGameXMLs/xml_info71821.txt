			<description>A game of travelling theater companies in the Roman empire. Each player must try to perform in every city the best play according to the demands of the public and the festival it takes place there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in different rounds. Each round the players play cards in order (the first player will play the city of the performance, the second will play the festival and the third the public). Each city card, festival card and public card has associated a symbol and a number value. There are three different symbols for cities, three different for festivals and three different for publics. The number values are all from 1 to 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all the players have played their cards they must choose a plot to perform. They all have 6 plot cards to play, and every turn they play one and get a new one from the deck. Every plot is a combination of 3 symbols (one city symbol, one festival symbol and one public symbol). So the players get points for each symbol that matches the requirements stated at the beggining of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 12 rounds have been played the game ends and the player with a higher score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
