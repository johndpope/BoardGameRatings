			<description>From the rules on the back of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Try to pick up colourful morsels as many as possible from the platform and put them into the small cup. Kindly use chopsticks enclosed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the cup is placed at the top of the platform. The chopsticks are placed in the rings at the bottom of the platform. The wooden morsels are placed in the center. The first player spins the top and starts collecting the morsels with the chopsticks and places them in the cup. When the top stops spinning, the player stops. The cup is emptied and the score is added up. The board is then reset for the next player. The game continues until all players have had an equal number of agreed upon rounds. The player with the highest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points by colors:&lt;br/&gt;Green square (broccoli) = 15 points&lt;br/&gt;Yellow triangle (bamboo shoot) = 20 points&lt;br/&gt;Red circle (meat) = 30 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
