			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Explore &amp;amp; Discover Scottish Heritage &amp;amp; History. You don't have to be Scottish to enjoy the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 48 cards in each of five categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Myths &amp;amp; Legends;&lt;br/&gt;     Tartans &amp;amp; Clans;&lt;br/&gt;     Rhymes &amp;amp; Pastimes;&lt;br/&gt;     Regiments &amp;amp; Castles; and&lt;br/&gt;     People, Places &amp;amp; Events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a six-sided die with a different color on each face, plus a smaller set of cards called &amp;quot;The Sporran&amp;quot; and another called &amp;quot;The Laird's Castle&amp;quot;, both of which have special instructions on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his/her turn each player rolls the die and attempts to answer the question on a card in the category with the matching color. If successful, the player then draws a Sporran card and follows the directions there. This could be to roll the die again and answer another question, or proceed directly to the Laird's Castle. Cards in the Castle set have further instructions, or the game could end if the player turns up the &amp;quot;Chief's Badge&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When four or more players are involved, the instructions suggest forming teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
