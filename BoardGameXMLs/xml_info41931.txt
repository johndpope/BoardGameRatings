							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypt-O</name>
									
			<description>A unique game of guessing a hidden word.  There is a deck of 52 Letter Cards -- 2 of each letter, except 1 J and Q, 3 As and Es.  On the front it has the letter and its value (1-5), and on the back it has its value and all letters of that value: &lt;br/&gt;1 - AEIOU&lt;br/&gt;2 - HLNRY&lt;br/&gt;3 - CSTVX&lt;br/&gt;4 - BDFGZ&lt;br/&gt;5 - JKMPQW&lt;br/&gt;There are also 7 Clue Cards - &amp;quot;1st Letter&amp;quot; thru &amp;quot;6th Letter&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Any Letter&amp;quot;.  The game board has 6 spaces for cards with an elastic to hold them in place, and a scoring dial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dealer is chosen, who thinks of a word of 4-6 letters, takes the Letter Cards that spell it, and places them face down under the elastics, showing the points and possible letters of each.  The Crypt-O Number for the word -- twice the sum of its letter values -- is set on the dial.  Each other player is dealt a random Clue Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player either: asks a general yes/no question, asks a yes/no letter question (&amp;quot;is the 4th letter R?&amp;quot;), guesses the word, or gives the dealer his Clue Card and peeks at the front of the card indicated.  The turn continues until a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; is received or the Clue Card is used.  Whatever the answer, for each question the scoring wheel is decreased: for a general question, 1; for a letter question, the letter's value; for a wrong word guess, 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a letter is guessed it is turned face-up; if the word is guessed or the last card expose, the round ends.  To score, if the word wasn't guessed, the dealer scores its Crypt-O value, other wise the guesser gets the value on the scoring wheel and the dealer gets the Crypt-O value minus that amount; and each player gets 5 points for each Clue Card they hold.  If the word is unknown to half or more of the players, the round doesn't count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotate the dealer with each round; the game is won by the player who first hits 150 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
