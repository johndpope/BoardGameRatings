							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Calypso</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power of the elements, the fury of a goddess... Calypso!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 12 Rogue, Calypso is the fury of the sea personified! Calypso is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calypso is designated &amp;quot;Red&amp;quot; for her naturally occurring meta-human abilities. Before taking the name Calypso, she was known as Janet Brooke, a teenaged athlete growing up in a world filled with superhumans. Her worst nightmares were realized when her own latent meta-human abilities surfaced in a moment of panic, and her life came apart at the seams. In an extreme case of denial, she now claims she is the goddess Calypso, and is always ready to unleash her mad fury upon any heroes unlucky enough to cross her path. In her hysteria she is a threat to everyone around her, though she is most likely to focus her wrath on heroes who are known to have special powers or who might have a personal connection to her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
