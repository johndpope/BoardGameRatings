			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Monday morning, the police chief calls you into his office. You figure you're probably going to get your chops busted for something again. When you enter, you see the police chief, some other grizzled veteran officers and some pencil-neck accountant-looking guy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The police chief puffs on his cigar and nods at the pencil-neck who coughs at the smoke and says, &amp;quot;We have a situation. There appears to be a rash of crime throughout Metro City that might be related in some way. It looks bad for the mayor, and it's an election year. We need this taken care of now, and we need this taken care of quietly.&amp;quot; It's almost cute how the nerdling's voice cracks when he tries to sound tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
