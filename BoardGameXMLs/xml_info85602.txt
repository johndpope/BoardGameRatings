							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flip&#039;s Twisted World</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip&amp;rsquo;s Twisted World is a platform-puzzle game for the Nintendo Wii. The game centres around Flip, a wizard&amp;rsquo;s apprentice that is sucked into a demented universe inside a forbidden spellbook. In order to escape he must make his way through six worlds and collect the chapter stones in order to return home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is typical for a platformer, as the player must make their way through a number of levels by jumping between platforms and avoiding enemies, but Flip is in control of a magical cube. By turning the cube, Flip can rotate the world on its side and potentially open up new paths. Flip can also collect five tools that will aid him in his quest, and there are a number of characters that interact with the player &amp;ndash; some helpful and some dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
