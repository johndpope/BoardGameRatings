			<description>Defending the Reich is an operational level simulation of the epic night struggle between RAF Bomber Command and the Luftwaffe's  Nachtjagdflieger night-fighters during the critical period of 1943-1944. Players can play as the British and attempt to devastate as much of Germany as possible, while keeping bomber and aircrew attrition to safe levels, or can play as the German, and attempt to defend the Reich's cities from aerial destruction. . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a typical turn, the British player plans his raids, taking into account flak levels, bomb loads, routes, and active night fighter bases. The Germans can organize their gruppen with different type of aircraft squadrons, and upgrade aircraft types. Once RAF intruders have crossed the radar line, the German player must discern between spoof missions and main force raids, and launch his interceptors to knock as many bombers out of the sky as possible. The game includes rules for technology upgrades, He219 advanced night fighters, Schrage musik weapons, firestorms, ace pilots, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
