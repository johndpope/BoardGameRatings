							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RoboCop (2002)</name>
									
			<description>RoboCop is a 2003 first person shooter released for the sixth generation home consoles. The only North American version available was released for the Xbox while the PAL region versions were released on all consoles except for Game Boy Advance. This was Titus Software's last game they developed, before they went bankrupt in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows the player to play as RoboCop and to uncover a sinister plot involving OCP, local gangsters dealing a deadly new synthetic drug and a powerful cyborg known only as MIND. As a last hope, RoboCop must capture, destroy, or arrest hostile characters in a desperate search for clues and evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received mostly negative reviews by critics; GameSpot rated it 2.2/10, the official Xbox Magazine UK, rated it a mediocre 5.9/10, GamerFeed gave it a 2/5, XBN Magazine gave 2/10, and NTSC UK, rated it 3/10. The Scandinavian magazine Gamereactor gave the game 1/10 and called it &amp;quot;the worst videogame since Superman 64&amp;quot; (also from Titus Software).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;RoboCop&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
