							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Theodore Tugboat Rootin&#039; Tootin&#039; Card Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Players flip their cards over one at a time.  Who sees the pair of matching cards?  Quick!  Toot the tooter so you can claim the pair!  But be sure they are identical matches before you toot.  If you make a mistake, you'll have to hand your cards over to your opponents.  The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you successfully toot the tooter you win all discarded piles and add them to your play stack.  Once someone runs out of play cards the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with an electronic bell and 54 large cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the characters from the Canadian based childrens television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Best Toy Award Gold Seal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
