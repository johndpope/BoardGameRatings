			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released for the home version of the popular arcade title Sega Bass Fishing, the fishing rod was a unique controller to release, especially in the US market.  Sega Bass Fishing however became a fast selling title because it showcased the graphical power of the Dreamcast and the fishing rod sold in droves with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only two titles officially supported the fishing rod (Sega Bass Fishing and Sega Marine Fishing) but due to some clever  people with possibly too much free time, it gained new life as a motion controller for Virtua Tennis and Soul Calibur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
