							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exalted Domains of Light and Lore</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exalted Domains are a new option that grants clerics a truly special and unique connection to one aspect of their deity&amp;rsquo;s power in exchange for one of their domains. Rather than draw bonus powers and spells from two domains, the cleric with an Exalted domain has a greater focus on a single domain, and can utilize powers not available to any other character. Exalted domains can be used to create clerics with a special place of honor within the church, a renegade who may even be seen as a heretic by the organized worship of his deity, or a unique foe that has a surprise in store for the PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genius Guide to Exalted Domains of Light and Lore focuses on the domains most often associated with gods of knowledge, good, aid, and assisting a group. If you want to create a specially blessed healer, a sage of divine lore, a stalwart guardian of the temple, or a craftsman tasked with creating the relics of the gods, these Exalted domains provide a quick, easy, balanced method for doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
