			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;A Game of Yum Yum Dessert Grabbing and Sweet Sweet Deduction&lt;br/&gt;Oh NO! The Mistress of the house is gone, and all the lights just went out! But&amp;hellip; the door to the dessert closet was left wide open! All the yum-yum goodies are for the taken! Under the cover of darkness, the household pets are scrambling to grab their favorite desserts. But who are those rascals? It&amp;rsquo;s up to the famous De-cat-ive Furlock Holems to uncover their identities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cookie Mookie is a set-collection micro-game with element of mystery for 2-4 players. Players are assigned a character role, with the goal to get the highest points to win the game. However, players are encouraged to keep their goal a secret, else they can be worked against you. The game is split into 4 short phases, the Setup, the Grab, the Swap, and the Deduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn, quick to play. A great game for the whole family, or the sweet lovers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=======&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short description of the game-play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First desert cards are dealt out on the able in a grid. Each player are handed a character role. Each role have particular type of desserts that they love, which would score them bigger points, as well ones they dislike, which give the negative points. Each player then takes turn plucking cards from the grid. After each player have a certain number of cards, they then swap one card with their adjacent players. If there is detective character in game, they get to deduce other player&amp;rsquo;s role. Else the turn ends, and the score are counted up to see who is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strategy comes at card picking phase. Not only do you want to be mindful of what other are pick, but also what you pick, so to get the max points, but without giving yourself away. This allow you fool other during the card swapping, so go give you a card that would better benefit you, while give them a card that might reduce their score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
