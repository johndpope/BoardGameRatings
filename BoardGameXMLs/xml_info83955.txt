			<description>From &amp;quot;Using the Magic Merchants Series:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Magical Merchants series is designed to help strike a balance between the necessities of theme and mechanics,  providing you with a series of detailed characters and locations that the players must interact with in order to get that crucial +1 dagger or potion of cure moderate wounds. Every release in the series is designed with the belief that magic stores and the people who run them should have just as much character and importance as the dragon the adventurers defeated in order to earn their gold. Rather than a simple exchange of gold, shopping for magic items can become an experience that reinforces the power and role of magic within the campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
