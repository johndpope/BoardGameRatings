			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fantasy role playing game, Quest, is designed to be an open-ended game system in which you, the Player, design your own Character conception. Virtually any fantasy concept is reproducible using Quest, although this may not seem to be the case at first glance. What makes Quest truly open-ended is the interaction between abilities. Imagination and cleverness are the watchwords for Quest. Along with some d6 and d20. We are constantly trying to improve the system, and any suggestions you have are welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The precise effects of Spells and abilities are, for the most part, left up to the discretion of the Game Master. This philosophy will allow the Game Master to control the game more easily, and will allow the Game Master to tailor the rules to his or her campaign. Some of the effects are discussed in detail, because of their importance to game balance. The Game Master may use these as a guide for making decisions concerning other effects, but he or she should not feel constrained by these discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Players and Game Masters should note that unlike most fantasy role playing games, reasonably high levels of technology are possible within the system. If the Game Master or Players feel too uncomfortable, they may, of course, agree to eliminate the Technical skills, although this is NOT recommended. The Game Master could set the campaign upon a mineral-poor world as a limit the technological expansion, but technology adds a great deal to a game and is necessary when reproducing some fantasy concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
