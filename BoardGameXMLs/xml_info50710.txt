							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">End of the World: Three Cases of Climatic Confrontation</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS COULD BE IT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's right! This could be the end for your band of investigators as they are faced with three climactic confrontations with the ultimate evil that is the Cthulhu Mythos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will it come in a small Georgia town where dark things lurk in the heart of the woods and in the heart of one who should be long dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will it come in the bloody hell of the Honduran conflict, at the hand of bandits and revolutionaries - or in the cindering corruption that but awaits an ancient call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or will it come in the cold, abyssal depths of space, on a world infected with an alien virus of such inimical intent that the very fabric of space and time will be threatened?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions and more will be answered as you delve into the pages of End of the World, a book of campaign-climaxing scenarios for the Call of Cthulhu role playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scenarios, written by three of the most prolific Cthulhu writers, will challenge any group of experienced players as they are pitted against threats which will require all their talents, skills, and intelligence to survive and emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
