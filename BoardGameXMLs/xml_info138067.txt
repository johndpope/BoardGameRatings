							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giraffalaff Limbo</name>
									
			<description>The Giraffalaff Limbo will have your preschoolers howling with laughter as they try to limbo alongside the ticklish Giraffalaff giraffe. A quick spin of the wheel reveals which silly animal's walk you'll have to do under the limbo bar--whether it's the bird walk or the crab walk. Just make sure not to knock down Giraffalaff or he'll go into a frenzy of giggles, and you'll be out of the game! Designed for children ages three and up, this limbo set is a fun and activity-filled game that will keep your child engaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
