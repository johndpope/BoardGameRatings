							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightingdell Village</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wilderness is full of ruined villages, destroyed by war, famine or time. Many adventurers and travellers seek shelter by their crumbling walls. But beware those who rest in the ruins of Nightingdell Village - for at night the village returns to life, and who can say if the spirits that inhabit it are friendly...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightingdell Village is a printable battemap compatible with any RPG game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightingdell Village is a day &amp;amp; night set, comprising 20x20 2 battlemaps. One map depicts the village of Nightingdell as an overgrown ruins, with vines and ivy growing over walls and tombstones. The other depicts the village at night, where an ancient curse has returned it to the world of the living. A church, houses, blacksmith and small tavern are features of the settlement. A small map of the cave below the well is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightingdell Village is ideal for spooky Halloween adventures. Perhaps the party rest in the ruins, only to find it's changed at night. Or they arrive at the village to rest, and awaken in ruins. It's also ideal for adventures with time travel, or a village stuck outside of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
