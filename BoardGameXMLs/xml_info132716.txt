							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peterchens Mondfahrt</name>
									
			<description>The game features a race to the Moon, to retrieve the sixth leg of the May Beetle. This is a well-known German fairy story by Gerdt von Bassewitz (1873 - 1923).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board (which is very beautiful) depicts a winding track, running from Little Peter's house to the moon. Movement is decided by a spinner which has seven sections, one to six as usual plus a Sandman section. If the Sandman is spun, the player will get an extra turn (spin again and move and then a second spin and move).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start each player receives 6 apples which will be needed on the journey. On the path you will collect cards featuring four Nature-Spirits; Thunder, Water, Storm and Little Star. In the latter part of the game you will use these cards to advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various spaces might demand apples to pass. Generally  you will get a choice, pay X apples to carry on or wait until you land exactly on the space and then you pay less appels. At the end of the game, after you have been fired on to the moon by a cannon (really!), if you get asked for apples and you have none left, you are out of the game. Conservation of your apples is critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to reach the May Beetle's leg, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
