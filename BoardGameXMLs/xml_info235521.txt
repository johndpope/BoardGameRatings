							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Detailed Things to Find in a Dungeon (PFRPG)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons are common in many fantasy settings. To make dungeons more interesting, appear occupied, puzzle players and potentially disguise things that are important with things that aren't, dressings should be added to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are 100 different things that can be found in a dungeon. Some are valuable, some are puzzling and some are just plain weird. Players may think that these are important, given that they are described in detail, but none are unless the GameMaster decides otherwise. All should help make a dungeon seem more alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pickaxe - A large, sturdy pickaxe is for some reason deeply embedded in the flagstones here. Removing it will require success at a DC 20 Strength check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one page the front matter, one page the introduction and ads and one page the Open Game License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a system neutral version. The latter is a bit shorter and doesn't have the Pathfinder stats for some items. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
