							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Weser√ºbung: The Invasion of Norway</name>
									
			<description>Operation Weser&amp;uuml;bung: The Invasion of Norway covers the German invasion of Norway in 1940 during World War II. The game covers all aspects of the invasion, including land, naval, and air operations as well as the British and French involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Weser&amp;uuml;bung is a two-player or three-player game, with one player taking the Germans and the other player or players taking Norway and Great Britain/France. The game is regimental scale with each hex representing approximately 20-25 kilometers with turns representing four days. The combat system is roll-to-hit and the entire game system is based on the system from World War II in the West. This game is also a preview of what the system for World War II in the West: Ultimate Edition will look like when it is published in late 2007. Turn phases include the Air Phase, the Naval Phase, the Combat Phase, the Movement Phase, and the End Phase. The game includes everything from air interception to naval-air combat, from parachute drops to amphibious assaults. While the game strives to be an accurate simulation, the level of enjoyment and ease of play is also a priority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a medium to low complexity and should be easy to learn relatively quickly. The game can take approximately 5-8 hours to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Weser&amp;uuml;bung contains approximately 225 mounted counters in easy-to-cut strips. All historical land and naval units are represented in the game and individually identified. Divisional leaders are also included as well as an Admiral. All ships larger than a destroyer are individually identified and included, and air units are divided into counters representing a few squadrons of each type of aircraft. The Germans can call on the Messerschmitt Bf109 E, Messerschmitt Bf110 C, Junkers 87, Heinkel 111, and Junkers 52 during the game, while the Allies have a few Gloster Gladiators, Fairey Swordfish, Vickers Wellingtons, Capronis, and Hawker Hurricanes to try to stop the invasion. All air units have images of the aircraft on the counter while naval units have the historical profiles of the ship represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters are all two step and as shown in these pictures, have values on the top and bottom edge of the counter. Thus, the facing of the counter is important. This is similar to the system used in Distant Foreign Fields but a departure from the Second Edition of World War II in the West. Look for this feature in the Ultimate Edition of this latter game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 4 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 12-15 miles / 20-25 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Regiments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;Three 12 x 18&amp;quot; full color mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;Ten single-side printed non-diecut counterstrips (240 5/8&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 24-page Operation Weserubung spiral-bound rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One Player Aid card&lt;br/&gt;Two 10-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2-3 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 5-8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
