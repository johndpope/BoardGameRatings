							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Targ</name>
									
			<description>Targ was a successful 1980 game by Exidy. The game depicts vehicular combat in a future world. The locale is described by the game cabinet as &amp;quot;The Crystal City&amp;quot;: it is a simple 9x9 grid of roads demarcated by rectangular buildings. The player, piloting the Wummel, which looks like a small green car, maneuvers through the maze trying to shoot enemies and avoid collisions. None of the enemies shoot back. Their sole means of killing the player is ramming in to him. Despite this, the game is quite challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the enemies consist of angry-looking red wedges, or &amp;quot;Targs&amp;quot;. Occasionally, a small cyan-colored &amp;quot;Spectar Smuggler&amp;quot; will appear; shooting this is worth a significant point bonus. When all the enemies have been destroyed, a bonus is awarded and a new round starts. If the player takes too long to clear the board, the speed of the Targ ships increase until they are traveling faster than the player's Wummel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targ sold well enough to spawn a more elaborate sequel, Spectar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Targ (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
