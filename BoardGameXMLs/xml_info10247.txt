			<description>For those players of 'Risk', Axis &amp;amp; Allies, etc. here's a different approach to contend with. In the year '2026', Ireland is the setting for a truly 'New' &amp;amp; novel game presentation. Despite it's 'English' sounding name, you &amp;amp; your opponent are vying for control of the 'Emerald Isle' in this fast paced, futuristic contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components for this game consist of the following: a Colorful Gameboard; a set of RULES(4-Pages); 2-Sets of plastic Miniatures(including Jets, Helicopters, Tanks, Hover-Tanks, Hover-Craft, Mobile-Rocket-Launchers, Mobile-Helo-Base, &amp;amp; Mech-Infantry); plastic 'chips'; 6-sided DICE; a Set of printed cardboard 'chits'; and 2-Sets of 'Casualty Cards'-one for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You might be pleasantly surprised at how relatively easy this game proceeds and there are bound to be comparisons made between it and others. This game stands on it's OWN merits for it's unique individuality, while providing a quick game on an otherwise 'touchy' subject. Each game will be different, since only after 'Set-up', THEN it will be determined which of the Players is going to begin the game! The 'Sequence of Play' is as follows: 1.Jet Combat-a)Air Superiority, or b)Bombing; 2.Movement; 3.Resolve Combat; 4.Collect Counters; 5.Purchase &amp;amp; place 'Chips'. Those folks with a limited group of 'gamers' available will be especially pleased with this, since it is designed for just 2-Players.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
