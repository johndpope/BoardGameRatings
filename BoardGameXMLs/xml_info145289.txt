							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunters, Inc. (ICONS)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a supervillain skips out on bail, there&amp;rsquo;s only one team of bounty hunters tough enough to bring them in: Hunters Inc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are they heroes?  Not exactly.  Are they villains?  Not precisely.  They play whatever role the GM needs.  Whether the PCs rely on them as allies, compete with them as rivals or fight them as enemies is completely up to the needs of the campaign.  For that matter they can be allies in one adventure and enemies in the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement details the members of Hunters Inc, the non-superpowered support staff who make their work possible, the weapons, vehicles and team tactics they use.  It includes a section on how they plan and execute missions, as well as an introductory adventure that lets the PCs play either for or against the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plain Brown Wrapper Games is proud to be able to put Jeff Boman's classic superhero supplement back in print at last!  It&amp;rsquo;s been unavailable for years, but now you can buy a copy and see what all the fuss was about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
