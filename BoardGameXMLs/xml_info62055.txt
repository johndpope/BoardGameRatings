			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasure Hunter Sourcebook is a supplement for use with the D20 Modern rules system. As its inspiration it takes such films as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider . In the style of these classic pulp-action adventure movies, intrepid heroes travel the globe in search of priceless and powerful artifacts. Rival treasure hunters lurk always nearby, waiting for any chance to steal the prize away from their competitors. Trap-ridden ruins and the dangerous animals that inhabit the wilderness are not the only dangers in the treasure hunter's path, however. Centuries-old secret societies vie for power behind the scenes, some looking to gain the knowledge of the world?s lost civilizations and others intending to keep it hidden for all time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasure Hunter Sourcebook contains a wealth of rules options for bringing this world of modern pulp adventure to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New advanced classes such as the retrieval specialist, scholar, priest and occultist.&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded rules for both divine and occult magic in the modern world, including spells and artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for traps, natural hazards, chases and other elements that make treasure hunting a dangerous occupation.&lt;br/&gt;     Background information on mysterious locations throughout the world and the secret organizations that seek to exploit or protect their secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
