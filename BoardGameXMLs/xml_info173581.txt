							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Temple of the Black Oracle</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temple of the Black Oracle is a low-level adventure. With a little tweaking it could even be a 0-level adventure. The locals having been noticing chickens and livestock missing or being drained of blood. Chowder, a local nuisance, was chasing some of the children away by the old Cursed Cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chowder, a mage by trade, fancies himself a priest. He's chosen to worship a black pudding that he has formed a relationship. He offers it blood from the animals and it seems to respond to the offerings. Together they form a horrifying sight. A thing of nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is up to the party to rid the area of this escalating threat. This could be the first step in a long adventuring career. Or the last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local region is missing many chickens. In recent weeks, cattle have been found drained of blood. And a group of children said they were chased by old man Chowder. Chowder has been problematic in the past. He's not been seen for a season. Some say he's worshiping the Black Oracle in the Cursed Cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
