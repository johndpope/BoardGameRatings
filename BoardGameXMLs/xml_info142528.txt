			<description>During the Wiener Spielefest, &amp;quot;Spieleberater&amp;quot;  move around to   explain games to the visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple cooperative game for kids: Move any pawn, but not the one moved by the previous player and not the one actually forbidden to the next hidden tile. Reveal it (it shows a part of a board game) and place it onto the appropriate picture. If you pass a clock symbol by moving, add 1 hour on the clock. All children win if completed all games before 9 &amp;quot;game hours&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;advanced competitive game for families: In addition, all players start with movement points they spend during their turn.  If a  player adds a picture tile, he will get 3 or 5 victory points (by chance). Moving tiles not spent count 1 victory point at the end in addition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was added to a description of recommended games available in Austria&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
