			<description>From the front of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chain fists, drill arms and tomahawks made of lightning were a regular feature of the 1970&amp;rsquo;s giant robot shows. The robots had names like Daitarn, Voltes V and Mazinger Z. They had personality and charisma of their own. Those towering heroes were shunned by the next generations in favor of more &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; mecha that emphasized the vehicular nature of the machines. Blazing swords were replaced by machine guns and guided missiles. We were no longer watching super heroes. We were watching wars. As fabulous and sophisticated as the new mecha shows are, some of us will always long for the super robots of days gone by. Nothing thrills like a huge, laser-edged disk hurling from a giant arm to cut right through the shoulder of some immense monstrosity because our hero screamed, &amp;ldquo;SPINNN... SAUCER!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Get out your dice and character sheets team! We&amp;rsquo;re going to return&lt;br/&gt;to the days of old when heroes were shot through impossibly complex&lt;br/&gt;networks of tunnels and trap doors to be deposited in the cockpits of massive warriors that enabled them to take on menaces that&lt;br/&gt;could wipe out skyscrapers with the sweep of an arm. Let&amp;rsquo;s work together to become a hero greater than ourselves. Let&amp;rsquo;s get&lt;br/&gt;out there and show those bastards the might of an ATOMIC PILEDRIVER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
