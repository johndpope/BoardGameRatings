			<description>Based off of Namco's arcade fantasy game that had a twingle of an RPG feel to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game plays very very loosely like Dungeon! but is even more basic. You move through each level of the dungeon to get a key. You roll a die for movement, take the shortest route towards the key, and after every roll (the game does not even have rooms or such), you have an encounter with a monster that you must fight. You get a treasure for each victory, and once you have the key, you can open the door that leads to the next level, and continue doing so on each level until you get to the 6th level where the princess is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
