							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Misericord(e)</name>
									
			<description>Being a record of the Good, Dutiful, and Hard-working Guildspeople of the Town Misericord. Written this year of our gods &amp;amp; Sovereign twelve-hundred and thirty-two and may it please the people of the Land, Empire and Goddess of Mystery to heare these tales as they are writ here as told to the gathered peoples of our Town Misericorde and those guestes which have cross&amp;rsquo;d our door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From The Back Of The Book:  Misericord(e) is a storytelling and role playing game meant for two to six people. It can be played in two to four hours in an evening, and can be played out over many sessions. As you play, you learn more about&lt;br/&gt;the town of Misericord and its inhabitants. The stories revolve around the members of the Guilds, but they meet many other people (and other beings!) in and around the town, so you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about and make up things about them, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find in this book what you will need to play. Read it through before you play, and gather the items you&amp;rsquo;ll need. Then settle in for a lovely evening with tasty food, amazing tales and good friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is meant to be played over many, many months. It is flexible, so it can be played by a different set of players from month to month&amp;mdash;play won&amp;rsquo;t stop if someone can&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play one to three tales in an evening. Record them right in the book, and then you can put it away until next time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
