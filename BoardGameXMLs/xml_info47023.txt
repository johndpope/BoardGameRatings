							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are about to be ten billion people on the Earth. Who&amp;rsquo;s going to miss a few?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of 2015. Mankind&amp;rsquo;s greed for wealth and knowledge has damned our collective souls. The Corporations have declared that human beings are a resource, to be used and discarded as they wish. Careless mages have released the demons of hell into the world, to prey upon human terror and suffering. Aliens from far stars have taken notice, and are preparing to harvest the entire human race for their own profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, we&amp;rsquo;re pretty much screwed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, a very few people have realized that there is a secret war for the future and destiny of mankind, and they are going to fight for all of us. Using their Martial Arts, Cyberware, Psionics, Super Powers and Magical Spells, they will throw themselves into the battle and save mankind, or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, yeah. That would be you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FIRST book in the new Inverted 20 System! High cinematic action, dozens of weapons, psionic disciplines, magical spells, super powers, pieces of cyberware, and martial arts abilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customize each and every piece of equipment, or buy it off the shelf... EVERYTHING can be modified to suit your needs and tastes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lavishly illustrated with the lovely ladies of our Hot Chicks products.  A mature game, for mature gamers.  Well, older ones, at least...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING!  Strong Language and Mature Themes.  Reader's Discretion is Advised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
