			<description>Operation Typhoon was the final attack the Germans launched at the end of 1941, in a desperate attempt to capture Moscow. When their offense ground to a halt, the Germans assumed the Soviets had run out of reserves &amp;ndash; but they were wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion kit for Battle for Moscow (second edition) allows players to extend the original, solitaire BattlessonTM game to early March, 1942, when the Spring thaw turned the countryside into a quagmire and brought the Soviet winter offensive to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This Expansion Kit is not a &amp;lsquo;stand alone&amp;rsquo; game. You must own a copy of Battle for Moscow (second edition) to use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of Players: 2&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 12 and up&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: approximately 50 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 2 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 8 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each unit is one German corps or Russian army, and each turn is approximately one to two weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Eight 5/8&amp;quot; square pieces&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Player aid mat overlay/extension&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 plastic High Tide token&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Set Up map / Designer's Notes by Frank Chadwick&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Rules sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
