			<description>Star Eagles is a&amp;nbsp;science fiction action game of futuristic space fighter combat that allows you the freedom to play out those battles seen in your favorite books, movies, and TV shows. Players control a squadron of 4-12 ships competing in exciting objective based missions which take place in space, moons, and in the atmosphere of planets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The game is&amp;nbsp;easy to learn, yet&amp;nbsp;tactically rich with many options that&amp;nbsp;provide variety without bogging down the pace of the game.&amp;nbsp; Players will build their squadron from variety of small craft ranging from nimble, yet fragile, light fighters all the way up to larger gunboats and corvettes. Although playable as one off missions, the game is intended to be played as a campaign where your pilots gain experience after each mission and you must manage your squadron resources.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another feature that sets the game apart is it has&amp;nbsp; an open source unit building system that lets you create your own ships. You can recreate your favorite ships from a book, RPG, movie, TV series, or create entirely new designs from your imagination.&amp;nbsp; If you prefer to jump right into the action, Ganesha has created a whole background world for you to play in, including beautiful detailed resin 1/285 scale miniatures representing the protagonists in the STAR EAGLES universe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
