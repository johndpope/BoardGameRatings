							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">And the Transport Empire</name>
									
			<description>From the One Page Wars game series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players compete to be the first to earn 100 credits by purchasing buses, trains, and planes and using them to transport passengers for hire between the seven cities on the hex grid mapboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of transport unit is rated for cost, movement and passenger capacity. There are a limited number of such units available: 10 aircraft, 5 buses, and 3 trains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the players can build a portion of the transportation system, as there are no train tracks marked on the board - the tracks may be purchased and placed by the players during the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
