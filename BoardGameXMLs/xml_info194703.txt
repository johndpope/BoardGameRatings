							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medieval Tannery</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 16 x 20 inch,battlemap of a Medieval Tannery , with Square, Hex and No Overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am running out of yellow dye. I need you to acquire buckthorn berries common to these woods. Be careful as the berries&amp;rsquo; color will fade if exposed to bright light and become useless to me. The yellow dye I can create from the buckthorns when mixed quickly with blue dye makes green dyed leather a possibility. &amp;mdash; Tanner Jasper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Tannery is a single level map of the interior of a tannery and the exterior of the surrounding area including a creek with a water wheel and a small bridge spanning the creek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Tannery is intended for use in fantasy or medieval historical era games. It is also useful in fairy tale and horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jasper&amp;rsquo;s Request:  A local tanner, Jasper, asks the group get him some buckthorn berries that he needs to dye leather green when combined with blue dye. He has a recent order for an entire suit of leather armor dyed green and his current supply of buckthorn is not sufficient. He can pay the group with silver pieces or barter in leather armor of red, blue, brown, or black color (He won&amp;rsquo;t trade the green color as it&amp;rsquo;s twice as expensive in dye cost, but will take silver rather than gold in exchange for the more expensive color).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the group returns from finding the buckthorn, they return to Jasper being accosted by knights of the medieval lord of the area. They capture Jasper and place him in chains. If confronted, the knights claim that Jasper is a traitor to their lord, charged with sedition by conspiring with rebels to overthrow the lord. The group can decide to let Jasper be captured, but they won&amp;rsquo;t get paid for getting the buckthorn. However, the knights likely won&amp;rsquo;t be convinced to give up Jasper without a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the group lets the knights take Jasper away, a local barker appears here to sell Jasper recently stripped tree bark from the forest. When told of Jasper&amp;rsquo;s capture he seems dismayed and asks for the help of the group in freeing Jasper. The barker offers a reward of gold for freeing him, an amount of money that seems absurd for one of his station considered by most to be merely a poor man&amp;rsquo;s lumberjack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group needs to decide to help free Jasper, ignore the request, or capture the barker who may be a rebel&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
