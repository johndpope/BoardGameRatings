							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crime Network: Cosa Nostra</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime Network is a fast-paced, gritty role playing game, set in the underworld of organized crime. Players control mobster characters as they rise through the ranks of the American Mafia. In the spirit of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, and The Godfather, players will work with and against each other in their pursuit of infamy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime Network favors simplicity, style, and fun. All of the rules presented in this book are designed to maximize these elements of play. Character creation is a breeze, and those who enjoyed our game &amp;quot;Terror Network&amp;quot; will find the same easy to use skill system. The skill groups in Crime Network are streamlined to better fit the genre, and we added a host of Shortcomings and Crime Skills to enhance the flavor of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime Network is a game of paranoia and suspense. Plots are fueled by character goals and inter-party conflict. This is the Mafia, after all. Players find themselves in a lot of heat if they are not careful... and even if they are, they can still end up dead. Sometimes players may be contracted to kill one another. In the mob, the person most likely to kill you is your best friend. You never know when you might get whacked in Crime Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Terror Network, you got a chance to play the good guys. With Crime Network, you now have the opportunity to walk on the wild side. So fire up the stove, cook a spicy arrabiatta sauce and a pot of linguini, and set the table for Crime Network!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
