							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Emden vs. Sydney</name>
									
			<description>Emden vs. Sydney is a tactical naval wargame for two players, based on a modified version of the classic rules first developed by Fletcher Pratt in the 1930s. The game simulates the Battle of Cocos that took place on November 9, 1914, between the German cruiser Emden and the Australian cruiser Sydney in the South Indian Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emden vs. Sydney is a simple, all-skill game in which players maneuver their ship on the floor and fire at the enemy to inflict damage. The Emden&amp;mdash;a raider that had captured or sank over 100,000 tons of shipping since the outbreak of hostilities&amp;mdash;met its end in the actual battle at the hands of the Sydney, a light cruiser with larger guns and superior range. The game is one of skill, as players not only use strategy in moving their ship, but also must direct and estimate the range of their gunfire towards the enemy. Good tactics&amp;mdash;and a good eye for directing fire&amp;mdash;can spell the difference between victory and defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
