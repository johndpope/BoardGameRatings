			<description>Make some noise - or not! Make the sounds of the animal cards you play, but don't be fooled by the silent cards! Start a donkey parade to catch the other players off guard, or skip someone's turn with a rooster card. The first player to play all their cards is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds with each player able to discard as many cards as possible from their hand on their turn. The first card played on a turn must be either the same color or the same animal as the face up card on the top of the discard pile. The following cards played on a player's turn must be the same animal as the first card discarded. Players may keep playing as many cards that they have that match. When discarding a card, a player must make the sound of the animal that is played with the exception of certain special action card rules. When a player cannot discard any card from their hand on their turn, they must draw one card from the draw pile. Their turn ends immediately, so they cannot use that card until their next turn. The first player who successfully discards all of their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Colors, Observation, Animals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
