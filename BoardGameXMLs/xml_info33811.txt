			<description>Hoppaspelet (English, The Jump Game) is a Swedish children's game based on the book and cartoon &amp;quot;Flugsoppan&amp;quot;. Every player takes on the role as young frogs that set out on a hunt for ant eggs. These eggs are to be used as the main ingredient in Mommy and Daddy Frogs' famous fly soup. The first player to return home with a jar 'o ant eggs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ant eggs are provided by the nabour &amp;quot;Herr Padda&amp;quot; (Mr Toad). When getting there you are just half way through, as you have to get back through all the dangers again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When leaping along the board the players may get &amp;quot;Hoppakort&amp;quot; (Jump cards). These cards may provide extra leaps, or perhaps some bad luck for you. But more important they can make a change of the weather. The weather guids the amound of leaps every frog may take in each turn until there is another change in the weather. Bad weather such as rain and mist will give you a slower pace. Nice and shiny weather will provide the frogs a quicker move towards the aim of delivering the ant eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
