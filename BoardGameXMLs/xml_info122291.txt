			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new collectible RPG in a Golden Age Superheroes vein: to play, you just need any set of the playbooks, with at least one per player. Each playbook gives you a pre-made character and all the rules needed to play them or to run the game for others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive story: the Secret Origin of... Miss Mob!&lt;br/&gt;Researcher Diana Darling was as astonished as anyone when the amazing plastic skin project she was working on came to life! To keep it out of military hands, she allowed the symbiote into her body, gaining incredible powers in return: an army of clones, each telepathically linked to all others, which she is able to create and reabsorb at will! But how long can she stay one step ahead of those who want the power for themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
