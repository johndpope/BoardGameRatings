			<description>From the Guide's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Eos Event Guide - Rest No More. Here you will find all the necessary information in relation to the site and anything else specific to the weekend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in your return pack should be the following items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Event Guide&lt;br/&gt;     Ticket&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you require an updated creature guide, please email us. If either of these items is missing then please contact us immediately and we will do our best to rectify the situation. If you are a new player and need any additional material, please just let us know. Most things are available from the website but we are more than happy go through any questions you might have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rest No More is the first event of 2010 for Hicks with Sticks. If you have any questions before the event just email and ask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have been to a Hicks with Sticks event before then you will know that the Saturday night meal is included in your ticket and that we have a licensed bar. The serving and opening times are in this guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any profits taken from the bar and food go back into the game and help us to keep the overall price of the ticket down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for your continued support and trust in us, hopefully you are enjoying our events and we can provide you with another great live role-playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
