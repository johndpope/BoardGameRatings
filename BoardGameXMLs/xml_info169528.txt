			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xcrawl, the game that can dance you to death with a Twerker Berserker&amp;copy;, is proud to present Dungeon Detonation 2014! Now powered by the mighty Pathfinder gaming engine, Xcrawl is more fun than ever! Tis another ultra fun challenge designed to make your players cry for mercy and laugh out loud in the same breath! Strap on your armor, cue your theme music, call your agent, and tell them to arrange you a date for the Grammies. It&amp;rsquo;s time for victory and your own line of action figures... or death. Or worse ...calling your old boss and seeing if they still need someone to work lunch shift at the expo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for Pathfinder characters of levels 6-8. In Dungeon Detonation, the players take on the roles of a hard-core Xcrawl squad, trained and tested and ready for superstardom. This is a high-profile charity event, so it&amp;rsquo;s a great way for the team to get some real exposure. If the team wins the Dungeon Detonation2014, they are well on their way to being the hottest team in the league!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Detonation 2014 is a one level, fully-lethal charity event. Five teams are challenging the dungeon, one right after another. The charity aspect works thusly: for every gold piece in treasure and prizes the team wins, one gold piece is donated from a group of registered sponsors to the Jose Villalobos House for War Widows and Orphans. The team that earns the most money for the Jose Villalobos House is declared the winner of the contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
