							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Climb to the Top of the Castle!</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Climb&amp;quot; is a 2D Action/Platformer where you must save the Princess from the evil Warlock and his mechanical army by jumping and slashing your way to the top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game packs an old-school challenge so players will have to hone their skills to take on the challenge. Think you can make it to the top?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 3 dozen enemy types, impossible leaps, diabolical obstacles and 15 challenging levels impede your progress, so you just might have to grab a few 1-ups and pick up a shield or crossbow to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are multiple difficulty levels, a bonus challenge mode, arena battles, lots of trinkets to collect and other goodies to complement the main story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's like Metal Of Duty with swords!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
