							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Devil&#039;s Smuggler</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Devil's Smuggler, written by John Ling, is part of an ongoing series set in the Great City. This is not a numbered adventure in a path, but instead, it concerns a mysterious event that will forever alter the Great City, setting the tone for future events. Throughout the year, &amp;Oslash;one games will release a number of short adventures whose various plots are all somehow entwined with the event. Each will be a stand-alone adventure, designed to be played independently without a specific sequence and can be completed in a single evening&amp;rsquo;s play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In desperate times, the scum rises to the surface where everyone can see it. Street crime has reached an all time high, wallowing amidst a sea of homeless and indigent beggars. Yet beneath the surface, there lurk darker things. Spurred to action by a rash of abductions, the adventurers run afoul of one of the Great City's long standing crime families. But like everyone else, the Sinking has dealt them a fateful hand. With Orim Menach, the patron of their organization missing, the Menach boys have slipped into the trap of an even greater threat, one the adventurers must uncover for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Devil's Smuggler is an Adventure for the Pathfinder RPG System for 4th-level Player Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
