							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White&#039;s Tale</name>
									
			<description>The White&amp;rsquo;s Tale board game makes players &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; a white-tailed deer and thrive by taking advantage of their environment and avoiding perils unique to nature&amp;rsquo;s four seasons. The game is fun for kids and benefits retailers, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The white-tailed deer&amp;rsquo;s keen senses, complicated communication system, and commuter-like daily living habits make it essential that hunters understand the deer&amp;rsquo;s world,&amp;rdquo; said Emily Beach, the Archery Trade Association&amp;rsquo;s manager of education and curriculum development. &amp;ldquo;In the game, players are white-tailed deer, trying to survive and raise fawns. It sounds tough, but The White&amp;rsquo;s Tale makes learning child&amp;rsquo;s play.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created as part of the ATA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Explore Bowhunting&amp;rdquo; program, which teaches kids of all ages the basic skills of hunting with a bow and arrow. Students in &amp;ldquo;Explore Bowhunting&amp;rdquo; play The White&amp;rsquo;s Tale to learn how animals follow patterns when traveling, eating and mating. Students then use that knowledge to their advantage while hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this classic-style board game, players learn the natural history of white-tailed deer. Players must collect food and water through all four seasons, and breed successfully by collecting five fawns while avoiding predators, hunters, diseases and other unexpected dangers. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended for two to six players 8 and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although The White&amp;rsquo;s Tale doesn&amp;rsquo;t teach players specific hunting tactics, it educates future hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
