			<description>An all-in-one supers rpg that makes a point of in the introduction being a reaction to other existing superhero games. Several pages of the gamebook are devoted to a type-in-yourself computer program for character creation which is a blast from the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enforcers, the easiest, fastest, most flexible super-power role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Creation point character generation in minutes.&lt;br/&gt;    Fast and easy combat system.&lt;br/&gt;    A complete magic system.&lt;br/&gt;    All alignments of characters allowed.&lt;br/&gt;    LOTUS compatible spread sheet program for online character sheets,&lt;br/&gt;    Step-by-step procedures provided for new players. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to L.A.&lt;br/&gt;The years is 2046, and the world has changed. The pace of evolution has been accelerated a thousandfold by a combination of man's pollution and alien weapons. Humans are evolving and changing into new and different forms with incredible powers and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federal, stat and local governments are having a difficult time coping with the crisis and have resorted to letting the superbeings police themselves. This has created a world where good battles evil, where superpowered mercenaries line their own pockets while helping to stave off a greater evil, and where maniacal geniuses hatch plots to force society to conform to their own warped views. This is the world of Enforcers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
