							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unofficial Blade Runner Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blade Runner is, without doubt, one of the iconic movies of the 20th Century. Thought a miserable failure on its original release in 1982, the movie went on to be restructured into the Final Cut, the definitive vision of this landmark film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Unofficial Roleplaying Game is assuming two things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. That you, the player, is fully aware of what the Blade Runner universe is all about and that you have not only seen the film but understand the underlying themes as well as appreciate the imagery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. That you have played roleplaying games before and are therefore fully capable of running a game with little to no advice or instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also going to not only take it primary cues from the movie but from other source material, such as the original Philip K Dick novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep, the K W Jeter novels and the 1997 computer RPG. It will also take some liberties - some of the references and item abilities are vague and somewhat debated, so I have translated them into simple open-ended game terms for ease of use. Feel free to adapt or change as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's disclaimer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fan-made creative exercise and has not been created for profit.
