			<description>Witches, ghosts and bats are racing against each other. Those that reach the goal on the game board first will yield the most points for the players. At the same time, however the players must achieve individual goals by cleverly playing their cards. The one that does this best, will get the most points. And that leads to conflict quickly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is placed in the middle of the table with 3 coloured markes placed on it. On their turn, a player lays a card: he can lay it in front of himself to try to improve his chances, or in front of another player to make the completion of their tasks more difficult for them. You may even play cards face down to cover a face up card (your own or an opponent&amp;rsquo;s). With each card played, the same coloured marker is moved. That means that all markers can be moved by all players. The finishing order of the 3 markers determines the sequence for the 3 tasks. Now the points are calculated for each player, and after 4 rounds the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
