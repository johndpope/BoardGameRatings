			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starship Valiant is suddenly attacked by an unknown vessel while exploring a new region of space. While the two ships battle, a boarding party from the enemy ship infiltrates the Valiant with orders to disable all of the vital systems onboard and take control of the ship. In response to this additional threat, the Captain of the Valiant orders the crew to stop the boarding party at all costs and to repair whatever damage the ship might sustain during both of the battles in space and onboard the Valiant.&lt;br/&gt;â€‹&lt;br/&gt;Intruder Alert is a fast-paced board game of team combat. One team must detain the crew and disable the starship&amp;rsquo;s vital systems such as the engines, shields and life support. The other team must fight off the boarding party and repair any damage that the ship has sustained. As both teams try to achieve their objectives, the starship Valiant is sustaining damage from the enemy vessel which causes all sorts of problems, that could affect both of the teams onboard, from hull breaches to electrical fires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
