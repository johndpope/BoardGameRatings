			<description>A game close to that of Crokinole and &amp;quot;Bowls&amp;quot; or other Bocce-related games.  The object is to get your colored or otherwise marked Squails (round flat disks, usually 4 in number) as close to or touching the Procese/Jack (smaller diameter, but thicker and heavier flat disk) by setting your Squail on the edge of a table and striking it with the palm of your hand.  There is a version from House of Marbles in thier &amp;quot;Around the World with Eight Great Games&amp;quot; series, which details some terms to be used in the playing of Squails, such as &amp;quot;To Flute&amp;quot;-To strike a Squail or the Procese off the table and &amp;quot;Excrunch&amp;quot;-To hit an enemy Squail very hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
