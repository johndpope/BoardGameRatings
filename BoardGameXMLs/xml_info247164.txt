			<description>Rules and Encounters for Airships and Other Vehicles&lt;br/&gt;You've done it! You've taken the leap, and bought your first airship. The thrill of excitement is nigh over whelming, untill a simple thought bursts your bubble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now what?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've got some awesome airships, but how are they controlled? What sort of encounters will you face? What is the best way to integrate them into your campaign?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have no fear, and look no further. Izzy's Guide to Fight and Flight is here to answer all your questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fighting and Flying at its best!*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At long last, part 2 of the Izzy's Airships saga has arrived!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picking up where Izzy's Slightly Used Airships left off, Izzy's Guide to Fight and Flight offers 24 fully illustrated pages, packed with airship encounters, NPC's, battle maps, and the mechanics needed to integrate airships into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each chapter also features a short story detailing Izzy&amp;rsquo;s enigmatic past, and an assortment of pre-assembled and statted airship encounters, each with three fully illustrated pages detailing their crew, armaments, and their captains. It has everything you need to kick-start an aerial adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait, there is more! The vehicle operation mechanics found in this book are not limited to airships; they are designed for universal use across land, sea, and air!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Izzy's Guide to Fight and Flight is a catalogue of rules and encounters, essential to any campaign set among the clouds. Unlike Izzy's Slightly Used Airships, this book is designed to fill the gaps in 5e's rules regarding the operation of vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 pages of of vehicular mechanics and their variants&lt;br/&gt;3 new spells&lt;br/&gt;Updated spell lists&lt;br/&gt;3 high resolution, multi-storey battle maps&lt;br/&gt;3 new ships&lt;br/&gt;3 new ship captains &lt;br/&gt;Updated stats for the DMG airship&lt;br/&gt;My personal thanks and gratitude&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
