			<description>From website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agent Saboteur is a face-paced card game full of bluffing and sabotage, where you command a team of international spies trying to stop the terrorists and build your reputation in the process. One of the great things about this game is that no one sits on the sidelines and waits for the other players to get done. For the casual gamer, Agent Saboteur is easy to teach, fun to play, and will quickly become the game you play most often. For the hobby gamer, it will become the go-to game you get out when friends or family stop by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story: &amp;ldquo;Welcome, handler XXXXXXXXXX. Your reputation precedes you. That little matter you took care of in XXXXXX was quite impressive. Some believe you may be ready, so from here on your organization will only be tasked with stopping the type of incidents that end up on the front page. The last agents that got sent got themselves XXXXXX within a week and we&amp;rsquo;re still explaining the glow in XXXXXXXXXXX. Everything you hear, see, or do from this point forward is strictly classified. Good luck. You&amp;rsquo;ll need it.&amp;ldquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gameplay: Your assignment is to use the spies and mission updates in your hand to stop the terrorists. Whichever player gathers the most points in incidents wins. To do so you'll work the source to gain more agents to your team, but if you push your luck, you may get made and lose them all. Then you'll need to send your agents on missions, traveling incognito using your fake passports. Beware, if the other agents guess where you're sending them, they can sabotage the attempt. Keep your cards close to your chest and you just might live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
