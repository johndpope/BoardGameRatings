			<description>StarLife is a turn based space strategy game. The goal is to create a great game experience for players where each turn meaningful choices are made. Each race will play in a unique way. Follow us for more information about StarLife here on facebook or in our website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key points of Starlife:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Focus on player experience;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Governments as a key mechanic of the game (not just fancy text and some bonus);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Tactical space combat with mechanics like a miniature game;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Exploring planets have a real impact on colonies (how they grow) and can trigger events (local and global);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Relevant research tech tree, based on levels of knowledge and more than one way to achieve it (own research, tech trade, tech stealing, prototyping);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Macro Management economic model opposed to a micro management model (planets have infrastructures instead of individual buildings);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Logistics play a big part in a civilization&amp;rsquo;s development;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Space area control by regions (color coded with civilization control), including empty space areas (no stars or planets);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Space stations have a purpose and are valuable to be built;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Diplomacy and relations are more wider in scope;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Player is not a dictator in his civilization. He cannot just force planets to do anything he wants and go to war with anyone without a proper reason;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Ships and ground forces operate in groups and orders (like in a real conflict) need to be issued for those groups before they act. Supply lines are important in any military conflict;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Dinamic story &amp;ndash; the game builds its storyline based on the gameplay;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; External and internal spy agents and intel networks;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Different game set up every time a new game starts. Player may find himself in terms with a huge and old empire in the beginning of the game. This simulates a more realistic approach of a chaotic start condition when a civilization reaches the starts;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Unique races with core game mechanics (not just nice texts and bonus) that are different from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: text by the game designer, taken from the developer and Game Designer websites for VGG; &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://purpleorangegames.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://purpleorangegames.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
