			<description>Rabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay.

Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina&amp;rsquo;s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Erina and Ribbon&amp;rsquo;s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;What trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Retro exploration platformer featuring a bunny girl&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 3+n difficulty settings for all types of players&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 8+ main areas and 20+ sub-areas to explore&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Bunny&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Over 60 items and upgrades&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Over 20 fully illustrated characters with cutscene illustrations&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; 40+ boss battles, 1000+ attack patterns with Boss Rush Mode to fight some or all of them in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Post game story and content with speedrun mode which takes out every section of the game where the player cannot control the main character.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Multiple playable characters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Over 40+ pieces from an original soundtrack&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; English,Chinese and Japanese support&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; Bunny&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
