							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizardry: Tiltowait Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Uno with more special cards and a fantasy (Wizardry) theme to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays exactly like Uno, down to having to say a special word when you're down to one card. The only differences is the nice artwork on the cards, and the magic spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, most of the magic spells work the same as the special Uno cards (Draw Two, Draw Four, Skip, and so on); but there are a few more of them, including 'counter spells'. Easy to play without Japanese knowledge as long as each player has a translated spell list (there's 10 spells).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
