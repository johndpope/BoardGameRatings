			<description>Genitri is a two player board game. It's very easy to learn, but exciting to play. No game is like the previous one.&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to put more tiles on the board than the opponent, by skillfully arranging the pathes.&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are placed alternately.If one of the two players can't play his own tiles, then the opponent must play his remaining applicable tiles.&lt;br/&gt;To win you have to use your strategic tiles intelligently, because you only have 3 start tiles, 3 blocking tiles and 6 arborization tiles.&lt;br/&gt;Its up to you to find out the right placement strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
