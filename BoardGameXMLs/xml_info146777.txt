			<description>Card game from the &amp;quot;Dubbel en Dwars&amp;quot; series. All cards are printed on both sides. During the game you need both sides!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Confetti, try to find an object on the basis of assignments as soon as possible. The table is littered with object-cards. One player turns a card on the table, which shows an assignment. Everyone is now searching for a card that meets the assignment: the objects in the green half have to be on the card, while the object in the red half there should not appear. The first player that finds a matching card gets the assignment card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the deck runs out, the player who has the most assignment cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
