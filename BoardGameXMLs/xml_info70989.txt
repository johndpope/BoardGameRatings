							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prymidian</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prymidians are regal, red-skinned humanoids. Their stately demeanor and formidable build impress other races, and their learning follows suit. The Prymidians are a scientifically-inclined race, dedicated to reason and intellect. Their culture seeks to know all there is to know in Exodus - and none know better than the Prymidians that knowledge is power. Although Prymidians pride themselves on logic and reason, they rarely fit the stereotype of the shy scholar. The typical Prymidian possesses a forceful, even arrogant personality. He is contentious, skeptical, always questioning and probing the opinions and thoughts of those around him and arguing with anyone who disagrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play the Prymidian as PC Race including Personality and Relations.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus an all new Prymidian Paragon Class&lt;br/&gt;     All New Prymidian Feats including Academician and Intellectual Power.&lt;br/&gt;     and a blank Prymidian Character Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
