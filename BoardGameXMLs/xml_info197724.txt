							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HLS Sentinel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HLS Sentinel is a heavily armed patrol scout vessel belonging to the Helian League. The Helian League, a loose Federation of the colonised planets of the Solar System, require fast, well armed and armoured patrol vessels to ensure Helian space remains secure and the HLS Sentinel is well placed to meet this role. With dedicated gun control decks, the HLS Sentinel can quickly destroy interlopers that it encounters on it's long patrol missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Sci-Fi or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The ship occupies approximately 20x20 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A small spacecraft, with a military design. The central area links the bridge to two nacelles, each housing an engine (with engineering room) and dedicated gun control decks. The rear of the ship has living and recreation areas for the crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: HLS Sentinel could be crewed by a team of military personel, and could either be the location for a fierce ship-boarding action or the vessel for long-range exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;300dpi A4 pdf, with map spread across 4 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;300dpi full jpeg version for VTT or poster printing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
