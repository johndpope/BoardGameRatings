							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars: Han Solo Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Han Solo Card Game is inspired by a legendary card game from the Star Wars universe! In this exciting game, players try to score as close to zero as they can with their cards. They can add or swap cards to improve their hand during each round, but rolling the dice and getting doubles will shake things up. At the end of a hand, the best score collects the most valuable bounty token. If you collect wisely, you can even steal the Millennium Falcon &amp;ndash; the highest valued token. The player whose tokens add up to the highest value at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents includes: 62 cards, 24 cardboard bounty tokens, 2 dice, and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Star Wars: Han Solo Card Game is a hand-management game where players take turns drawing and discarding cards one at a time in hopes of ending the round with the sum of their card values closest to zero. The winner of each round gets first pick of a rotating selection of bounty tokens, and the player with the most valuable bounty tokens at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;-user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
