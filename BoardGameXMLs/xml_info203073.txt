			<description>These days it's not enough to be the toughest crew on the streets; you need to make sure everyone knows it, too. Bring enough cans of spray paint to tag walls all over town, and enough muscle to make sure no one else does. There's nothing quite as satisfying as watching little punks drop their spray cans and run at the very sight of you &amp;mdash; just make sure that there isn't someone even bigger right around the corner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tag Team, you play as a crew of Eagles, Bulldogs, Alligators or Gorillas, defending your turf by bluffing your way through battles each day. Players simultaneously reveal their leader characters, and, if nobody backs down, their backup characters join the fight. The winner tags their opponent's territory as a reward. In the end, the crew with the most tagged territory wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
