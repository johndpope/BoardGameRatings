			<description>Assemble the Birds. Claim the Territories. Soar to Victory! In Backyard Birds, you'll draw birds from a supply deck and assemble these birds into different flocks of birds from your hand into your &amp;quot;flock area&amp;quot; based on their species. Flocks will include black birds like Crows and Magpies, red birds like the Robin and Cardinal, yellow birds including the Goldfinch and Warbler and also brown birds which will also grant special abilities. Then you'll discard birds from your flock area to claim territories for victory points. Territory cards include everything from a simple fence post to the Great Oak! Two fantastic art styles bring Backyard Birds to life including some incredible watercolor paintings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
