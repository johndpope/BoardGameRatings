							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">House of Noctula</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctor Noctula is the last scion of a once great family who's cursed line has withered beneath sickness and madness. For years the cantankerous old necromancer has performed his unnatural experiments in the condemned ruins of the family manor. Only a few servants and distant relations have even seen him as he sequestered himself deeper and deeper into obsession with life beyond death. Whether or not he found the answer he's dead now. You are the few who stand to inherit and have been summoned to hear his last will and testament in the condemned House of Noctula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ignore the distant thunder and the encroaching fog. What's the worst that could happen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
