							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bear in Underwear Backpack Adventure Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Bear and his animal friends have found a backpack full of goodies. Players roll a jumbo multi-colored die to travel around the 3-D game board, through the forest and over the bridge, landing on colored spaces directing them to collect their animal&amp;rsquo;s favorite food, forest item and underwear. If a player lands on a space numbered from 1-3, they reach into the red box backpack to pick out that number of items that might match the items on their animal card. If they're lucky they'll grab one they need, otherwise they share it with the other players. First player to collect all the goodies for their animals wins in this silly game based on the books by Todd H. Doodler. No reading required. Everyone plays on every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
