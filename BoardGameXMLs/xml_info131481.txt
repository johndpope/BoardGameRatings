			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Carry the Burden of the Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apocalypse World is no place to raise children. Sometimes, though, a hardholder or scavenger brood makes a pact&amp;mdash;with the blasted heath, with the poisoned groud, with the Psychic Maelstrom itself&amp;mdash;and the pact is this: OBEY THE LAW AND YOU WILL SURVIVE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so a haven is created amidst all the want and suffering, a hardhold of sorts but something more, something almost civilized. Children are born and raised within its limits, taught to fear the world beyond and to obey the law, taught the means of survival. Generations go by, and yet the people remain.&lt;br/&gt;But humanity is curious and heedless; they do not obey the law but break it&amp;mdash;in part or in full&amp;mdash;every day. And thus every day the broken world chips away at this mote of security and stability, awaiting the day when it will be consumed in desparation and darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ones known as the Angel, the Battlebabe, and so on... maybe they were born and raised in a place such as this, a place long ago and far away, a place without the constant fear of death and want, a place long since consumed. If so, these are the stories they tell no one, the stories of what they used to be before the broken world made them hard, cool, sexy, and weird, the stories of growing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
