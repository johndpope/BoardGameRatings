			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waterdeep, City of Splendors and Crown of the North! This iconic city is perhaps the most influential in all of Faer&amp;ucirc;n. It has been a rough century, but she is quickly regaining her former glory.  What better place for your characters to call home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faction Folio: Waterdeep &amp;ndash; Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s City Guide is a resource to help you bring this magnificent city to life. This guide describes seventeen NPCs including a friendly Thayan with revenge on his mind, a blind pirate with a secret, a rising gnome merchant queen, and an old crone in the darkest depths of the Downshadow.  Characters can visit more than forty locations, including a high-end private social club that fronts as a time travel gift shop, a bustling casino with a giant silver hippopotamus statue, or a quiet temple to Chauntea in an outlying farming village. Explore more than twenty rumors, ranging from an information-broker allied to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s alliance, a Calishite thieves&amp;rsquo; guild operating out of Little Marekh, or a shadowy bazaar that sells all manner of things for a favor or a piece of your soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
