							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Master</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;This booklet contains information for gamemasters who wish to design and run role-playing games involving The Master, one of the most formidable villains in the DOCTOR WHO universe and the greatest of The Doctor's humanoid foes. Although The Master can never appear as a player character (that would be completely contrary to the spirit of the game), he can be the focus of many encounter situations, adventures, or even entire ongoing campaigns in which one of his evil plots must be uncovered and thwarted by a Time Lord and his Companions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is split into two books. &amp;quot;The Master: CIA File Extracts&amp;quot; is a sparse 16-page book meant for the players, purportedly written by the &amp;quot;Celestial Intervention Agency&amp;quot; and meant as an official, albeit sparse, report on the Doctor's greatest single opponent. The second book, &amp;quot;The Master&amp;quot; is a more traditional 64-page sourcebook for the GM's eyes only, with more elaborate (and accurate) information about The Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
