			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobilis honing their miraculous abilities generally follow widely-known paths, striving to improve their Aspect, Domain, Realm, Spirit, or collection of Gifts. However, the road to greater power has a few narrow and twisting offshoots, routes that lead some Nobles to develop peculiar and unique abilities. Many of these take the form of byway or exclusive Attributes &amp;mdash;miraculous Attributes possessed by only a small percentage of the Noble population. Each is the fruit of an idiosyncratic personal journey down a path of study few Nobilis walk. Most are weaker or less flexible than the four primary Attributes; the others have comparable power but specific limitations. The virtue of the exclusive Attributes lies not in their raw miraculous potency but rather in their rarity &amp;mdash; the Powers who master them thereby command a rare resource, and can take advantage of this in their dealings with other Nobilis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
