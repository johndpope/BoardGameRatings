							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perilous Journey #1: Portsmouth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1745. The lure of open land, religious freedom, and riches to be made has drawn you away from your home in England to the New World. Unbeknownst to those who usher you across the Atlantic, your desires are more than what the authorities may find appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You like to delve into the world of the unknown. Your curiosity has led you to an underground world that hides beneath everyone&amp;rsquo;s nose. Rumors abound of the Indian shamans that can teach you new things, as long as they deem you worthy, or of the treasures waiting to be discovered. Relics of times long gone lie in wait, housing unimaginable power. Tomes of esoteric lore are said to dwell within shelters only accessible through hazardous terrain. But you don&amp;rsquo;t let silly rumors keep you from the occult power you seek. You are determined to uncover the secrets of centuries past and harness their dark powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, many beings stand in your way, and the journey is not without peril. There are Templars to avoid, witch hunters to fight, natives to exterminate, and worse. It is said creatures of evil powers lurk across the New World, protecting the esoteric knowledge of centuries past and doing everything they can to keep their lands free of intruders. Your quests will not be easy, and scrutiny will be constant, but the payoff can be huge. For those who hold the power of the occult may hold the power to change the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the New World, and you are here to exploit its true secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Colonial Gothic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Journey #1: Portsmouth presents part 1 (out of 14) of the New World campaign, licensed for use with Colonial Gothic (available from Rogue Games). But this isn&amp;rsquo;t just a campaign, it&amp;rsquo;s a complete supplement with material for GMs, players, and fans of the setting. Not only will be able to delve into the New World campaign, you&amp;rsquo;ll also find new character options and fiction set in the world of Colonial Gothic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Journey #1: Portsmouth includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The first part of the New World campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     17 fully-fleshed-out NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;     Side encounters placed in New England.&lt;br/&gt;     3 new character backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;     2 new types of magic.&lt;br/&gt;     Mechanics for adding corruption to your games.&lt;br/&gt;     A look at Portsmouth, NH in 1745.&lt;br/&gt;     New creatures.&lt;br/&gt;     The first part of a fictional series placed shortly after the New World campaign within Colonial Gothic.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip; and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
