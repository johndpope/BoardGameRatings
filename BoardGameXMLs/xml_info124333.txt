							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Eon Assassin</name>
									
			<description>Dark Eon Assassin is an exciting solo science-fiction boardgame, designed to challenge players of all ages as they infiltrate the Tyrant of Acheron&amp;rsquo;s palace, avoiding the traps and guards he has prepared, in an effort to rid the galaxy of his maniacal atrocities. You will have a range of high technology equipment and weapons to aid you, but the odds are stacked against easy success&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board forms your inventory and view of the Tyrant's palace, allowing you to quietly stalk its halls and corridors as you track down your prey. While the palace is explored via two decks of cards and will be different in every game, you will be making important choices all the time that will affect your chances of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, you will need to choose which school of assassins you will be trained by; the school of Dark Eon prizes stealth and deception above all else, while the school of Torsten Rex focuses on ranged weapons and one shot-one kill. Finally, the school of Magna Kurr practices ancient Jovian martial arts and can deal punishing blows with almost any part of their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also need to choose from a highly advanced but very limited range of equipment, including Stealth Suits, Ionised Rail Rifles, Psionic Shields, and many others. Finally, you must pit your wits against the defences of the Tyrant's palace, including avoiding or nullifying traps, evading guards, and defeating the mighty Warmaster Battle Engine as you close in on the Tyrant himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
