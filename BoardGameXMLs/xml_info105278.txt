			<description>RIVAL is a collection of 5 two player abstract games, all played on a board consisting of black hexagons divided into diamonds, white hexagons and white triangles and none of the individual games is called RIVAL. These games are:-&lt;br/&gt; STARTRAP&lt;br/&gt; The object is surround a white star with your own pieces whilst preventing your opponent doing likewise. Each player has 16 playing pegs which move &amp;quot;diagonally&amp;quot; on black diamonds, one guard peg which blocks a black diamond to all other pegs and one jumper peg which occupies a point where black hexagons meet and blocks all movement through that point.&lt;br/&gt; MASTERSPY&lt;br/&gt; A chess like game played on black diamonds in which each player starts with 10 hunters, 4 detectives, 2 secret agents and a masterspy and the object is to capture your opponents masterspy.&lt;br/&gt; TWENTYONE&lt;br/&gt; Each player starts with 7 pairs of counters numbered 1 to 7 which move on black diamonds only. The object is to surround a white star with counters that add up to 21 whilst preventing your opponent from doing likewise.&lt;br/&gt; FIFTEENS&lt;br/&gt; Each player starts with 15 counters numbered 0 to 9, one each of values 0, 1,8 and 9 and two each of the rest. The object is to make groups of 3 counters on a black hexagon (one on each diamond) which add up to 15. One of those three counters may be the opponents.&lt;br/&gt; BLOCKER&lt;br/&gt; Played on the white diamonds only, players start with 12 counters and 3 guards each. Players take turns in rolling a d6 which generates their movement allowance. Movement may be divided between more than one piece. To capture an opponents piece one must use the full movement allowance on a single piece and land on an opponent's piece thus eliminating it. The object is to eliminate all opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
