The hapless fools that brought chaos back into the world were slaughtered..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now it falls to you to set things right. You must wash away the stains of evil. So get your mop ready once more and clean this mess up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;House of Horror&amp;quot; DLC features a whole new level set in a haunted suburban home and surrounding grounds, complete with new assets and challenges to discover and overcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
