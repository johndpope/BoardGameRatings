			<description>Menko is a Japanese game for two or more players. Originating during the middle Edo period (1700s), Menko was a popular children's game during that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to flip the other players' cards or cardboard chips by striking the play area from above with a card or chip from the hand.  The purpose is to create a gust of wind with the intent of flipping over one or more cards on the table.  If a card is flipped, the player gets to keep it.  The game continues until one player has won a set number or all of the cards in the game, and this player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Menko cards are often decorated with images of power and military from the time.  They continue to be made today in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is assumed that Menko was brought to Hawaii at some point during the early 20th-century and eventually evolved into another popular and similar game, Pogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
