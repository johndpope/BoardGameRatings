			<description>Proxy Wars is an expandable two-player game in a contemporary but slightly fictional setting. Players represent a battle-ready faction and use their agents to fight for control of a customizable board, which is set up individually each game. To win, agents must occupy valuable tiles worth victory points (VPs) or wipe out enemy agents or do both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proxy Wars is a full-fledged strategy card-based board game, and the game mechanisms include tile-placing (the cards form the board) and deck-building elements. You are to decide how to best deploy your faction's power and agents to outwit your opponent with ingenious cutting, positioning and attacking strategies. Each player starts with ten agents (playing pieces) in his headquarters and a set of faction cards. Players alternate turns, choosing one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play a new card &lt;br/&gt;     Recruit an agent &lt;br/&gt;     Move an agent &lt;br/&gt;     Attack enemy agents &lt;br/&gt;     Take card actions &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players total the number of agents they control, along with any VPs that they have accumulated on their cards. Whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Proxy Wars, you need at least the two basic sets: GreenEngage and MegaCorp; Proxy Wars: Oath Bound, which contains additional cards for both factions, is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
