			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're back as Arin Costello, newly minted style editor! Now that you've outpaced Hugh, he's your errand boy, along with Ruby Patel, who has taken over your old spot. Margot is trying to adjust to a simpler life in an attempt to win back her husband, and so is giving up her fabulous New York apartment to whichever editor does the best job. You're sure to win, right? Except there's new competition in the form of Trevor Simons, and you'll need the help of your old rival or your ambitious replacement to rise to the occasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sharpen your people skills and become the top fashionista at Supple magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
