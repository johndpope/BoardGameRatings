							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spar: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The game has been updated to version 3! It's a complete revamp and change from version 2 for faster and more strategic gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast paced card game featuring two opponents slugging it out in each other's faces.  Very easy to learn, but the strategy lies in reading your opponent and strategizing your own moves.  Do you go all out and attack heavily from the start?  Or do you lean back and wait for your opponent to strike first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;1. Players are dealt 9 cards&lt;br/&gt;2. Players take turns playing a valid card from their hand. A valid card is one that is equal to or higher than the current card in play. If there isn't a card in play, the player may play any card.&lt;br/&gt;3. After the player plays a valid card it is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Win&lt;br/&gt;Discard your entire hand first to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passing / Drawing a Card&lt;br/&gt;If a player is not able to play a card, they must draw a card. The player's turn is now over. A player may also choose to draw a card even if they have a valid card to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Block&lt;br/&gt;A player can BLOCK once per game. A BLOCK causes both players to draw a card. The player's turn is now over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow Fist / Playing Pairs&lt;br/&gt;A player may start to play pairs if the pair they wish to play is the same as the current card in play. Subsequent plays must be pairs until a player passes, blocks, or wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1 Card&lt;br/&gt;The 1 card may be played after the 10 card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
