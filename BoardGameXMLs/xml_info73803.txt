							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Telgrathia 1st edition</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction on 1KM1KT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Telgrathia, a land torn by war and famine. For many years, the people have grown&lt;br/&gt;restless. Now, under the watchful leadership of King Kelak, Telgrathia has entered a new time of&lt;br/&gt;propsperity. But not all people are content under the leadership of King Kelak, whose rise to power was&lt;br/&gt;filled with bloodshed and reprisals against his political enemies. Every day the opposition to the new king&lt;br/&gt;grows. Old warlords who were coerced into swearing fealty to the king cease paying tribute. Bandits grow&lt;br/&gt;more brazen. Treasure hunters freely roam the crypts of Old Telgrathia, finding artifacts which were not&lt;br/&gt;meant to be found by such self-serving men. Telgrathia needs saviors, adventurers brave enough to save it&lt;br/&gt;from its newfound enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
