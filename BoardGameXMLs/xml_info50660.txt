			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For seven centuries the reach and power of the British Crown was regularly challenged, but never dispelled. The Crown's capital city, London, in the 1920s three times older than the Crown itself, grew to be the pre-eminent confluence of old privilege, new money, dynamic creaitivity, social class friction, madness, tuberculosis, science, education, and advanced medical research. Bumbling criminals, evil geniuses, refugee intellectuals, social deviants, harmless eccentrics, moral reformers, occultists, and millions of utterly normal people gravitated to London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Larger any city becomes, the more it becomes the place to be, and the more reasons people find for going there. London was the largest city in the world. With detail chosen not only for social or political importance but also for the curious, bizarre, and supernatural, this book captures much of London's special flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keepers and interested readers will find in it substantial background and a wide range of information, including new occupations for the game, famous people, London by district (with a half-dozen general maps, and many more detailed plans and illustrations of particular buildings and complexes), the suburbs, the Thames, parks, subterranean London, transport, annual events, law and order, crimes and criminals, institutions, recreation, occult London, a historical chronology of the city, a 1920s timeline by month, prices, how to get chloroform (or weapons, fireworks or public records), how to send a letter or telegram, sample hotel and restaurant costs,a bibliography, an introductory scenario, and an index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
