							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Peacemaker Game</name>
									
			<description>This is an educational game in religion for school and home, and has a subtitle: Spreading Christian Friendship. The purpose of the game is to help children see what certain followers of Jesus Christ did to reconcile people to God and one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mary, St. Paul, St. Francis of Assisi, Pope John XXIII, Dr. Tom Dooley, Dorothy Day, &amp;amp; Mother Teresa are the individuals highlighted in the game.  Additional reading is also suggested in a bibliography within the rules book to facilitate follow-up discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires an adult or peer moderator, and two to six children to play.  In a classroom, the students could be divided into two to four teams, with the teacher acting as the moderator.  Prior to the stare of play the moderator gives a brief bio of each of the seven christians mentioned earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colored pawns mark the position of each party on the play board, and a deck of cards and die direct play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 72 cards in the play deck, and a die is rolled by each player or team in sequence, and if their number is rolled they are able to draw a card from the deck.  If their number isn't rolled, they pass the die on to the next player or team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a card is drawn, the party reads the card to the other parties and does as directed.  When a card is used, it is discarded from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first party to reach the finish line wins the game.  But it is hoped that the parties will continue until all finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
