			<description>From the distributor's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following hot on the heels of the release of the Symbaroum Core Book and Symbaroum Adventure Pack 1, The Mark of the Beast is an independent sequel to the tutorial adventure The Promised Land and provides insights on how to deal with more complex battle- and problem solving situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also contains a dozen colourful non-player characters, two maps, four handouts, a new ritual, two artefacts, a new elixir and much more to add to your Symbaroum campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mark of the Beast features the settlement of Thistle Hold &amp;ndash; a town of hopes and dreams but also a place where people are murdered or disappear without a trace. A beastly killer known as the Flayer is hounding the northern districts of town. Some say an abomination is on the loose. The situation grows even more tense as an infamous Black Cloak arrives, spreading suspicions far and wide  ...And when it becomes known that Mayor Nightpitch is among the witnesses, the rumour-mill really starts to grind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter Thistle Hold, the town in the shadow of Davokar where hope flourishes in a bed manured with broken dreams and shattered prospects. The Mark of the Beast gives adventurers a good reason to explore the streets and personalities in town, but will also take them along on a hunt for an elusive and brutal slayer &amp;ndash; a slayer driven by the most ruthless power known to the world: love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
