			<description>Love Formula is a card-drafting game for 2 to 4 players in which you attempt to set up couples you support on their perfect date while sabotaging the efforts of your opponents to do the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two phases of the game: the draft phase and the play phase. During the draft phase, players strategically choose which cards they want to be part of their hand while their opponents do the same. During the play phase, players use cards from their hand to organize the perfect dates for their couples and sabotage their opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play alternates between the two phases, with the draft phase occurring first. Once each phase has been played twice, the game ends. The player who has the most victory points from creating the best dates wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
