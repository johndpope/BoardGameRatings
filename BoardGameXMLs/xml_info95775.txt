							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Millenium 2.2: the boardgame</name>
									
			<description>Reproduces as a boardgame the famous computer game Millenium 2.2: return to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;The Earth has been made a lifeless planet by some catastrophe and the players (the few living in remote outpost in space) must collect resources around the solar system to make it habitable again.&lt;br/&gt;spaceships! techno-babble! aliens! all this sort of things, but in a quite reasonable mixture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A giant asteroids wiped away any form of life from Earth and made it inhabitable. Fortunately, mankind was able to found a few little outposts through the Solar System before the&lt;br/&gt;catastrophe.&lt;br/&gt;There are blueprints of forgotten technologies lost on the planets and the satellites of the Solar System, and some of them will allow to build some machine, which, once constructed and transported to Earth with a suitable space craft, will be able to solve one of the many Earth&amp;rsquo;s problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once found such buleprints, the players will have to accumulate the resources to build the re-terraforming machine (there are several resources in the game, from Aluminium to Uranium).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such resources could be mined from the asteroid belt (sending an appropriate ship there) or exploring celestial bodies until one rich in that resource is found (a drawing card system is used in exploration to determine randomly which planets will be strategically valuable and which one will be worthless pieces of rock, so that no two games will be the same).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same resources will be used also for the construction of othe ships a player can use for further exploration.&lt;br/&gt;There are several kinds of ship a player can build, each one having its own abilities and its own price in resources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Earth has become habitable again the game ends and the one having contributed most to restore its environment win, since his sub-specie will be able to colonize Earth while the others will have to remain in some worthless piece of rock&lt;br/&gt;lost in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
