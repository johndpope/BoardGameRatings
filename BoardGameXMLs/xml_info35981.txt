			<description>&amp;ldquo;A Game of Fantasy Gladiatorial Combat for 2-6 players. The players take the roles of owners of a team of warriors who do battle in The Arena, a circle of battle, blood and death. Their teams consist of brave Humans, the graceful, catlike Ptemet, the insectoid Keet&amp;rsquo;Norn, the brutish Orghar, and the deadly Vashail, who battle for glory, money and at their master&amp;rsquo;s whim. Life is cheap, death is easy, but glory is eternal!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are allocated funds to set up their gladiatorial team. Warriors, weapons and armor must be purchased. In addition, there are campaign rules to chart a team&amp;rsquo;s progress from one game to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
