							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tawala&#039;s Last Redoubt</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cruel Emperor Tawala has been forced from his throne on the world of Galactica and has fled for his life to the planet of Farside, where he and a small bank of adherents prepare to make their last stand. Extreme solar conditions have isolated Farside from the rest of the galaxy, and so it remains to Benthi, leader of the local insurrectionists, to press the final assault on Tawala and his minions.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Tawala's Last Redoubt puts you in the position of rebel leader. You must intercept and decipher Tawala's secret messages to his supporters, form alliances with local chiefs, detect Tawala's spies in your midst, separate hard intelligence from enemy disinformation, avoid Tawala's military forays against you and, finally, lead the assault against the Prince's stronghold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
