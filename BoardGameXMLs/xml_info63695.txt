			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You sleep in the middle of the day.  The twin towers of the World Trade Center in 20th Century Manhattan, once the world's tallest buildings, top out at 35 stories each.  No one has ever heard of the Mason-Dixon line.  Cigarettes seem never to have existed.  So much is different in so many subtle ways that you feel your Paranormal Memory will be overwhelmed completely, yet you know that somehow, somewhere, it wwas all caused by a solitary change in the fabric of Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your seasoned squad of Veteran Time Corps agents must utilize their Timetricks (tm) training to find the common element behind the myriad differences in history and identify the single moment in Time that determines whether billions of lives will be plunged into darkness and death.  But even if you find that single moment in Time, how will you find the power to overwhelm the unimaginable forces arrayed against you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkest Before the Dawn is a 42 page adventure scenario for use with the Timemaster role-playing game and the Timetricks supplement.  Inside you will find the historical background, characters, plot encounters, maps, and underlying scientific explanations you need for hours of investigation and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
