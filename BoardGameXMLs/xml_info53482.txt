			<description>From the designer's Etsy listing (Etsy seller fun4thecar):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I created this card game for younger children, but when different people started playing with them, we found out that teenagers and adults laughed uncontrollably as they tried to shout out the right animal sounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is made out of laminated paper (with rounded corners). Rules: Cards are placed down one at a time. Two players see who can make the correct animal sound first. The person who makes the correct sound first, holds on to the card. When the rabbit card appears - don't make a sound! If you do - you lose one of your cards. It helps to have a judge, too, to determine who shouts out the right sound first. Whoever ends up with the most cards in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
