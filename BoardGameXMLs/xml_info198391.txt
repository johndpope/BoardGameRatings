			<description>Sten, Sax, P&amp;aring;se: Superdueller is a variation on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors. In this game you have cards with Rocks, Scissors and Pouches (in Sweden it's not paper but pouch), that you play to win matches. But before every match you also draw and read a card with special rule for that match. It can be that more then two player gonna play, or that a player must win two times in a row. The game is played until one player has a certain amount of wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
