			<description>English version of the S&amp;aacute;rk&amp;aacute;nySakk board game (hungarian).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     For all ages with simple rules to be learned easily, and still lots of possible strategies for elder gamers to develop.&lt;br/&gt;     3D gameplay experience.&lt;br/&gt;     Uncountable board variations.&lt;br/&gt;     Balanced gameplay, you always have the chance to overcome your opponents playing with any dragon.&lt;br/&gt;     Gameplay length is adjustable to your demand by setting the winning goal to the right value&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is moving your dragon on to an orthogonally adjacent cube. When you move from one cube to another, you rotate the cube you are leaving, rotating it in the direction you are moving. If you rotate the cube you just left to the neutral color or your dragon&amp;rsquo;s color, you get to move your dragon again. In this way, the mottled board slowly becomes green when the green dragon moves, then becomes red when the red dragon moves. The goal of the game is to be the first dragon to score 100 points. Points are scored when you are done moving for your turn. Each cube with your color face up at the end of your turn counts as a point, whether you landed on it this turn or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
