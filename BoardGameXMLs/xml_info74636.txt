			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrek is a video game based on the first installment in the popular movie series. It was released exclusively as an Xbox launch title on Wednesday, November 14, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first Shrek video game to be rated T for Teen by the ESRB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;Shrek takes place after the movie. Shrek and Fiona are married and living happily until Fiona is captured by an evil wizard, Merlin, who has placed a seemingly impassable fog to guard his fortress. The fog can be breached by completed good deeds. The Magic mirror gives Shrek a mission book which guides him through the lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The player completes objectives (&amp;quot;Good Deeds&amp;quot;). In most objectives, the player hunts for an object and completes an action. Not many objectives vary from this, though a few will occasionally vary. Notably, Shrek's ally and best friend, Donkey, does not appear in the game, neither is he mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
