			<description>&amp;quot;The Terminator: Rampage (also known as just Terminator: Rampage) is a first-person shooter video game released for the PC by Bethesda Softworks in 1993. It is the third game based on the Terminator film series that was made by Bethesda, following The Terminator and The Terminator 2029.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's levels are grid-based 3D mazes, similar in design to Wolfenstein 3D. Players explore each level searching for the stairs lead up to the next level, with the Skynet computer core located at the top of the building. The game contains dungeon crawl elements, as the nature of the game's maze-like levels will sometimes require players to back-track between levels in order to access previously inaccessible areas of a level. Exploration of the game's levels is required to finish the game, as the player must collect and assemble various scattered pieces of a plasma gun, which is the only weapon capable of harming the game's final boss.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator%3A_Rampage The Terminator: Rampage]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
