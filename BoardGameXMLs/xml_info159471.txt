							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deluxe Trivial Pursuit</name>
									
			<description>A videogame version of the classic game Trivial Pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deluxe Trivial Pursuit is a faithful representation of the experience of playing Trivial Pursuit.  Players roll an (animated) die to move around the board.  When a category is selected the scene changes to a room and an animated cartoon bird character walks on to pose the question.  In addition to the straightforward trivia questions of the style found in the original board game, there are also picture questions, and musical questions where the bird character will sit at a piano and a short piece of music will be played.  An animated spider on the right of the screen acts as a timer for each question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
