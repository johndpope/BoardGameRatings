							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Conspiracy!</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep in mind that change is not always good and historically, revolutions rarely end well. Space Conspiracy takes role playing games into the future and then gets weird. Every new campaign spawns a host of random conspiracies to investigate and be baffled by. Scores of weapons are in the game, including lasers, slug throwers, grenades, and cabbage. Exciting vehicles such as the boring ground car are detailed in the game. Okay, so maybe that vehicle isn't that exciting, but there are a couple of tanks, and some spaceships, and a canoe. Who doesn't like canoes? Choosing from six races and six classes, players create characters that will adventure throughout the galaxy using a unique rule system that reads like it was developed by space chimps. This game masks its flaws by forcing you to roll a ridiculous number of dice and then suggests that you go out and buy more. So why haven't you gone out and bought this game already?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
