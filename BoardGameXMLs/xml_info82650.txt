			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOMB ALLEY is an operational level game featuring combat between British and Axis air, land, surface-naval and submarine forces for control of the Mediterranean and North Africa in 1942.&lt;br/&gt;Every ship, airplane or infantry company available to the local British and Axis commanders in the summer of 1942 are now under your control.  You will need to organize your ships into task forces to perform various missions: sea lane, interdiction, land bombardment, supply/troop transport, evacuation, etc.  All play revolves around the creation and manipulation of these task forces and the effective concentration of air power.&lt;br/&gt;Included are a campaign game covering June 11 to August 31, 1942, and minigames covering the invasion of Crete in May 1941 and Operation Pedestal in August 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOMB ALLEY is designed to be a two-sided game: British vs. Axis.  The Axis forces may be commanded by either a human or the computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Gary Grigsby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
