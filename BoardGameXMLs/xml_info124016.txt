			<description>This is a party game in which a player and his opponent debate an issue that is determined by a card draw. The debate is judged by the other players according to a criterion that a spinner decides, eg, funniest, most unique, worst, etc. The judges award chips to the players. Play continues through each bracket, with the two players who have collected the most chips squaring off in the finals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
