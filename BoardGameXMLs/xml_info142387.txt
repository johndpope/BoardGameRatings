			<description>The game consists of 40 Challenge cards. Each card has one Primary Challenge and three Bonus Challenges.&lt;br/&gt;The challenges come in four types: 1. Out on a Limerick --- Fill in the blank at the end of the limerick with the correct Greek or Latin prefix.&lt;br/&gt;2. On the Road --- Identify the author of each imagined diary entry, and the work of fiction he or she comes from.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Eschewbox --- Correct the grammatical errors. The number of such errors is in parentheses at the end of the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;4. Rooted Out --- Replace the bracketed words in the challenge with one of the multiple choice answers. The bracketed words essentially are a definition of the answer.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns being the reader, with the other players, beginning in a clockwise direction from the reader, attempting to answer the Primary Challenge. The first player to answer correctly selects a bonus challenge. If he cannot answer it, then the next player gets a chance, and so on. Each correct Primary Challenge answer is worth two points, and each correct Bonus Challenge answer is worth one point. The first player to reach 10 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
