			<description>Three Little Ducks is a card game in which the players cooperate and compete to build a path out of &amp;quot;danger&amp;quot; and move their three baby duck cards along it to the safety of home. Players take turns to pick up a card from the deck which will either help them build a path or move one of their ducklings along it. Watch out for the big bad wolf card! He will send your duck back to the start. The first player to get all three of their ducklings home is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Three Little Ducks game consists of a deck of 52 cards. &lt;br/&gt;It is for 2 to 4 players and takes 30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;It is suitable for young children even if they can't read yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
