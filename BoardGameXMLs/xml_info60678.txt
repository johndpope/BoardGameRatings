			<description>Cover Blurb: A new character and Storytelling Adventure System scene for Geist: The Sin Eaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dem bones, dem bones gonna walk all over, dem bones, dem bones they gonna walk all over...&amp;quot; The thing in Regan&amp;rsquo;s head was still singing that damn song. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t stopped in three months, ever since the Incident had bound them together. Not to breathe, not to eat, not to sleep--not even to let her do any of those things. You might not think something as simple as a song on continuous repeat could drive someone completely insane; surely that&amp;rsquo;s the sort of thing you could tune out after a while, like traffic noise or a waterfall right outside your window. You&amp;rsquo;d be wrong, and Regan would be happy to tell you so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Please,&amp;quot; Regan whispered softly, her eyes squeezed shut and her body rocking softly back and forth, like a child in her mother&amp;rsquo;s lap. &amp;quot;I can&amp;rsquo;t live like this. Just... just give me an hour. Ten minutes. Five. God, please, anything you want, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it, just please be quiet!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dem bones, dem bones gonna walk all over, dem bones, dem bones they gonna walk all over...&amp;quot; Regan&amp;rsquo;s breath caught in a ragged little hiccup, somewhere halfway between a sob and a hysterical laugh. &amp;quot;Fine,&amp;quot; she said, opening her eyes as her gaze settled on the gun in her lap. &amp;quot;Okay. We&amp;rsquo;ll do it this way.&amp;quot; Tears tumbling down her cheeks, she drew in a deep breath and brought the gun to her temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some hours later, after her blood and brains had cooled and congealed, Regan sat up with a sudden, rasping hiss of breath. She saw a boy&amp;rsquo;s face, not much older than her, and she knew that he had been killed for the seventeen dollars in his wallet and the hundred dollar shoes on his feet before she could tear the caul away. Blinking slowly, as though she&amp;rsquo;d never seen the world before, Regan smiled and began to sing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dem bones, dem bones gonna walk all over, dem bones, dem bones they gonna walk all over...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
