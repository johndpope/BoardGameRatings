							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Oleander Maw</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dragon Age RPG Adventure for Characters Level 1-2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oleander Maw is a small wooden box, about a foot long and half as wide, ornately carved with the design of a twisting vine featuring oleander flowers. When opened, it is empty, though it smells strongly of oleander as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box has served as the prison for a Desire Demon for unknown time. Udrik, once a rogue maleficar, has been the owner of the box for years. The Desire Demon within tried to possess Udrik at one point, promising him delights of the flesh unimaginable, but Udrik was able to withstand the temptation and trap the demon within the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His son, Lord Casden, also possessing a small amount of magical talent, was not so successful. Having seen that his son was madly in love with Fadella, the daughter of the Mayor of Terin, and his inability for years to even show the least expression of that love to the (in his opinion, spoiled) girl, Udrik made a deal with the Desire Demon in the Oleander Maw to give his son the power to achieve his heart&amp;rsquo;s desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all, Udrik figured, Casden was mediocre enough of a mage that a demon from the Fade would eventually possess him. So, better the demon you know&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
