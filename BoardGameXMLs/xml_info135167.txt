			<description>This game was sent for free to those who pre-ordered Braccio da Montone.&lt;br/&gt;The Disfida di Barletta was a tournament fought near Barletta, Southern Italy, on 13 February 1503. It consisted in a mounted tourney between 13 Italians and 13 French knights. The tournament took place in an area enclosed by the judges of both parties&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple man-to-man tournament combat wargame. &lt;br/&gt;La Disfida (DDB) is played by two parties of 13 knights who compete on a leveled playing field (which is a fenced area previously chosen) that has been overlaid by an hex grid.&lt;br/&gt;Each Knight has indicated on the counter the name and the value (VC), which is fighting capability, morale, strength,etc. &lt;br/&gt;The front shows the knight on his horse, the back  the horseman on foot.&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to capture the enemy knights&lt;br/&gt;You must have Braccio da Montone to play La Disfida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
