			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: In front of you is a long table set with a glorious feast. At the head of this table is Lord Bentele. He motions for you to have a seat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Oooo. What&amp;rsquo;s on the table?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: What? Why does that matter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: I&amp;rsquo;m hungry and we have been eating trail rations for weeks.  Now what&amp;rsquo;s on the table?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no better way to celebrate than with a grand feast. Whether held to honor conquering heroes, celebrate a holiday or honor a guest at court, feasts are part of the landscape of most role playing games. Unfortunately, the smells, sights and sounds of these grand occasions are all too often glanced over to get to the next crucial plot point. This is regrettable as eating is one of the few shared experiences to which almost every one can relate.  A good description of a waiting meal can conjure memories of smells and tastes in the minds of players and can even be used to set the mood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is designed to help create these vibrant feast images, with a whopping 16 tables dedicated to designing a well fleshed out feast. This product can design feasts suitable for any game situation. As a bonus, there are two small 10-option tables dedicated to giving the feast table and the feasting chamber some details. All this and its only 50&amp;cent;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product is 9 pages, plus cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
