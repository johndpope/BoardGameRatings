							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolling For Bunnies: A Rabbit Match Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Bunnies and dice: that's all. In this offshoot of Rabbit Match: The Game, players collect rabbit cards from a common tableau using two types of dice, socializing and bunny type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players determine how many dice to commit in preparing (socializing) rabbits for adoption and how many to spend seeking appropriate adopters for the fully socialized buns. Multiple players can contribute to making a single bun friendly, but only one can get adoption credit (and points), allowing other contributors to dip into his or her dice pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect a variety (lop, lionhead, ruby, large, small) of bunnies shoot for sheer numbers, or play for victory points? Rolling for Bunnies allows for multiple strategies and contains advanced cards (such as pairs, groups) with the base set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
