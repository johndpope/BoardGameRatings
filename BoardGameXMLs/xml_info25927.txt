			<description>Discover a New World... And Fight for It!&lt;br/&gt; Players start as a small island nation off the coast of a large continent.  They receive initial resources, colonists, cash and a ship to search for a rumored new land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns are taken by choosing specific roles which allow movement, technology advances, and investment in the Old World or influence on the continent, outfitting ships, investment cash, and diplomatic efforts.  Only two roles are chosen per turn and then all movement and actions are played out.   Players must explore the New World and found farms, posts, towns, and harvest resources.  They then score points and generate income shipping new goods to the Old World, and then can score points shipping supplies back to the New World.  Nations must also balance defense against rival nations while protecting their investment in the New World on land and sea.  OWNW is different each game.  Explorers and ships reveal new hexes that have a type of terrain and a potential special resource.  All terrain has a carrying capacity, which cannot be improved until the player builds farms.  While exploring and settling the New World, players also play technology advances back at home which improves ship speed, manpower, reduces cost of men and goods, and allows for special buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game features:&lt;br/&gt;-role selection.&lt;br/&gt;-known and unknown map.&lt;br/&gt;-hex based discovery, changes each game.&lt;br/&gt;-carrying capacity per hex which may be modified&lt;br/&gt;-resource extraction and management&lt;br/&gt;-shipping goods, soldiers, colonists.&lt;br/&gt;-tech advancement.&lt;br/&gt;-piracy and conflict on land and sea / all units are unarmed until you decide to arm them!&lt;br/&gt;-colonization, simple building tech tree.&lt;br/&gt;-Area control through role selection of Old World for endgame points.&lt;br/&gt;-multi-path scoring: building, influence, shipping, exploration.&lt;br/&gt;-basic units and characters with special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;-'touring' mechanism for specific mapmaker, envoy, etc... characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is still in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
