							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial And The Cosmic Garden</name>
									
			<description>Released for the Game Boy Color in 2002, E.T. Cosmic Garden is a real-time adventure where you travel to six planets populated by exotic, weird, and wild plants. You gather these rare and wonderful plants for the spaceship's greenhouse and fulfill E.T.'s original mission by replanting and restoring the Cosmic Garden. Growing a healthy garden requires E.T. and his assistants, Space Bee and Space Slug, to maintain proper amounts of food, water, and light, and to protect these special species from a host of intergalactic pests, including space beetles, fungus, and harmful celestial events, such as a prolonged eclipse. E.T. can use his special telekinesis powers to control the pests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features 12 levels and seven environments. You can create more than 60 plants, each with unique personalities and abilities&amp;mdash;they sing, jump, generate electricity, and more. Beat the game and you'll unlock the never-ending Prize Garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;E.T. and the Cosmic Garden&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
