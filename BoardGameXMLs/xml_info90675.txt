			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 2 is Namco&amp;rsquo;s second title in their Grand Prix motorcycling series. It includes licensed riders and tracks from the 2001 championship season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 2 is an arcade-simulation game, having game modes to suit both types of players. Players can choose from any of the riders from the season to participate in Arcade, Championship, or Time Trial game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Championship is a career mode that places the player in control of one of three beginner teams as they race through all 10 tracks. Players have a practice session before each race to tweak their bikes and a qualifying lap to determine pole position. At the end of each season, a player can resign with their current team or move up to a better team with faster bikes, provided they earned enough points in the season to be signed. Championship mode ends after 5 seasons, where the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Trial and Arcade are single races that players match off against the clock or opponents, respectively. There are a number of customization options available to tailor the races to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 2 features a simulation toggle that determines the control complexity. With simulation off, the controls are simple, while activating simulation mode brings the bikes close to actual performance response. The game features 2 player competive matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
