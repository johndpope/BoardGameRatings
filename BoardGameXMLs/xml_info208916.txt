							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rulers of the Continent Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast-play solo stat sports sim dedicated to the early years of European Soccer knockout competitions. Rulers of the Continent permits you to replay entire tournaments, with scorers, in just a few dice rolls per match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual sets are available, each including the base rulebook necessary to play, for the European Champions Cup, Cup Winners Cup and  UEFA Cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each match, teams are rated based on the number of goals they scored and conceded in the historical tournament, and these ratings are compared to identify a column on a chart.  Along with a 2d6 roll, this determines the initial number of goals scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams have a &amp;quot;third dice&amp;quot; stat ensuring that those that did well in the actual tournament have a better chance of advancing, while still allowing for shock results and giant killings.  A d10 roll determines whether or not each team gets to adjust the initial goal results, with the &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; teams more often gaining this advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A percentile dice roll provides the name of the scorer of each goal, again based on the historical results of the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With just a handful of rolls per match, an entire Tournament can be completed, and a Champion crowned, in a single sitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Builds on the game engine of the designer's World Cup soccer game, Dream To End All Dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
