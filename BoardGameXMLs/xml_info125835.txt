							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brent Crude</name>
									
			<description>&amp;lsquo;Brent Crude&amp;rsquo; is a two-to-five player game about the oil industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players grow their businesses by purchasing oil fields, pipelines, storage tanks, refineries, and retail outlets. They produce crude oil at offshore platforms and pipe it onshore to sell or store. They ship stored oil to refineries, where it is converted into diesel, petrol, and liquid petroleum gas. Finally, they deliver those refined products by lorry to retail outlets, where they score victory points (with bonus points for previsously-established outlets of their own). Or they ship the refined products to Rotterdam to sell for money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of each good varies according to the rules of supply and demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
