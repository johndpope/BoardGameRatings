			<description>A cloth bag is filled with a variety of differently shaped wooden pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to grab pairs of identical wooden pieces out of the bag.  Once a player has his hand in the bag, he can feel for the pieces as he likes -without looking- and pick a pair, which he keeps if it matches, in which case he may continue to search for matching pairs. A turn lasts until the current player grabs two un-matching pieces or until a minute is up, whichever comes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has most pairs at the end of the game has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
