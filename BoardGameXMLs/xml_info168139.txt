							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ziggurat</name>
									
			<description>As a neophyte sorcerer you are one of many to go the rite of passage: to enter the maze of the Ziggurat and face deadly skulls, skeletons, ghosts and powerful bosses in order to clear your way through the final floor equipped with powerful wands, staffs or spell books. Only through this, you will become a powerful wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ziggurat is a Rogue-Lite Dungeon Crawl FPS (First person shooter) in which you go through procedurally generated dungeons, floor by floor, room by room to find perks and more powerful spells to become stronger with each playthrough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Rogue-Lite Game it works within the permadeath system - meaning when you are dead, you have to start over from the beginning. But as you play, you will find many powerful unlockables to become stronger everytime. Only to someday make it to the top of the Ziggurat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rooms will be filled with Monsters, Traps or both. Many rooms change the games rules, such as throwing invisible enemies at you or decrease your run speed for an extra challenge. You can find many secret rooms and treasures, provided you are vigilant enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each floor a powerful boss Monster awaits you, while standing between you and the portal to the next floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
