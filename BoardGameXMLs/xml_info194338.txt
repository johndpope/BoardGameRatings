			<description>User sumary:&lt;br/&gt;The title is a german nursery rhyme. Something like &amp;quot;in love - engaged to be married - married&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;3 to 8 players (on the box it is written incorrectly as 3-12 players) can do this funny boardgame with many hearts and luck.&lt;br/&gt;First you have to select, if you are a man (turn your pawn clockwise) or a woman (turn your pawn anticlockwise). Everyone gets 10 hearts, the money in this game. Roll the dice and move your pawn along the coloured fields. On the yellow fields you get a yellow card with your interests (jazz, football, politics). On the green fields you get characteristics (angry, smart). If two players meet each other, they can fall in love (romantic) and check their performance (economically). Sometimes you have to pay with red hearts or get black hearts (white fields) and you have to pay for optimizing your interests and characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;After a specified time all players sum up their red and black hearts and the winner is the heart with the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
