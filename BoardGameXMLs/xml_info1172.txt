			<description>extrapolated from Schildberg translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucky Five&lt;br/&gt;by Heinz Meister&lt;br/&gt;A dice game for 2 &amp;ndash; 6 players&lt;br/&gt;Ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;33 cards&lt;br/&gt;3 dice&lt;br/&gt;60 chips (42 light green, 12 dark green, 6 black)&lt;br/&gt;Card tray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Place the card tray in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Shuffle the cards and place them face down in one side of the card tray to form the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Roll the three dice and place them next to the card tray.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Give each player 10 chips worth a total of 270 points, as follows: 7 light green chips worth 10 each, 2 dark green chips worth 50 each, and 1 black chip worth 100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The player who has been the luckiest today begins the game. Play then proceeds clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A player&amp;rsquo;s turn must always be taken in this order (during which steps 1 &amp;ndash; 4 may repeat several times):&lt;br/&gt;1. Turn over a card. The cards show what dice must be rolled in step 3.&lt;br/&gt;2. Put down a chip. Then the player decides &amp;mdash; based on the card and the intended dice roll &amp;mdash; which chip he would prefer to put down. You can only put down one chip per card (one 10-point chip, one 50-point chip or one 100-point chip). Place it in the middle of the table next to the exposed card.&lt;br/&gt;3. Bet and roll the dice. Now the player must predict the total roll of the respective dice on the card when compared with the numbers currently showing on the dice.&lt;br/&gt;4. Evaluate the roll. The player&amp;rsquo;s bet will be right or wrong. Right bets mean two possibilities for this player:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; He/she may take another turn, going through steps 1 &amp;ndash; 4 again.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Or he/she may end his/her turn. He/she takes all the upturned cards from the middle of the table, puts them in a stack in front of him/her and puts the chips from the middle of the table on the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when only one player has chips left. This player gets one final turn. If he/she bets wrong, the chips are left in the middle of the table; nobody can use them in the scoring. The same goes for chips that were not yet used in betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also ends if no more cards can be drawn. In this case chips not yet used in betting do not score, either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring and winning&lt;br/&gt;Each player scores his/her stacks separately, by multiplying the number of cards in the stack by the total value of the chips in the stack. Then add the separate stack scores together for a grand total. The winner is the player with the highest grand total. In case of a tie, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
