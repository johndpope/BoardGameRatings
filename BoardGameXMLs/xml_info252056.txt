							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abandoned Mine</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trying to pay the debts accumulated by her grandfather, the Baroness Edith was looking to re-open the silver mine south of Highbrook. But the team of surveyors discovered that a small kobold clan, the Gnawed Bone, had moved into the mine and turned into some sort of religious shine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With costs rising and the kobolds yet to be cleared out, the plan was going to be shelved. But on the recommendation of one of her advisors a bounty was setup for anyone who could clear out the kobolds and destroy whatever it is they're worshipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reward was set at 50 gold coins, and included claim to any items found within, whether left behind by the previous operators, or the kobolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
