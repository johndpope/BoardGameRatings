			<description>Cowdown - A space opera of loss and revenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this platform Jump&amp;amp;Run you need to save your star cows, which have been abducted by a ruthless rustler. He brought them to his flying range land platform, where they are waiting to be rescued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every platform loses energy as longer as you stay on it and will fall down after 10 seconds. So don't waste time, collect all star cows and get back to your rocket.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand each loss of energy and platforms is a damage to the evil rustler. Get better and higher scores by getting every platform out of the sky. If you do not want to wait the 10 seconds use your special move (space bar and down) to destroy a platform instantly. But be careful not to destroy your way back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Ludum Dare game entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
