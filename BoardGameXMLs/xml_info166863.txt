			<description>Glyphs is a 4 player trick taking game based on Whist. It plays similarly to hearts, spades, and bridge, but with expanded play. Players will create a shape of cards, called a Reference Glyph, and then attempt to gain ownership of it by recreating the actual Glyph through trump style game play. One team must attempt to create the glyph of cards through play, while their opposing team tries to deny them points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glyphs is played in turns comprised of three phases. The first phase involves creating the Glyph of cards. The second phase is the conflict to build and control the glyph. The third phase is scoring for the Aggressor team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
