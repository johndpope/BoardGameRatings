			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is not what you think it is. Evil is real, demons walk the Earth and Hell hungers for every human soul. The ignorant masses are powerless against the hordes arrayed against them - but you are not. You dare to stand up as a force for good in a world of corruption. You are Immaculate... and all the powers of Hell shall not prevail against you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immaculate is a role-playing game set in a world much like our own. Players take on the roles of agents of good who wage a lonely war against the armies of evil... and against the temptation to fall into the Dark. Your numbers are few, your foes many and powerful, but hope remains alive. When the shadow within your soul is strongest, will you continue to fight the good fight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: this game is intended for mature audiences. It contains treatments of religious themes that may be offensive to some readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
