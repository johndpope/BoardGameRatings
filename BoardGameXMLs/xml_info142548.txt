			<description>from the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fantasy of Eight Gaming System (F8S for short or simply &amp;quot;FATES&amp;quot;), serves many purposes.  First of all it is a way for the readers of my novels to actually play within the worlds of the Pleides (pronounced Pl-I-Dez, or Pl-A-u-dez depending on ones preference and locale).  Secondly as a life long role player myself I wanted to create a simple system for people to play with (some systems out there are too intricate for the average person and too time consuming).  I wanted to give both the players and the controller of the game (Director of Gaming, D.G., or DIG) as much to play with.  Too many rules stifle the will and imagination I always say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
