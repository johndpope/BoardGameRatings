			<description>&amp;quot;SSX (Snowboard Supercross) is the first in a series of snowboarding video games published by EA Sports BIG. It was the first game to be published under the brand, which specializes in extreme sports titles with an unrealistic or arcade feel. As such, the game's exaggerated jumps, highly decorated mountain runs and improbable tricks make it a classic example of an EA Sports BIG title. It was developed by EA Canada and released with the launch of the PlayStation 2 on October 26, 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was widely regarded by critics as one of the best PS2 launch games, thanks to its depth, gameplay and graphics. The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences awarded SSX with 5 awards, including &amp;quot;Console Sports Game of The Year&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Racing Game of The Year&amp;quot;. The Executive Producer and creative leader of SSX was Steve Rechtschaffner, who was also the inventor of the now Olympic snowboard event called Boardercross, which served as the inspiration for the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SSX,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
