			<description>From the Zillions-of-Games site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tyr is a variant of Hasami-Shogi. Object: Be the first to establish a Phalanx inside enemy territory. A Phalanx consists of 5 pieces in a line in any direction and is made up of 1 Lord and 4 Warriors. Enemy territory corresponds to the 5 rows on the opponents side of the board. The middle row, marked with the crisscrosses, is considered the front line of the battle and therefore mutually shared by both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may also win by making it impossible for their opponent to create a Phalanx, either by capturing all four of their opponent's Lords or reducing their opponent's Warriors to three or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warriors slide like rooks in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down, left,or right. It can also make a single jump over another piece of either color that is adjacent to it horizontally or vertically. The jumping piece lands on the other side. This is not a capture. The only capturing is achieved by sandwiching your opponent's pieces between yours along a row or column. This is similar to Reversi, except that the pieces are removed from the board instead of flipped. A sandwich capture along an edge may wrap around the corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords have the additional power of moving and capturing diagonally. So they slide like Queens in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down, left, right or diagonally. They may jump over another piece in any direction. Also they can make captures diagonally in coordination with another friendly piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
