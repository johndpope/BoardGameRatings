			<description>Night Driver is a 1976 arcade game by Atari Inc. It is the original first-person racing game, and is believed to be the first published game to display real-time first-person graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a car which must be driven along a road at nighttime without crashing into the sides of the road as indicated by road side reflectors. The coin operated game had a choice of three tracks from which the player could choose at game start. The turns were sharper and more frequent on the more difficult tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to limitation of arcade technology at the time, the car the player is driving is not actually drawn by the game. Instead, the car is a printed plastic insert that is laid under the screen. Also, the fact that the car is driving at night made it easier for the programmers to draw the environment with limited graphics at the time; as most things (street, buildings, ...) didn't need to be drawn because they were supposedly completely dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Night_Driver,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
