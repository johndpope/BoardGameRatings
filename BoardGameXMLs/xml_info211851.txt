							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Knights of the Watch - The Knights of Dispatch</name>
									
			<description>An organization dedicated to the defense of the Sheldomar Valley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Knights of the Watch formed several centuries ago, built upon the foundation an earlier organization based in Gran March. Tasked with protecting Keoland, Gran March, Bissel and Geoff from the incursions of Paynims and westerlings, the Watchers, as they are generally known, hold several castles, fortresses and strongholds along the border with Ket, as well as in the western mountains. The order's strongest bases of power can be found in Gran March (Hookhill), Geoff (Hochoch), and Bissel (Pellak), though members of the knighthood are drawn from the best and wisest of the lands throughout the Sheldomar Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document was created by the individuals responsible for writing and organizing the Living Greyhawk meta-regional play in the Sheldomar Valley.  It was used in an official capacity, but was not published by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
