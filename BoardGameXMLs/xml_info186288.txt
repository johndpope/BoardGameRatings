							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor M</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A genius on the brink of Madness... Dr. M!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 10 Renegade, Dr. M is a scientific genius who stands on the precipice of madness! Manon St. Martin is not afraid to put her mutagenic skills to use when the situation calls for it, and experience has taught her to trust her instincts. Her followers, the Muta-Men, are devoted followers who stand by their benefactor's brilliance. Dr. M is a classic mad scientist archetype in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. M is designated &amp;quot;Blue&amp;quot; for her technological origins. Inspired by classic &amp;quot;meddling&amp;quot; mad doctors like Dr. Moreau, she brings a new twist to the genre by saving lives instead of destroying them(so far!). As a Renegade, she lives outside the law (and well outside the normal shipping lanes), but may encounter your heroes for any number of reasons. She might serve as a potential scientific consultant on strange cases, the source of an unintended biological disaster, or even a strange romantic interest for a scientifically-minded hero! Presented along with several examples of her Muta-Men, she will be a memorable addition to any superhero's supporting cast.Jack Norris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
