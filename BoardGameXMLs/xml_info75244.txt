			<description>From Wikipedia supplemented by User Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Toon Adventures: The Great Beanstalk (known as Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster and the Beanstalk in Europe) is the first Tiny Toon Adventures-related game released on the PlayStation. It was developed by Terraglyph Interactive Studios and published by NewKidCo on November 1, 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a game for the Personal Computer by the name of Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster and the Beanstalk that is very similar to this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storyline&lt;br/&gt;Plucky Duck and Buster Bunny has found the Great Beanstalk, in this Jack and the Beanstalk-inspired game. In this game, you play as Plucky Duck who is following Buster Bunny as they climb the beanstalk and explore the areas above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;This is a relatively simple game with a difficulty that has perhaps been adjusted to its intended audience. The game consists of two distinct segments, the first where you play as Plucky and follow Buster through the beanstalk, the second when arrive 'on' the beanstalk. This second part is 'point and click', where the player must click on the right pixels on the screen. Hints are provided during this process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
