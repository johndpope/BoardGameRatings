							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Decisive Campaigns: Case Blue</name>
									
			<description>In Decisive Campaigns: Case Blue players take command of the German Wehrmacht or the Soviet Army on the Eastern Front in World War II in the summer of 1942. Assume control of the Wehrmacht&amp;rsquo;s drive towards Stalingrad and the Caucasus in the 2nd Kharkov Offensive and in Operation Trappenjagd. Fight for the Motherland as the general of the Red Army during Soviet counter-offensive in Operation Uranus that encircled the German 6th Army at Stalingrad and change the course of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decisive Campaigns: Case Blue comes loaded with four campaign scenarios, a linked scenario campaign of the 1st Panzer Army, and two smaller scenarios. For the more creative wargamers: a full scenario editor is included! Decisive Campaigns: Case Blue also brings with it a well-researched historical simulation to satisfy any grognard and history strategy game buff. New to the Decisive Campaign series are the brand-new High Command rules: follow your orders and be rewarded with prestige points to spend on reinforcements and influence future orders; fail at these and face dismissal, or worse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
