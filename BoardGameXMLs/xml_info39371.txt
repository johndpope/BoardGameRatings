			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you know that Barry B. Benson (Bee Movie) broke the &amp;quot;never talk to a human&amp;quot; rule? Or that Bow Wow was born Shad Gregory Moss?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actors, musicians, move and animation characters! Play the game and guess who they are! Famous Name Us! gives you 4 clues that start out vague and get specific. If your team members guess the famous name on the first clue you earn 20 points. Guess it on the fourth REALLY specific clue and you earn only 5 points. Be the first team to earn 300 points and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
