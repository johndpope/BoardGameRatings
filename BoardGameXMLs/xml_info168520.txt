			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve died, come back, and now have a ravenous thirst for the blood of the living. Most regard you as an unnatural mockery of life, a monster just barely able to keep it&amp;rsquo;s murderous instincts in check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To a point, they&amp;rsquo;re right: you need to drink blood in order to stave off the thirst, and the longer you go without sating it the more you can feel it gnawing at you. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t feed by choice? Eventually something else will take over and make you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new (un)life does have it&amp;rsquo;s upsides: you&amp;rsquo;re stronger and faster than the normal human, your sense of sight and smell are greatly enhanced, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to eat or sleep, and can withstand a staggering amount of punishment without dying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not all that bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the rest of our playbooks, this product is two files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a digest-sized, 26-page book laid out Dungeon World-style. It comes with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The vampire, with 22 advanced moves that let you stalk, charm, and tear apart your prey.&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons and dungeon gear, some extra moves that didn't quite make the cut, and the vampire spawn compendium class.&lt;br/&gt;    A behind the scenes look at our design decisions, as well as clarifications on some of the moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
