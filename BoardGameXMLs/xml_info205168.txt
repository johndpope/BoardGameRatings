			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Mist is a two-player card game, for players of all ages, that takes about 10 to 15 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses their hand of cards and plays according to their own strategy in an ever-changing board. By choosing among a range of mythical adventurers the players pick those that can help them populate the lands and score the most points for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;However, each player carries the support of a faction that wishes to influence their actions and lead their opponent to ruin.&lt;br/&gt;And once a victor is declared, the heroes carry on to a next expanse of land, forging new alliances and trying to bring prestige for themselves and their lords!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
