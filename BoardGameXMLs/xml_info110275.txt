			<description>In &amp;Aring;keri (&amp;quot;hauler firm&amp;quot;), players assume the roles of lorry drivers transporting goods, mostly fragile or hazardous ones, across a city. Four warehouses contain goods waiting to be evenly redistributed, and deliveries can be made along the bypass that connects the warehouses or through the unpredictable streets of the city centre. Hazards are found in the form of event cards and the blocking vehicles of other players. When a car crashes into a wall or hits another car, a die is rolled to determine whether there's damage to vehicles and goods, which can be costly or even disastrous. Players have the option to purchase insurance policies to mitigate the effect of such misfortunes, or to join into cooperatives with shared assets and some added benefits (the promotion of cooperative ideology being an explicit goal of the producer). The goal is to end up with the most money having made successful deliveries of valuable goods and avoided expenses caused by the destruction of goods or vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game is nominally for 4-8 players, it would no doubt be possible to play with 2 or 3, optionally with adjustments like having more than one car per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box sides show titles and short captions in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish, but the Swedish edition at least (assuming there are others) has a rules sheet in Swedish only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
