			<description>Four young gardeners have a communal garden in which each sets out to plant a row of flowers  However, that can be a complicated undertaking; sometimes the bed a gardener chooses is already planted or is reserved for a different color of flower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a color peg and takes 8 flowers, two of each color.  The players take turns rolling the die and moving their pegs in any direction he chooses but only in one direction.  If a player lands on an un-planted flower bed and has a flower of the same color as the bed, he can plant his flower.  But if the bed is already planted or the player does not have a flower to match the bed, he may not plant a flower.  After a player moves, his turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first play to plant all his flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
