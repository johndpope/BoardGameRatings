			<description>Object: To be the last player left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 36 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you begin, find 3 tokens (buttons, sweets etc.) for each player. These represent his 3 &amp;ldquo;lives&amp;quot; and when he has lost them he is out of the game. The pack consists of 4 sets of cards numbered from 1 to 9, which have the following order of importance from highest to lowest:&lt;br/&gt;Farmer's Wife, Dog, Cat, Mouse. Therefore, the 3 of &amp;quot;Dog&amp;quot; beats the 3 of &amp;ldquo;Cat&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer shuffles the pack and deals one card, face down, to each player. During the game you must try to avoid holding the lowest card. The first player to the dealer's left looks at his card.&lt;br/&gt;He can either say &amp;quot;Stick&amp;quot; and keep it or exchange it for the card belonging to the next player on his left in the hope of getting a higher number and/or set. The next player does the same and so on until it is the dealer's turn. He can either &amp;ldquo;Stick&amp;quot; or exchange his card for the top one of the pack.&lt;br/&gt;Then all players turn their cards face up and whoever holds the lowest one puts one token into the kitty.&lt;br/&gt;If 2 players hold the same lowest number, the lower set loses. All players put their cards onto a discard pile. The next player becomes the dealer. When the pack has been played through once, pick up the discard pile, shuffle it and play on. Play continues until there is only one player left who wins all the tokens from the kitty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
