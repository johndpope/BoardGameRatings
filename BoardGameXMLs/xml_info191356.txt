			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I choose weird stories because they suit my inclination best &amp;ndash; one of my strongest and most persistent wishes being to achieve, momentarily, the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of the galling limitations of time, space, and natural law...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; H.P. Lovecraft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydra Team and Wyrd Edizioni are excited to bring you Beyond the Edge #3: Weird Lore. It provides Numenera players and GMs with a deeper exploration of the weird and wondrous in The Scattered Lands, expanding the opportunities for adventure and discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set the scene, Weird Lore first considers the measures of weirdness and how they might impact the qualities and colour of your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scattered Lands dives into the history and geography of the region, providing suggestions on how you can adopt the Lands as the backdrop for your adventures and campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Consider the history and origins of the long dead Xendalian&lt;br/&gt;    Meet the challenges of the toxic deserts of the Broken Land of Tusi or submerge yourself in the inky bounds of the Sootsea&lt;br/&gt;    Hunt through the ruins and remains that survived The Wounding, the deathblow to the ancient civilisations of the region&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weird Lore then dives into five different weird themes, with material for both players and GMs, that play upon the strange and alien possibilities of the Scattered Lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Claim back the weird bloodline of The Scattered Lands with the Xendalian Descriptor&lt;br/&gt;    Deal in the trade of dreams and visions in the breath-taking city of Mirage&lt;br/&gt;    Uncover the experiments in mutation committed by Magister Taranthius - and, perhaps, become a party of mutants with a selection of new mutation based sub-Descriptors&lt;br/&gt;    Walk the wastes in the footsteps of the Clang One, a nomadic people descended from weird biotech experiments&lt;br/&gt;    Ride the winds between the islands of the Hanging Pelagus, free-floating islands that together hold the secret from beyond the Ninth World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
