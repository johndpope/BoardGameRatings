			<description>Going out to eat can be an expensive venture, but with Menu Math, players learn how to keep within their budget and interpret menus. Each player receives $60 and six menus. Choices range from short order restaurants like Grandma's Kitchen, to Chinese, Mexican, and Italian restaurants and dinner houses. There are two levels of difficulty in the game, and it 's great for use at home, or in learning centers. 2-4 players Grades 4-9&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
