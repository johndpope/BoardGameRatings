							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bingo Ball (Chart Football)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;This game is played in pairs and is enjoyable for 2 players as it is for 10&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game inspired by Battleships. Each player gets a card with two football pitches marked on it. One is for 'Your score sheet&amp;quot;, the other marked as 'Opponents score sheet&amp;quot;. You keep your card secret at all times. Each pitch is divided up into 10 squares across and 6 squares down. The rows across are represented by the letters A to F. The columns down are marked 1 to 10. So every square can be chosen by giving a letter and a number A7 or C2, for example. The idea is to trace a line from Row F up to row A, without running into a T square which represents a tackle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
