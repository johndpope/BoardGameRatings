							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Skull Mercenary Company</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your soldiers prove insufficient, when your armies are shattered by fearsome beasts or the humanoid hoards&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;if you still have money, there remains to you always:&lt;br/&gt;a path to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red Skull Mercenary Company will fight anyone, anywhere, as long as the price is right. Do you need wizards? Or warriors? Are your enemies holed up in cities, or giant fortresses? Fear not! The Red Skull Mercenary Company is famed across this land and so many others for its merciless siege engines! In addition, we have a plethora of experienced soldiers, magnificent mages, and skilled assassins. We can conquer any battlefield &amp;mdash; FOR YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A highly successful fighting company, the Red Skulls will work for nearly any employer, be they human, god, or monster. They desire only to live out their days surrounded by obscene wealth or to die in battle and dwell in Elysium forever. Their leaders have cultivated a sizeable organization of considerable variation, truly an organizational feat. Their representatives travel to conflict-torn areas offering their services, and can be found milling about in most major marketplaces of the world, especially the market in the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is entirely possible that independent adventurers might ant to hire trained mercenaries to aid them in the dungeon, once they have exhausted any local reservoirs of foolhardy torchbearers and stevedores, and found themselves in need of more competent help. The Red Skulls offer both human mercenaries and more expensive ogre fighters. You can imagine which is more in demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
