			<description>In Contact, players take turns as the Spy whose goal is to keep their chosen word secret. They reveal the first letter of their secret word to begin the round. Other players take turns interrogating/asking a question of the Spy who must truthfully answer, thus revealing what the secret word is not in the process. Their answers must also begin with the revealed letter(s). If a question stumps the Spy the other players may Contact the Interrogator to provide their answer. If the answers are the same then the Spy reveals the next letter in their secret word, thus making it harder to keep their word secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
