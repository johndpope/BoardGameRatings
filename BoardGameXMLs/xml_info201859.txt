			<description>&amp;quot;Nerves of Steel is a First-person shooter video game Developed by Rainmaker Software and BnB Software that was published by Merit Studios in 1995 for DOS Computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nerves of Steel is set in the near future in Southeast Asia where ruler Kim Dung Moon is set on purifying the world. Moon plans to carry out this plan through a system of elaborate tunnels called the 'Iron Triangle'. The player must infiltrate this tunnel system and defeat all soldiers and monsters in their path to stop Kim Dung Moon's evil plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is in a first-person perspective where the player uses rifles, pistols, and a rocket launcher to defeat monsters and soldiers in an underground tunnel complex. This game has a very similar control setup to Doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nerves of Steel is generally viewed as one of the worst first-person shooter video games of all time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerves_of_Steel Nerves of Steel]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
