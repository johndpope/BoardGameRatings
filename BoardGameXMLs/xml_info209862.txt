			<description>The active player chooses a random theme by throwing two numbered dice then throws six &amp;quot;words and phrases&amp;quot; dice and sorts them from lightest to darkest color. Each die shows a word or phrase on it's face and the player must use the words to tell a story using the dice in front of her, in order: &amp;quot;Did I tell you about...&amp;quot; . During the story, other players can throw an &amp;quot;interrupt&amp;quot; die and read the result aloud. The active player has to adapt her story to the interruption: &amp;quot;No, that's a lie!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all dice have been used up, the player throws a six sided die that gives her her score. Other players decide if she is allowed to throw another die to get a better score. As the rule book says &amp;quot;the scoring system is unfair, but life is unfair and this game... is life!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great fun for adults, and an amazing expression tool for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is almost identical to &amp;quot;Comment j'ai adopt&amp;eacute; un gnou&amp;quot;, but is better adapted for families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
