			<description>This game is set in the Spanish political environment of the late eighties and early nineties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Politics are like a game, and every day, in front of us, politicians compete to acquire power.  The competition is at its best every four years, like the Olympics, when the elections come.  The contenders must make an effort; it's the final sprint and the goal is near.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, for the first time, you can participate in this struggle for power with The Political Game (El Juego de la Pol&amp;iacute;tica).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you'll lead a political party and must win the elections.  To do so, you have to make a political program, taking left, right and center positions on issues such as NATO, taxes or autonomy. You'll have to get money, needed for the electoral campaign, to pay publicity, meetings, or launch attacks against other political parties to snatch votes away from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Political Game, an ideal game for groups, like in politics, agreements with other political forces are indispensable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll have to negotiate with the other players, make agreements with them, and betray them if you're interested in doing so.  You may loan them money to attack your most fierce rivals, and exchange favors or information.  Everything is valid in your effort to win the elections!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
