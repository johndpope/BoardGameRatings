			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the ancient mariners of Earth, spacefarers have their own brand of legends. One of the most prevelant and widely told is that of The Cold Equations. It is told in gloomy bars and freighter holds throughout the galaxy. It is always about a different ship - the Erasmus, the Lord Cheka, the Sha-Mak - yet it always involves the same dire choices for the two crewmen, trapped in an impossible situation...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cold Equations is an introductory adventure for the Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game: 2nd Edition. It is set at the start of 2259, in the second season of the television series (during the events of Points of Departure), and is designed for 1st level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure can be played as an introduction to the Babylon 5 campaign book, The Ragged Edge, or run as a stand-alone scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
