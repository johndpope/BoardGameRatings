			<description>From the Preface:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure tables suck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No really, it's like a video game. I open the chest, what do I find? Wait, wait for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's this cool list of items, with an extensive random table that doesn't take into account the power level of your group or the environment at all. How do I generate an appropriate list of items and treasure for an area without favoring certain PC's? How can I match the treasure with the approximate danger in the area? How can I randomly generate treasure that doesn't instantly unbalance my game because of a bad random roll (1% chance of an artifact I'm looking at you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I like to run a game that feels, I don't know, simulationist. And what did historical looters find of value?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furnishings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where are the tables for these things? Well, completely unsatisfied with every hodgepodge treasure table scattered all over the universe, I decided to compile a little document that would help me when preparing my games. Now you can roll up an 800 gp armoire that the players will walk right past when you roll that 20 for room contents. (Unguarded treasure?!) Now you can put more than enough treasure in the game for the players, and leave it up to them if they want to sell their diamond bells, or try to figure out how to move their 500 pounds of iron ingots. Now you can actually *know* how difficult to move whatever they find actually is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tables in this document are assuming that 60% or so of rooms are empty, and only 20% of the rooms contain treasure of any sort. All values are vaguely accurate and are designed to not break the suspension of disbelief in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is little description. Most of the following should be fairly self-explanatory. Enjoy. If there isn't a table for something, pick. Or roll 1d20 and count words, cycling around till you run out of numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
