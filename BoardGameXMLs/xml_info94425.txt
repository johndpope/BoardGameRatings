			<description>From the company website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Introducing Glide the fold-up tabletop shuffleboard game that's sure to be a hit with young and old alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take aim and carefully push the handmade GLIDE stones across the supersonically slippery board to land in the target. With a 4 foot long board, only the most skilled will have the aim to knock an opponent out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar in gameplay to actual shuffleboard and also to Sorry! Sliders board game. Each player shoots his stones down a 4' board, attempting to stop them inside of the bullseye.  Players are awarded 25-100 points based on where their stones end up by the end of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
