							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NWS: Nights of Fury â€“ Guadalcanal Naval Battles</name>
									
			<description>NWS: Nights of Fury - Guadalcanal Naval Battles is the first in a series of high intensity naval combat naval wargames that will offer realism and detail yet have streamlined and hard hitting game play for 2 players or solitaire play. Full color cards with highly detailed ship graphics for easy and quick recognition. Full color and detailed marker cards, random event cards, battle map, and plastic damage markers are also included. Full color island cards showing Savo, Florida, and Guadalcanal islands will also be used for the battle map. Scenario cards will include random events, weather, visibility, land effects, and other cards that will determine the setup and play of the battle. Quick result combat modifier charts will also be included to allow for fast reference to determine combat results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the critical details will be covered such as flotation and structural damage, spotting and detection, Admiral capabilities, formations, maneuvers, land effects, radar effects, armor ratings, fire controls, torpedo combat, gunnery, evasion, combat range effects, random events, crew qualities, searchlights and starshells, and more. This is not your typical generic naval card game where realism and detail are sacrificed for the sake of playability. The USN, RAN, and IJN ships each have their own researched and calculated combat factors and with the details to make combat realistic and effective. A rapid fire, efficient, and easy to learn combat system with basic, advanced, solitaire, and optional rules. No other naval combat card game has yet to incorporate the features this combat system will handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Info is available at: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://nws-online.proboards.com/thread/18/nights-fury&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://nws-online.proboards.com/thread/18/nights-fury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
