							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheerios Check-A-Lot</name>
									
			<description>A checkers variant published on the back of Cheerios cereal boxes for one summer during the 1990's.  The game was displayed on boxes that contained promotional 'X' shaped pieces of cereal amongst the tradiational 'O' shaped pieces, and different boxes featured different games to play with those pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Check-A-Lot game, each player has an array of pieces -- either all x's or all o's -- arranged on both red and white squares.  Players alternate making checkers-style movement across the board, obeying the special squares indicated on the board.  Naturally, you are encouraged to eat any opposing pieces you capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
