			<description>User Summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the year 1990. Terrorists have taken control of the worlds largest oil reserve and are threathening to blow it up, using a nuclear device. The crew was taken hostage and are being held captive throughout the different rooms.Despite coming prepared with a team of specialists your flight is shot down on the way in. Luckely you manage to survive and get aboard the rig, carrying no more than a 9mm gun and some explosives. At this time, the nuclear bomb has been armed and you have 1 hour to find it and disarm it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to overcome the terrorist threat you'll need more, (and preferably bigger) guns and ammo. The rig has many rooms and alot of them will contain items you can use. The hostages, who are scattered over the place, will be helpful to you by offering you information or passcards, that willenable you to get deeper in the rig. Other locked doors can be opened by using the less subtle explosives. The rig itself is a maze made up of different rooms connected with (locked) doors, ladders and elevators. Finding your way around isn't easy. &lt;br/&gt;While you are exploring, waves of terrorists will pop up, shouting at you in Arabic and shoot at you, unless you shoot them first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the graphics arent the best, the impacting bullets on the bodies where quite well done. Alot of the rooms seem alike, but then again, how much different surroundings can an oil rig have anyway?&lt;br/&gt;The sound effects are good, especially the gunfire sounded realistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been reported that the game can be completed in 10 minutes if you know where the bomb is, as the location of the items doesn't change between the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
