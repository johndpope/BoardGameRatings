							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fated Almanac</name>
									
			<description>From the kickstarter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the Breach is a tabletop roleplaying game set in the world of Malifaux. Players take on the roles of various citizens, such as Gunfighters, Drudges, Dabblers, and Entertainers. Each of these characters is as unique as the players themselves. These are the Fated. As a Fated, you know your future, it has been told to you, as cryptic as the sparrow on a moonless night. It is your task to rush headlong into the arms of destiny, or to carve your own future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes on the role of the Fatemaster. It is his duty to craft the legends of the other players, to narrate the story of Malifaux in his own vision, and to move each Fated along towards the moment when they must choose between their fortune and their soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
