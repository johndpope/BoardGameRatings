							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Were&quot; Have the Good Brothers Gone?</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short encounter &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; that is systemless and scalable for about any level of PCs in any OSR-style game. The design is deliberately vague in several areas to make it easy to &amp;quot;tweak &amp;amp; toss&amp;quot; into your current campaign. Perfect for when the party goes &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; when you expected them to go &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, any GM/DM/Judge can easily drop this into the current campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind this Tweak &amp;amp; Toss is that a small order of monks has come into possession of a certain book for study, and two of its order have gone missing after taking the book with them to read while tending to the order's flock of sheep. Were the Brothers attacked, or did something else happen? A list of suggested tweaks is available based on the percieved strength of your party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is intended to print this file two-sided and fold in half, zine-style. Just select &amp;quot;booklet printing&amp;quot; and make sure that you have duplex set up on the short edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF download consists of three pages of content (map, encountes, and basic set-up). There are a couple of hotlinks within the file taking you to some additional resources, one of which is the Patreon site where you can download better versions of the maps if you so desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
