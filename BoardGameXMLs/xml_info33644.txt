							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Play It Safe: The Farm Safety Challenge Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is designed to help teachers and 4H group leaders teach kids about farm safety.  One person takes the role of game leader and runs the game without playing; everyone else splits into two, three or six teams.  Each team gets a farm animal paddle -- this paddle is passed from player to player within the team, and only the player holding the paddle at any given time may answer questions (though the whole team may influence those answers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play, teams take turns answering question cards in six categories: F.Y.I., In the Moos, You Herd It Here, Ouch, Seeing is Believing, and Heads Up.  Cards have a base point value of either 10 or 20 points, and all the 10-point cards are played before the 20-point cards.  All of the category cards feature a question about farm safety, and some also include bonus questions which can be answered for additional points if the first question is answered correctly.  Some cards require the players to look at large 11x14 photos showing farm activities and equipment.  Wild cards with general, non-farm-themed trivia may optionally be mixed in, and Daily Double cards may be added to force players to wager points on certain questions instead of using their face values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game leader decides the exact mix and number of cards, so the game can be weighted to favor particular topics and length of play can be shortened or lengthened as necessary.  Regardless of which cards are used during play, the game must be set up so that all teams get to answer the same number of questions, and the team with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
