			<description>Kites are a fun way to spend an afternoon in the park&amp;ndash; if only the wind wouldn&amp;rsquo;t keep tangling up the strings! Race against the other players each round to be the first to figure out who is holding the kite shown on the die roll. This is a great way for kids to practice holding attention and mentally tracing a route in their heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the players roll the die.  This determines the color that is being tracked this turn.  At the same time, all players should mentally follow the string from the kite down to figure out which character is holding the other end of the string.  Players must not use their fingers, just follow the string's path in their heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once someone thinks they have the right answer, yell &amp;quot;STOP!&amp;quot; and grab the matching Solution Tile.  Everyone checks together to see if this is the correct solution.  Collect a Pinwheel for a correct answer, but lose a Pinwheel if you're wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll yellow and the yellow balloon is showing near the characters, players have to grab the Yellow Balloon Solution Tile instead of tracing the yellow kite's string.  Similarly, if you roll orange and Squawk the parrot is showing near the kites, players have to grab the Squawk Solution Tile instead of tracing the orange kite's string.  You lose a Pinwheel if you grab another Solution Tile when you should have chosen Squawk or the balloon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with double-sided Character and Kite boards, and 2 double-sided and reversible String Boards to keep players guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN:  Mental Mapping, Color Recognition, Quick Thinking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
