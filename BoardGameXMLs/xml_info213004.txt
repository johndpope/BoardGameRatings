			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rewired is a &amp;quot;Quick and Dirty&amp;quot; cyberpunk role-playing game. It is a world burned by nuclear fires, locked down by authoritarian states, consumed in corporate greed, and inflicted with technological cancers. It's the grungy, bullet-filled, wet neon streets of the yesterday&amp;rsquo;s future &amp;ndash; or the reality we are just moments from experiencing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of Ronin &amp;ndash; professional troubleshooters and freelance operatives for hire, willing to stick their necks out on the line for some quick credit. Hackers, gearheads, guns for hire and muscle for rent just make up a few of the anti-heroes of the dark near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game system is to provide a gritty, deadly set of rules that plays as fast as the genre. Other such games can get weighed down in complex mechanics, redundant weapon catalogs and ridiculous skills lists. Our aim is to keep character creation quick and flexible, combat fast and deadly, and still maintain a level of detail to keep the tactically minded satisfied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
