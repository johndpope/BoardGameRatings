			<description>Accompany Jerry as he travels this mystic world and unravel the Marquis' sinister secret. 12 year old Jerry's greatest dream is to become a wizard. During the final days of summer vacation this dream seems to become reality: a tall, elegantly dressed rabbit, the Marquis de Hoto, appears out of thin air and offers Jerry an apprenticeship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of them venture into a fantastic world; a world where talking animals and magic, mysterious creatures dwell. But as the spell of the vile wizard Zaroff takes hold of the people and the world itself, Jerry's magic adventure turns into a nightmare. And slowly the boy comes to realize, the enigmatic rabbit had his reasons to make him his apprentice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Jerry and his friends, Plato and Kitsune, succeed in foiling the Great Zaroff's schemes? What sinister secrets does the Marquis try to hide? The answers are buried deep within the dark woods of a mystical world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
