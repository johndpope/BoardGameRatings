			<description>From back cover of Game box :&lt;br/&gt;Find your chicks that have escaped and are hiding with the other chicks and bring them back to your home.&lt;br/&gt;Every hen and every chick has a magnet inside, which causes the hens and chicks to be attracted to each other or repelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve chicks are hiding in the fields from the mother hens who must bring them home to the poultry-yards. Each of the chicks and hens fit on magnetic bases. Players throw the die and move their hen along the path. When the hen comes to a hiding chick, she moves as close as possible. The chick will either cling to the mother or be repelled, indicating which hen is the mother. The clinging chicks are taken back by the mother to home. First player to return 3 chicks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this game cannot (fairly) be played with three players, as this would leave one player (who has the hen polarized differently to the other two) with a wider selection of chicks, and thus would need to move less to obtain them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
