			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Bother the apocalypse. Bother demons. Bother failure. Bother many things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gentle Ladies&amp;rsquo; Tea &amp;amp; Monstrosity Destroying &amp;amp; Quilting Circle Auxiliary is a Machine Age Production. It is a game about destroying nuisances before they ruin tea. Because no matter how wicked the end of times, there's no excuse for incivility. This is not post-apocalyptic, it is proper-apocalyptic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have need of dice. Four sided, six, eight, ten, twelve, and twenty. As is traditional. Remember extras for guests! Set your center piece on the credenza and gather your dice in its stead. You will have need of some notions. Buttons, thimbles, or perhaps a helping of macaroons. One shouldn&amp;rsquo;t face the forces of evil without a taste of sweetness, after all. Pencils are also quite useful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh my dear! I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you could finally join us. I know Margret can be a touch, shall we say, picky about who gets these invitations, but now that you&amp;rsquo;ve risen to her approval, welcome! I thought as we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten together to craft, stitch, and destroy the blackest souls of destruction, it would only be proper as a hostess to give you every comfort. Make yourself at home, there&amp;rsquo;s tea. You&amp;rsquo;ll need honey, as we&amp;rsquo;ve no sugar cubes. Radiation does silly things to the sugar cubes, sadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Machine Age Productions are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike/NonCommercial license. Share it all you want. If you want to sell it, talk to us first. Pretty simple, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
