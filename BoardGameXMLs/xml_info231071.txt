			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were an adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadly with a blade or a bow, you wandered the ruins of the ancient past or the lairs of vicious monsters in search of glory and treasure. Your companions were others like you - competent in their fields, specialized, and hungry for gain. Maybe you were a veteran, searching for a place or a reason to settle down and end your wandering. Maybe you were a fresh-faced teen, newly out of whatever apprenticeship you endured, or striking out on your own with nothing but whatever gear you could scrounge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever the case, you met with a bad end. You were an adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
