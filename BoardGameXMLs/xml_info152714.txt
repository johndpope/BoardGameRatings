			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 3055, an unknown pirate menace threatened several Lyran border worlds. Known only as the &amp;quot;Red Corsair&amp;quot;, this brutal pirate leader broke several militias and preyed upon her victims with no mercy. In response to ComStar's pleadings, forces from Clan Wolf and the famed mercenary Kell Hounds pursued the mysterious pirate band across several Lyran worlds to a climactic showdown deep in Clan Wolf space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operational Turning Points: Red Corsair opens up the battle for players to join in the fight (as detailed in Michael Stackpole's novel Natural Selection) using the successful Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to a time when tensions were high along the Lyran-Falcon border, and one wrong move might spark another interstellar war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual Missions and Touchpoints, following a campaign arc, and inserting it into their own campaigns. This PDF exclusive includes detailed information on several of the worlds affected by the Red Corsair, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict, an overview of the historical campaign, and several tools and tracks that players can use to run historical characters and battles from this time period. Only the players&amp;rsquo; imaginations are the limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
