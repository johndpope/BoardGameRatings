							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mach: The First Colony</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mach's tagline is &amp;quot;A role playing game of soldiers of fortune in a New World.&amp;quot; It's a self-contained sci-fi RPG with a unique premise: Aliens called the Abla come to Earth in the late 20th century, inform humanity of an impending catastrophe, and transport the entire human race to the colony world of Mach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box set contains three black-and-white 32-page booklets. Books I and II (they are otherwise untitled) contain the rules for the game; there's no clear reason as to why some rules are in one book as opposed to the other. The third, III, is an adventure entitled &amp;quot;Frontier Series #1: Guilden's Farm.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mach uses traditional polyhedral dice, mainly percentile, and has a &amp;quot;sandbox&amp;quot; feel to it. The group is encouraged to decide what their version of Mach is like, develop the starting region, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
