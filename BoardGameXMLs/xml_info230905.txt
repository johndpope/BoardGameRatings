							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Glart Smashrip</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An impressively obese Smashrip attends the tryouts for the Warpfire Wanderers, but is laughed out of the line-up. His chances aren&amp;rsquo;t improved when he eats the team&amp;rsquo;s assistant coach to prove a point, but news travels fast, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t long before the Skavenblight Scramblers scout him out and offer him a place on their roster. Eventually, after some unpleasantness including a lifetime ban for eating a referee (which was eventually overturned) he became a free agent, bombarded with offers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field the gloriously portly Glart Smashrip as a Star Player in your Skaven or Underworld Denizens Blood Bowl teams by picking up this resin kit. The first thing you&amp;rsquo;ll notice about Glart is his size &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no hiding that this is a Skaven of impressive girth, who barely fits into the ramshackle armour that has been attached to his bulk with creaking straps. He isn&amp;rsquo;t bothering with head protection as there aren&amp;rsquo;t any helmets that would fit and, honestly, they just get in the way of eating stuff. Luckily, someone has found a swathe of cloth large enough to hide most of his unmentionables, and he features the usual spiky bits on his shoulders and knee pads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resin kit comes as 8 components with a 32mm round Blood Bowl base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
