							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vice Squad: Miami Under Fire</name>
									
			<description>Miami Under Fire takes you back to a time and place that never was: 1980s Miami. Think palm trees, pastel colors, pink flamingos, neon lights, hit music, bongo drums, bikinis, designer clothes, speedboats, and million-dollar drug deals. Think flamboyant cocaine cowboys, ruthless drug czars, and the honest cops who oppose them. Think action, action, and more action as you investigate drug lord murders, arrest arms dealers, break up a gang war, stop a drug kingpin's play for power, and infiltrate the Colombian cartels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miami Under Fire includes an entertaining recap of the early 1980s, a detailed investigative scenario, original artwork, 11 battle maps, select 1980s weapons and vehicles statted for the genreDiversion i rules, and ten pre-generated characters including a squad of vice detectives (led by a stubble-jawed cop and his street savvy partner), a surveillance specialist, a homicide detective, a S.W.A.T. sharpshooter, a pair of beat cops, and even an IAD detective in disguise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
