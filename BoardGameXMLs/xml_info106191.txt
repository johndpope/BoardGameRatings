			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The staging of the 2004 Olympic Games has brought a time of great potential for Greece; not only did it provide valuable tourism, but it also marked the return of the world's greatest athletic contest to its country of origin. To help continue this spirit of cooperation, the Greek government has organized other gala events that share a similar spirit of peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such event is a conference of the world's most influential archaeologists, representatives of the most prestigious universities, museums and private institutions from around the globe. In addition to showing off the country's rich archaeological sites, the conference is also a chance to facilitate negotiations to return a number of ancient Greek artifacts that were removed by agents of other countries. Due in part to the recent Olympic Games, the event is being conducted with a spirit of cooperation and mutual celebration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, the two events have combined to facilitate a most fortuitous occurrence. As part of the preparation that was undertaken for the influx of tourists, the Greek government had authorized an almost unprecedented level of construction and similar development. One such project, under the supervision of a local construction contractor named Alexos Konstantinos, uncovered a series of tunnels beneath the Akropolis. Previously unknown, these tunnels could yield a wealth of new information regarding that famed landmark. Konstantinos promptly contacted Geoffrey Turner, a Candadian engineer and historian, and the two have begun an investigation of the tunnels in haste, with the hopes that some of the discoveries made their might be publicized as a culmination to the archaeological conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nemesis is an adventure for the D20 Modern Roleplaying Game, recommended for use with the Treasure Hunter supplement.  It is intended for a party of roughly six third-level characters. It is recommended, but not required, that this adventure be played after the events of QA-01: The Mystery and the Tomb and  QA-02: Spoils of War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
