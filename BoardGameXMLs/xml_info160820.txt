			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mercenaries spied a small door to their right which led into the warehouse. The mist only became thicker the closer they approached the door. Assuming their regular positions, Geremiah tapped the control box. The mercenaries froze as they stared into the creatures&amp;rsquo; nest. Sthol reached out and tapped the control box again, closing the door. The mercenaries stepped back, staring at each other with discerning looks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sthol looked deeply at the others. &amp;ldquo;Did you see that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geremiah nodded his head. &amp;ldquo;It looks like the nest. There was some giant, bulbous creature on the far side, probably a hundred of those skittering, scorpion things, and a handful of the larger ones. This must be the mother, and those little ones must be her offspring. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming they grow into the larger creatures we&amp;rsquo;ve already fought.&amp;rdquo; Geremiah glanced toward the far wall. Using his night vision goggles, he could see vents along the way. &amp;ldquo;The small ones must be traversing the ship through the vents. They must fall into the rooms, get stuck, and grow into the larger ones. That explains why the control boxes are all intact.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mercenary Breed 2.0!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenary Breed is a science fiction action and adventure toolkit and sandbox setting for Legend. The core setting set is broken into three rulebooks: Mercenary&amp;rsquo;s Handbook, Galaxy Guide, and Xenopedia. The Mercenary&amp;rsquo;s Handbook is the player&amp;rsquo;s guide including everything they need to create characters across a multitude of science fiction themes including space opera, sci-fi horror, and pulp sci-fi. Characters could be bounty hunters, scouts, helmsmen, demolitions experts, biohackers, neuromancers, scientists, engineers, and a whole lot more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenary Breed is designed to embrace all styles of science fiction setting and campaign design with a number of toolkits and discussions to make that happen. Mercenary&amp;rsquo;s Handbook provides the character options players can choose from to create those different characters including those utilizing Tech Backgrounds &amp;ndash; the sci-fi equivalent of Arcane Backgrounds, but based on technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenary&amp;rsquo;s Handbook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6 xeno templates representing different species for the characters to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;     Reputation-based equipment requisition.&lt;br/&gt;     New Hindrances.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 30 new Edges.&lt;br/&gt;     Sci-fi weapons, armor, and equipment to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;     Information on how to apply different sci-fi themes.&lt;br/&gt;     6 Tech Backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip; and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
