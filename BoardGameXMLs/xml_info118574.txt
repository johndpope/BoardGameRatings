							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superhero League of Hoboken</name>
									
			<description>Superhero League of Hoboken is a computer game from Legend Entertainment, designed by interactive fiction designer Steve Meretzky. The game combines the adventure and role-playing video game styles of play and the superhero, comedy and post-apocalypse genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was available on both floppy disk and CD-ROM. It uses 256 colour 2D graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future, the world is ravaged by wars, nuclear disasters and pollution. Mutations become common, resulting to individuals and creatures with mutant superpowers who unite in crime and become supervillains. However other individuals decide to unite their powers for the common good and become superheroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the post-apocalyptic New Jersey-New York-Pennsylvania Tri-state area, where the player controls a team of off-beat and often useless superheroes who battle a number of strange enemies, most notably the evil Dr. Entropy, a human jack-in-the-box with plans to bring chaos in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The missions in the game were typically offbeat or featured satire of present-day society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anytime the player can choose their off-beat team from a retinue of characters. The off-beat protagonist is the Crimson Tape, whose power is to make organizational charts. His off-beat companions are the Iron Tummy, who can eat any amount of spicy food without suffering intestinal distress, Treader Man who is a fantastic swimmer, the Tropical Oil Man, who defeats villains by giving them high cholesterol, the Oxide Man who can damage mechanical enemies such as robots etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every character has three stats which help him in battle: Brawn stat determines weapon damage, Brains affects the effectiveness of super powers, and Toughness is the character's defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character can be taught or achieve a secondary superpower by drinking colored liquids bought or found anywhere in the game. Superpowers mostly are used in combat, although the superpowers of some characters are just a part of the plot (e.g. for solving some certain puzzles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
