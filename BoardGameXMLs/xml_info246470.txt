			<description>Competing farmers are all trying to use the same farmland to grow their crops. They realized that in order to keep the pests away it's best to mix the crops they grow onto the same field. The challenge is that the farmers can't agree on who should plant which crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use seeds (coins) or dice to move their tractors (pawns) around the board while trying to form patterns with the seeds. Successful patterns are rewarded with prizes from the county fair and collecting enough prizes wins the game. The seeds grow four different crops: arms are almonds, crowns are corn, moons are melons, and suns are sunflower seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, choose whether you're going to move using a seed or a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seed - Pick a seed from your hand, and show the value to the other players. Play the seed suit side up on the board space under your tractor, and move the tractor. The seed's suit tells you which direction to move and the seed's value tells you how far to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die - Choose the die for the direction you want to move. Roll the die to determine how far you move in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you finish your move on a space with a seed, pick it up and place it in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;If you finish your move on another player's tractor, pick it up and place it in any empty space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you created a diagonal, vertical, or horizontal line with three seeds of one suit, take the prize tile of that suit from the county fair. A line of four seeds with one of each suit collects the grid tile as a mixed harvest prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning&lt;br/&gt;Collect three prizes to win. In a four player game, play as partners with the opposite player and collect three prizes as a team to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
