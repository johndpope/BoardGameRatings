							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Day After Tomorrow</name>
									
			<description>The first 4x strategy game fully integrated into an immersive storytelling/choose-your-own-adventure system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;60 years after the most powerful nations on Earth obliterated the planet, small tribes emerge to transition from mere survivors into a functioning society. You play as the leader of one of these tribes, each with a unique method of governing their people, a specific moral alignment, and explicit spiritual beliefs. You are leading a small group of lieutenants and followers. Your objective, specific to your unique character and motivations, is to mold this emerging world in the way you best see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the wasteland to find essential materials, find and recruit other small pockets of survivors, and discover the competing tribes. You must conquer hearts, minds and bodies if you want to emerge as your region's guiding force in forging the world to come The Day After Tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early game, players explore and expand by revealing hidden tiles, hoping to find modest food sources that will allow them to add tribe members, find groups of other survivors who may be interested in joining forces, fighting for their autonomy, or simply keeping an arms-length relationship. Most importantly players are hoping to find precious rare materials such as ammunition, horses and power sources to assist their growth and expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through exploration players discover one another on our unique modular hex map system. Then the main phase of the game begins, where culture and religion pass between connected tribes, where the leaders fight for the best people, and each tribe's rare and valuable resources are being plundered during daring raids and defended by courageous sacrifices. Tribes will need to work together in order to achieve shared ends, but ultimately the most important thing is: will your particular vision for the world to come end up proving dominant?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters in The Day After Tomorrow are brought to life with voluminous text in a choose-your-own-adventure style. You will need to carefully roleplay your leader as adhering to his or her particular moral, spiritual and governmental predilections is required to achieve success. There will be numerous character choices for players to make and, for those who want The Day After Tomorrow to do so, the design is intended to support deep RPG-style character play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
