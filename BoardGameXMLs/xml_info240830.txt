			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off the Beaten Path is a collection of five short adventures for 5th Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons but can also be easily adapted for other game systems. Though stats are provided for 5th edition you can easily adapt these adventures for other game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the children of the village of Quiet Acres have been going missing for the past few years. Though their crops and livestock are doing better than ever they cannot explain or fgure out what has happened to so many of their children. The few villagers who have been courageous enough to go into the Dark Forest to search for their loved ones never return. The villagers and farmers in the region are scared to leave their homes at night and many have seen strange glowing orbs oating through the air all throughout the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
