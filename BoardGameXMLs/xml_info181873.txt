							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice &amp; Glory RPG Core Rulebook (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Edition Core Rulebook for the Dice &amp;amp; Glory tabletop role-playing system, a game system for those not afraid to be imaginative. This book provides all of the basic parts of the D&amp;amp;G system to craft your own unique worlds. This pen &amp;amp; paper dice based system uses reduced character classes, a stylized turn based combat system, a simplified skill system, skill-based psionics system and a unique and detailed skill-based magic/spell system. This allows Game Masters and Players near complete freedom to craft worlds and characters to their personal tastes and needs in any game setting imaginable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall D&amp;amp;G system consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A unique &amp;quot;cash-in&amp;quot; Experience point system where players can build fully customized characters bit-by-bit and gain points for such actions as playing in character. Experience points are used to buy such things as feats, and combat bonuses which have attached experience point costs.&lt;br/&gt;    Characters are built from initial basic character classes which generalize the character's role in the campaign and from there the player evolves them by spending experience points. The simplified character classes are: Brick, Fighter, Adventurer, Rogue, Mage, Psychic and Clergy even Classless! Character classes determine bonus HD, your primary saving throw and a single class ability.&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed but easy-to-use Combat system using its own class-like level system. Combat is turn based using a melee round system where a player gets a set number of attacks/actions per melee round and where 4 melee rounds equals 1 minute. It also uses a D20 + modifiers for resolution and defined combat maneuvers to allow customization of fighting style.&lt;br/&gt;    A skill system that is easy to use and adapt to any situation. Skill definitions are general and allow for their narrowing to a specialized purpose. Skills use points to raise their rank, are dependent on a given base attribute and use a D20 + modifiers for resolution.&lt;br/&gt;    A unique and in depth Magic system which uses a magic source system that determines if casting a spell is a skill-based check, point expenditure or limited by a number of spells per day. Spells are composed of well defined modular parameters which allow for Game Masters and players to easily learn to write their own.&lt;br/&gt;    And the skill-based Psionics distinguishes itself from the magic system no longer relegating psionics to &amp;quot;a poor man's magic system&amp;quot;! Psionic powers are skill based rolls where the difficulty is determined by a flexible list of modifiers for distance, targets and area of effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system also incorporates a detailed uncanny abilities system used for creature abilities or for use as powers in a super-hero campaign and a full chapter on constructing monsters and races for Game Masters. For those Game Masters and Players yearning for more creativity and flexibility the D&amp;amp;G system is what you are looking for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
