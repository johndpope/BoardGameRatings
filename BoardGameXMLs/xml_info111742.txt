			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walk It Out is a fitness game in which players walk in first-person view through a large city. The city starts out empty, with colored capsules hovering everywhere. Players earn points by stepping in time with the beat of the song currently playing--one point per step. They can then use their points to buy the colored capsules, which burst open with everything from streetlamps to trees to buildings to giant blimps. The objects remain in the city from session to session, so players can gradually build up their personal cities. The time of day is also a factor: the game sets the lighting to reflect the current (real-life) time of day. Players can later gain abilities to change the time of day to any time they like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
