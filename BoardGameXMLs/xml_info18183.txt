			<description>CHALLENGE ANNEKA is a board game based on the BBC TV series of the same name in which presenter Anneka Rice is given a finite amount of time to complete a given task - this must be completed by persuading people to provide freely of their time, money and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Take your challenge card, read it, make your way to a start location and you're off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you have to race against time, and the other players to collect all the Joiners, Bricks, Printers, Florists, Pop Stars, Movie Stars ... and of course plenty of volunteers ... you may need to complete your challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can rush around the board visiting various locations to find Volunteers or use your trusty mobile phone to call any number in the telephone directory to collect the other items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But remember that the other players are after the same things and the time is always ticking away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need all your wits about you to be the first player to complete the challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
