			<description>Plagiat of &amp;quot;Scotland Yard&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Made in Czechoslovakia some time in the late 80s.&lt;br/&gt;One of the players takes on the role of Agent X. His job is to move from point to point around the map of Praha taking taxis, trams, boats or subways. The detectives, the remaining players acting in concert, move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Agent X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
