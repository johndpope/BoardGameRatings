							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sesame Street Let&#039;s Go to the Park</name>
									
			<description>In this children's game for ages 3 to 6 players try to get their Sesame Street character across the game board to the park picking up friends along the way.  The board is made up of four straight tracks each with 20 spaces.  Players pick from 20 cardboard Sesame Street characters and insert them into the slot of one of the triangular pieces and put the piece on a Start space.  The players take turns spinning the traffic light spinner which is equally divided into a 1, 2 and 3 area.  The player then moves the number of spaces that was spun.  When a players lands on a stoplight space they must stop there.  When a player lands on a friendship space they get to pick a new Sesame Street character, insert it into one of the circular pieces and hook it to the back of their current character making a train.  Play proceeds until a player makes it to the park space at the end of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
