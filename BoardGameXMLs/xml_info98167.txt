							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geon: Emotions</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed so that players control a cube that moves around a grid. Most games involve two cubes that are on opposite sides of the grid. The object is to pick up &amp;quot;emote&amp;quot; pellets before your opponent can. Once a player picks up five pellets he can flip to the other side of the grid so that he is on the same side as his opponent. He must then navigate his cube into the scoring zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide on an emotion before the game begins. The chosen emotion might give the player certain benefits when he picks up a &amp;quot;powerball.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 32 2-player grids and 4 4-player grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
