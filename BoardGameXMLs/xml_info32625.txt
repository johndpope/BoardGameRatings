			<description>Das Umzugsspiel (&amp;quot;Change of Residence&amp;quot;) was published in the Swiss gaming zine &amp;quot;AHA/Der schwarze Peter&amp;quot; #89/1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a fictive city map with a furniture warehouse in the middle and 4 residences in each corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to move his 7 furniture pieces from the starting residence to the residence at the opposing edge of the board with the help of 1 van per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements are done by dice rolls, but 54 also included cards influence the movements heavily. Fortunately, only 26 cards must be used immediately. The remaining 28 cards give more room to avoid too much bad luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 mobile road works (=obstacles) hinder the players to move where they want and the fact that loosing furniture pieces is also possible (must be replaced by picking new furnitures in the furniture warehouse) does not only make the game more interesting, it also gives the feeling of a real change of residence - with all possible frustrating experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is the player who has moved his furnitures to the target domicile first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
