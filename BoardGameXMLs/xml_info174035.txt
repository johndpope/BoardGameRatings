							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time Flux: Origins of War</name>
									
			<description>Time Flux is an EXPANDABLE CARD GAME (ECG) based on time travel that is designed for 2-4 players.  Each player is represented by a &amp;quot;Time Traveler&amp;quot;.  Your Time Traveler is your character card that has special abilities and can travel through time by moving in and out of &amp;quot;Eras&amp;quot;.  Eras are several cards that make up a playing surface similar to a board game.  Depending on which Time Traveler you choose, the playable Eras will change!  The object of the game is to kill all other Time Travelers so you can control time and ultimately gain the ability to change the future how you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play lasts an average of 10-20 minutes for a 2 player game and winning a game feels phenomenal!  Multi-player games are even more fun than playing 1 on 1 and require a different kind of strategy to win.  Multi-player games last 40-75 minutes.  Although Time Flux is simple to learn, defeating an experienced player or winning a multi-player game requires a skill set on par with Chess; easy to learn and play, but difficult to master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
