			<description>Complete title: &amp;quot;Avventure fantasy nel cupo mondo di Warhammer&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Fantasy adventures in the dark world of Warhammer&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;A partwork in 28 issues sold in Italian newspaperkiosks. Nexus Editrice, who has the rights for Warhammer RPG in Italy and had already translated a couple of collection of short stories with the same setting, proposed the partwork to Hobby &amp;amp; Work, under Games Workshop License: Nexus would do everything up to the layout, while Hobby and Work would take care of printing and distribution. &lt;br/&gt;The issues include short stories set in the Warhammer world, translated from English, with original GW drawings re-drawn and colored plus additional stuff by Studio Horley Parente. &lt;br/&gt;Central pages form an Encyclopaedia of the Known World, written by Andrea Angiolino and forming a huge sourcebook on Warhammer's setting. Sections are People, World, Religion and Magic. Each section has a collection of sub-sections devoted to single polupations, nations, religions and forms of magic. A problem was that at that time the world of the RPG was somehow different from the one of the miniature game, that in some regions evolved differently: for example, Ulthuan was an archipelago of hundreds of island in the RPG and a huge, ring-shaped island in the tabletop wargame. So the choice was to make each sub-section as a collection of legends, letters, diaries, book quotations, ballads, songgs and so on, all written by people living in the world of Warhammer - if there is any inconsistency with one of the two games, it has then to be taken as a mistake or as a lie by the character writing that piece.&lt;br/&gt;The first 10 issues gave also a boardgame called &amp;quot;Warhammer adventures&amp;quot;, again by Andrea Angiolino, featuring tactical fights between adventurers and monsters in the uinderground as on the surface of that world. Tiles, models of buildings and counters can be also used as accesssories for RPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
