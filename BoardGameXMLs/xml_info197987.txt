							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shrine of the Harvest Goddess</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the heart of the forest lies a small clearing at the center of which stands an immaculate statue of the harvest goddess.  Tended by a dedicated priest, this shrine has been standing for over a century.  A power emanates from the statue as if the goddess herself stands there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omri Hallam was the priest of the harvest goddess when his city was destroyed by war.  He has faithfully tended the shrine as the forest has reclaimed the land once occupied by the city.  Old beyond a normal lifespan, he has been blessed by the goddess to continue his work.  Friendly to the rare visitor, he seems to have great knowledge of the outside world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
