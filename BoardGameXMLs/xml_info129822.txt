							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snoopy Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Snoopy Card Game &amp;quot;With Your Favorite Peanuts Characters&amp;quot; consists of character cards from Charles Schulz's Peanuts comic strips: Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Woodstock and, of course, Snoopy; each character card has a different color background. Players are dealt four cards, which they then play in turn, one at a time, on the gameboard, a 5 x 5 grid. At different points in the game, players claim ownership of a row and a column and, when all spaces are filled, score for their color combinations.&lt;br/&gt;Except for the title and artist (Schulz), this game has no connection to the Milton Bradley game of the same name from 1974.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
