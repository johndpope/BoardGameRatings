			<description>The board for Run Sheepee Run begins with a 3x3 square grid of nine holes, with four similar grids branching out from the corner holes of the center square, for a total of 41 holes.  One black marble (the wolf) and twelve white marbles (the sheep) are included with the game, and rest easily in the board's holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, the wolf places his marble anywhere on the board.  The sheep then places a marble anywhere on the board. The wolf may begin moving to one adjacent hole in any direction.  The sheep must continue placing his marbles one at a time anywhere on the board until they have all been placed.  At that point, the sheep marbles can move the same as the wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wolf can capture any sheep in an adjacent hole by jumping over it to a vacant hole on its opposite side and removing it from play.  Multiple jumps are possible.  The sheep cannot capture but must try to crowd the wolf so that it cannot move, either with white marbles or against the edge of the board.  If the sheep trap the wolf, they win.  If the wolf can no longer be trapped, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a variant of Fox and Geese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
