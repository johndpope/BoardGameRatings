							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Eldritch Might (First Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malhavoc was an arrogant bastard, but his ideas were interesting. Arcane spellcasters &amp;mdash; arcanists &amp;mdash; do possess the unique attributes to call power into themselves, serving only their own wishes. Of course, this led to the development of their not-entirelyundeserved reputation of evil, power-mad egoism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizards, sorcerers, and bards are formidable characters who command great power. But power is only as great as the knowledge behind it. Much of the secret arcanist lore lies within the covers of a massive tome known as The Book of Eldritch Might. This volume holds just a small sampling of the treasures found in those pages. Frequently, in fact, snippets such as this one are copied from the book and disseminated as books of magic all their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malhavoc himself, a powerful wizard, claimed to have possessed the full Book of Eldritch Might for a time. He said the book was intelligent &amp;mdash; an elder god of magic somehow trapped within a simple item. In his &amp;ldquo;conversations&amp;rdquo; with the book, he transcribed details of new areas of study, new spells, new magical items, and more. We are proud to present his work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
