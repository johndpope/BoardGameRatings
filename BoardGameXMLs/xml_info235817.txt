			<description>The conquest of space was one of the main human achievements of the 20th century. In 1957, the first satellite named &amp;quot;Sputnik 1&amp;quot; has been placed into orbit. Four years later, Yuri Gagarin has performed the first human space flight on &amp;quot;Vostok 1&amp;quot; ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is dedicated to the first space explorers &amp;mdash; i.e. all the outstanding people who have made spacefaring possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player becomes the Head of a Research &amp;amp; Development Hub in the Space Research Center. You recruit best Specialists to your team and produce large-scale space projects &amp;mdash; from placing satellites and manned spaceships into orbit to launching automated interplanetary stations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the players complete all the available Projects or when one of the players recruits 12 Specialists to his/her Hub. The Specialists and Projects bring you Progress points. The player with the highest amount of Progress points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was inspired by Splendor, but offers unique differences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Closed loop resource system: when recruiting a Specialist to your team, you pass Research tokens to a player to your left.&lt;br/&gt;     Specialists are assigned to the Divisions according to their skills. The more Specialists you have in a Division, the easier it is to recruit new ones to that Division.&lt;br/&gt;     All Specialists have unique abilities. Only the ability of the top card in each stack is active. Therefore, by adding a new Specialist, you often get a new ability but loose the other one. Think carefully what is more important for you at the moment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Yuri Gagarin said at the moment of his launch: &amp;quot;Let's go!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
