			<description>David Royffe's first game, which later evolved into his Pylos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With four players, each player has 23 spheres (marbles).  The spheres are used to build a pyramid layer by layer on a central grid.  In rotation, each player adds a sphere to form a chain of their color.  When a layer is complete the next player starts a new chain on the next layer up.  Each sphere is now supported by four spheres below, one or more of which must be of the same color.  If a player is blocked they must fill all the empty places in that layer.  However there is an option to sacrifice a sphere into the tomb.  The player who places the final sphere at the top of the pyramid wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a puzzle version for one.  With two players, each player plays with 46 spheres in two colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
