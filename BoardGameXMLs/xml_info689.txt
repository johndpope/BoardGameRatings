			<description>Dubble Kross uses a regurlar deck of cards, two six-sided dice, 11 plastic pegs and a house-shaped pegboard. Cards 2 through Queen each have a track on the board. Kings, aces and jokers are used as special action cards. After dealing out all the cards, four dice rolls determine the four penalty numbers. Any one who has the corresponding cards in their hands must pay to the kitty. In phase two, each player rolls the dice and either advances the corresponding peg on the board or pays more to the pot if the a penalty number is rolled. Like Parker Bros. &amp;quot;Can't Stop&amp;quot;, the length of each track is proportional to the probability of the roll. Therefore, the  &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; peg must travel the greatest distance while the &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;12&amp;quot; (Queen) pegs need only travel three spaces to win. When a peg crosses the finish line unchallenged, each corresponding card in players' hands are worth a quarter of the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
