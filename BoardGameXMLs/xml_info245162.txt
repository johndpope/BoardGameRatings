			<description>The Electro-Motive 2,500-horsepower GP35 was a railroading success story, with more than 1,300 of the locomotives sold to 40 original railroad buyers during its 1963-1966 production run. When the GP35 debuted, it represented the latest in Electro-Motive&amp;rsquo;s extraordinarily successful line of four-axle (B-B) &amp;ldquo;GP&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;general purpose&amp;rdquo;) diesel road-switchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list of GP35 customers read much like a railroading &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rsquo;s who&amp;rdquo; of the time, and among the railroads which purchased the landmark diesel was the Western Pacific, which between 1963 and 1965 acquired 22 of the versatile freight-service diesels. Western Pacific&amp;rsquo;s GP35s were originally dressed in WP&amp;rsquo;s eye-catching &amp;ldquo;Zephyr&amp;rdquo; silver and orange livery. Following the discontinuance of the California Zephyr in 1970, the Western Pacific adopted a new green color scheme. In 1980, most of the WP GP35s were rebuilt by Morrison Knudsen and soon thereafter joined the Union Pacific roster when WP was merged into UP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by DTM, the Train Simulator Western Pacific GP35 is an authentic re-creation of this landmark locomotive and includes the WP GP35 in its original stylish silver and orange livery and in the WP&amp;rsquo;s 1970/80s green livery, making the locomotive suited to service across several decades on the WP&amp;rsquo;s Feather River Canyon route. The GP35 features highly authentic controls and operating features, as well as details specific to the WP locomotives. The Western Pacific GP35 add-on pack also includes WP 50-foot boxcars and three-bay covered hoppers and four career scenarios for the Train Simulator Feather River Canyon route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four career scenarios for the Feather River Canyon route (available separately) feature challenging mainline freight and switching duties:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Quincy Switcherman&lt;br/&gt;    Descending to Kramm&lt;br/&gt;    Finishing the Trip&lt;br/&gt;    Local to Crescent Mills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please Note: The Feather River Canyon Route Add-On is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Western Pacific Electro-Motive GP35 diesel road-switcher&lt;br/&gt;    Original &amp;ldquo;Zephyr&amp;rdquo; silver-and-orange and WP green GP35 liveries&lt;br/&gt;    Realistic locomotive controls and operating features&lt;br/&gt;    Authentic Western Pacific details&lt;br/&gt;    Western Pacific 50-foot boxcar (two versions)&lt;br/&gt;    Western Pacific three-bay covered hopper (two versions)&lt;br/&gt;    Four career scenarios for the Feather River Canyon Route (available separately)&lt;br/&gt;    Quick Drive compatible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
