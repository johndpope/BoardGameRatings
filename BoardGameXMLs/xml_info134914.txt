							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial: Escape from Planet Earth</name>
									
			<description>Released for Game Boy Color on November 28, 2001. Your mission is to construct a communicator so that E.T. can phone home. You must search 60 environments for all the components needed to build the transmitter. All the while, you have to evade capture by government agents and avoid the clever traps they've set for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can alternate playing as the strategic-minded Elliott or as E.T., whose extraordinary powers, including levitation, can help you out of the many tricky situations you'll confront. This single-player game features three levels of difficulty and three modes of gameplay: exploration, quest, and encounter. Six large maps with 10 environments and 45 miniquests that unlock hidden items you can trade later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;E.T.: Escape From Planet Earth&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
