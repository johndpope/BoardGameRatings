			<description>Flinker Willi is a quick-playing word game in which players first lay out a circle of 21 letter chips, each of which has one of nine categories hidden on the obverse side. The wooden Willi figure is stacked on 13 wood tiles and placed on one of the letter chips at random.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a round, players start by revealing the category under the chip lying to the right of Willi. Then one player rolls a die and everyone must count left from Willi to find the chip lying this many spaces away, after which the players must race to yell out something starting with that letter that matches the revealed category. The first player to do so receives one of the wood tiles on Willi if her answer is correct; otherwise she must return one tile to Willi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To continue play, move Willi to the chosen letter tile, then start a new round. The first player to collect four wood tiles wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
