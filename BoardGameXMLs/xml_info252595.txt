							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flash Word</name>
									
			<description>Flash Word consists of a deck of double-sided cards. One side of the cards show a number from 2 to 7, the other side shows a Japanese hiragana character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several modes of play. All of them require the players to find words quickly in order to earn points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one mode, the deck is shuffled and placed in the middle of the table. Then, one player flips the top card and places it besides the deck. All players then try to find a word starting with the character just revealed containing exactly the number of characters indicated by the card on the top of the deck. The first player to say a correct word takes the character card as a point and another card is flipped until there is only one card left in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end, whoever collected the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
