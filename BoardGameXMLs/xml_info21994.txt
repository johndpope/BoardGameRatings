			<description>(From the game rules:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bloody Business: the Battle for Hue, Tet 1968 covers the attack on the old Imperial capital of Hue by forces of the North Vietnamese Army and South Vietnamese insurgents of the National Liberation Front during the Tet Offensive. The Communist forces hoped a popular uprising by the &amp;quot;oppressed&amp;quot; people in South Vietnam would lead to a general uprising and overthrow of the &amp;quot;puppet&amp;quot; regime supported by the United States. &lt;br/&gt;The city of Hue was the only city to be completely occupied by the communist forces during the massive offensive, and was the scene of violent and close-quarter fighting that waged for nearly a month, from January 31st to February 25th, 1968. The general uprising never occurred, and in fact the communist's disappointment led to atrocities when they massacred hundreds of &amp;quot;collaborators&amp;quot; after they took control. The fighting to retake control of the city and oust the NVA and VC devastated the city and Imperial Palace, symbolizing the tragic and confused nature of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players will have capabilities to inflict harm upon their opponent, while also having liabilities to protect. Contestants will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale: The map scale is about 350-400 yards per inch. &lt;br/&gt;Each combat unit represents a platoon (25 to 30 men, 2 tanks or 6 APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers) and artillery batteries (M-109, Katyusha rockets, and mortars). &lt;br/&gt;A game turn represents 2-3 days of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
