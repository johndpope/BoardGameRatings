							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Election Day</name>
									
			<description>From the Decktet wiki: Rule of the land was benevolently shared by the six Crowned Princes. Every five years the people would elect one of the Princes to lead the land for the next five years. Before the election, the Princes would hold a series of debates in which they would demonstrate why they were most fit to lead for the next five years. The debates were always reviewed by the three major newspapers and typically two of the papers' editors would agree that one of the Princes won the debate while the third paper's editor would choose someone else as the clear victor. In the end, the people would vote and a new leader would rule peacefully for another five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Election Day takes great advantage of the structure of the Decktet cards. There are 6 suits with 2 suits on each card. Each suit represents a prince. Each player plays one card face up on their turn until all players pass, ending the debate. The suit appearing most frequently during the debate keeps two of its highest point cards as influence points until the end of the game. The next most frequently appearing suit keeps one of its highest point cards until the end of the game. After all the debates, the influence cards accumulated are added up and the suit with the most influence indicates who the winning prince is. The player who backed that prince is the winning player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
