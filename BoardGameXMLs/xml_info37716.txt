							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Churchill and the Glorious Revolution</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1688 and the Glorious Revolution is neither glorious, nor a revolution! Players take on the role of one on England's early leaders like John Churchill or the Viscount of Halifax and score points by playing cards onto a central common grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are assigned to either the rebel or loyal cause, and allow players to collect money or force them to spend it based on the card played and the position. The card's position relative to other cards and to the influence pawns determine its scoring ability. Players vote to move the influence pawns, making the game quite dynamic and interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
