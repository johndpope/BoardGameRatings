			<description>Turro is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. Your goal is to reach the opponent's end of the board with your Turro stone or capture the opponent's one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turro is a game of careful planning, area control and and flexibility on the board. With the two winning conditions you always have to keep your mind open for either way while keeping an eye on the plans of your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capturing opponent's stones is key to make way to victory. But captured stones stay on the board remaining a threat if freed in the wrong moment. And capturing in the wrong moment can offer your opponent a free move to turn around the whole match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to break through? Or will you get captured on your way there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
