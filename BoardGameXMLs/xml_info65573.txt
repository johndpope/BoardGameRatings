							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grocery Rummy</name>
									
			<description>The players will be able to organize and budget for grocery shopping according to planned menus. They will attain mastery of monies calculation skills. In the affective domain, the students will acquire an understanding of how complex planning and budgeting can be when wants and needs meet prices and paychecks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get the Groceries needed for specified Menus within a predetermined budget. The teacher will determine the budget based on the number of Menus each student must &amp;quot;shop&amp;quot; for - approximately $12-$15 per Menu.&lt;br/&gt;If the player/shopper has overspent or forgotten an item on the Menu, that amount is deducted from the player's &amp;quot;savings,&amp;quot; i.e., score total. Likewise, if the player has money left over in the budget, that surplus is added to the player's score total. The game is over when a player reaches a predetermined score, e.g., $50. If a time limit is set instead, e.g. 20 min., the winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- The deck contains 72 cards: &lt;br/&gt;- six different Menu cards, &lt;br/&gt;- 54 Grocery cards (including generic, lower-priced alternatives to brand names), &lt;br/&gt;- six Non-Food Grocery cards, &lt;br/&gt;- three Coupon cards, &lt;br/&gt;- three &amp;quot;1/2 Off&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
