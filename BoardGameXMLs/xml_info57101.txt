			<description>There are different kinds of cards: 34 strawberry cards (with one or two berries on them), 13 bird cards and 8 scarecrow cards. Each player draws a card. Strawberries are flipped open and laid out in front of the player, birds mean you can secure your strawberries (put them aside), a scarecrow means that all unprotected strawberries are reshuffled into the deck. When all cards are played, the player with the most strawberries wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
