							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pantheonic Dreams: Ecology of Canton Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;'Come into my parlor,' said the spider to the fly&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now who would resist such a pleasant invite? The whole point of creating monsters is for interaction. You may want to defeat them, outwit them, or beat them into a bloody pulp, but the same monsters and the clutter of &amp;ldquo;additional traits&amp;rdquo; can get as tiresome as hearing your comrade in arms say &amp;ldquo;Ho there wanderer&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; for the seventh time in the same game session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ecology of Canton is a supplemental book of monsters providing new fodder for imaginations, player and DM alike. Each creature has a tie to the lands of the Pantheonic Dreams Realm Book, but can fit into any campaign through the Open Gaming License and the D20 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our efforts in this endeavor were to provide something that has gone missing for some time in our experiences. Frivolity, laughter and humor. Everything we saw was a type of &amp;ldquo;fight it, or fear it&amp;rdquo; opponent, and our roleplaying would boil down to stabbing, spellblasting or running through the adventure. In this book we wish to provide adversaries to be tricked, cajoled, or befriended, without removing the purity of pounding the enemy&lt;br/&gt;into the dirt. More so, we wished to provide that momentary smile elicited just from reading the book. More often than not, those spurs provide the ideas to drag players into more and better adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
