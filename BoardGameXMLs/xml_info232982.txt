			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players with a Cthulhu theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising 10 card types: Investigator, Ally, Object, Book, God, Monster, Location, Transport, Spell and Event.  Each player is dealt a hand of 13 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn having 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigation Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 2 cards from the deck and put them in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insanity Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard 1 card from your hand for its effect (e.g. discarding a Transport card allows you to look at the next 5 cards in the deck and keep one; discarding a God card allows you to discard your hand and draw 9 new cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    You may play a Meld. A Meld must include the following: 1 Investigator card, 0 to 2 Ally cards, 0 to 1 Object card, 0 to 1 Book card, 0 to 1 God card, 1 to 2 Monster cards, 1 to 2 Location cards, 0 to 1 Transport card, 0 to 1 Spell card, 0 to 1 Event card.&lt;br/&gt;-   Melds score story points for the number of cards in the meld (3 cards is worth 2 Story Point (SP), 4 cards is worth 4 SP, 5 cards is worth 6 SP and so on &amp;hellip;..). Certain card combinations will award extra Story Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythos Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If you played a Meld this turn, draw X cards where X is the number of cards in the Meld.  Max hand size is 13 cards - discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no cards left in the deck and no one can play a Meld. The player with the most Story Points (SP) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
