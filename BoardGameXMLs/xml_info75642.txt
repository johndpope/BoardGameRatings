							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Personnel Files 3: Wild Justice</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transhuman Space presents a rich and varied background that is excellent for near-now science-fiction gaming. But its rich in detail can make it difficult to know what to do with it. That's where Personnel Files come in handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the assassins killed Steve Hollick and blasted his house apart, they made one mistake: They left two beings living on the site, and two more minds intact and ready to run. Now Hollick's security guard and the better-than-canine dog who was Hollick's masterpiece are out to even the score, aided by two artificial intelligences who also seem interested in justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The killers used military-grade hardware and bought off the local cops. What can one man from backwoods Tanganyika, one uplifted dog, and two rogue AIs do against an enemy whom they can't even name yet? They don't know, but they're going to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transhuman Space: Personnel Files 3 &amp;ndash; Wild Justice provides the basis for a campaign set in remote East Africa in the year 2100. It provides four fully detailed characters suitable for ready-to-run PCs, templates for new characters, or contacts in a different Transhuman Space story line. The supplement also comes with ideas for how to structure this campaign, plus a sample scenario and other adventure ideas to get the story started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world of deep secrets and runaway technology, the heroes in Transhuman Space: Personnel Files 3 &amp;ndash; Wild Justice have a big job. It's up to them (and the players) how they pursue vengeance or justice &amp;ndash; and as Sir Francis Bacon said, &amp;quot;Revenge is a kind of wild justice . . .&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
