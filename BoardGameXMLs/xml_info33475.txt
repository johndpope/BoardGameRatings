							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blackhole</name>
									
			<description>In Blackhole players travel around the board collecting vowels, consonants and combination letters (for example sh, ar, ing). The tension builds as players near the black holes and risk losing all their letters. The first player to travel from the Earth, around our Solar System and back again on the Scoring-Wheel is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     For 2, 3, or 4 players or more in pairs.&lt;br/&gt;     A game for all ages: fun for families and challenging for adults.&lt;br/&gt;     The rules are coded to the symbols on the board and can be learnt in minutes.&lt;br/&gt;     Blackhole's new approach to word games using combination letters helps players make longer words more easily.&lt;br/&gt;     Adults and students will enjoy the embedded tactics of Blackhole. &lt;br/&gt;     The consonants, vowels and combination letters are colour coded. The combinations have a phonic nature [sh ... st ... er ...] and the letter cards can be moved around in front of the player. These features makes the game ideally suitable for dyslexics and those people with learning difficulties. For the first time a word game is accessible to all abilities.&lt;br/&gt;     Educational. Blackhole helps children learn new words and improve their spelling.&lt;br/&gt;     The winner always emerges in less than an hour.&lt;br/&gt;     Players travel around our solar system and Blackhole encourages the development of an interest in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
