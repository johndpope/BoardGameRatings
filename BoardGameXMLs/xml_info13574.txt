			<description>The board represents a city and has 4 roads on it with 3 intersections. The player has 12 cars which he has to move along the board as quickly as possible. The trouble is that you can't pass another car so you get traffic jams. A player can also give the opponent a flat tire.&lt;br/&gt; The player who gets his cars off the board first, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prototype of the game was called &amp;quot;Stau!&amp;quot;, which means traffic-jam. It had player-aids representing parking-spaces to hold a player's cars, these were omitted in the production version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
