							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">.44 Caliber</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Cripple Creek (a.k.a. DS-4) has a problem with people going missing and others turning up dead.  The local Steel Disciple sheriff has petitioned volunteers for aid in tracking down and eliminating this threat.  Have you the guts to answer this challenge?  .44 Caliber is an Exodus OPS campaign scenario for 4 to 6 characters of 1st  to 3rd level and can easily be adapted to any post apocalyptic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario has been updated from the original to reflex the new Experience system used in the Exodus OPS campaign.  OPS players that have already played this scenario, cannot re-play it, or gain any benefits from the changes within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
