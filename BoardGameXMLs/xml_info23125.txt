			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a night of murder!  For 14 to 40 guests!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Gasp is a Victorian murder mystery which runs for about three hours. Everyone taking part is given a character in the plot. As well as having a murder to investigate, characters will also have their own, secret objectives. Why does the church choir only accept female members? Where is the Earl hiding all his money? Can anyone persuade Captain Ratliffe to do the decent thing? At &amp;quot;The Last Gasp&amp;quot;, anything can happen - and generally does!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is New Year's Eve, 1899. George Sweet, the 5th Earl of Coddingham, has lead a wicked and dissolute life. His past is finally catching up with him and, eager to keep out of reach of the law, he is planning to flee abroad. Before he goes, he is holding one final party: &amp;quot;The Last Gasp&amp;quot;. Invited to it are all the people to whom his appalling behavior has brought the most grief and heartache: his ex-wives, Florence and Dawn, his present wife, Jojo, his ballet dancer son, William, and his long-suffering friend, Bernard. George is determined to use his party to make up for past mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People from the Earl's local village and members of his staff are also at &amp;quot;The Last Gasp&amp;quot;: the local vicar is recruiting new members for the church choir, cavalry officer Captain Ratliffe is breaking a few more women's hearts, and Jarvis, the Earl's loyal butler, is making sure no one steals the sherry. The Earl's plans go slightly awry, however, when the police unexpectedly turn up, hoping to arrest someone for murder. Who do they want to arrest? The Earl of Coddingham....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think this game is suitable for anyone 13 years old and over.
