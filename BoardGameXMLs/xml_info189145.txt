			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Albraxas: Storming the Dawn, one player takes on the role of Albraxas and the remaining players generate characters.  In some (minor) respects, the Albraxas role is analogous to a traditional Game Master role, but in general Albraxas is antagonistic to the characters and attempts to thwart and destroy their actions.  The game also is peculiar in many other aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have three Attributes:  Backbone, Battle, and Blitz.  Characters distribute 13 points among these abilities, while Albraxas has 20 points to distribute.  Another derived Attribute, Dynamism, is calculated.  Dynamism is spent to perform actions.  Opposed actions pit dice pool rolls against the opponents dice pool roll.  No die type is specified, but all players should use the same die type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played through a pre-selected number of Phases (turns), being either 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, or 100.  Albraxas moves through the phase backwards.  Characters can perform an action in a given phase, selecting from a list of five possible actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
