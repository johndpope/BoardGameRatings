			<description>From the back of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We could tell you all about how this is an accurate simulation of real events and warfare, how many buildings were destroyed, how much weaponry was expended. How many soldiers died, and how many civilians were accidentally killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are probably not interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will tell you that this game includes naval, aerial, and ground forces. As well as nuclear bombs, killer satellites, and labor camps. 2 to 4 players can play at the same time, and lots of fun can be had by all, because the intent of this game is to&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KILL EVERYTHING!&lt;br/&gt;The friendly game of genocidal warfare&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to four island maps are attached together, then populated Risk-style.  From then on units are purchased and combat is made in the same vein as Axis &amp;amp; Allies.  Elements that make this game stand out from other war games include the ability loot territories they own to gather immediate production funds, but at the cost of turning that land into a wasteland which produces no further resources as well as the ability to bribe units not to attack.  More typical elements include generals which improve troops attacks, research and development of new technology, and fortifications like cities, labor camps and the run-of-the-mill fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with four map sheets, (attachable in multiple ways) two war boards, (folding for hidden deployment of troops in battle) and a pile of cut-out chits, money, and stand up buildings and generals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
