			<description>The goal of the game is to be the Diplomat that creates the Greatest World Empire by controlling strategic location cards, collecting Colony and Independent Country Flag cards, capturing soldiers, battleships and bombers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map consists of a circle of spaces with flags representing various countries of the world, across the center of the circle is the Bridge of Flags representing the six great colonizing countries.  At the beginning of the game players pick one of the six great countries as their home country.  They get one Diplomat, 10 consulates, 5 soldiers, 1 bomber and 1 battleship.  The battleship and bomber are placed on the home country flag and all the diplomats are placed on &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanic of the game consists of movement around the path of flags via the roll of dice (doubles get a second roll). When a player lands on a colony he places a soldier, a second landing on the same colony gains a consulate and the Country Flag card.  Landing on an independent country gains an immediate colony.  Soldiers can be captured if another player lands on a colony before a consulate is placed.  Players can move across the Bridge of Flags if they land on one of the two Neutral Countries, doing so gains the player a battleship or bomber.  The battleship or bomber can be used to gain a strategic location flag if he owned when he lands on a strategic location. Normally players can only move clockwise but control of a strategic location allows the player to move either direction when he lands on one.  Additional game play is added via card play introduced by landing on an &amp;quot;Isolation&amp;quot; spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has placed 10 consulates.  Flags, and captured tokens are worth points and the player with the most points at the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
