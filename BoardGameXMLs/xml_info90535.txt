			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP for the N-Gage is a simplified title in the MotoGP series. The game is based on the Xbox release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other titles in the series, players can choose from a number of licensed riders from the MotoGP championship. The game starts with two playable tracks, but five more can be unlocked during play. The control scheme is slimmed down for the portable title. Players use one button to accelerate and one to brake, and the control pad to steer. There are no enhanced control maneuvers, such as manual shifting, available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The N-Gage title features four game modes, including a multiplayer that allows up to four players to race against one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
