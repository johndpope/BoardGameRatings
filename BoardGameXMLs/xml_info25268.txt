							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon</name>
									
			<description>The game &amp;quot;Napoleon&amp;quot; was included in Spielbox 6/86 as part of the &amp;quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thought as an introduction to Cosim games, this game has simplified wargame rules. Anyway, the Allied and French forces enter play according to a detailed time plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hex board is somehow exchangeable for Napoleonic battles, because no village names are marked on it and the victory conditions are not different for the 2 players (like in most Napoleonic games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 20 rounds and the object of the game is to score the most points, which are won by capturing opposing forces or occupying certain map points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
