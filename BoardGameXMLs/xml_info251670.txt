							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Miniatures Battles</name>
									
			<description>Universal Miniatures Battles (UMB) is a generic set aiming to cover both all of history up to the Late Medieval period as well as any fantasy of a similar technological level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All troops are divided into a number of basic categories, e.g. light cavalry, skirmishers, or (for fantasy) monstrous infantry. These are then customized by rating each unit for skill, discipline, stamina, and any approprate special rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns activating the divisions of their army, with any or all units of an activated division able to shoot, move, charge etc. Any that do not do so are available to react to enemy activations later in the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is meant to be played by special attack and defense dice, but these can trivially be replaced with ordinary D6's. Any genre or period miniatures can be used, although the author recommends that both sides use the same scale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
