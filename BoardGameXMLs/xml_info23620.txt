			<description>Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;Crossroads Farm needs new guardians.  The person who wins the game will earn the right to care for the farm on a long term basis. Your challenge is to make decisions which allow the farm to make money so that you can maintain the farm.  The decisions you make must leave the farm in as good a state or better than when you received it so that future generations can live, work and enjoy the farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earning the most tokens wins you the right to manage the farm.&lt;br/&gt;In this game you will answer questions, take chances, make decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this game was made as an integral part of a sustainable agriculture resource kit distributed to New Zealand Schools by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
