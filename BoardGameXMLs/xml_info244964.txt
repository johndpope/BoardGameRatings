							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Corpses to Find in a Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons often contain bodies, whether these be of slain foes or those of previous adventurers who succumbed to the dangers. These can simply be described as being a corpse, perhaps of a particular race, or they can be given a more detailed description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 100 different corpses. Many are descriptions that can be added to any desired body whilst some relate to specific races and monsters. Not all need to be used in a dungeon either. Some are perplexing, some appear to warn of hazards and creatures that characters may meet (or maybe not; that's up to the GM) and some have died in odd and sometimes very nasty ways, suitable for darker settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various corpses have descriptions that can be read aloud to players and notes for GMs including further details that can be discovered on investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The supplement describes dead things, often ones which have died unpleasantly. They may not be suitable for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surgically Altered - This body bears extensive signs of surgery, to the degree that some of the parts do not appear to be original. The head and torso appear to be the same person, as does one arm, but a second arm is clearly from a different individual and a third under it ends in a claw. Both legs are from another creature entirely, with backward jointed knees. Huge, ugly black stitches can be seen where additional parts are sewn on, and other areas display&lt;br/&gt;them too, suggesting some internal modification is also likely. (If examined, a suitable skill check would appear to show that the individual, despite its modifications, was at some point alive after them; they were not done to a corpse.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter and one page is ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
