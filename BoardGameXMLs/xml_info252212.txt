							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Evil: The Mystery of the Demonic Puppeteer</name>
									
			<description>Tales of Evil is a scary 1-5-player board game where the Brave Ones (as the players will be called from now on) will assume the role of one of the components of a gang of young people: Pizza &amp;amp; Investigation. During each adventure the young investigators will have to venture into places inhabited by the forces of evil and try to get out alive, carrying out various missions and revealing the hidden mysteries. The Investigators will have to use all their strength and intelligence to stop the Demons that they will encounter on their way and the Evil that resides in the places they will explore, but this may not be enough and this is where the Brave Ones, or you and your friends, come into play. Tales of Evil is an adventure which, depending on your decisions, will give different results. You will be the protagonist and the only one responsible for your destiny and that of your companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
