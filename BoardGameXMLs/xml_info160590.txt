							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Invasions Basic Game</name>
									
			<description>Zombie Invasions is a Zombie Apocalypse Survival Horror Combat System developed by Frugal Rock Games. This board game allows for 2 - 5 players to take on the role of either Survivors or the Zombie Master in a strategic turn based fight for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivors must employ their wits and a selection of weapons in order to defeat wave after wave of shambling nightmares. Meanwhile the Zombie Master who takes control of the horde must use superior numbers and devastating attacks to bring the Survivors down at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game or 'wave' consists of two distinct phases. The Encounter and the Post Encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to bring fun, strategic thinking and competitiveness to the table top by employing robust Action Point and Health Point systems, as well as the scoring of Earned Points which allow Survivors and the Zombie Master to buy new weapons or zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Invasions is designed for consecutive games, 'waves' to be played for as long as the Survivors can live up to their name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
