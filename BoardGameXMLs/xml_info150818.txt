			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game in which players start with a mountain of dice. Game starts with players being dealt a random one of 4 numbers (like 5 or 11). Each turn, a player places one of his top dice on the appropriate tile (numbered 1&amp;ndash;6) on the board. When placing a die on a tile, if there are exactly 2 or 4 dice on the opposing tile, the player scores those dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game continues until no player has any dice to place. The players who have managed to score exactly as many dice as the number he was dealt is the winner. If not, the player who is closest wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
