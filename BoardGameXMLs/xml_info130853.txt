			<description>Gather stars from the cosmos to form constellations and rule the universe!&lt;br/&gt; THE CREATION&lt;br/&gt;Divide the deck into constellation and star cards.  Shuffle the two decks and place them face-down next to  each other.  Each player draws three cards to begin their hand.  Turn two constellation cards face-up, side by side, next to the constellation draw pile.  A star discard pile will begin next to the star draw pile.  If the star draw pile is empty, reshuffle the discard pile and replace face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEAVENLY MOTION&lt;br/&gt;During your turn:&lt;br/&gt;1. Draw one star &lt;br/&gt;2. Do one of the following two actions:&lt;br/&gt;a) Play two stars from your hand face-down on the table.  Your &lt;br/&gt;opponent(s) must place a star face-up in front of each of your two cards.  Your opponent wins the stars that were matched opposite the players star.  The player wins any unmatched cards opposite one another.&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;b) Discard  a set of star cards from your hand that match the stars highlighted on a face-up constellation card.  Take the constellation and earn the points labeled in roman numerals. Turn another constellation card face-up to replace the card just won.&lt;br/&gt;If any player has less than two stars at the beginning of a turn, then, they draw to bring their hand to two cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STARS OF THE SHOW&lt;br/&gt;Stars come in 4 types&lt;br/&gt;alpha, beta, gamma, delta&lt;br/&gt;9 cards of each type&lt;br/&gt;Supernovae can be used as any star type&lt;br/&gt;They always lose during a match phase&lt;br/&gt;3 supernovae&lt;br/&gt;15 Constellations in 3 types&lt;br/&gt;3, 4, and 5 star combinations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 players:&lt;br/&gt;During a match phase, each player plays 2 stars&lt;br/&gt;3 players:&lt;br/&gt;During a match phase, the player plays 2 stars and each opponent plays 1 star&lt;br/&gt;4 players:&lt;br/&gt;Teams with 2 partners sitting opposite one another. &lt;br/&gt;Player and partner each play 1 star face-down&lt;br/&gt;Opposing team&amp;rsquo;s partners each play 1 star&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULING THE UNIVERSE&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last constellation has been taken.  Total the points in roman numerals that you or your team has collected.  Receive a 2 point bonus for collecting 3 or more of a constellation combination type. The highest total wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
