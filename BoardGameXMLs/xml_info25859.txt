			<description>Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play Herstory, your travel along the game path will in many ways parallel the experiences of women throughout four hundred years of American history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your playing marker will be sent backward and forward on the board depending on whether an event described on your &amp;quot;Herstory card&amp;quot; was a victory or a defeat for women's advancement. You will also be sent to areas of the game board which symbolize key aspects of women's lives: home, employment, personal style, and public achievement. As American women have known both frustration and triumph in their struggle for equality, you too will progress or lose ground on the board as you learn the landmark developments of women's history, the fight for women's suffrage, and the continuing effort for fair treatment at work and at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for both simple and more complex play. Those players who have had little exposure to women's history will most enjoy the simple version, which familiarizes them with details and people but does not test their knowledge. Those players who are ready for the risks (and pleasures) of a challenge will enjoy the complex version. Here questions are asked and must be answered in the course of pursuing the goal and planning game strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both game versions, the objective is to reach the end of the path where the Statue of Liberty stands as a symbol of freedom of choice and opportunity - the life goal of both women and men in America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
