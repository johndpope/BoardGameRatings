			<description>The first release from Franco-Californian studio Elefantopia, McDROID is a mad fusion of Arcade and Strategy, with a heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doggy robot McDROID and her friend, the very talkative Shuttle head back home to their Planet, M, only to find the wisecracking giant all lobotomized. Their journey to heal M begins as they plant trees, fend off the mutated fauna, meet a prankster, harvest strawberries and build bases with giant lasers, teslas, bot factories, mutagel and other madnesseseses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defend your shuttle against a variety of crazed alien species as they mutate, corrupt the ground or even turn your crops against you. Load up on weapons, bring your friends (drop-in/drop-out co-op) and take the battle to them. If it gets too crazy, turtle up behind your defensive perimeter and assume direct control of the turrets. It will challenge your trigger finger and your wits as you multitask running, shooting, building your base, harvesting, repairing, protecting, upgrading and researching all at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
