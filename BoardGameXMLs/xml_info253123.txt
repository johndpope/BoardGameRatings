			<description>In India, you and an opponent are trying to retrieve a dagger and bring it to the Taj Mahal. You will move along a path using a Carrom style flipping mechanic to determine how far you can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the players will flip a chip in a box that is filled with numbered squares. The chip must bounce off the far wall and (hopefully) land on one or more of the squares. Your opponent will then look and the squares covered and decide which value you will move. You may choose to move forward or backward on the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only one dagger in the game. To capture it, you must land on it by exact count. You may also steal it from your opponent if you land on his or her piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path is marked with yellow squares which give special events and shortcuts along the path. The first player to carry the dagger and land by exact count on the Taj Mahal is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
