							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fate of America</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutigiant insects tear the U.S. in half, and it's up to the Continental Rangers and the First Nation militia to hold the line against &amp;quot;THEM&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fate of America&amp;quot; is a setting book for the Mecha vs Kaiju RPG, detailing the horrors unleashed on the American heartland. While Asia is beset by kaiju, nuclear testing in the 1950s unleashes a horde giant, mutant insects. Unable to stop the creatures, the US government evacuates the area and creates a no-man's land, defended on its borders by the Continental Rangers. Soldiers in servo-suits and walking, tank-like ArmorCATs defend the borders, while Native Americans within the &amp;quot;Central Control Region&amp;quot; build the First Nation, defending their ancestral homeland, while &amp;quot;The Saints&amp;quot; of Salt Lake City build and defend their fortress city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement provides a vision of America where every nuclear horror film of the 1950s really happened, and creates a wild, post-apocolyptic Southwest, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A nuclear history of the world, and details on how the Mutigiants came to America.&lt;br/&gt;    Details on the Continental Rangers, the First Nation of Native Americans, and the Saints of Salt Lake City, complete with Organization Extras.&lt;br/&gt;    Military Stunt Trees, for playing specific specialties within the armed forces.&lt;br/&gt;    Campaign details on introducing players into this exciting and dangerous part of the MvK world.&lt;br/&gt;    Examples of &amp;quot;ArmorCAT&amp;quot; mecha and &amp;quot;Servo Suit&amp;quot; power armor.&lt;br/&gt;    New Mecha stunts, including those specificly designed for Servo Suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course Fate of America features details on the Mutigiants, monstrous insects twisted by atomic radiation. This new kind of enemy is presented with a variety of options:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Hive, an entire mutigiant complex built like a single opponent.&lt;br/&gt;    The Bughunt, a classic bare-knuckle brawl, setting players against an army of insects and their vile Queen.&lt;br/&gt;    The Swarm, multiple options for pitting players against countless giant instects.&lt;br/&gt;    The Alpha Predator, Mutigiants built with classic kaiju-construction rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate of America expands the world of &amp;quot;Mecha vs Kaiju&amp;quot; into an entirely new continent for players to explore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
