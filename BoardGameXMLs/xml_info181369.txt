			<description>The players move around the board, while buying and selling shares of public corporations. Movement is determined by a die. Three special dies determine the share prices and dividends. If a the stock rises, dividends are payed to the share holders. If a player has at least 6 shares of a company, he has to buy this company. As a result he, instead of the bank, has to pay the dividends. But he also gets 10 times the dividend from players who land on one of the spaces of his company. The game Ends when one player gets bankrupt or if the bank runs out of money. The Player with the most capital (money, shares, companies) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
