			<description>A Swedish card-game for any boys and girls learning English.&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 50 cards half of which have four questions printed on them (e.g. Where can I meet you next time? Can you lend me ten shilling?) the other half have four answers (e.g. My poor little head! I'm afraid you will be angry with me if I tell you).&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets an equal number of each kind of card. On your turn you ask question number 1 on one of your question cards to any other player who has to use answer number 1 from one of her answer cards. The effect can be hilarious. Continue until all questions and answers have been used.  There is no winner. the aim is to get familiar with the English language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
