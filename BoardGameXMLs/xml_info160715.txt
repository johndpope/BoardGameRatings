							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Novus Fantasy Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novus is a brand new role-playing game from Firehawk Games.&lt;br/&gt;Firehawk Games did not set out to re-invent the fireball, it tried to make a fun and flexible game that can easily be adapted to many different styles of role-playing and many different settings. Firehawk Games wants to give you an old school experience with modern, up to date rules, and we believe that Novus fits the bill perfectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Novus, everything you need to start gaming is in one small book. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 Player Races - All of the classics; Human, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Half-Elf and Half-Orc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 8 Backgrounds - Everything from Barbarian to Upper Class Urban.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 8 Character Classes - Each Class has some degree of customizability allowing for each character to be unique. The 2 Mage Classes allow for up to 21 different types of Mages, each as customizable as the other Classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archer, Fighter, Martial Artist, Minstrel, &amp;amp; Dual Mage are just a few of the possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Dozens of Spells - Spread among 6 Schools of Magic and the Universal Spells, that any character is able to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 40+ Monsters - including Demons, Devils, Dragons, Undead and many more, all waiting to be unleashed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Snag &amp;amp; Boons - This allows you, the player, to take controls of your character&amp;rsquo;s own destiny when it comes to fumbles, failures and exceptional successes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
