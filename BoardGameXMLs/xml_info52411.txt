			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;The difference between a hero living and dying often comes down to his choice of weapons. The latest release in Paizo's sensational GameMastery Item Cards line offers a complete choice of all the simple and martial weapons your character needs not only to survive his next fight, but to dominate it. A perfect way to get all the weapons most characters need without having to hunt them down over several sets, Item Cards: Weapons Locker has the blade or bludgeoning implement you've been dying to own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GameMastery Item Cards allow heroes to keep track of their equipment in style, and the set is completely compatible with all of Paizo's other GameMastery Item Card sets. Each of these full-color cards features a beautiful portrait of an item on one side with space on the back to keep notes. GameMastery Item Cards are compatible with any fantasy roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
