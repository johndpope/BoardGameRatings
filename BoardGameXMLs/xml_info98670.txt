			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes more than 140  creatures for your Labyrinth Lord campaign, or  for any game compatible with the classics of our  hobby. I won&amp;rsquo;t tell all of them are new, as you  probably met some of their cousins in your  earlier games, but I hope I hope you will enjoy  meet them under their new clothes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes some classic and giant animals,  dinosaurs, undead, constructs, weird horrors,  various humanoid races, from low to very high  level. You will probably found some which fits  well your campaign, as well as your own  publications &amp;ndash; provided you respect the terms of  the license published on last pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook is available as a free download from Nicolas Dessaux's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
