			<description>Each player assumes the role of a horse rider. Each player takes a horse and puts it on start. In turn, each player rolls a die (the rules says dice but only one die is provided), advances one&amp;rsquo;s own horse that number of spaces,  takes chance card and follows the cards instructions. Landing on certain spaces and the cards award victory points. The player with the most victory points after all have finished wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most outstanding feature of the game is its oversized (22 &amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; x 36&amp;rdquo;) gameboard. The game is one of a series of &amp;ldquo;Gold Cup Games.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
