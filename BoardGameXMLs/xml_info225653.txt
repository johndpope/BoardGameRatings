			<description>English Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crazy Catalans are at it again, creating massive human towers in streets and squares. Your team of castellers, called colles, tries to raise up their towers first with encouragement from the Grallers (musicians) and the Cap de colla (team leader). Careful not to get the jitters and try to avoid llenya (when your tower falls down). The festival winner is the colla who gets the most applause!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card game which takes 20 minutes to play where you build human towers through hand management. Turns are played clockwise, with each player being able to either take a group of castellers from the table, take two cards from the deck, or raise part of their human tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, you must have the most points (or applause). The points are won throughout the game, the player who raises one of the towers first gets 4 points, if that tower is built by another player, they will only receive 3 points, the next 2 points, and the last player 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has risen 3 towers, the game ends and the points are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
