							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Now Playing: Roleplaying in Every TV Genre</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TV will never be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put down that remote and grab some dice!  Now you can be the star of your favorite show.  Now Playing takes the work out of preparing TV shows for roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this game you only need a few minutes and a few friends!  Based on the popular Fudge engine, the rules are simple yet elegant, to give your acting skills free rein.  Creating characters usually takes no more than 10 minutes.  Adapting existing TV shows to Now Playing is just as simple, and lets you put your creative skills to the episode plots, where it belongs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes with a complete show that includes two ready-to-play episodes.  As members of the Foundation for Paranormal Investigation (FPI), you go on location to investigate the strangest of cases.  From ghost hunting, to tracking Bigfoot, to investigating UFO abductions, you strive to learn the truth about the paranormal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
