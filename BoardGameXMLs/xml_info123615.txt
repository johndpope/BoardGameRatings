			<description>Promotional card game, made by the Irish company Lyons, who sell tea in Ireland and Great Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt ten cards. The undealt cards are laid seperately in the centre of the table face down. The cards have either two letters or one letter on them and in one of four colours. In her turn, a player must choose one of the face down cards and then discard a card by returning a card from his hand by placing it face down in the centre of the table. However, before she does this, she must show it to all the other players. Now memory is added to the game because if you need a specific card, and you can remember that it was discarded earlier, it would be beneficial to recall where it is in the face down cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to collect cards that spell out the words GREEN LABEL (the company's most famous brand). This could be as few as 5 cards (using double letter cards) or as many as 10 cards (using single letter cards). The first to do so, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
