							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sword of Three Parts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends say that long ago the gods of good forged a sword of incredible power. They gave the weapon to an ancient hero so he could restore the balance of good and evil. The hero succeeded, returning peace to the land. Sadly, the hero fell victim to his own pride and the gods were forced to break the sword into three parts. The broken sword was hidden in a specially created dungeon until its power would once again be needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That time is now. You stand before the entrance to the legendary dungeon. Tales say that the trials awaiting in the dungeon are designed to test one's wit as well as strength. The foolish will find death in these halls, but the wise might just manange to recover the sword!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword of Three Parts is a fantasy adventure designed for a group of mid-level characters. This is a short adventure that should take about 4-5 hours. It is not written with any particular system in mind. The game master is free to adjust the level of the challenges within as he sees fit. The Sword of Three Parts only contains the dungeon, allowing you to work the adventure into an existing campaign as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
