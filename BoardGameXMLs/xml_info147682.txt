			<description>From the rules sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;GEO is the opportunity to learn and enjoy the geography of the U.S. For as little as five minutes a day you can learn the geography of the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game is to be the first to collect two of each color token for a total of twelve tokens&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player rolls the dice and moves that many spaces and lands on a colored space. The another player draws a card the same color as the space that was just landed on and asks a trivia question. If the player gets it right, they get a token of that color. The first player to get 2 tokens of each color wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trivia questions are US based, and consist of history, government, and geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
