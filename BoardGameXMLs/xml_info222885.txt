			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Players create marriages with the King and Queen cards in this classic trick-taking strategy game of timing and memory.  The winner is the first player to earn 7 Game Points over several rounds!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is identical to the traditional trick-taking card game Schnapsen, except for the addition of a 0 in each suit.  Players take turns playing tricks in order to score game points -- after each round, scoring occurs, and the first player to reach 7 game points wins.  Rounds may end early if a player claims to have earned 66 trick-points during the round.  Marriages allow players with both Queen and King of a suit in their hand to claim additional trick-points for the round, provided they immediately lead with one of those two cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard trick-taking game. Each trick is won by the player who played the highest card of the leading color. A player that wins enough tricks during a round wins Game Points. The game continues for several rounds until a player wins by reaching seven Game Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This game was available as a free, secret bonus for the Pack O Game Set 2 Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
