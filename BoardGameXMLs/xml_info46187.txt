			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What if the people who were dead got up one day?&lt;br/&gt;What if they got up and started killing other people?&lt;br/&gt;What if the people they killed just got back up and killed some more people?&lt;br/&gt;What if it had already started?&lt;br/&gt;What if that day was yesterday?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie is a roleplaying game set in the world of the Zombi. The Dead walk the lands, killing and eating the living. Society has fallen and the only thing left now is to break out, find an island somewhere, live a little... before the end. But there must be more than just static and deserted cities out there? Sometimes you hear the radio talk for a while, sometimes you see lights in the sky and they remind you that even as the streets are haunted with shambling, rotting monsters, humanity is out there waiting for a chance to reclaim everything.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
