			<description>Honorable Mention, 2015 Golden Cobra Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Golden Cobra website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kids go up into the attic, where there&amp;rsquo;s a soul-sucking mirror and two kid spirits trying to replace them. Banana Chan has written &amp;ndash; no, illustrated &amp;ndash; a simple, eerie trip into the fantastic that will likely take under an hour. Evocative drawings model the characters, play, and everything else one would need to understand to make the game interesting. Multiple outcomes, including several that are devastatingly creepy, make the emergent play of this game an object of considerable interest. Although certain factors such as player safety are largely set aside, we see the irresistible, uncanny charm of this game&amp;rsquo;s overall design as deserving of an honorable mention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
