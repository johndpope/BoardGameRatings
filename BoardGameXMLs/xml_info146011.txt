							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Longbridge (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hotbed of intrigue and deception, Longbridge is claimed by not one but two noble lords.  Sprawled across both banks of a wide, swiftly flowing river forming the boundary between the rivals&amp;rsquo; lands, the village grew up at either end of a fortified stone bridge of ancient dwarven artifice. A no man&amp;rsquo;s land of sorts, the bridge itself is huge; scores of travellers cross it every day and several businesses have established themselves upon its span to service their needs. Informally led by Einhard Kochel these free traders do not pay tax or offer fealty to either lord and fiercely resist both nobles&amp;rsquo; overtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longbridge is in turmoil. Rumourmongers whisper that bloody war will soon swirl across the span as one noble or the other seeks to settle the matter of its ownership once and for all. Others whisper of hidden stairs in the bridge&amp;rsquo;s pilings plunging deep below the riverbed to hidden, noisome catacombs of great antiquity and of the foul, ageless creatures lurking within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
