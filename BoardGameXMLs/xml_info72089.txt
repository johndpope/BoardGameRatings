			<description>Description from the rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloodlines is a game that can be played by 2-6 players. Each player controls one bloodline, which is represented by a set of nobles from the same family tree. Each living noble has one or two genetic markers, indicating which (up to two) bloodlines he or she belongs to. The genetic markers appear as tokens on the noble&amp;rsquo;s card.&lt;br/&gt;The game proceeds in turns, and in each turn, the player can perform a set of actions with one or more of the nobles in his bloodline (nobles containing at least one marker for the players bloodline). Actions include having a baby, getting married, starting an affair, or challenging another noble to a duel.&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to use your actions wisely to build the most powerful bloodline in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
