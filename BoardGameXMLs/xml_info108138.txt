							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Karla Ford</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not Just a Pretty Face&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karla Ford was once the best Data Warfare operative the Army had to offer. When a suicide bomber in an exploding truck destroyed her heart, everyone thought she was out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have friends like Kale Fleigh, the editor of Extreme Edge Magazine, though, you're never as far out of the game as people might think. With a little help from Nth Degree, the outlaw organization that aids and supplies cyborgs, Karla found a new lease on life - a high performance artificial heart, and data warfare assets that the military couldn't match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, she runs a fetish website on the side, but spends the majority of her time as T@ru$, the most dangerous hacker on the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A character study, gallery of character images, and homage all in one, this Character Spotlight introduces Karla Ford to the world of Hot Chicks, and provides a powerful ally in the battle for the future and destiny of mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be warned, though... some might find Karla too hot to handle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
