			<description>South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is a 2D game-show style video game based on the television show South Park. It was released in 1999 for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. It gained its popularity by having mini games and the ability to play against friends in a challenge for the most points. It also involves trivia questions about South Park and other topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player gets to choose to be one of four characters, Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski, or Stan Marsh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game intermittently switches between questions and minigames, with a minigame proceeding every three questions. Players score points by answering questions first (correctly) and based on minigame ranking. Players lose points for questions answered incorrectly. The game is exclusively multiplayer, as when played by one player, there is no AI, so that player always wins, even with a negative score. Players have the option to &amp;quot;shaft&amp;quot; (pass on) a question to another player after opting to answer the question. The &amp;quot;shafted&amp;quot; player can then pass the question on again, or choose to answer the question him or herself. When &amp;quot;shafting&amp;quot;, a question will always be answered, by the last &amp;quot;shafted&amp;quot; person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;South Park: Chef's Luv Shack&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
