			<description>This is basically an unscramble-the-word game where score is kept on the board.  The board depicts a skyscraper where players start at the ground floor and try to be the first to reach the penthouse.  They do this with elevators, which are paths along the diagonals of the board.  Advancement toward the penthouse occurs when words are successfully unscrambled.  Players may be hindered, however, by having to take other paths around the skyscraper.  And advancement may be helped or hindered by action cards obtained on various spaces around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
