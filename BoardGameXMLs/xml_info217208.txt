			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an historical game for three or four players. Each of the eight Rounds represents a long period of northwestern European medieval history, from 20 to 75 years. This game uses a simplified and shortened version of the systems developed for the game Britannia. Each turn, the player moves and attacks with new factions in an effort to score points by achieving that faction&amp;rsquo;s goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three scenarios, starting in 406 AD (Merovingian Rise), 843 AD (Carolingian Collapse), and 1215 AD (Rise of the Nation-state). The Merovingian Rise scenario follows the barbarian assumption of power from the decrepit West Roman Empire, including the rise of the Merovingian dynasty and the succession of the Carolingian dynasty. It ends with the era of Charlemagne (Charles the Great), the new western Emperor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Carolingian Collapse scenario, which chronicles the collapse of the empire built by Charlemagne and his father and grandfather. The scenario begins in 843 AD with the Treaty of Verdun dividing the Frankish empire following the death of Charlemagne&amp;rsquo;s son, emperor Louis &amp;ldquo;the Pious,&amp;rdquo; and ends in 1215, the date of the great Battle of Bouvines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-player Rise of the Nation-State that begins in 1215 is a relatively static situation. Many of the nations can be seen as the precursors of modern states such as Britain, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
