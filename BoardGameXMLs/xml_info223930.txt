			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player's Guide to the Aegean is Skirmisher Publishing's second title for BASH Fantasy! This sourcebook provides the information you need to create characters for the Swords of Kos Fantasy Campaign Setting using the BASH Fantasy system. It accomplishes this by presenting the various playable races and backgrounds and providing you with the details you need to generate a character of that race, including the exciting new Antaean, Arachean, Bull Centaur, Cynocephalian, and Myrmidon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fully-illustrated sourcebook also provides you with options for play, like signature spells, or specialties for a specific culture, some information on their common worldview, gods worshipped, favored weapons, technology, companions, likes, and dislikes. It also includes information on using existing races in an Aegean campaign and new items, powers, advantages, and disadvantages for the BASH system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the material presented in this book is associated with the system-free Swords of Kos Fantasy Campaign Setting, a milieu is set in a re-imagined Mediterranean, and can be easily incorporated into games that use it or other settings altogether. Here, the Gods of Olympus reign, their heroes acting as agents of their will or exemplars of their glory. A century before, the Titans began a war that nearly destroyed the world and this Cataclysm changed everything, returning monsters to the earth, allowing the dead to roam, sinking islands, shattering cities, upsetting the cosmic balance. As the monsters returned, so too did the Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Elementals, Giants, Dragons, Satyrs, Goblins, and Orcs, striding, creeping, skulking or marching back into the world from distant realms or deep fastness, rejoining the world they had left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
