			<description>Designer / Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle Wizard is a new Hero for you to use in the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, before the darkness came to Arax and the hordes of orcs, goblins, demons and undead invaded, the world was a much different - and better - place. Civilization flourished: the dwarfs built their great fortresses, the elves crafted fine towers using their natural skill with magic, and mankind constructed mighty cities.&lt;br/&gt; Then the darkness came.&lt;br/&gt; The time for learning was over, and the time for survival was at hand. The mages of the academies were suddenly forced to abandon their research and, at the order of the king, were told to begin developing spells that would be useful against their enemies. This, the Battle Wizards were born.&lt;br/&gt; This expansion requires the free Chronicles of Arax: Solo Adventure Game Core Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
