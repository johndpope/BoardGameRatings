			<description>(From the included instructions...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's Play Football was originated to give both the football player and the non-football player some of the thrills of football right in the home, in a car, on a plane, or anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed as a twosome - two people, or two teams playing against each other, at the same time, with one game. Let's Play Football can also be played singly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 108 plastic-coated playing cards; printed football field; marker; instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
