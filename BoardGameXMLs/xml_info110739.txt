			<description>To run away from Gargamel and his cat, the smurfs left their village and escaped to the woods.&lt;br/&gt;The players must find them in their six hideouts on the board, bringing them in couples back to the village inside a little caddy, moving it in the paths of the wood.&lt;br/&gt;This with the help (or the tricks) found in the 20 &amp;quot;surprise cards&amp;quot;, to be revealed when passing near Gargamel's castle.&lt;br/&gt;The player who manages to finish first his mission, moving with the caddy the assigned couples to the village, will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
