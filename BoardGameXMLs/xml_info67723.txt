			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;35-page PDF of forms designed specifically for the overwhelmed DM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forms inside this PDF include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Overview Page: Including space to note which published adventures have been used, what setting is being used, and whether or not the setting's metaplot is being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Books Used: Create a comprehensive listing of the books used in your campaign and then hand a copy to your players. &amp;quot;If it's not on the list, it's not used!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Classes Used: As cool as prestige classes are, there are just too many of them for the overworked DM. This form allows the DM to list which classes are allowed, what book they can be found in, and any specific changes for the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign Time and Timeline: What are the names of the months and days of the week in your campaign? What major events have taken place? This form helps you organize it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geographic Features, Towns, and Dungeons: Different forms for each, including half-page forms for noting minor areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major and Minor NPCs: Space to note more than just the name and hit points of an NPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the form pages are presented without unnecessary background graphics and are perfectly suited to most home printers. DMs can print as many or as few copies of each form as they need and keep them all in a binder for easy access during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
