			<description>Game of strategy and memory, and suspense for two players, with unusual material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players create their block-pawns and their starting zone. They receive 12 block-pawns, 18 pawns of their color, 6 pawns of the opponent's color, and 12 neutral pawns. Players secretly insert combinations of 3 pawns in each block-pawn: 1 pawn of their visible color in the window; and 2 pawns of their choice. At the same time as the placement of the block-pawns on the board, the players build their starting zone by positioning the stems. The game begins with 12 blue block-pawns against 12 red block-pawns. The unfolding game will reveal neutral block-pawns, playable by the 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each color a direction with displacement and catch is associated. The catch of an opponent's block-pawn consists in turning over it and replanting it on another stem. According to the internal combination of the block-pawn and the height of the stem, this action involves a modification of color, due to the translation of the pawns. No block-pawn is eliminated materially from the plate, it is transformed. As soon as a neutral block-pawn is present on the play, the players can turn the board a quarter of a turn, to counter their adversary, or to prepare their next blow: another vision of the play arises. The part is finished as soon as a color (Blue, Reed, Neutral) is represented more only by 7 block-pawns on the plate. The players count their respective block-pawns (Blue, Red). That which has some more gained: it is the rule of the 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.plimil.fr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.plimil.fr/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
