							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Color Guard</name>
									
			<description>Color Guard is a tile placing game that is played on a 6x6 board. All 36 spaces are connected with lines of different value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 42 tiles as playing pieces. They all have the same back, but the front shows one of 6 different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to achieve the most points, which are collected from the connecting lines.&lt;br/&gt; Each turn, a player can place up to 3 tiles on the board and refills his hand to 3 tiles again. The tile placement starts in the center of the board and develops to the edges, where the most points can be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 tile placement rules, which make this game very playable. But what makes this game brilliant is the fact, that it includes 6 tiles more than needed (42 tiles for a 36 space board!). Thus, hoarding tiles of a single color to make secure points in the edges is not a good winning strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color Guard, Stronghold, Tower 6 and Where To? are 4 games from Ronald Corn from the 80ies that never found a publisher. They all had interesting mechanics and/or inventive victory conditions - but they had no theme! Since they were not pure abstract games (they used dice, cards or tiles as random elements), this lack of a good theme could be well have been the main reason, why they were never published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
