			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sky's the Limit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take to the Skies!&lt;br/&gt;To a ground-bound warrior, there is nothing more deadly than an opponent who can take to the air, be it on a magic carpet or on the back of a wyvern.  Nut now it's your turn! Take to the skies and bring the fight to them! Tame a pegasus, or just grab your favorite lance, jump on the back of a dragon and level the playing field for once!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise High Above the Clouds...&lt;br/&gt;Who lives above the clouds, looking down upon the lands as the gods from above? Some sought a reprieve from the wards far below while others are looking only for a new realm to conquer. But those who were born and bred in the air will not give up their airborne kingdoms... At least without a fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Adventure Just Took on a Whole New Dimension!&lt;br/&gt;There's more in the skies than just the dragons and the odd flying wizard.  Entire societies, each with their own dark secrets, live on without ever setting foot on the ground miles below. Some are good, clinging to the light, while others plot the vile destruction of all who would oppose their rule. do you have the courage to face them in their own element?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
