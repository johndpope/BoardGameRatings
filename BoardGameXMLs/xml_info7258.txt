			<description>Hitchiker 2012 is an easy to play adventure where a little imagination, free thinking spirit and love of satire will take you for a wild ride on an emotional rollercoaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise is simple.  Players (2-6) assume the role of carefree Hitchikers and set out on the road to make their fortune while trying to avoid trouble along the way.  Hitchikers don't have jobs so you'll have to find some more creative ways to make your money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with a HOMETOWN, $25,000 and a Bank envelope.  The object of the game is to be the first player to save $250,000 in your Bank or accumulate $50 million in traveling cash.  You can only deposit money in your bank by passing through or landing on your own HOMETOWN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game (play method) will be familiar to anyone who has played a traditional board game like Monopoly except unlike most other games, you're never really out of it until someone actually wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitchikers travel by rolling two dice and following the highway clockwise around the board.  Each city or location along the road counts as one space.  Upon arrival at your new location, you will either be presented with an opportunity to earn huge sums of money or face a potential disaster like a Bad Ride or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although random luck (dice) will play a role during the game, there is also a need for strategic planning.  With two ways to win the game delivers an opportunity for everyone to have a chance.  If you tend to be cautious by nature, you can win by being conservative and saving money in your Bank.  On the other hand, if you like to gamble you will love the pursuit of monster payouts as you stack up your traveling cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast paced, high stakes action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
