			<description>Bring a Whole New Perspective to Your GURPS Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the most amazing thing you can do with your gaming is to look at things from a new angle, shake things up, and challenge your perspectives. This issue of Pyramid - the PDF magazine for roleplayers - is devoted to looking at things from a different point of view. Its senses-stretching articles include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Long and the Short of It,&amp;quot; Sean Punch's supplement-length look at how extremes of time and space can call for special scrutiny in GURPS, in the same vein as the advice from How to Be a GURPS GM. Whether your campaigns are set in a tiny hamlet or the endless multiverse, or whether they're one-shots or span generations, you'll learn how to ensure your campaigns are balanced and fun!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Disappearance of Father Cohen,&amp;quot; this month's Eidetic Memory from GURPS Abydos author David L. Pulver. In this adventure - suitable for GURPS Horror or lower-powered GURPS Monster Hunters heroes - the investigators must determine whether Father Cohen was working for good or ill, what his goals were, and how to defeat a greater evil!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Heroes on the Mass Scale,&amp;quot; an in-depth guide to translating adventurers into the GURPS Mass Combat system. Zooming out from furious personal melee to larger tactical battles has never been easier!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Elvey Institute,&amp;quot; an odd organization (with GURPS Boardroom and Curia stats) that takes a very long view on solving the world's problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue also presents a Random Thought Table that offers more ideas for different perspectives, plus Odds and Ends that expand the options for the Elvey Institute and feature a behind-the-scenes look at the gorgeous Brandon Moore cover. Your campaign can always benefit from a new point of view, and this issue might be just what you need to look at things with fresh eyes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
