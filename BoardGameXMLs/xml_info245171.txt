			<description>Feat On The Ground is a sequel to Ahead In The Clouds. If you recall, the industrialists gather and manage resources (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Water and Stone) in order to provide for their families and keep the city in the clouds afloat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empacta, the planet beneath the cloud city, is in bad shape - which is rough news for everyone. After an eternity of exploiting the Empacta's resources, it is dried up and the ecosystem is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an industrialist, you will use your resources to help re-shape the planet. By gathering and forming collections of assigned resources you will terraform Empacta back to its prime. After all, a city in the clouds is nothing without the planet below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Feat on the Ground, each player will take their turn by playing a card to the map, adding resources or removing them. Together you will be working on a defined area, but players will assume different roles once an area is completed. If a player completes the area on their turn, they will get credit and score points. If it&amp;rsquo;s completed on their opponent&amp;rsquo;s turn, they will stash resources to bring back with them. At the end of the game, players score points if they stashed the most of a resource type. In the end, the player that manages to do these the best is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Feat On The Ground requires 8 coins/cubes/tokens for tracking scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
