			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burgermania is a real-time dexterity game. Two players are racing to build hamburgers based on their order cards. Conveyor belt is battery operated, and players try to stack ingredients like lettuce, cheese and tomato in their hamburgers using tweezers. At the end of the line the hamburger is placed on a plate. The conveyor belt accelerates, so the later hamburgers are more difficult to build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
