			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, Directors, Developers. The three grow out of one another quite naturally. The desire to play the game turns into the desire to host a game which then turns into the desire to change the game to ones needs. For most Role Playing Games the desire is stifled at the directing level, directors could and often did create their own monsters and magical items and game worlds but ultimately these innovations never ventured far from the games of the people who invented them. Official game design trickled down the stone-walled ramparts of distant game companies who were not exactly deaf to the needs of their players but were often distant, physically inaccessible, and seemingly resentful of having to deal with the contributions of their co-workers let alone all the anonymous Joes &amp;amp; Janes who played their games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays, thanks in part to the internet, no one is blissfully out of touch from anything yet a stone wall of bureaucracy seems to stand between the people who design the games and those who play them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not with the Theatre of the Adsurb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
