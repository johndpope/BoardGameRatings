			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if the wars of the Napoleonic Era were fought with dragons as well as armies and ships?  With In Harm's Way: Dragons! you can answer that question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game contains all the rules necessary, along with a random dragon generator and example dragons. You can play this game in any period from the American War of Independence to the Crimean war, though it concentrates on the Napoleonic wars. French, British, and American human and dragon characters are supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Harm's Way: Dragons! uses the StarCluster 2.5 System, with some significant differences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play British, American, or French characters, both humans and dragons.&lt;br/&gt;     Play Wingmen, Lieutenants, Wing Commanders, Captains, or even Commodore or Admiral - or you can start as Wingmen and play all the way through to your retirement as an Admiral.&lt;br/&gt;     Troupe Play: Players play three characters, an Officer, a Warrant Officer, and an Airman, or an officer and some other player's dragon.&lt;br/&gt;     Honor/Practicality Mechanic: Adds to your chance of success due to your reputation.&lt;br/&gt;     Interest and Notice: You have to accumulate Notice - the approval of your superiors - and add your Interest - your family's political clout - to advance in rank. You are born with Interest, but in order to get Notice, you have to burn with zeal and throw yourself headlong in harm's way.&lt;br/&gt;     Competitive Play: There can be only one Captain. One hero. Is it going to be you, or the guy sitting next to you?&lt;br/&gt;     Voluntary Wounds: You are face to face with the Captain of the French dragon. He's a master of the blade, and after a long duel, cuts you down. Instead of taking damage from it now, you can turn some or all of the damage into a permanent wound, and deal with it later. You stay on your feet, and slash him in return. He drops to your feet, dazed and bleeding. The dragon is yours - but that left arm is going to have to come off...&lt;br/&gt;     Avocations: You're an officer, sure - so are all your fellow officers - but you are also an intelligence agent. Breckenridge over there is an avid naturalist, always cutting things up. Williams is a gambler and a bit of a sharp, you suspect, and Horton and Woolrich are both passionate amateur musicians, on violin and cello respectively.&lt;br/&gt;     Create dragon Breeds of your own with the Dragon Breed Generator.&lt;br/&gt;     Play humans, dragons, or both as you choose.&lt;br/&gt;     Play wild or feral dragons caught up in the human wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
