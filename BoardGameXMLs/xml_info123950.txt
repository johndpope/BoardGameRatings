			<description>From the box: Two games in one!  Our specially designed double-sided board offers two favorite games - Steeplechase on one side and Ladders &amp;amp; Slides on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steeplechase is a game where the players roll two dice and move their markers (horses) the number of spaces shown on the dice.  There are special squares that either help you or hinder your progress.  The first &amp;quot;horse&amp;quot; to reach the finish line wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ladders &amp;amp; Slides is basically the same as Chutes &amp;amp; Ladders, Snakes &amp;amp; Ladders, Knights &amp;amp; Dragons, etc.  Roll one die and move forward the number shown.  If you land on a square with the botton of a ladder, you automatically move to the square at the top of the ladder.  If you land on a square with the top of a slide, your mover is sent to the square at the bottom of the slide.  The first player to reach square 100 by an exact number wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
