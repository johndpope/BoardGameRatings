			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is late one night when the characters are approached by a man introducing himself as Garius Toovale. Dressed in simple trappings, he asks if the characters would be willing to assist him in a mission of mercy. He can&amp;rsquo;t pay much &amp;ndash; 500 cogs only &amp;ndash; but explains he is desperate to find out what has happened to his family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they accept, Garius will proceed. About seven months ago, a trade ship chanced upon an undiscovered island. A free floating isle, it seemed abundant with the basics for life and held much potential. Upon the ship&amp;rsquo;s arrival in port, her captain &amp;ndash; who had collected some of the isle&amp;rsquo;s earth &amp;ndash; met a young miner, Karl Vous, whose family excavation had recently run dry. Seeing this as an opportunity to start anew, Karl gathered families affected by the downturn in mining, and together they purchased the location of the island. With little preparation, but much hope and determination, Vous and four other families &amp;ndash; including Garius&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; set out towards their new home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garius has not heard from them since. While is may seem odd that he&amp;rsquo;s so concerned after such a brief period of time, he says the plan was for the colonist&amp;rsquo;s ship to return as soon as possible for the others. He realizes he might be overreacting, but he needs to find out what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toovale is reluctant to share any more personal information, but he does indicate he has a sample of the island&amp;rsquo;s earth, which he will allow the party to have once they are underway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
