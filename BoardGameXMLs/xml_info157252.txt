			<description>designer's website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Happy Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Appreciation Day! Although I haven&amp;rsquo;t played much of it, S&amp;amp;W strikes me as a great system&amp;mdash;clearly written, it retains the spark of the Original rules while smoothing out some of the more incomprehensible quirks. Best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s eminently hackable; indeed, the S&amp;amp;W creators go farther than almost anyone in enabling you to hack your own system onto S&amp;amp;W. &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module is dubbed IDA0: Plague-Stricken Halls. In it, a lawful goblin fortress has been overrun by a strange plague, leaving its wonderful magical riches free for the taking. Among these are a Font of Ever-Burning Oil, and a Ring of Forbidden Fruit which turns your own skeleton against you! The module also includes new monsters, a nifty map, and of course a fully-keyed dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s written for my own house setting, Terra Pericolosa, which is set on medieval earth. As such, the goblins were mostly Catholics, and I&amp;rsquo;ve sprinkled Biblical allusions throughout the text. If there&amp;rsquo;s interest, I might do a follow-up post on Terra Pericolosa. For your own games, it could easily be adapted and dropped into any hexcrawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
