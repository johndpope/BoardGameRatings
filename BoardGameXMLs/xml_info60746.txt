							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sarkuvans</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, the Morphic Society created a race of shapeshifting enforcers and assassins to carry out their will. They were a scourge on the lands of free people, committing unspeakable acts in the name of their wizard masters. After many decades the Morphic Society was defeated and most of its minions destroyed. Today, the remaining shapeshifters live in the caves and sewers beneath the great cities, plotting death and destruction for their enemies and the seeking the secrets of creating more of their kind. Will they succeed and create a newer, stronger Morphic Society, or will they be cast down to lurk forever in the twilight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races of Twilight: Sarkuvans is the third in a series of d20 racial toolkits. Not simply a collection of elf and dwarf variants, the Races of Twilight series provides detailed information on unique and original player races that can be incorporated into any fantasy campaign. While intended for the experienced gamer who enjoys deep characterization and role-playing over one-dimensional heroics and &amp;quot;roll-playing,&amp;quot; Races of Twilight can be used by anyone who likes unusual characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the races presented are in some way approaching the final phase of their cultural, political, or physiological development and are slowly fading from the world. Some have fallen into decadence and apathy; others have lost their dominance and position in a world of multiracial empires; still others have been crushed by disease, overpopulation, or magical travails. Whether each races dies and is forgotten or overcomes its difficulties and thrives is in the hands of players and DMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While each book provides numerous details on a new race, plenty of room is left for DMs to develop a unique background and role for that race in his campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races of Twilight: The Sarkuvans features the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed information on sarkuvan characters, lands, and culture&lt;br/&gt;     Three evil gods and demon lords&lt;br/&gt;     A detailed look at crafting poisons&lt;br/&gt;     New character feats, many that are unique to the sarkuvan race&lt;br/&gt;     Three new prestige classes: the Living Weapon, the Mimic, and the Morphic Mage&lt;br/&gt;     Two new clerical domains and seven new spells&lt;br/&gt;     New weapons and equipment, both magical and mundane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
