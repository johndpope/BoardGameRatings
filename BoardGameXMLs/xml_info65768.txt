			<description>Preparation:&lt;br/&gt;1.Select one of the three packs of playing cards. The maps with images used as the other cards would be difficult for one or more players not so well read. &lt;br/&gt;2.Sit somewhere where the players enough space have their role to play.&lt;br/&gt;3.The players go sit in a circle so every one player whose turn it is good to see. The board is put down in the middle .. The hourglass and the dice for the youngest player down. &lt;br/&gt;4.The pack of cards was selected vice versa (i.e. with the text down) next to the sign down.&lt;br/&gt;5.The players choose a pawn and put in the triangular box at the start board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game:&lt;br/&gt;1.The youngest player starts and throws the dice.&lt;br/&gt;2.He draws the first card from the pack. The number of eyes of the dice determines the number of category on the card to be portrayed.&lt;br/&gt;3.He remembers what to portray, flip the hourglass and goes as long portraying until the hourglass is completely gone.&lt;br/&gt;Caution! All gestures and sounds are allowed, but words can express absolute last resort.&lt;br/&gt;Players who have not read so well do not on the numbers of the dice to watch and the picture images on the card they have drawn out.&lt;br/&gt;4.The other players try to guess what is depicted. Each player must answer if he to turn (the first player left of the guesser and then continue with the clockwise (note):&lt;br/&gt;- If a player gives a wrong answer, the turn the hands of the clockwise to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;- If a player gives a correct answer, he may be pawn on the board and put forward two squares, the guesser his pawn one square put forward.&lt;br/&gt;- If no player has given a correct answer before the hourglass is gone, nobody should be oppose pawn. In all cases the turn then to the hands of the clockwise to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner:&lt;br/&gt;The player who first reaches the last slot is the winner. It is not necessarily to arrive with exact number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
