			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two bands of nomadic survivors are on a high-speed trek down the rubble of Interstate 9 to what is fabled to be the last source of water. Will you be able to quench your thirst or will die trying? In an odd mix inspired by Wings of War, Mille Borne, and Mad Max, we have a head to head card game with dice rolling, location smashing, and card shooting fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deck of Distance Cards is shuffled and placed between both players. A deck of Item Cards is also shuffled and place between both players. Finally, a set of six vehicle cards (representative of each player's car layout) and a gear box card is given to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing cards from the Distance Deck and rolling 1d6 to try to beat the difficulty value listed on each card. Different locations have different difficulty values, sometimes causing damage to vehicles or rewarding players with items like armor or weapons. As players successfully maneuver through locations, they add these cards to their Distance Traveled deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also choose to attack each other to cause damage to their vehicles, use items to boost their position, or press their luck and avoid disastrous terrain (no one likes minefields).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most Distance Traveled cards at the end of the deck or have gained 10+ cards than their opponent wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
