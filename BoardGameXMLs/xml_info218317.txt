			<description>Each player has to get 4 meeples from the starting space to the 4 destination spaces of his color. 2 meeples use the left side and 2 meeples use the right side of the game board. Movement is determined by rolling a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a meeple gets on a free green space, the Player shouts: &amp;quot;Mensch, sei kein Frosch!&amp;quot; and takes the next opponent meeple in front of him back to the starting space. If the green space is already occupied, the player sets his meeple on the space in front of it and pays a token into the cash box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a meeple gets on a free red space, it changes places with the next opponent meeple in front of it. If the red space is occupied, the player sets his meeple two spaces in front of it and pays a token into the cash box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a meeple gets on space 80/81 the player has to miss a turn. If the space is alredy occupied, the first meeple is moved 6 free black spaces backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space 100 must be reached by exact count. Only meeples that are standing on space 100 may move onto the destination spaces. If the player rolls too many points, the surplus points must be moved backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get his 4 meeples to his 4 destination spaces wins the game and two thirds of the cash box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
