							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saigon: The Final Days</name>
									
			<description>A later Adventure International title, Saigon: The Final Days, had as its very dark scenario the escape of a soldier from Vietnam at the end of the war. It was written by by Jyym Pearson and Robin Pearson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quirk in this game's input parser provided an unintentional surprise bit of morbid gameplay. At one point in the game, the player must figure out how to cross a predator-infested river. Entering the command &amp;quot;confess to war crimes&amp;quot; here would not be rejected as gibberish as one might expect, but would actually kill the player. This turned out to not be a planned feature; the parser was finding the command &amp;quot;swim&amp;quot; embedded in the phrase (&amp;quot;confess to war crimes&amp;quot;), and swimming across the river was invariably a fatal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual solution to the game was no less macabre, involving zipping oneself into a body bag to be carried out of the country by an evacuation helicopter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Adventure International&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
