			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Cartoon Action Hour: Season 3 series book by Mark Lungo, life is good for most of the citizens of Creaturia, a futuristic planet populated by intelligent humanoid animals. But no world is perfect, and Creaturia has its criminals. The worst were imprisoned in an underground, ultra-secure reformatory called the Quarry&amp;mdash;until an evil genius named Vance Coffin masterminded a mass prison break and invited the escapees to join his crime syndicate, Outrage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, CIPO, the Creaturian International Police Organization, has a special unit called the Crimestrikers to deal with these threats. This team of colorful, courageous experts is led by Diana Mastron, who is not only Vance Coffin&amp;rsquo;s equal, but knows him better than anyone else. After all, she almost married him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 64-page PDF contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Information about the setting, including its technology, magic, interesting locals and more&lt;br/&gt;     14 episode seeds and 10 episode seedlings to get your group into the action&lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for creating your own Player Characters&lt;br/&gt;     19 heroes&lt;br/&gt;     14 villains&lt;br/&gt;     14 vehicles/playsets&lt;br/&gt;     Numerous illustrations that bring the series to life&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
