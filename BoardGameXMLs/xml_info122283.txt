			<description>All players start with the same starting money and travel through all those european countries in which adopted the Euro as their currency. Which of the players will earn the most money? Who will be most successful at the stock markets? Who is going to secure the most valuable business shares?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player in turn rolls a dice and places his meeple in the matching country, where he can secure business shares, book an overnight stay, live through some events and possibly operate at the stock market or pass on the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all business shares are in private ownership one last turn of stock market operation follows and then the winner (the player holding the most stocks at the stock market) is determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
