							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Builders</name>
									
			<description>This piecepack game has two phases: First all the players build a dungeon by placing rooms, monsters and items. They may also use their turns to power their hero up, as only the most powerful hero will enter the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the dungeon is ready, the most powerful hero (in case of a tie, there's a small auction) enters the dungeon and plays a mini Dungeon Crawl, trying to get all the gold and defeat the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the hero is successful, he'll keep the gold, but the other players will also gain gold for every point of damage done by their monsters and for items used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in different rounds until one player gains a set amount of gold decided at the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's an element of bluffing because items and monsters are placed face down, hiding their identity, and this can be used to trick other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
