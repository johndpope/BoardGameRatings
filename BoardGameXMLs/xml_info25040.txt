			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Know you all a comic's chin?  A stately nose, a golfer's grin?  A President's brow, a pop star's cheek?  The name?....alas.... the game's Mystique.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MYSTIQUE is a new and exciting game for all the family.  A numbered casket contains 75 famous faces from the past and present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the face is gradually revealed the players attempt to identify the personality whilst collecting simple information cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple and entertaining game which can be played anywhere, anytime by everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In essence a simple deduction game where players try and identify a celebrity from parts of a (sketched) picture.  Help is provided in the form of FAX cards that provide information on gender, whether they are alive or dead, where they come from, and for which reason they may be famous (pop music, sport, cinema, television, public life, the arts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A somewhat complex scoring system is used to determine the winner of each round, and ultimately the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
