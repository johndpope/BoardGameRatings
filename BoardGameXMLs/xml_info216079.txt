							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orcs Must Die!: Minion Pack</name>
									
			<description>The Minion Pack contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Dwarf Grenadiers (enemy of the Unchained) - Dwarf Grenadiers can injure multiple Heroes simultaneously with thrown bombs that do a lot of damage, which scales up rapidly with each Onslaught. This encourages a Hero to fight them alone, thereby putting themselves at risk from other enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Gnome Tinkerers (enemy of the Unchained) - Clever Gnomes will capture your Traps and turn them against you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Goblin Sappers (enemy of the Order) - Devious Goblins will destroy your hard-earned traps! You have to kill them as quickly as possible or see your Fortress defenses fall apart before your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Cyclops (enemy of the Order) - Powerful and hard to kill, Cyclopses use unusual attack dice to deliver their impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack also contains new Minion Description Cards and Army Cards to shuffle into your decks so these Monsters can easily join the fray!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
