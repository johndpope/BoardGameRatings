			<description>Mark of the Werewolf is a game of deduction, accusations, bluffing, survival, and mob mentality involving two teams: Villagers and Werewolves. The Villagers don&amp;rsquo;t know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to devour the Villagers one by one before the Villagers discover who they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;Choose a Moderator: He is not on either team and only manages the &amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Night&amp;rdquo; phases of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your cards: From the deck of Role cards, choose enough cards so that each player gets a card. Make sure you have at least 1 Werewolf card, 1 Seer card, and 1 Villager card for each of the remaining players. &lt;br/&gt;Example: for 7 players you will need. 1 Werewolf card, 1 Seer card, and 5 Villager cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards: Using only the cards you pulled out, shuffle the deck and deal a card to each player, face down. Each player secretly looks at their card, being careful not to let other players see it. Players may say anything they want about their card but they can not reveal their card at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark of the Werewolf takes place over a series of &amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Night&amp;rdquo; Phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NIGHT: During the night the Werewolves pick an innocent Villager as their victim, eliminating them from the game. The Seer will pick a player and learn if they are a Werewolf or not. The Moderator will lead the players through the Night Phase of the game following a script provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DAY: During the day, the players try to discover who the Werewolves are. They do this by lynching one player during each Day Phase in an attempt to eliminate the Werewolves from the Village before the Werewolves kill all of the Villagers. Once a player has been lynched he must remain silent for the rest of the game. It is often best to have lynched players get up and watch from an area close by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the Game&lt;br/&gt;Repeat the &amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Night&amp;rdquo; phases until all Werewolves have been killed, or the number of Werewolves is equal to the number of Villagers (at which time the Werewolves overtake the village and win the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 54 Role Cards, 54 Treasure cards, 1 Rule book, and 1 Score pad. 44 unique role cards and 36 unique treasure cards. The combination of cards in this game are endless and will keep you and your friends entertained for hours on end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
