			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirit of Aventure is a first-person perspective 3D dungeon crawler in the spirit of Bard's Tale or publisher Attic's later Realms of Arkania games.  The player is tasked with unravelling a sinster plot centring on the distribution of a nefarious addictive drug that threatens to unravel the fabric of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player creates a party of six characters chosen from various races and classes ranging from the mundane to the bizarre ('goddess' is a class, now, apparently).  An interesting feature of the game is that character class determines sex, although each class has relatively clear male/female analogues.  Magicians, for example, are somehow the male equivalent of Goddesses.  Gameplay consists of exploring towns and fighting beasties.  While the game is fundamentally driven by its plot, the player has a fair bit of freedom to explore and wander around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
