			<description>The goal of the game is to travel with a rocket to the space station, from there with a spaceship to Mars or Venus and back to the space Station, change into the rocket and return to earth. The moves are determined by a die. To make this difficult, the station moves one space per game turn. The first player to return to earth wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the 1950s or '60s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
