In July 2007, Sony announced that Rockstar was working on a new franchise for the PlayStation 3, but details of the project, including its title, were not announced until June 2009 during the Sony press conference at E3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set during the Cold War and will take players into &amp;quot;the world of counter-intelligence, espionage and political assassinations&amp;quot;, according to a Rockstar press release.  Rockstar has yet to reveal any details regarding the setting other than the fact that it will be set in the late 1970s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Agent (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
