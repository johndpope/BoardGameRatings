			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new exhibition has settled on the outskirts of the village. Trying to break a little routine, you've been with your girlfriend Sofia to visit it; however, she does not attend the appointment. What could happen? When, alarmed, you start to look, you soon realize that in this place nothing is as it seems. Terror, magic and fantasy await at every corner, at every attraction. You'll have to take the plunge if you want to find and save her from the sinister evil that permeates everything. You are the hero of this story and you have to make decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
