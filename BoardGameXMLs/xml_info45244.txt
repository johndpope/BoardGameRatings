							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hamlet of Wodfeld</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hamlet of Wodfeld is a rural settlement that rises near a river. The village is surrounded by wood and is linked to the rest of the world by a main road. Wodfeld is small but has everything a good group of adventures may need: a general store, a blacksmith, an inn, a very small temple, a watermill and a cemetery plus some farm houses. Wodfeld is the perfect place to start over a campaign and the best place to put on the adventurer&amp;rsquo;s way. An adventure set in Wodfeld already exists and it is called Earth Unleashed (OSRIC).&lt;br/&gt;Some hints to use the hamlet follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The PCs arrive in Wodfeld, where weird things are happening. They witness sand and stones falling from the sky, accompanied by a mild earthquake. The local druid claims it is the work of Mother Nature, who wants the loggers gone. The PCs are asked to investigate the disappearance of two lumberjacks... (this leads to the Earth Unleashed adventure)&lt;br/&gt;     A vampire plagues the hamlet of Wodfeld. During the night, the inhabitants of Wodfeld bar their doors and windows. The PCs are hired to hunt down the monster. The vampire was, in life, a ranger; he is very sly and leaves false traces leading to the near wood, toward many monsters&amp;rsquo; lairs. The vampire sleeps in the cemetery in a tomb without name.&lt;br/&gt;     A group of bandits harass the hamlet of Wodfeld. They make raids and plunder at least every 15 days. One of the villagers, tired of this harassment, leaves the hamlet for a distant and ancient temple, asking the solitary god to help him. The god gave the villager the power to defeat the bandits: a shapechanging amulet that would turn him in a fierce beast, unfortunately the beast was utterly evil. The man returns to the hamlet and arrive in the same moment the PCs and the bandits enter the hamlet...&lt;br/&gt;     While resting in the hamlet, the PCs witness the kidnapping of a child. A dark, looming figure snatches the child and fly away. The villagers refuse to speak about the fact and ignore it completely. A dark cult, with members among the most prominent villagers, makes human sacrifices to a dark deity. The cult hideout is found in forgotten catacombs below the House of Prayers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
