			<description>Cricket with dice. Make lists of both teams, with names of all batters and bowlers. The opening bowler rolls the &amp;quot;bowling&amp;quot; dice, that is the dice with 1,2,3,4,6 &amp;amp; &amp;quot;HOWZAT&amp;quot; on it. The batting team scores 1,2,3,4 or 6 runs until &amp;quot;HOWZAT&amp;quot; is rolled. The batsban then rolls the &amp;quot;BATTING&amp;quot; dice to determine the result of the &amp;quot;appeal&amp;quot;. One bowler rolls the bowling dice until one batsman is out. The next bowler rolls until the next batman is out. The next team takes their turn, and the winner is the team with most runs at end of 2 innings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
