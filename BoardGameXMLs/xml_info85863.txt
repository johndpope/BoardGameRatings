			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydro Thunder Hurricane is a boat racing game released for the Xbox 360 Live Arcade. The player chooses one of nine boats and races on a number of courses in an arcade-style game. Hurricane is a sequel to the arcade game Hydro Thunder, and includes a number of features that were included in the first game. There are a number of boost powerups that can be collected on the tracks which allow the player to speed up temporarily or jump over obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each race the player earns credits which they can use to unlock additional elements such as game modes, skins, and courses. Hurricane includes four play modes: a 16 competitor race, Ring Master, Gauntlet, and Championship. Ring Master has the player boat through a series of rings on a course, while Gauntlet replaces the opponents with an obstacle course of explosive barrels. Championship is a combination of races and modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
