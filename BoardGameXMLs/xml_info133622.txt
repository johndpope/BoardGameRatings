			<description>Towns is a city-building simulation game that shakes up the genre by placing the town above a cavernous dungeon.  Help manage and build the kind of town that will attract glorious heroes and cater to their needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Steam Discription:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Towns brings a fresh new take on the citybuilding/management genre by introducing many RPG features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has you managing a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Craft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
