							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Ride: Hafid Ridge</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb: &amp;quot;Death Ride - Hafid Ridge provides a small, introductory game into the Death Ride system by Grognard Simulations.  It is a platoon level tactical game with forces representing the British 7th Armor Brigade in front of Hafid Ridge during Operation Battleaxe.  The result of this battle caused the removal of General Wavell from his command in the desert.  5th Leichte Divisions', soon to be 21st Panzers', PanzerJager battalion and some supporting flak elements withstood a determined attempt to force them off the ridge and move north toward Ft Capuzzo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main elements of change from the Death Ride Kursk games is a move to use silouhettes for the armor units and double sided counters.  There will be more player aids and the size of this game will be perfect for those looking to finish a play through in a few hours.  This game may hopefully become a tournament game since the challenge to both sides is quite high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will find this game very easy to start playing and will then be looking for the meatier elements of the Death Ride Series after they are bitten by the Death Ride bug.  The amount of critical decision making and knife-edge suspense will have you wanting more.  And we will find you more.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
