							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eagle Day</name>
									
			<description>A game that appears to have been inspired by Zocchi's Battle of Britain (and to have borrowed a bit from the former game as well.) This game uses 10 minute turns, approximately 5 mile hexes, and units representing Gruppen (27 planes) and Squadrons (12 planes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game places you in command of the forces which took part in the original campaign . . . Eagle Day is two games-in-one. The Historical Game allows you to re-fight the original battle.   The September Game allows you to see what would have happened if the Germans had continued to bomb the RAF's airfields instead of switching the focus of their attacks to London . . . Eagle Day is played in 'full turns', each representing ten minutes of time. Each week has 20 full turns . . . When the third week is over, the game is ended.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
