Each turn involves 5 phases:&lt;br/&gt; 1.Naval Movement&lt;br/&gt; 2.Air Movement&lt;br/&gt; 3.Air Reaction&lt;br/&gt; 4.Air &amp;amp; Naval Combat&lt;br/&gt; 5.Ground Movement &amp;amp; Combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be RANGED Fire from Artillery Types as well as Naval units capable of performing this. The rules get very explicit for the various special units inclusive to this campaign with such Naval types as Seaplane Tenders, Landing Craft, Submarines, Transports, plus the requisite usual Naval vessels. The Land components can also have specialized abilities including step reduction represented by another lesser value counter and Combat Units range in size from Company/Battery up to Regiment/Brigade formations while HQs can represent from Brigade level up to Army/Theater Command. The unique feature about the Unit Formation symbol is that they've placed it underneath the Unit Type Symbol whereas almost everyone else has it ABOVE this.&lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
