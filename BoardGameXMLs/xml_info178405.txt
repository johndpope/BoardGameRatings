			<description>This memory game contains 12 sets of puzzles and their respective puzzle boards, which are used to play a number of competitive or cooperative games within the predetermined time limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, when playing a competitive game, each player chooses a set of puzzles and places its pieces in the center of the playing surface face down, together with other players&amp;rsquo; puzzle pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players take turns pointing to a missing piece on their own puzzle boards and turning over a puzzle piece to see if there is a match.  Before passing the turn to the next player, any matching  puzzle piece is placed on the corresponding puzzle board, while a mismatched puzzle piece is turned to face down again in the center of the playing surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game is to be the first player to complete his/her puzzle board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
