							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Monks of High River</name>
									
			<description>Acolytes of the oldest temple in the Five Rivers Valley, the monks of High River are also the most feared. Trained in a wide range of both agonizing and lethal combat skills, the monks are adept at violence and its application. Legends abound of individual monks facing down a dozen men, or turning the tide of a battle single handedly. They are seen by some as demons of pure rage; a reputation the monks use to their advantage, covering their faces with steel masks to conceal their humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monks of High River cannot be swayed to a cause with promises of power, wealth, or honor. They do not concern themselves with material rewards, only with the perfection of their art. That their chosen art is pain and death means they can be swayed with the promise of deadly opponents against which to hone their skills. Those who request the monks' assistance do so knowing they are unleashing living weapons onto their enemies, and must hope those enemies prove worthy of the monks' attentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing three 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic. Will require some preparation and assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Monks of High River&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Monks of High River&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
