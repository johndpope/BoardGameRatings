							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BWAH! Can&#039;t Stop the Signal</name>
									
			<description>A stand alone BWAH!! game that can be combined with the original if desired. BWAH! Can't Stop the Signal is based on the game BANG!! but set in the &amp;quot;Firefly&amp;quot; universe created by Joss Whedon. This one is based on the movie &amp;quot;Serenity&amp;quot; and not directly the show. The game uses the same mechanics as BWAH! and BANG! except the characters and professions are from the movie. Some examples are Wash, Zoe, and Mal as characters and Psychic, Crew, Captain, Reavers, and Operative as professions. Health is recovered by eating Fruity Oaty Bars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
