			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd in the adventure series, the first being Perfectorium Of The Golden Tentacle.  The Face Stealer has beaten the Labyrinth Lord and awaits the party!  You may have been through the Perfectorium and survived but can you face the master behind it all?  Only the powerful will be able to face it, the ones that have been tested by battle.  This could be it, the last adventure they will ever have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Face Stealer has waited forever to finish his great plan.  The world will be his and he will rule all even the demons he has been allies with.  He is so close to finishing the work.  But blast that party!  They have the map to the Cacoshox.  He will have to prepare his minions, beings the party will never have seen before.   Their defeat will be easy.  Just how powerful are these new adversaries he wonders.  Nevermind, he is safe in the Cacoshox! :D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cacoshox is a high level Labyrinth Lord/OSR adventure.  Weird but fun.  Shox will not be your guide but he will do all he can to rid the Cacoshox of you.  Cacoshox can be played after the adventure Perfectorium Of The Golden Tentacle or even as a stand alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
