			<description>&amp;quot;The world of stars&amp;quot; in English&lt;br/&gt;On 32 cards there are 2 questions with three answers each, on the back with information and illustration on the subject. Players receive questions cards, in case of 3 and 4 players also betting cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player is asked by the quizmaster, if the first answer is right, he is asked the second question. If the answer is again correct, the player receives the card and places it with his betting cards. In case the first answer was wrong the left neighbour of the player can risk an answer and use one of his betting cards. If he answers wrong, he loses he card. When no one has questions cards left, the player with the most betting cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
