			<description>Description taken from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has to use one petter. The attack begins from the center. Each player has in turn with his opponent one unchecked kick in order to make a goal. The ball has to be beaten from the point where it comes to a stop. It can be kicked into the goal directly or by rebounding from the borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
