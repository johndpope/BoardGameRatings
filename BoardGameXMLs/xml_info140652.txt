			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information age has made infiltration even more dangerous for the would-be spy. Data mining can uncover even the most studious falsified background of a spy and plastic surgery is no match for digital imaging technology. Security trumps espionage, or so it seems. A new breed of undercover agent can penetrate even the most paranoid organization, able to uncover the most highly guarded secrets. A literal chameleon, these agents can shape shift into a new form, changing their appearance, size, skin color, hair or even gender. These abilities are powered either by mutation or advanced genetic engineering experiments and honed by training and experience. Virtually all Chameleons are freelance spies, working for anyone who can find them and afford their talents. This 7 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Haven: Full Metal Zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
