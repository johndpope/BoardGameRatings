			<description>Advertising game for a German bank. Players are trying to finance building their house. They move along a track, with the movement determined by their action cards. There are different types of action cards, not all of which can be played at all times. Event cards help or obstruct the players. The first player to reach the house without event cards and with no more than two action cards in his or her hand is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
