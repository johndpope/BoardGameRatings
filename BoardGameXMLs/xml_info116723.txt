			<description>The Rolling, Racing, Frantic, Flipping Action Game of Strategy and Chance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking Place on a 3-D Board, Players take turns rolling a ball around a circular game field.  As the ball slows, it drops through one of a number of holes which hits a flipper.  The flipper levers over revealing the number of spaces a player moves one of their four cones.  The object is to get one of your cones around the game field back home.  But beware, for an opponent landing on your cone will send you back to the start, and the eight spaces on the flippers, which lever into a central dumping well, will flip your cone out of the game permanently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
