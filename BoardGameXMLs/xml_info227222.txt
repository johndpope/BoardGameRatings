							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill Hitler</name>
									
			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players set in the period 1940-45. Players represent various elements of the German Resistance trying to assassinate Hitler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through card play players strive to be the first player to assassinate Hitler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising 6 card types: &lt;br/&gt;Method (Plot Card. Weapons used in an attempt)&lt;br/&gt;Conspirator (Plot Card. Key Personnel involved)&lt;br/&gt;Venue (Plot Card. Exact Building or Location the Fuhrer is currently in)&lt;br/&gt;Locale (Plot Card. City or Region the Fuhrer is currently in) &lt;br/&gt;Save (Events that Prevent an assassination)&lt;br/&gt;Action (Events with Special effects)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set-up the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of 5 cards. &lt;br/&gt; Players take turns with each turn having 5 phases: &lt;br/&gt;1.  Fate Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 1 card from the deck and put it in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;2.  Plot Phase &lt;br/&gt;-   You may put 1 or more plot cards into play face up in front of you. &lt;br/&gt;-   A Complete Plot consists of 1 of each of the 4 different types of Plot Cards:  Method, Conspirator, Venue, Locale. &lt;br/&gt;3.  Foil Phase &lt;br/&gt;-   Any opponent may play (discard) 1 or more save cards. &lt;br/&gt;A save card causes the target indicated plot card to be discarded.  You may immediately play a plot card from your hand to replace the card eliminated by the save card. &lt;br/&gt;4.  Kill Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If you have complete plot in play, roll 1 die for each of the 4 plot cards. (This is called the assassination attempt). &lt;br/&gt;For each odd number you roll, discard 1 plot card.  If all the rolls are even, the attempt is a success, you have killed Hitler, and you win the game.  &lt;br/&gt;5.  End Phase &lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Hitler is not killed after the players have gone through the deck twice then Hitler survives, the German Resistance is crushed, and all the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
