			<description>Part of the Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product adds new rules, races and ships for Star Fleet Battles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Frax: Based on &amp;quot;wet navy&amp;quot; warships with FX and RX firing arcs. Their subs use the gravitic Axion Torpedo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Britanians: Their cruiser mounts no less than eight disruptors - four on each side! Cross the T to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Sharkhunters: A cloaked ship's nightmare, they use flashbombs for lock-on and wire-guided plasmas for the kill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Qaris: Their ships mount rapid-fire kinetic cannons in rotating turrets. Their gigantic Scud missiles kill bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Flivvers: Float like a butterfly - and kick like a mule! Speed-640 Huperdrones cannot be stopped easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Barbarians: Their ships have option mounts able to hold weapons and other systems to simulate any enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Triaxians: Their ships move in three direcions (rather than two) and mount the versatile Type-A Plasma Torpedo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Deltans: Designed for ONE mission - base busting! They are the fastest ships able to hold overloaded photons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Canadi'ens: Their Maple Leaf Maulers will hit you coming and going, right and left, up and down, in and out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
