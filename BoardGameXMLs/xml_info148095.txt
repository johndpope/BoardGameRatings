							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Metro Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metro Station is a full-color, 48 x 40 inch, floor plan of a Subway Station, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want that station on complete lock down. We need as many troops as possible to put down this rebellion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metro Station is a large single map featuring an open view metro train and a metro train station. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Metro Station from outside the train.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metro Station is meant to be used in near or far future science games, but could be adapted as a cutting edge high tech metro station with bullet trains in a modern setting. &lt;br/&gt;The Metro Station by its very nature makes it an important logistical area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, it could be used as a way to transport troops quickly. One scenario is a rebellion, civil disturbance, or other riot breaks out in a city. The tyrant&amp;rsquo;s military uses the metro station as a way to transport troops in to quell the disturbance. The rebels start seeing military troops mixing in with normal police and track them to the metro station. The rebellion decides to take over or destroy the metro station in order to stop the military&amp;rsquo;s flow of troops into the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rebels either include the Player Characters or they hire the group of Player Characters as mercenaries to help them either take control of the train or blow up the station. This leads to a massive firefight in the metro station, with the latest batch of troops showing up by train to stop the characters. With the military controlling the train, they bust out windows to fire at the characters, take cover behind the open door, etc. The Player Characters and their rebel allies need to enter through the front gate of the station, taking cover behind the walls, chairs, tables, and other objects and then fight their way up to the raised platform and defeat the soldiers in the train.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once they get near the train, they can plant explosives to blow it up or they could take control of the train, using it to return to the military base by hacking into its last destination. From there they make an assault on the military base to bring the fight to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
