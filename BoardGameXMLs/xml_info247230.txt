			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long before the Empire, created by the Kalasans after they stormed R&amp;ucirc;l and wrested it from the clutches of the dread Witch-King, whose wicked legions had overwhelmed and plunged the continent into darkness, an ancient people known as the Edene ruled over the land. Like the Kalasans so many centuries after them, the Edene were also bold conquerors who arrived on the shores of the continent, fleeing the destruction of their homeland far across the Auroral Ocean, They arrived in R&amp;ucirc;l, handily defeating the First People and their faerie allies who had called the continent home for centuries, and founded a new civilization in the ruins of the one that came before. The Edene claimed their empire would last a thousand years, but like so many fledgling empires since the dawn of time who believed the same, the Edene themselves were drowned in the ebbing and flowing tides of history, yet another civilization of grand ambition lost and mostly forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruins and remnants of the ancient Edene still litter the lands of R&amp;ucirc;l. One can find their works across much of the Empire, from crumbling castles jutting up from the high hills of the Holy Kingdom, to broken statues and indecipherable cenotaphs scattered about the countryside surrounding Caecras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A revealing glimpse into this civilization can be obtained more easily that one might think simply by traveling east to the newly independent kingdom that calls itself Old Edene. This entry into the Lands of Shadow series explores this kingdom, built in no small part upon the values, traditions, and cultural artifacts of the Edene civilization that once existed before it was nearly wiped out by the Witch-King. Here you will find information about the history, peoples, and major figures of contemporary Old Edene to help you explore these lands in your own Shadow of the Demon Lord campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
