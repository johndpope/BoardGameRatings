			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place solely within the quaint, remote town of Elysburg. The adventure begins with the player characters (PCs) simply entering the town. They can be coming from a recent adventure or on their way to a new one. The gracious people of Elysburg greet the party with respect and admiration and see to their every need. The PCs are lavished with grooming, baths, clothing, and entertainment&amp;mdash; everything they could possibly need or want&amp;mdash;for a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fair town of Elysburg has learned that agricultural income is far inferior to the influx of money adventurers can bring in. So the town has devised a method of sapping every hard earned coin from their adventuring guests. The town, lead by the beautiful half-elf Cleric of Trickery, Ariadne Moonsleight, traps incoming adventurers in a tale of horrific plights and terrible monsters. No good adventurer can stand idly by and watch the poor defenseless town be ravaged by such foulness. But, unbeknownst to the townsfolk and our fair adventurers, the town&amp;rsquo;s invocations of a false god have the attention of the demigod Mardax, and his scorn could tear the town asunder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
