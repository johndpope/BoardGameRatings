							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pinguin Rallye</name>
									
			<description>A simple die-based racing game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big walrus is trying to scare away penguins from their ice floes. Can your penguin still manage to reach the iceberg?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a penguin player's piece. Players move their penguin according to the roll of the die from one ice floe to the next. If a walrus symbol is rolled, the walrus comes down from the iceberg, pushes the closest penguin off the floe and makes it fall back a few spaces (penguins that have fallen off an ice floe are moved back to the next of the darker floes). The player who has rolled the walrus can choose where to place it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose penguin reaches the iceberg first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
