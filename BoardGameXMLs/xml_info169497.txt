							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HardNova II Revised &amp; Expanded: Space Action Roleplaying</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurp:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take to the stars and smuggle exotic goods across the galaxy, solve mysteries aboard space liners, or explore the frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HardNova 2 is fast, ready-to-use, and adaptable. You don't have to learn a complicated system, refer to scores of tables, or spend all day creating characters. You can either create custom characters for the game or dive right in with any of the included templates. The game is designed to be light; it has a small footprint and extremely low price tag - it's not overloaded with tons of rules or an excess of information you just won't need. It's meant to get you running quickly so you can have a good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is very open. Two centuries after forming the United Sovereign Worlds with the ape-like Digronians, Humanity spearheads peace and freedom in known space. While aliens are commonplace, some are more trusted than others. The bioframe-ridden Migado, insectoid Kt'Sorii, and synthetic X-ans are mankind's newest allies. And while the genetically-flawed Tarkosians are now also allies, many citizens cannot forget or forgive their involvement in the war that prompted the initial need for such alliances. Travel to mysterious destinations, discover new alien species, uncover diabolical plots, and battle space pirates with HardNova 2. The included scenarios immerse you into the setting so even if you don't want to the run them, you've still got a lot of info to work with to flavor your setting or inspire ideas. And if you don't want to use the setting, the rules are flexible enough to handle your own ideas or that of your favorite movie, television program, comic, or novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expanded game compiles the HardNova 2 core book, both Enhancement Packs, Miniseries Alpha: The Vanguard, and Aliens: The Ruthdii in one book, plus includes even more content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
