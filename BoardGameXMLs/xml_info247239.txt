							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Inn of Dusk</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inn of Dusk is an inn that has been haphazardly extended over the years. It is the focal point of the local community and sits near an old and now rarely used trade route. The Inn has a secret and is far more dangerous to visit than might be though; quite what the hazard is can be chosen by the GM from a list suggested for different power levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is aimed at d100 systems but is generic enough in nature to be adapted to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure comes with a 24&amp;quot;x20&amp;quot; battlemap of the inn's exterior and interior taking up eight pages that can be printed out and assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter, around half a page is ads, one page has the GM's map of the inn, one page has instructions on assembling the battlemap and one page has a menu for the inn that can be printed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
