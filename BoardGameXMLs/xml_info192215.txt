			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have participated with the Republican forces in combat during the Battle of Guadalajara until March 18, 1937, at which time the Italian retreat has disengaged from the Republican main line of resistance. The characters are placed on detached status as an independent squad and ordered to forage throughout the area. They are notified that Italian or Nationalist rearguard units, as well as stragglers, should be expected. The characters are to avoid combat and gather as much ammunition and food supplies as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
