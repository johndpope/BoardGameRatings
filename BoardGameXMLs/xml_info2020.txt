			<description>from the translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An intense rocky dice-fest for 2 to 6 players Ages 7 and up. By Hajo B&amp;uuml;cken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pssst, everything seems nice and quiet but...did you hear something move? No, that's not possible. Or is it? There it is again. Do you see it, too? Look more closely: that rock has two eyes and arms, too. And what's it doing now? It actually put a stone into its mouth and chewed it up. Hmmm, it seems to like the taste of it. It must be one of those Rockeaters. What, you've never heard of the Rockeaters**? Well then, you'd better be careful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
