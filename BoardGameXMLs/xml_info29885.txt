							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Coping Skills Game</name>
									
			<description>Another Child'sPlay game designed for therapy/teaching coping skills. Children roll a die and move around a track. When landing on different spaces, children are posited situations to which they must respond or a coping skills card. When a player responds to a card in a suitably acceptable way, he or she receives a victory point chip. Theoretically, at the end of the game, the player with the most chips wins. However, the game is focused more around helping children to develop nine positive coping skills than a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
