			<description>Tom &amp;amp; Jerry's Trap Game is a very basic game published on the back of a Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal box.  The board is a spiral of 16 squares which leads towards a mouse trap at the centre.  Card tokens depicting Tom, Jerry, Spike (the bulldog) and the housekeeper must be played as the game progresses and the winner is the first to use up all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
