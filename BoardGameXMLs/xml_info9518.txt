			<description>Adverteasing is a trivia game based on product marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player takes a question card and asks the next team/player a question. A correct answer is awarded 3 points. If he/she cannot answer inside 15 seconds, anyone else has a chance to answer for 2 points. If there is still no answer, the multiple choice answers on the rear of the card are read and the original guesser has a chance to gain 1 point with a correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players who answer questions correctly move up the &amp;quot;career ladder&amp;quot;. The first player to make it to 25 points, or President, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
