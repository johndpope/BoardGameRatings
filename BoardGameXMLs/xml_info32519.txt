			<description>Each player chooses to be Babar the Elephant or Zephir the Monkey. Set the See-Saw to 0 for both players. The first player uses the spinner and moves the See-Saw up towards his Pop of Gold as many spaces as the spinner indicates. This will cause the other player's character to go down towards the alligator's mouth. Now the other player spins, and moves the See-Saw up, causing the first players character to go down. Play continues like this until one player reaches the Pot of Gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not the most skilful game in the world!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listed in American Games, #44493.  1960, Literary, Board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
