							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rivet Wars: Macleod&#039;s Guards vs. Baron Munchen Guards</name>
									
			<description>This accessory contains six alternate Allied infantry models and six alternate Blightun infantry models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macleod's Guard. The men of Northern Brighton are a proud lot. They work hard, play hard, and fight hard. Like the granite cliffs of the Lexing Beaches, these men are solid and won't be broken easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baron Munchen Guards are picked for their martial and tactical skills. Each soldier is at once loyal to the Blightun EMpire but most importantly to Baron Munchen himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
