							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucky Dip Quiz</name>
									
			<description>A standard party quiz game really but an added feature is how time is used up. All 84 question slips are laid face down on the table and shuffled around.  A time for the quiz to last is set by the host, say 20 minutes for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the word &amp;quot;Go!&amp;quot;, each team captain comes to the table at the same time and each selects a question slip. This is then taken back to his team, who may consider what the right answer may be. When ready, the team captain goes back to the table and hands their answer to the host. If it is right, the captain takes another slip and returns to his team. Note this is done in real time, there are no turns as such. If the answer is wrong, the captain must wait half a minute before being allowed to take a new question to his team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the time is up, the team with the most correct answers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variation is provided for individuals to play but it is pretty tame, just being a regular quiz game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
