			<description>A bank robbery has occurred in Diamond City. All the players are eye witnesses and their task is to find and identify the robber. You are running around the board checking concealed cards to get clues to the robber. Instead of clues you might find other valuable cards, like money, weapons, duel cards or the large diamond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to find out who the robber is and transport him to the police station, without any of the opponent kidnapping him to get the honor from you. If it shows up that yourself are the robber (1 chance out of 27), than you must steal back the diamond and escape to the airport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
