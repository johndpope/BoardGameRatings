							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roadwar Europa</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Not Your Average Tour of Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 21st century, Europe suffers the same bio-war that devastated America, a holocaust that established the deadly scenario for SSI's exciting ROADWAR 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now this sequel, ROADWAR EUROPA, creates a post-doomsday Europe held hostage by maniacal terrorists. They have already destroyed one city with a dirty nuclear device and threaten to detonate five more across the continent.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was a sequel to Roadwar 2000. Gameplay was similar; players managed a road gang traveling across a map of Europe, Russia and the Near East left wasteland by biological warfare. Suddenly jihad sweeps out of the Middle East threatening the delicate recovery. The player must locate and defuse five dirty nuclear bombs, contact the underground forces opposing the jihadists, and then locate and destroy the terrorist base. Road combat took place on a tactical map allowing the player to maneuver modified vehicles against each other, and gang members (&amp;quot;Crew&amp;quot;) acting as hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players had to loot familiar European cities to keep in supply while encountering Terrorist regulars and sympathizers, Soldiers (presumably surviving pockets of NATO troops), police forces, cannibals, hoodlums, the homeless, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Jeff Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
