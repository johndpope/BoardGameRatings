			<description>They Breathe is a journey into the depths of a forest filled with water. As you swim deeper, you will come to slowly understand a world where nothing is as it first seems, and where everyone is after the same precious resource &amp;ndash; oxygen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We don't want to get in the way of your exploration, so we leave most of this game up to you to figure out on your own, from the controls to the grand meaning of it all. So far our critics have all agreed on one thing: this is quite possibly the strangest thing you'll play this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
