			<description>MMORPGs, or Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games, all focus on the process of acquiring loot. Sure, some of them are set in outer space where you fight galactic wars over high-tech loot, and some are set in fantasy worlds where you slay massive beasts for magical loot, but all in all the objective is the same: People just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get enough loot. That&amp;rsquo;s where this game, Loot! Need or Greed, comes in. We are streamlining the process for you, bypassing all that needless adventuring and skipping straight to the item drops. Just like in online-play, there is a certain etiquette that needs to be followed when competing for loot with your peers, and that&amp;rsquo;s where the strategy comes in. And above all, always remember &amp;ndash; No one likes a Loot Ninja!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loot! Need or Greed is a dice &amp;amp; card game for 2-6 players. Each round, players will attempt to out-roll each other on valuable loot items that their character could use while attempting to figure out what classes the other players are equipping for. They may even be so bold as to roll on items they can&amp;rsquo;t use, but if they are caught &amp;ldquo;Needing&amp;rdquo; on items their class can&amp;rsquo;t use they could be kicked from the party &amp;ndash; and the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
