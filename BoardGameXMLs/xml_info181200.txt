			<description>The first player to get all 3 cars on a parking spot wins the game. Movement is determinied by 2 dice. Even cars already on a parking spot can be forced to leave the parking spot by the roll of the dice. Each car that gets on a parking spot, gets a parking-ticket. The car is safe, if the ticket has a &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; on it. Every other number means, that the car has to leave the parking spot, if the player rolls the number on the parking ticket, while trying to park other cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
