			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Character Levels 6-8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Xcrawl, the players are superstar athletes taking their chances in a live-on-pay-per-view death sport. It&amp;rsquo;s a modern-day world with a fantasy twist, and the game is simple. The Dungeon Judge, or DJ, creates an artificial dungeon under controlled - but lethal - conditions. The players go through the dungeon and try to fulfill whatever conditions the DJ puts forth in order to win. Xcrawl is a sport and the challenges are created, but the danger is no less real. If you die, you die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visit scenic Indianapolis for racing, basketball, and now Xcrawl! The citizens of Indianapolis are known for their love of mayhem, be it a fiery crash on the racetrack or a nice brawl on the basketball court. So it comes as no surprise that the world's most famous blood sport is quite popular in Old Indy, and charismatic DJ HoosierDaddy has emerged as a popular leader in Xcrawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DJ has teamed up with a devious leprechaun to create IndyCrawl, a challenging new crawl featuring evil fairies, twisted satyrs, and other horrors hailing from the myths and legends of Old Europe. Interspersed with the fey are other whimsical encounters, such as the now-infamous Gummi Golem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
