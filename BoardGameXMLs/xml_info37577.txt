			<description>Hexway The New Game from the AHOY Series of games produced by Robert Ross and Co. LTD is advertised as a game that is simple enough for children and subtle enough for grownups. The game appears to be a tile laying game where a road and houses are constructed from hexes. No other information is available at this time but the game is presently being researched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
