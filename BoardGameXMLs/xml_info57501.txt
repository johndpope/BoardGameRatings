			<description>Subtitled: Warships and Space Pirates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Arm Missiles! Fire Lasers!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The battle klaxons have sounded! GURPS Spaceships 3: Warships and Space Pirates provides ships and game mechanics for exciting space combat between medium and large vessels. It includes an overview of space navy and pirate operations; it also features GURPS Spaceships statistics for dozens of sample warships, from patrol ships and frigates to star cruisers and battleships. Tactical maneuvering rules expand the GURPS Spaceships combat system to handle hex-based combat and chases using counters or miniatures, and additional rules cover squadron-level command tasks. In space, there's nothing personal between two enemy ships . . . just hard vacuum and hard choices.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is the third volume in the GURPS Spaceships series by David Pulver (co-author of GURPS Fourth Edition). It requires only the GURPS Basic Set and GURPS Spaceships. GURPS Space is recommended for characters and campaigns; GURPS Spaceships 2: Traders, Liners, and Transports provides civilian ships and cargo to loot or protect.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
