							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kick Punch Burp Fart Slap</name>
									
			<description>Black Slither Games is at it again, and this time we've gone micro. Kick, Punch, Burp, Fart, Slap is a 2-5 player micro card game based on the classic hand gesture game Rock, Paper, Scissors. KPBFS takes those hand gestures and puts them on cards, with that silly Black Slither twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's incredibly fasted paced and anybody can play. Kick, Punch, Burp, Fart, Slap can be played for points, or as a drinking game. Without giving all the details away, here is how it's played. Deal out cards, turn over cards, drink if you lose, don't drink if you win, wash, rinse, repeat. Oh, and keep track of points if you care. Simple and to the point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
