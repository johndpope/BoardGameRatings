			<description>Players set up a funfair. Each carousel, booth etc consists of several parts which the players place on the board when they reach certain fields. When an attraction is complete, each passing player has to pay to use it; with discounts for those players who participated in setting it up. Players can increase their money on lottery fields (courtesy of positive dice rolls). There are also event cards, when the last of these has been used the game ends and the player with most money is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
