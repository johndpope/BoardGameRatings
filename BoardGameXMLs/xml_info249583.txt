In Haunt, the players hide information from the Game Master. Players will play as paranormal detectives, exorcists, or psychics with a goal of stopping a haunting, possession, or any other supernatural event. These &amp;ldquo;haunts&amp;rdquo; will attempt to learn your characters darkest secrets to gain an advantage over the character and break their resolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunt uses simple rules paired with detailed locations to give a greater sense of immersion in the environment. Using simple rules allow you to jump right into the game without having to read pages upon pages of rules. Six archetypes are available for characters to play as. Each one has unique statistics and a special boon. But, true character creation begins at the secrets. This game absolutely relies on trust between the players and the Game Master, cheating or lying ruins the fun for everybody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Pits the players against the Game Master&lt;br/&gt;    Simple rules allow for fast pickup and play.&lt;br/&gt;    Unique mechanics for player secrets.&lt;br/&gt;    Haunt generator creates an endless amount of terrifying encounters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
