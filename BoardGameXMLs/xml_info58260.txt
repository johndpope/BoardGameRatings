			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the eve of the American Revolution; colonial life is on the verge of drastic change. To some degree, many parts of the world shun folklore and Witchcraft in favor of so called rational thinking. Magic, in many people&amp;rsquo;s minds, is supposedly as dangerous as a child&amp;rsquo;s imagination. However, tucked between soldiers, trackers, and pioneers, there are those who believe they know the Truth. Magic, along with monsters, demons and other creatures, is real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Colonial Gothic you play a Hero who knows that Magic is real and the horrors that it can create in the form of monsters. These monsters could be anywhere. They could be witches cursing a settlement, vampires that followed European immigrants to the New World, or angry spirits terrorizing a Cherokee tribe. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re fighting in the frontier or you&amp;rsquo;re fending off a supernatural disease like Curse from the Grave you, along with others like you, will wage a hidden war because there is no one else brave enough to face the Devil&amp;rsquo;s minions, fight them and win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes, be warned: something waits for you in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it is hungry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Richard Iorio, Monica Valentinelli, Matt McElroy, James Maliszewski and Mathew Kaiser, this 130 page True20 conversion of the popular RPG published by Rogue Games takes you deep into the heart of Colonial America and provides you with everything you need to run a supernatural campaign series during the American Revolution. Painstakingly researched, Colonial Gothic also makes it possible  for you to fight the war for independence and take part in the events which shaped the birth of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An in-depth look into life in Colonial America.&lt;br/&gt;     Information about each of the colonies&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed information on the native tribes of the region&lt;br/&gt;     New Backgrounds&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for Rituals and Sanity&lt;br/&gt;     New Creatures and suggestions for using existing horrors such as ghouls, spirits and werewolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Revolution has begun, will you join the fight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
