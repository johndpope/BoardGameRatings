							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Altus Adventum 2nd Edition Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd edition of the Altus Adventum role-playing game harkens back to those glory days of gaming where one rule reigned: Make The Game Fun. Everything within this rulebook are guidelines for your group to use when taking your characters on the journey from lowly aspirants to grand legends. This book is but the foundation for you to mold into your own. Ignore rules you don't like. Keep those you do. The goal is to have fun, and no written rule within this tome should ever prevent that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Altus Adventum offers is a skill-based system that allows you to focus on how you want your character to progress without being tied to any particular occupation if you do not want. It offers a combat system that moves very quickly, allowing you to focus on the narrative game without stopping play to analyze modifiers. It offers a vast library of weapons, armor, magic styles, and creatures to make every adventure challenging yet fun. It is a tool to bring good friends together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
