			<description>Trans-Kombi is the abbreviation of Transportkombination, or combination of transports. Players play in two teams, with each team playing of their own identical board that shows the major town and transport connections of the former German Democratic Republic. A game master is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 3 rounds. Each round 6 town cards are drawn. The first card of the first round is the common start point, the other 5 are the stations each teams must connect in the order of their choice. Each team's last station is its next starting point, and the original start is the common end point of the last round.&lt;br/&gt;Each team starts with a credit which is needed to buy the transport- black for rails, red for streets, blue for waterways and green for air transport. Prices are rolled for before each round. Also, each round has an accident field that is secretly determined beforehand and often requires re-building a section of the route. Rails, roads and waterways must follow the lines printed on the board, while air transport always takes the shortest possible route.&lt;br/&gt;Teams compete to complete the route first (to get a bonus) and as effectively (=cheaply) as possible. The team with most cash at the end of round 3 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
