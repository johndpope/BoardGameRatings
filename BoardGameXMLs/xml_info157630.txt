			<description>from Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is designed to be run in just three hours. No prior knowledge of Cthulhutech is needed to play this scenario, though knowledge of the survival horror genre and both the manga and movie &amp;ldquo;Akira&amp;rdquo; is helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario includes everything needed to play it, except some dice (ten sided dice). It uses material found in the CthulhuTech Corebook and Vade Mecum: The CthulhuTech Companion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is inspired by the survival horror genre. In the modern age, we live in a safe and secure world created from compliance with established social norms. Survival horror asks the question: what happens when those social norms collapse? &amp;hellip; Survival horror uses the imminent threat to put everything we value in jeopardy. This includes the society in which the survivors live, their sanity, their morality, their relationships and everything they value or love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survival horror aspects of this scenario are further emphasised by having a cast of teenagers. Teenagers are more volatile than adults and have less established patterns of behaviour. Yet, for them, relationships are the most important aspect of their lives. &amp;hellip; In this scenario, these elements create additional drama and tension as they seem more willing to victimise, isolate and die for each other. These factors culminate in Act Three where the PCs, in the face of utter annihilation, are forced to decide who and what is important enough to them to risk their own survival for, and who and what they must let go even if they desperately don&amp;rsquo;t [want] to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
