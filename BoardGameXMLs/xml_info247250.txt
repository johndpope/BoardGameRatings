			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Push the gate open, if you dare, and step onto the mist-filled grounds of Grim Acres. The overseer, Morticai Grimsly, has been waiting for you. He solicits your help in architecting his garden of gloom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quickly outbuild your opponent(s) in this casually creepy cemetery card game. Ghosts included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Play Order:&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;Grave or Statue&lt;br/&gt;Memorial&lt;br/&gt;Remains&lt;br/&gt;Haunt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New plots may be played next to existing cards. All other cards are stacked on top of the preceding card. Statues and haunts are end cards (nothing can be played on top of them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round, build your section by playing as many cards in order as you like. Extend your section from the central house, laying plots in line or grid format. On subsequent rounds, play one card at a time. If you can&amp;rsquo;t play, draw a card and play it if you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Normal Cards: Only playable within your section or on another player&amp;rsquo;s green or purple card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green Open Cards: Any player may play onto any green Open Card, even outside his or her own section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purple Cursed Cards: Cursed Cards must be immediately covered by the next card in order (white, green, or purple). If you don&amp;rsquo;t have the next card, draw from the deck and play if you can. If not, play passes to the left until someone can play/draw the required card. Multiple Cursed Cards may be played in a row. Resume play to the left of the original Cursed Card player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, be the first to play all of the cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
