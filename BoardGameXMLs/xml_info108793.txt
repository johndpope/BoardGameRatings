			<description>Abstract patriotic game, made at the start of WWII and trying to appeal mainly to young boys. Each player places his planes (pieces) in one corner, if a 4 player game, or in two corners if a 2 player game. Movement is one square at a time, with the objective to be the first to get all your planes first to the opposite side of the board. The gun placements in the middle of the board are out of bounds for the planes. If an enemy plane is next to one of your planes, you may fly over it, but, note, no planes are ever captured.&lt;br/&gt;The game has been inspired by Chinese Chequers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
