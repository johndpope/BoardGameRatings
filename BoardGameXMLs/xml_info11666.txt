							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hoppity Hooper Game</name>
									
			<description>In this game, Hoppity Hooper, the cute T.V. Frog, and Professor Waldo Wigglesworth, the clever rascal, try to catch each other as they hop around the board.  One Player has seven playing Disks with the &amp;ldquo;Professor&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; picture, and his Opponent has seven Disks with &amp;ldquo;Hoppity&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; picture.  On the under side of each Disk is a Number&amp;mdash;either a 1, 2, or 3&amp;mdash;which is hidden during the game.  The Number tells the Player how many spaces the Disk must be moved.  If a Player can land one of his Disks, by exact count, on top of an Opponent&amp;rsquo;s Disk, the Opponent&amp;rsquo;s Disk is captured and removed from the game.  The Spinner tells the Player which Numbered Disk he can move . . . but . . . since the Numbers are hidden, the Player must remember where on of his Disks of that Number is located.  The object of the game is to be the first to capture all but one of your Opponent&amp;rsquo;s Disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
