			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming up with a new adventure can be a challenging process and sometimes a Referee needs a helping hand.  Perhaps your campaign isn't quite ready.  Maybe the last campaign finished a session or two early.  Maybe your players have strayed from the expected path.  Or maybe you're looking for a short session idea to introduce Traveller to a new group of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're here to help you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 Plots Go Forth is the fourth in our highly successful Plots series.  The book presents 21 situations, each with 6 possible outcomes,  for Traveller groups equipped with a starship and ready to travel.  The book uses the popular 76 Patrons style familiar to Traveller players and, while geared specifically at our Clement Sector setting, can be used with any edition or setting of Traveller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 Plots Go Forth also contains an index that can point you to the right adventure for your players not only within this volume but also for our entire line of 21 Plots products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all our products, the main intention of this book is to provide an extra spark to the Referee's imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
