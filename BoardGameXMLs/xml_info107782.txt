			<description>Square Up is a pattern matching game using a 2x3 portion of a 3x3 gameboard. Four players are shown on box top, but it may be possible that as few as two could play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are dealt cards intended to match patterns on the board. The colors in the 3x3 matrix could be changed one at a time by rotation of an associated knob on the board. Assumable a player would rotate one of the knobs to his color on his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
