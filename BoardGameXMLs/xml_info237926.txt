			<description>Brawlers is a two player game played in a mint tin. It's quick, silly, easy to learn and surprisingly challenging. Single-player rules are also included to help you learn the skills needed to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rowdy and mischievous game that children of all ages will be able to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;Quarrel with your friends with a gang of nine tough goons each. Sneak past the angry police man and be the last man standing.&lt;br/&gt;Learn to use your wits and cunning, whilst gaining a steady hand at he same time. But Brawlers is not just educational, it is also quite enjoyable indeed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notorious British street gangs of the posh Pips and the blusterous Rousters have been at it for years. Vying for dominance in the smuggling trade, their rivalry has presently come to a pinnacle.&lt;br/&gt;Nine each of their finest pugilists gather upon an east London wharf to settle their grievances at last.&lt;br/&gt;A lone bobby stands betwixt the rival bands, attempting to bar their path. The striving gangs will quarrel until one of them is thoroughly &amp;amp; truly defeated with none left standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
