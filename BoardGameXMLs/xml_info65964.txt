			<description>French game subtitled 'caution is the mother of safety'. The board represents France with connections between all the major cities. Each player takes a pawn of his prefered color and places it on Paris. Each one then draws a destination card that he keeps secret. On each turn the player moves his pawn with the die and upon arriving in another city he has to answer a question that earns him a colored token; if he answers this correctly he may advance again, otherwise he passes. When a player has tokens of four different colors he has to race to his destination city. The player who reaches his destination first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
