			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Artifact is a role-playing game for two players that will catapult you into timeless adventures in search of the old relics and artifacts of antiquity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be the archaeologist that, after the discovery of evidence to the existence of an ancient artifact, start an adventur to his research, not for money, fortune or glory, but in order to expose it to a museum where it can be admired by the whole human populations, or to bring him to safety in a warehouse and protect it from the wrong hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With you we will be your trusted and inseparable assistant who will follow you ends of the earth, but along the way you will find traps and enemies to face and old friendships to rediscover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for two players, with a system of shared development of the adventure, that allows both players to outline the history and adventure and the game system, simple and intuitive, will handle situations of danger and suspense quickly, keeping the game more on a narrative style without having to do so many dice rolls and calculations to determine the success or failure of the actions of the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
