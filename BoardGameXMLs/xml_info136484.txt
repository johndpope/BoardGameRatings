							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cogito</name>
									
			<description>Fun, crazy, educational game where players get to command the most epic philosophers through out history in combat of the mind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cogito is a fast-paced debate game designed to combine elements of popular games such as Uno, Magic the Gathering, and classic party games. In the game, each player assembles a team of charismatic philosophers from across time and space for the ultimate philosophical showdown. In order to win, a player needs skill, foresight, cunning, and a little bit of luck. Each player puts together his team and battles for honor, glory, and control of the truth! Each Cogito card is designed to have different crazy, fun, and occasionally mean abilities while representing and reflecting actual people and subjects within philosophy. The game balances a charming trio of gags, competitiveness, and intellectual ability. Players will experience game-play that quickly switches between moments of serious deliberation about the meaning of life to sudden requests to employ funny accents, all in one game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
