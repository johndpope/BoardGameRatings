			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hailing from the largest shopping mall in the multiverse are the numistians; a merchant race that specializes in making money. Originating from the mysterious demiplane of commerce, these humanoids can vary their height, eat and bleed coins, and have a great eye for lucrative endeavors. As the economy of the planes takes a dive due to a plague of cataclysms, this industrious race must now venture into your world to make a living. To a numistian, money is life! So gather your delectable copper pieces together and discover something new. Included is all you need to know about this fascinating new 4th edition PC race, including racial statistics, feats, and full details of the demiplane of commerce. Beautifully illustrated by Eugene Jaworski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
