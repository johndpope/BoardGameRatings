							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghostel: Trick or Treaters</name>
									
			<description>Halloween is a time for candy, pumpkins and of course, costumes! Enter the Trick or Treaters; children who have entered the hotel in the hope of finding sweets and maybe a scare or two!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of being discarded, these guests will stick around (children are notoriously fascinated with what scares them!) The ghosts will not only score points from these guests, but will also grab candy tokens depending on how well you scare them. These tokens can be used to pay the kids to help you with your ghostly activities, such as giving you extra pips or change the way you can move. But beware! The ToT guests are also fickle, and can be stolen away by your opponents if they have enough candy tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;- 8 Trick or Treater Guest Cards &lt;br/&gt;- 1 Rules Card &lt;br/&gt;- Custom Acrylic Candy Tokens Unique to Ghostel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
