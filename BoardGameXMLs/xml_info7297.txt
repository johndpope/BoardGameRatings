			<description>&amp;quot;Players take the roles of their favorite LA LAW lawyers and argue controversial and humorous real-life legal cases. Using the pro and con points provided, the 'attorneys' put their cases to the 'jury' (the other players), using all the logic, passion and powers of persuasion they can summon. After a vote is taken and the verdict is brought in, the real-life verdict is revealed - the results are often surprising, sometimes shocking - and points are awarded to the 'attorneys', both for being right and for successfully persuading their friends, right or wrong!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Includes 150 cases, 10 case files, file holder, 10 yes/no verdict cards, 10 character discs, verdict viewer, blind justice cup, score pad, instructions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
