			<description>An unusual game where players take turns trying to place magnetic bees onto magnetic spots on the face of Sally the sunflower. If the polarity is correct the bee sticks, if not Sally turns her head away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manufacturer:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Will Sally turn her face away or let your bumblebees land? Sally the Sunflower shows children the wonder of magnets all through the fun of play! Watch their enjoyment as they try to make a positive connection by landing their bumblebees onto Sally's face! The first to get all their bumblebees onto Sally's face wins!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
