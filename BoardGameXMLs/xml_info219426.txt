							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyrinth: Magic of the Ancients</name>
									
			<description>This expansion adds spells to base game. All heros can use eight spells after they get enough Power points from special tile of labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ages people believed that the Magic of the Ancients had left with Them.&lt;br/&gt;The most powerful spells were thought to be forgotten forever&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt; Things turned out differently, though. The remains of this unthinkable power are still here.&lt;br/&gt;And they still fill the Labyrinth built so many centuries ago!&lt;br/&gt; Heroes who shall discover magical springs and seize their power&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;shall also gain dominance over time itself and learn to use it as no one has done before!&lt;br/&gt; However, that&amp;rsquo;s not all! Thanks to the power lying dormant inside the Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;the Chosen shall be able to bring fallen heroes to a life of servitude.&lt;br/&gt; There is also &amp;ldquo;Change of Destiny&amp;rdquo;, the most potent spell of all, waiting to be released.&lt;br/&gt;It can ruin plans of many heroes fighting for immortality!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
