			<description>Death Ride of the Panzers - The German Attack on the Southern Shoulder of the Kursk Salient&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Ride of the Panzers is a board game simulating the operations conducted by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf as part of Operation Citadel these formations were to form the southern pincer of the German assault. Operation Citadel was an attempt by the Germans to eliminate the Kursk Salient on the Eastern Front thus shortening the front line that needed to be held. As well as the hope of being able to destroy a large amount of Red Army forces thus dissipating their ability to conduct offensive operations in the coming winter. The battle simulated took place from the 5th July to the 13th July 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a map, 124 counters (1 turn counter, 48 German ground and air unit counters and the soviets have a total of 75 ground and air unit counters), 2 dice and a rule document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
