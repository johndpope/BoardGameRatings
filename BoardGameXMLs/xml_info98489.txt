			<description>In Who&amp;rsquo;s Missing: A Calico Critters Card Game, two to four players try to memorize an ever-increasing number of cards and remember the missing cards after some are removed by the dealer. The 48 cards feature pictures of the Calico Critters families and can be used to play two additional games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out 5 cards in a row. Players hide their eyes while the dealer takes away a card. Who can remember which critters are missing? As the game is played the row of cards grows, so the longer you play the more challenging! Cards are also fun collector cards for Calico Critter fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
