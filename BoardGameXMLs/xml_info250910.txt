							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterhouse of the Ogre Mage</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for 4-6 PCs between levels 5-6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the party willing to hunt down and slay a tribe of Ogre Magi?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly after entering into this new town, gossip of a series of poisonings and disappearances &lt;br/&gt;coincide with the raising of a brand new slaughterhouse just outside of town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, a very well-loved and honorable butcher has recently disappeared without a trace. Many others soon follow. Gossip has arisen that the new meats being sold throughout the town are not from cattle, but from missing human beings! Village officials have approached the party due to their notable reputations and combat prowess. They are tasked with a mission in order to find the source of these poisonings and the whereabouts of the missing people of this once peaceful town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure requires intestinal fortitude unlike that of what they have faced at this point&amp;hellip; Does the party have enough of what it takes to dig deep and find the source of these disturbing problems? Or will the adventurers be served as meat to the villagers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO IS IT FOR? - GM&amp;rsquo;s running the Pathfinder system looking for a great darker-themed adventure to throw at unsuspecting PCs. It has easy moments and very challenging moments. There are 9 FULL-PAGE PLAYER HANDOUTS specifically designed and created just for this adventure. 7 MAPS and/or map closeups for the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
