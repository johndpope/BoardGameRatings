			<description>Grand Prix Legends (nicknamed GPL) is a computer racing simulator developed by Papyrus Design Group and published in 1998 by Sierra Entertainment. It simulates the 1967 Formula One season and is considered by many to be one of the most realistic racing games ever released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, developed under the direction of David Kaemmer and Randy Cassidy, was published in 1998 by the Papyrus division of Sierra Entertainment. To this day it maintains a reputation as a very realistic race car simulator. Its strong points are fairly accurate car physics (how the car responds and feels on the track), reasonably attractive graphics, impressive engine sound effects, good online racing and solid Internet support from its user community. The weak points are the game's difficulty as the cars are quite difficult to drive well (although many fans consider this to be a virtue, as Formula One cars of that era were difficult to drive compared to modern high-downforce cars), and some minor physics flaws, such as primitive aerodynamic modelling (for drag etc.), and a simplified tire model that completely omits tire wear, although, in 1967, racing tires on F1 cars would not wear out during a race and might regularly be used for more than one event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Grand Prix Legends , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
