			<description>Dino Stalker, known as Gun Survivor 3: Dino Crisis (Japanese: ガンサバイバー3 ディノクライシス Hepburn: Gan Sabaibā Surī Dino Kuraishisu?) in Japan, is an offshoot of the Resident Evil light gun shooter games, but based on the story of the Dino Crisis series. Though it can be played by other means, a light gun is recommended, as the game is one in a number of Capcom games that try to bridge the gap between light gun games and traditional games that allow the player greater range of control over their movements in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dino Stalker is the third installment in Capcom's Gun Survivor series. Although the Gun Survivor games are an offshoot of the Resident Evil series, Dino Stalker is the only game in the series without any ties to Resident Evil. It was followed by Resident Evil: Dead Aim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game focuses on the central character Lieutenant Mike Wired, who is caught in an intense dogfight during World War II. With nowhere to go, Mike appears to be doomed until he is suddenly teleported into the sky in the 3,000,000's, and must defend himself against an army of flying prehistoric predators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When he makes it to the mainland, he sees more dinosaurs and must battle them single handedly with whatever weapons he can acquire. He hears a voice on his new wrist communicator, telling him to find a girl called Paula. When he does find Paula, she simply replies with &amp;quot;Trinity&amp;quot; before more dinosaurs appear. Trinity is actually a dinosaur, (a Troodon, to be precise), with significant intelligence and it can send other dinosaurs to attack the player, as it does during a boss fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dino Stalker&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
