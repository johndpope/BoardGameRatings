							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DreadBall: Ukomo Avalanchers</name>
									
			<description>The Ukomo Avalanchers are an alien race of sentient dinosaurs (the Teratons) introduced in Season 3 expansion for DreadBall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armored hides make Teratons tough customers to begin with.  Couple that with their in-borne defensive ability to teleport when attacked from behind or to move through obstacles as necessary and you can see why they're a popular team.  Playing them takes finesse, though, as they field no strikers and are comparably slow against many other teams---even if they can teleport a limited distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic team includes 8 models:&lt;br/&gt;4 Teraton Jacks &lt;br/&gt;4 Teraton Guards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the DreadBall Sports Network:  &amp;quot;The Avalanchers haven&amp;rsquo;t been around for long, but their hard-hitting play style has already won them plenty of fans. The fact that they&amp;rsquo;re giant teleporting reptiles doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt, either!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
