			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a New Kind of Mythic Power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, your character&amp;rsquo;s mythic path tells you about the kinds of abilities in which he specializes, and perhaps even gives some clue as to his ultimate mythic destiny, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about where he came from, and what made him mythic in the first place. For that, you can turn to a mythic heritage. This new aspect of mythic characters allows for further customization of your mythic character. A mythic character can choose a mythic heritage in addition to his or her mythic path, and doing so grants him access to a number of unique abilities that are designed to reflect the flavor of his heritage, while also being of value to characters of every mythic path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment explores the earth heritage, and characters that are in some way intrinsically connected to the element of earth. They might be related through blood to a terran creature, such as an elemental, or might be the child of a powerful lithomancer. They might have otherwise gained their mythic power from fire, having it bestowed upon them by a xorn prince, or by handling a crystal infused with mythic power. However they came about, those touched by mythic earth have dominion over rock and metal, and are able to control the very ground beneath them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
