							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Horseclans of Edda / The Sultanate of Quirtoy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edda is a great rolling plain, home to the Horse Clans (the Clanurile Cai) of Edda also called the Cai de Oameni or &amp;ldquo;Horse People,&amp;rdquo; with clan names such as Clanul Erelide, Clanul Karaci or Clanul Quinquilleros. It is bisected by the Great Beldany River. The Eddans are an interesting people, considering horse as intelligent members of their families rather than property. They have a language very similar to the whickering and neighing of horses, even the braying of donkeys. It is said they can converse with their equine companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quirtoy is a nation of dark mystery. Not much is known of its doings outside its borders and what is known causes fear and trepidation in most people. The facts and figures given below are for the use of the gamemaster. An outworlder ruhlarına danışan kimse olmasın (necromancer) rules this dark and mysterious land. It is known that numerous undead are about the land along with rumors of were creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
