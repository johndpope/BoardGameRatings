			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devious Dangers Around Every Corner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traps have long had room for improvement. What should be an exciting encounter that leaves players on the edge of their seats holding their breath and wondering if they&amp;rsquo;ll make it out alive instead winds up reduced to a few cursory rolls, and players either shrugging off the damage or feeling that they are being punished for not being paranoid about checking each and every hallway. There are ways to avoid this, of course, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to have some traps that are built specifically in order to be exciting and engaging encounters in and of themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the mythic trap: these dastardly devices make use of mythic rules and mythic power to come alive in your game, in more ways than one. A mythic trap acts like a monster or NPC, taking turns in initiative order, and using (under the GM&amp;rsquo;s guidance) one or more of its devilish and hazardous components. They provide traps that are fun and engaging on several levels, and cannot be ignored in the same way that a simple pit trap or poison dart trap can be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces rules for mythic traps, which can be run easily in both mythic and non-mythic campaigns, and also provides four specific mythic traps to serve as examples. Brave the efreeti&amp;rsquo;s tomb trap, dodging fireball-spitting statues while navigating over a rune-covered floor to reach safety. Or try your luck at the hall of horrors trap, and try to choose between staying in the middle of the room&amp;mdash;where the floor is rapidly disappearing, leaving quicksand in its wake&amp;mdash;and the walls, from which spring dozens of deadly spears. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;d prefer the hall of serpents trap, which combines poisonous vapors and poisonous fumes to create a deadly combination, as the walls slowly close in around you? Perhaps the deadliest of all is the mummy&amp;rsquo;s curse trap, where, among other dangers, you face a room quickly filling with suffocating sand, swarms of angry scarabs, and possibly a mythic mummy, as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
