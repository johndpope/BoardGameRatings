			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 2000s, each player is one of the VIPs of Small City. Each one hides behind a pseudonym of a Roman emperor, based on the special ability that player chose at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to racketeer the Commerces, to rob the Residences, and to hire new thugs in the Industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you move your Roman empire figure, and can either destroy or burgle a building. Thus you gain more and more influence in the districts&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who builds up the most influence in Small City will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is represented on a hex hex grid, and its size depends on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play this new politically incorrect game in the Small City universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A book should be included in the box. It is a hard-boiled novel that deals with the story of the same 6 emperors, which takes place after the story of the board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new concept to expand the board game&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
