			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;You have completed your Apprenticeship and you are now a Journeyman Magi. What does that mean? Well, first off, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to school anymore. You are a full-fledged Magi. Journeyman Magi are expected to work with various Master Magi in order to learn new and different techniques. In this way, you can become a Master yourself. You are expected to train diligently under different Masters and in different cities so that your technique does not stagnate, or worse your art becomes inbred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RPG is about the mysteries you and your fellow Magi will encounter on your journey to become a Master. For you live in a magical world and your duty, as a Magi, is to protect those weaker than yourself. Mostly you are protecting the people from warlocks. Warlocks are Magi who have turned their eyes away from the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
