							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATV Offroad Fury 4</name>
									
			<description>ATV Offroad Fury 4 is the fourth installment of the ATV Offroad Fury series, and the sequel to ATV Offroad Fury 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATV Offroad Fury 4 sees the introduction of new vehicles such as MX motocycles, Trophy Trucks and Dune Buggies, alongside existing ATV quad racers; this allows the game to include up to 50 Championship Modes. In addition to improved graphics, it also has an additional 60 tracks and improved online gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of in-game controls, more tricks are possible while the player is on an MX motorcycle, but none can be performed while the player is controlling a Trophy Truck and Dune Buggy. Similar to the risk of being thrown off an ATV or motorcycle in the game, Trophy Trucks and Dune Buggies are vulnerable to rollovers, from which the player's vehicle will be automatically reset back on all four wheels, as are the ATV and motorcycle. The game also offers tutorials on how to drive Trophy Trucks and Dune Buggies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATV Offroad Fury 4 includes more mini-games, such as &amp;quot;Ice Hockey&amp;quot; (introduced in ATV Offroad Fury 2), &amp;quot;Scavenger Hunt&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;King Of The Hill&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bowling&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Ring of Fire&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online capabilities for this game have ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ATV Offroad Fury 4&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
