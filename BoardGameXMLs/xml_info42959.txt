			<description>Five dice are rolled. The players then put them on a row of squares separated by +...x...:...-. With this, they try to reach a certain number, so they can place a chip on the corresponding square on a large game board. There are several variants explained in the rule book, for one player, for teams etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
