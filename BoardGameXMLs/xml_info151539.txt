							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enemy Gods: Mythic Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy Gods: Mythic Edition is an updated and streamlined version of John's classic game of Gods and Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Enemy Gods, you take the role of both a mythic Hero and a powerful God. Your God guides your Hero and his compatriots through epic adventures in dangerous lands, winning the favor of mortals who beg for your intervention. As the Heroes' popularity grows, the power of the Gods does as well. The more powerful the Gods become, the more they can aid the Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But just as Gods are wise and generous, so are they vain and jealous... and wrathful? and there's only so much devotion to go around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemy Gods is a complete roleplaying game - you don't need any other products to play. All you need is a bunch of friends, pencils, dice, drinks and snacks, and you're ready to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
