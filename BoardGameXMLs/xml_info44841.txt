							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Clash</name>
									
			<description>In castle Clash each player uses one suit of a deck of cards (eg hearts) to build and populate their castle in an attempt to protect their king. The Queen and Knave can both be given special abilities to help protect their King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then choose combinations of dice to attack the other player's castle in the hopes of taking out their king.  You must be careful, however, because an attack that fails could cause you to lose your ammunition ... or worse yet - give it to your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Careful planning and a bit of luck are important if you are going to have the last King standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
