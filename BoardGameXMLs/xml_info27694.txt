			<description>This card game contains:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    72 cards (36 with a blue back and 36 with a red back)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    A rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card displays three numbers from 1 to 6 (vertically arranged), in six possible colors.&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt six cards each, and at their turn they can draw a new card and discard an unwanted one (discarded cards may be picked by other players). &lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to make winning hands, using the first, second or third line of the numbers: you can win with six numbers of the same color, or six same numbers, or a flush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two variants of the game. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    The &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; one (named &amp;ldquo;Bussy&amp;rdquo;) has an action/dexterity factor: the player who wants a discarded card must be the fastest to grab it.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    The strategic one (named &amp;ldquo;Bussy Money&amp;rdquo;) uses poker chips and bets. And the player who wants a discarded card must bid some chips on it and win the auction. It is also possible to &amp;ldquo;bluff&amp;rdquo; a winning hand, hoping that nobody will want to see it&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
