			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the creation of mankind, God created the angels. The angels served God faithfully as he created Adam and Eve, and the Garden of Eden. One angel watched as God forbade Adam and Eve to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: &amp;quot;Why do you give your children tests?&amp;quot; the angel asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO PROVE THEIR LOVE, was God&amp;rsquo;s response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and God cast them from the Garden to live in pain and darkness for the rest of their lives. The angel came to God again: &amp;quot;Why create your children with curiosity and then cast them down for being curious?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOURS IS NOT TO QUESTION, BUT TO SERVE, was God&amp;rsquo;s response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;But your children were made to question, and you punished them for it,&amp;quot; said the angel, whose name was Lucifer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And God turned his face from Lucifer, and Lucifer wept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
