							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sound Off Race Game</name>
									
			<description>A roll-and-move auto racing game with an included 33-1/3 rpm LP which randomizes certain events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the description on the LP back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Simply place Record on turntable at start of game and keep record spinning all the time -- but keep the volume turned all the way down so that nothing is heard -- until a player stops on a 'SOUND OFF' space.  Then turn the sound up right away to hear the 'Record Racer's' special instructions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
