			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A fascinating quiz game&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An &amp;quot;I.Q.&amp;quot; game for family parties&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents are 12 Quiz cards of four types, each appearing three times.  Each card has five puzzles (number sequence, missing-letters, pattern-recognition, anagram and general knowledge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably this game is from the 1950s, though there is no date on the box or answer sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is marked 'Series 3' and it seems there were several editions containing different puzzles. Certainly the replay value seems small for this on its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
