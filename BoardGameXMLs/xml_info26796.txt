			<description>This Whitman game is subtitled &amp;quot;The Scarey {sic} Crossroads Game.&amp;quot; This game was truly ahead of its time: it is a hexagonal tile laying game, with no board, for children. Each player selects 10 &amp;quot;spooky&amp;quot; tiles of either witches, monsters, ghosts, or buzzards, plus one crossroad and one tombstone. The first player then picks one of the 40 road tiles and places it in the center of the table. Each player then adds a road piece, making sure the road continues without a dead end or circling into itself. Every time you form a three-sided space, you fill it with one of your spooky tiles, making sure it does not block the road. After you have added 5 of your spooky tiles, add the tombstone, and then the rest of your pieces. The winner is the first to use all their pieces and add the Haunted House tile to the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
