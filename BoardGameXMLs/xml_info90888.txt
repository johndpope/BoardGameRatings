			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Foundationists is a Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World faction sourcebook that focuses on the organization known as the Foundation, one of the strongest and most dedicated pseudo-societies on the Twisted Earth.&lt;br/&gt; Known equally for their awesome artifacts of Ancient power as they are for their detached ruthlessness, the Foundation is a mysterious society of quasi-religious &amp;quot;warrior-monks&amp;quot; hailing from high-walled citadels and monastery-forts in the Sierra Gehena region. Despite limited numbers, they possess some of the greatest weapons, armor, and resources available so long after the Fall. The Foundation hold a belief that they are to one day re-found the civilization of the Ancients, and to this end they hoard all knowledge and technology they can get - whether through trade or by force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what will you find in this tome of Post Apocalyptic goodness (beside a powered armor ass kicking)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The History of the Foundation&lt;br/&gt;A detailed timeline of the Foundation before and after the fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foundation Characters&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive guide for creating Foundation characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foundation Technology&lt;br/&gt;A look at the various areas of technology discovered by the Foundation including new artifacts, eugenics, cybernetic, and robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortresses and Outposts&lt;br/&gt;Details on the various fortresses and outposts controlled by the Foundation, including color maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions&lt;br/&gt;An overview of the three main factions of the Foundation complete with statistics for common and notable NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great supplement for any Post-Apocalyptic d20 game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
