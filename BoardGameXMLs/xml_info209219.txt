							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chillwater Treaty</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Thirty] years ago gold was discovered in the mountains that border the duchy of Westmoreland.  As such discoveries always do, the news of gold and the promise of quick wealth drew hoards of prospectors and miners to the remote area hoping to make their fortune.  Several conditions made this activity quite dangerous, however.  For one, the location of the gold deposits were up in the high peaks region of the mountain range where the weather was cold and the terrain was treacherous and unforgiving.  Many who went in search of riches fell victim to the harsh elements and never returned.  Compounding the problem was the fact that a deep canyon carved through the mountains by the Chillwater river lay between the gold field and the nearest town.  Crossing the canyon was practically impossible, and circumventing the hazard added weeks to the travel time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 6th - 9th level characters.  The scenario typically is distributed as an RPT scenario file and three JPG files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
