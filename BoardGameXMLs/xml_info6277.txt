							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire Savior Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Based off the Vampire Savior arcade game. Each player takes a particular character, and constructs a deck with attacks usable by that character, and fight it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there was a release of a &amp;quot;Vampire Savior 2&amp;quot;, it really doesn't warrant a separate entry, as it is just the characters from the arcade game that the first series didn't cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
