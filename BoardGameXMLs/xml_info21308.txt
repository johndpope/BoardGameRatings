			<description>(Description taken from the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A highly competitive fast paced adult game (playing time approximately 1 hour) where players move in and out of three CORPORATE CIRCLES trying to become the first person to make $1,000,000.00 cash. This is done by building up one's corporate holdings through the purchase of companies or by acquiring your opponent's companies in hostile takeovers or corporate raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game where trivia knowledge can't help you; monopolies can be broken and there is always a risk of your opponents conspiring against you. Your common sense is your only ally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a no holds barred [sic] game where alliances are loosely formed and broken as fast as companies hit the auction block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
