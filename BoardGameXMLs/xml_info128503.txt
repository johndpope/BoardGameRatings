							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">De Magische Wereld van Pardoes</name>
									
			<description>De Magische Wereld van Pardoes is based upon a popular character of the Dutch theme park 'Efteling' and derived television series of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a circular board, just like the previous games that have been released in the same series (Joris en de Draak, Raveleijn). In this case 74 spaces divide the starting square from the finishing square with an emerald.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a typical roll-and-move game, combining some different genre elements. Before the game starts, players have to choose 1 of the 4 game's characters. Two of them (Pardoes, Pardijn) represent the heroes in the story depicted, while the two other characters (Rattar, Pantagor) are the villains in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic turn consists of rolling 1D6 and moving your character the according number of spaces towards the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board contains a number 'white twinkles' and 'green lightnings' (4 of each), which work just like S'nakes and Ladders'. The white twinkles work as ladders for the heroes and as snakes for the villains; the green lightnings work the other way around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board also contains two sections with spinning arrows. If your move ends on a square in such a section, you spin that section's arrow and move to the square indicated by the arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other squares let you take an action card (some are to be executed immediately, others can be kept for later in the game) or invoke a duel between you and another player. Each of the duelling secretly chooses 1 card from a set of 3 (water, fire and wood) and reveal this card simultaneously. Water beats fire, fire burns wood and wood floats on water. The winner of the duel   gets a bonus move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A duel is also fought when a player lands on a square with another player's piece. In this case the winner of the duel gets to stay on the square where as the loser goes backwards the number of squares indicated by 1D6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
