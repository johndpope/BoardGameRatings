			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Are The Furries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, here are the full game statistics for all of the Furries depicted throughout Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game - well, all but three, but those guys didn't make it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has an art study, notes and background, and are fully &amp;quot;statted out,&amp;quot; usable as Player Characters or NPCs in your Hot Chicks game.  Delve into deeper secrets of the mysterious Furries in their shadow war against the Slimeys, and see what role the rest of mankind has to play in this battle for their own soul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seminal sample characters from Yiffy, Yaoi, and Yahooey! are also included, with a few improvements.  Furries get experience too, after all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are twenty-eight (28!) complete characters in all, with specialities ranging from Archaeology to Zombie hunting.  Populate the dark corners and deep places of the Earth in 2015 with Fur, Scales, and Feathers, and see just who the real animals are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
