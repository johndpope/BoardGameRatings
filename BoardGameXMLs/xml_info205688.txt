			<description>According to the Orkneyinga Saga, Earl Rognvald Kali Kolsson broke into the chambered tomb of Maeshowe, on Orkney, in AD1150. In AD1153, Earl Harald Maddadson and a group of his men sheltered there during a snowstom. The sagas tell us that Rognvald found treasure there and that two of Harald&amp;rsquo;s men went mad. When the Victorians opened the tomb in 1861, they found Runic graffiti demonstrating that both of these episodes were based on real tomb-breaks. This game combines the two events from the 1150's and casts you as Harald and Rognvald.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a deck of cards, a player board and tokens to simulate your escape from the tomb. The player has a limited number of health and action tokens, which can be removed through normal play or through negative card effects. The player plays cards from hand and these can be positive as well as negative - removing passage tokens (leading to victory) or gaining extra action or health tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
