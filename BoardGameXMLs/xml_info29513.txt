			<description>A Chess variant similar to Ministers Chess, yet different.  The board is 9x9 and there are 36 pieces, including another pawn for each side and a new piece called a Minister.  There is also a standard Queen flanking the king, with the Minister located immediately on the King's opposite side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minister combines the move of the Knight and Bishop, choosing to move one way or the other each time, but not both simultaneously.  This is a unique addition to the game, and is a great complement to the Queen's movement.  In this way the game is different from Minister's Chess, and considerably so as a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minister's Chess has the 9x9 board and adds a pawn and another Queen to each side, but renames the Queen piece to Minister.  However, all Ministers move just like the standard Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
