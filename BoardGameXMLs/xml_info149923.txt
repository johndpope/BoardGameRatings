							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Stomp</name>
									
			<description>Zombie Stomp is a stand-alone miniatures game of redneck-vs.-zombie combat that uses the ECS game engine developed by Team Frog Studios, the same system that powers Super-Powered Miniatures Combat as well as the SuperFogeys game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is fast and furious, with the players having the opportunity to run through large and complex scenarios in a single session that lasts two hours or less. This allows for less time setting up to play, and more time actually shooting stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are free-form enough that you can build whatever scenarios and situations you wish with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
