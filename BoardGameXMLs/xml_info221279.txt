			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go Fish Fitness is a game based around the classic game Go Fish, it is a card game for kids to encourage them to get up, jump around, and add a component of physical exercise to their game in a fun and competitive way. Each card denomination includes a quick physical exercise, and players compete to make a match and force their opponents to do the activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to exercises, each card includes an animal or a creature so that younger children, and those with limited mobility can participate by mimicking the shown creature when a match is made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go Fish Fitness is based around the same set of cards as a standard deck, and can be incorporated into many other standard card games as well. Keeping fit is about incorporating exercise into everyday life, in ways both big and small, and Go Fish Fitness is a way to introduce a little bit more exercise into a normally passive activity for your kids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
