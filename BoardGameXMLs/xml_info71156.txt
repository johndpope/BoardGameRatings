			<description>&amp;quot;Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn (ファイアーエムブレム　暁の女神,  Faiā Emuburemu: Akatsuki no Megami, lit. &amp;quot;Fire Emblem: Goddess of Dawn&amp;quot;)  is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. It is the tenth Fire Emblem title and the first for the Wii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiant Dawn is a sequel to the Nintendo GameCube title Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, featuring the same style of cel-shaded FMV cutscenes. The game features most of the playable and non-player characters that were present in its predecessor, as well as some original characters. The player has the opportunity to transport gameplay data from Path of Radiance when beginning Radiant Dawn. The gameplay retains the fundamental format present in all games of the Fire Emblem series, but also introduces features such as new unit classes and an elevation advantage between battling characters. Radiant Dawn's plot begins in war-torn Daein with the main character Micaiah and her allies rebelling against the oppressive Begnion army. The story is divided into four parts, and changes perspective between different factions within the continent of Tellius.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fire_Emblem:_Radiant_Dawn,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
