			<description>GORE™ uses Open Game Content and newly presents algorithms from 80s role-playing games to produce a generic role-playing game in the tradition of old-school percentile-based games. GORE™ follows a trend that's been going on within the last few years in pen-and-paper games, that is, making material available to publishers to encourage competition and the contribution of high-quality gaming material to the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All new presentation in GORE™ is Product Identity, but Goblinoid Games provides a free license to use this material to produce third-party material that is compatible not just with GORE™, but also with any of several old-school games using a percentile-based system with similar algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Rulebook Introduction/Back Cover blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
