							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reversi Barbacan</name>
									
			<description>This box combines Reversi and Barbacan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barbacan can be played by two to six players. They try to be the first to get their men from the board's circumference into the castle by moving the pieces along the defined lines. An edition published in the 1920s also permitted to move them around the two circles outside the castle, which were omitted from later designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Reversi, players must trap other pieces between their own to capture them (flip them to their color). Pieces will change sides (colors) dozens of times. The winner is the one with the most pieces of their color when no more pieces can be played on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
