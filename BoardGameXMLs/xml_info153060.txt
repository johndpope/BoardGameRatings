							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Divine Powers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Divine Powers is THE definitive guide to the priestly class in Adventures Under the Laughing Moon.  Game Masters will be pleased to discover that each god of Mythren is described here in detail, including their history and impact on the world.  Players will now be able to fully embrace the priestly class with unique powers and abilities bestowed by individual gods.  What this means is that a priest of healing and a Holy Knight of justice may both be deemed &amp;ldquo;priests,&amp;rdquo; but will see entirely different game play.  Gods of light, and gods of darkness are all here for GM and player perusal. Additionally, learn about the role of all the immortal races in the world Under the Laughing Moon as gods, titans, angels and more are revealed. Have a little faith in all your adventures with this supplement to the Laughing Moon core rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
