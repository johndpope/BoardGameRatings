			<description>Kai Haferkamp's Das Kleine Gespenst won the 2005 Kinderspiel des Jahres, and now the little ghost returns in a smaller, &amp;quot;bring with me&amp;quot; game that maintains the sassy ghost spirit in a new way. The little ghost is hiding somewhere in the box, and the policeman is searching for it, peering into each manhole with a modicum of fear in his heart, waiting to feel the spectre push cold fingers through his forehead and whisk his cerebellum into a frothy pink smoothie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ha ha, you believed that? No, the little ghost &amp;ndash; should he be under the manhole upon which the policeman stands &amp;ndash; will blow off his cap. If you, the player, have been wise enough to be the one who placed the policeman on that manhole, you receive a reward chip. The box is then shaken vigorously in order to spirit the ghost away to some other manhole and await for the policeman's attention there. The first player to blow a cop's hat off five times wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
