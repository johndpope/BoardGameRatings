							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantastiqa: Treasure Hunt Expansion</name>
									
			<description>In the Treasure Hunt Expansion for Fantastiqa, you stumble upon a curious collection of Treasure Maps. Use these maps&amp;mdash;-and your dog-&amp;mdash;to dig up mysterious treasures all over Fantastiqa! A new Victory Cup Quest is also added to the game (more on this exciting Quest below...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantastiqa is required for you to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    12 Treasure Map cards (2 for each Region)&lt;br/&gt;    14 Mystery Tokens (see details below)&lt;br/&gt;    12 +1 Point Bonus Tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, one Treasure Map card is hidden face-down underneath the Quest Goal card. This Treasure Map indicates the Region where the Victory Cup is located--a final Quest required for victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, one Treasure Map card is always visible as an Open Quest for any player to fulfill. To fulfill a Treasure Map Quest, a player must travel to the Region showing on the Treasure Map and dig there (using his &amp;quot;Dig Dog&amp;quot;). On doing this, the player claims one +1 Point Bonus Token and one Mystery Token (see below). The Treasure Map card is discarded face-up at the bottom of the Treasure Map deck and a new Treasure Map card is displayed on top (reshuffle as needed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player reaches the Quest Goal, the Victory Cup Quest tucked beneath the Quest Goal is revealed, face-up, for all to see. The first player who fulfills both of the following conditions wins the game: a) the player&amp;rsquo;s score meets or exceeds the Quest Goal, and b) the player uses a &amp;ldquo;Dig&amp;rdquo; symbol (on his Dog card) to unearth the Victory Cup from the Region showing on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;List of Mystery Tokens:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Artifact: Draw one Artifact from the top of the Artifact deck and claim it for free. Immediately add it to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;    Beast: Draw one Beast from the Beast deck and claim it for free. Immediately add it to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;    Flying Carpet: Fly to any adjacent Region over a marked road. (Just like a regular Magic Carpet token.)&lt;br/&gt;    Magic Compass: Travel to any Region diagonally adjacent to your own (i.e., across the terrain occupied by an Open Quest card).&lt;br/&gt;    Pocket Portal: Teleport to any Region.&lt;br/&gt;    Potion of Persuasion: Use the potion to subdue any adjacent Creature while Adventuring (move your Adventurer as usual). Immediately add this Creature to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;    Secret Stash: The token is worth 4 Gems. These Gems do not count against you when the Mischievous Raven appears or when other players use Artifacts like the Rogue&amp;rsquo;s Purse. They cannot be stolen by the Mischievous Raven or by other players. Use these Gems just like regular Gems when purchasing items. No change is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
