			<description>La Bataille Electorale (&amp;quot;The Electorale Battle&amp;quot;) is a game about an election in the Canadian province of Qu&amp;eacute;bec circa 1977 during the rise of separatism. It was independently produced and distributed, made in limited numbers and sold only in Qu&amp;eacute;bec. Played on a stylized map of the province with historically named but hypothetical electoral ridings, two to five players battle for votes to get elected in the 100 districts and win the opportunity to form the government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and move their token on the game track, which can direct them to place their markers (50 apiece) in ridings or get game cards (like &amp;ldquo;Imponderables&amp;rdquo;) to effect the game.&lt;br/&gt;Made when the Parti Qu&amp;eacute;b&amp;eacute;cois was coming to power, 1977 was an exciting and contentious year in Canadian politics. To simulate this, the players represent five different hypothetical political parties that are based on their historical counterparts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Parti de l&amp;rsquo;Unite Nationale (based on the Union Nationale)&lt;br/&gt;     Ralliement Social-National (based on the Ralliement National)&lt;br/&gt;     Rassemblement des Travailleurs Quebecois (based on the Rassemblement pour l&amp;rsquo;Independance  Nationale)&lt;br/&gt;     Parti de la Souverainete Quebecoise (based on the Parti Quebecois)&lt;br/&gt;     Action Federale (based on the Liberal Party of Quebec)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
