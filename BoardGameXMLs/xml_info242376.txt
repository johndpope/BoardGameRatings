			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1930's dramas were slowly unfolding in capital cities throughout the world.  From dimly lit hotel rooms to highly sophisticated intelligence Headquarters, men and women were playing a game of cat and mouse for scraps of information essential to the security of their country.  Cloak &amp;amp; Dagger pits you against the computer, or other players, as head of an intelligence Agency trying desperately to stay one step ahead of its rivals.  Moving agents from capital to capital, ferreting information, and offering bribes are fundamental parts of each player's turn... and your survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
