			<description>Translated from description on publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Liar Kingdom. Funny people lie for the good of the kingdom, but the poor citizens despise them for their lies. YOU are the authority of darkness, dominate in the shadows of this crazy kingdom. Even the king is afraid of you. Nobles and slaves alike will die not even know your existence. You are invincible and your power is absolute, but one question has been asked that might change the kingdom's fate: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Who among the kingdom's people has the most power?&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt; Using only three cards and three &amp;quot;declaration chips,&amp;quot; play a game to earn victory points faster than your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays one of their three cards face down and one of their three chips face up on top of the card. The face up chip can be the true identity of their played card or a lie to try to trick the other players into believing what they are playing. There is an optional round where players can change the chip on their card to a different one. Then the cards are revealed and the way they interact decides who won the round and receives VP. Also, if you were lying or telling the truth with your chip determines if you receive or lose additional VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's summary:&lt;br/&gt;暗殺者、王様、奴隷のカードを１枚ずつ持ってゲームをします。プレイヤーは順番に手番を行います。自分の出すカードがどれかをチップを出して宣言する。任意のカードを裏向きで出す。全員がそれを行ったら勝敗の判定を行います。自分の出したカードが次のとおりだった場合、勝利します。暗殺者を出して王様がいた場合、それを１人敗北させて勝利します。王様を出して自分を殺す暗殺者がいなかった場合、奴隷を全員敗北させて勝利します。奴隷を出して王様がいなかった場合に勝利します。勝利したプレイヤーは得点を獲得します。勝利しなかったプレイヤーは全員敗北。宣言と異なるカードを出していたプレイヤーはマイナス点を獲得します。誰かが８点以上を獲得するとゲーム終了。得点の高いプレイヤーの勝利です。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 3 cards and 3 tokens, each of which represents Royalty, Assassin, and Slave. Starting player declares a card he will be playing by placing corresponding token face-up, then plays one card face-down. He may lie about the card he's playing. Then next player does the same, and so on. When all players are done, reveal all cards they played and resolve the outcome. If one or more Royalties are in play, each Assassin in play kills one of them. Successful Assassins win the round. After the assassination, if one or more Royalties are still in play, survived Royalties win the round, otherwise all Slaves win the round. Winners get points, and players who have lied and still didn't win the round lose points. A game ends when a player gains total of 8 points. A player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
