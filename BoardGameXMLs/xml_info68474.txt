			<description>At this gameboard portraits of 40 British kings and queens, in 80 playing spaces altogether, are shown with events from each of their reigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;The Card sold with the Game is to be divided. The Letters are to mark the players' position on the Game; the Numbers and Blanks are to be placed in a lady's reticule or bag. Draw for the first player; the highest number to begin. Each player on drawing a number is to place his letter on the same number on the Game, unless otherwise ordered in the directors, which must be read aloud. When it is his turn to draw again, he must add his number to the one where his letter stands, and remove it accordingly. If he draws a blank, he must remain where he is. Each card is to be returned to the bag. The game is to proceed in this manner till some player arrives at the Marriage of Queen Victoria, who wins the game. When a player is sent back, he is not to read the Directions, but wait his turn to draw again. The history of each reign may be read or omitted at the time of playing, as the players think fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
