							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Micro Play-Break: Kingdoms</name>
									
			<description>The dying King is a shrewd man with more gold than compassion. Unable to choose between his two offspring whom to name as his successor, the King devised a challenge, bequeathing to them small Kingdoms in the far corners of his vast territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will earn the right to the throne? Only the most clever will succeed either by building an impenetrable fortress or eliminating the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:  The winner is the first to either have a knight outside the forest that cannot be captured or be the only player with a knight on the board outside the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: On their turn, each player will place, move, or flip pieces on the game board.  Player options come from the pieces not-currently-on-the-board, meaning greater options are available to those who have fewer pieces in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
