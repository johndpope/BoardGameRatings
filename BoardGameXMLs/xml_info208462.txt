							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Selaa Dunesh: The Seducing</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for four characters in their first careers. These characters should have at least half their advances taken. With a little adjustment to names, places and stats, Selaa-Dunesh and be incorporated to any place in the Old World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course of events in this story will take a night or two to play out. Our heroes, such as they maybe, aid in the defense of a small Talabecland village. Where vicious and evil Beastmen plague and raid the small village, ravaging the populous. The villagers will plead for their help, and most noble-hearted characters should agree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
