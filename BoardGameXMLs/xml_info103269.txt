							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Telling Time With Tibbar</name>
									
			<description>Time to learn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn to tell time with Tibbar! Practice telling time by moving Tibbar's hands on Tibbar's Clock Puzzle. Learn three different clock formats (analog, digital, and 24-hour) by playing the memory game Tibbar's Time Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to get out of bed this morning starts the game.  This player begins by turning over 3 clock tiles, one of each color (red, green, and blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- If the tiles each show the same time, the player collects the tiles and begins a new turn.  A player may continue taking turns as long as they can reveal the correct tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- If the tiles do not show the same time, the player must turn them back clock-face down.  The player to the left then takes the next turn, following the same rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all tiles have been collected, the game ends.  The player with the most completed sets wins!  Note that the back of the rules booklet contains a handy guide for players having trouble reading the times at first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teaches:&lt;br/&gt;Memory&lt;br/&gt;Fine Motor Skills&lt;br/&gt;Telling Time in 3 ways&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
