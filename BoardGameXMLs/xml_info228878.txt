			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new prince has arisen among the Sahuagin in the deep. The barons of the area have set out with raiding parties to capture humans for slaves, sport, and food to be used in the coronation festivities. All of the raiding parties have been blessed by the god of the deep. One such raiding party has made its way to the coast a few days South of Ravens Bluff. The sahuagin have been raiding the nearby farms and fishermen of the town Arbonne. The adventure starts with the PCs in the marketplace. A fire breaks out at the Laughing Goat Inn and the PCs must handle a number of situations. After the incident, the PCs are proclaimed heros by the merchant community and a feast is given in their honor. During the feast, Justin, a spokesman for the town, approaches the PCs and asks for their help. The rest of the module is spent travelling to Arbonne and then defeating the Sahuagin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
