							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiger Attack!  The Battle of the Bulge, Ardennes 1944</name>
									
			<description>A relatively fast, very playable point-to-point game at roughly regiment/combat command/brigade unit scale and 1-day per turn time scale, using my simple Dark Crusade combat table and system, plus Disruption and fortification.  U.S. starts with 19 units, Germans with many more.  Playing time is a couple hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Peiper, Bayerlein, and Abrams leader counters and a Skorzeny 150th Brigade Brandenburgers unit are included, as well as the 2 historical Tiger tank battalions.  (Some offensive-shocked GIs were reporting any panzer as being a Tiger tank.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuel is unlimited for the Americans and crucial and weather-dependent for the Germans - vs. Allied airpower.  My Patton's Prayer rule (for better weather) from my hex-and-counter Tigers in the Ardennes is included, as is a rule for the chance of a &amp;quot;blonde and beautiful&amp;quot; U.S. Army nurse diverting Bayerlein's attention, as occurred historically and possibly decisively on his/Panzer Lehr Division's way to Bastogne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map and units can alternatively be used with Major Battles and Campaigns combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
