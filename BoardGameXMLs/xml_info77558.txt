			<description>From the Publisher / Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harpoon 3 Advanced Naval Warfare is the result of decades of development and fan support, resulting in the most comprehensive, realistic, and accurate simulation of modern combined air and naval operations available to the gaming public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harpoon 3 Advanced Naval Warfare gives you the opportunity to manage some of the most advanced air and naval assets available in the world and puts you in the middle of many historical and &amp;lsquo;what if&amp;rsquo; scenarios (including six multiplayer scenarios). In the scenarios you'll battle the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Persian Gulf , re-live Operation El Dorado Canyon and strike at the heart of Libya, guard the Greenland-Iceland-U.K. Gap to stop a Soviet naval invasion of the Atlantic, or stalk unwary U.S. shipping in a Soviet Akula-class submarine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are plenty more scenarios from which to choose from, with more than 120 pre-designed missions included (there are also more than 200 community-designed scenarios available online).  You'll have the chance to play them from either side, experiencing a wide variety of challenges, and most importantly Harpoon 3 Advanced Naval Warfare now has true multiplayer capability for up to six players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
