			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Rash! Saved from a near-fatal crash during one of his professional motorcycle stunt shows, Wayne Stetson&amp;rsquo;s upper body has been cybernetically augented, and his lower body replaced with a motorcycle-like prosthetic. Road Rash is aggressive, forthright, and bitter towards others more fortunate than himself. Financially ruined by his medical expenses and the loss of his celebrated career, Road Rash has become a daring and greedy thief specializing in highway robbery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;FOE FILE #06: ROAD RASH&amp;quot; contains a briefing from TEACHER, the sentient computer system of the Crusader Citadel (headquarters of the Crusaders superhero team), color character sheets with complete stats for Road Rash in VILLAINS AND VIGILANTES and LIVING LEGENDS, background, tactics, personality traits, and choice dialogue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
