							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island</name>
									
			<description>The game follows the exploits of the game's three main protagonists, Papa Doc, Jane Starling, and Blue Belly, as they try to stop the resurrection of a demon god, which is orchestrated by Papa Doc's treacherous wife aided by the pirate crew of Greenbeard and an army of zombies. After she captures the pirate king Flint and knocks out the three protagonists, the three find themselves cursed with their souls separated from their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay follows standard point and click adventure games but with a twist. Having been cursed, the three protagonists are able to interact with the world as either themselves normally or leave their bodies and interact as ghosts. As ghosts, they are capable of moving through walls and manipulating things without being seen or heard by most characters. However due to being ghosts, they are unfortunately unable to pass through or touch certain ghost warding barriers such as a line of salt. To pass, they thus have to find ways to clear the barriers away through other means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the ghost mechanics, each individual character is equipped with a set of skills. In relation to the curse, they are also able to communicate with each other telepathically and able to use each other's body in order to solve certain puzzles that each one alone is incapable of solving. Papa Doc is a strong Vooju priest and is an expert in most Vooju related areas such as reading certain hieroglyphics. Jane Starling is a nimble pirate and is an expert in most pirate techniques such as forging papers. Blue Belly is fat little pirate and is an expert in cooking and other related matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
