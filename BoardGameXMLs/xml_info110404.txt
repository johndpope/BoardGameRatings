			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Atop the peak of Mt. Auroch, the fabled griffon riders make their home in the city of Aerie. Epic in its scope, Aerie has been carved into the very face of the mountain itself. Its people rule over a vast swath of territory, its trade with the dwarves of Westerdeep and the city-states of the east is rich, and its fame has spread far and wide. Indeed, its fortunes have never seemed fairer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all is not well in the city of Aerie. Merchant and knight have turned one upon the other, and mercenaries play each off against the other. If the coming crisis cannot be averted, even a city of stone may burn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find all the wonders of Aerie, from the cyclopean maze of the Giant's Steps to the glorious sunken mansions of the upper city. Breathe deep the fresh, crisp mountain air and gaze upon the magnificent waterfalls of the eastern wall. Learn what it is to soar through the clouds on the backs of griffons...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
