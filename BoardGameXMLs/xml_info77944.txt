							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sled Storm</name>
									
			<description>The second game in the Sled Storm series was released on the PlayStation 2. The gameplay this time around was more similar to SSX. The environments were more interactive than the previous game with a larger amount of shortcuts and alternate paths. An attack button, new to the series, can be used attack opponents in an attempt to knock them off their snowmobile. Again, like the prequel the characters had differing attributes which effect weight, acceleration, and other things. But the storyline for the characters was covered much more in depth. The trick feature in this game was more in extensive and contained a larger amount of possible tricks. It was accessed by using the top four shoulder buttons in combination with the direction pad. The trick meter not only increases the score like the original, but it also charges the newly incorporated &amp;quot;Storm Meter&amp;quot; (which must be charged by performing tricks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Sled Storm , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
