			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two long months have passed since you where captured by the Constable. Other dogs have been captured in that time, most were adopted before it was too late, but some have gone to their deaths ahead of you. For the six of you who remain caged in the Rivergate Pound, time has run out. You thought that you still had two days to be adopted, but Igor, the loathsome human who controls this jail, has moved up your date of termination.  Tomorrow you will be sent to the &amp;ldquo;Big Sleep&amp;rdquo;, and Igor has taken great pleasure in reminding you just how long that sleep will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
