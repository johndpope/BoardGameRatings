							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Masters of the Universe: He-Man: Power of Grayskull</name>
									
			<description>Back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eternia was once a place of beauty and safety. Protected by the Masters of the Universe and the Mystic Wall, this sacred land could never be touched by the evil of the outside world. But one dark day Skeletor and his evil warriors were able to breach the Mystic Wall. Their relentless attacks have pushed the Masters of the Universe to their edge-and now, yet another wave of attacks. It's clear only one man can protect this land and keep its people safe - He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe! Can you, as He-Man, push back the evil beasts to the Dark Hemisphere? Test your skills and discover if you are worthy of being He-Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
