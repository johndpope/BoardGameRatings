			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HYPERBOREAN MICE is a role-playing game of grim Swords &amp;amp; Sorcery action... as portrayed by talking mice and rats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient White Lords, albino mice with magical powers, rule over the valley of Hyperborea, but their empire is crumbling. Barbarian rat tribes, deadly predators and political intrigue threaten to bring their mousy civilization to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrible predators like foxes and owls take the place of giants and dragons. Voracious shrew clans raid the Fallows, seeking mice and rats to fill their larders. Centipedes scuttle beneath the underbrush, seeking prey. Hawks force the inhabitants to stay under cover during the day, while owls stalk the sky at night. The system includes rules for dangerous predators such as shrews, foxes and weasels, as well as less offensive creatures like crows and pigeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary horrors stalk the land, unique predators with potent magical abilities of their own. The terrifying Mocker, a centipede whose only voice is the imitated cries of his victims. The serpent Ssaaa gathers a cult of worshipers to do her bidding in the valley. And no mouse dares stand against dread Hoorooru, the ancient ruler of Rookswood and the enemy of the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a Royal Mouse, White Mouse, Common Mouse, Jumping Mouse, White Rat, Common Rat or even one of the brutish Wild Rats. Your character might be a lowly commoner or even an outcast... or a wealthy noblemouse of high standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HYPERBOREAN MICE uses a simple stat+skill+2d6 system that supports multiple levels of success, different critical success results for different weapons, and an original magic system focused around six different magical arts and four levels of spell effects. There are dozens of combat and non-combat non-magical powers for characters to take and rules governing conflicts between creatures of vastly different sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
