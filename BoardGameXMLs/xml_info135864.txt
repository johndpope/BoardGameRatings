			<description>High Side is a casino table game using both cards and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game description:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;High Side is a table game that accommodates five or six players on a standard blackjack table, depending on layout utilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Side is similar to Baccarat in that players do not compete against the dealer or other players.  Instead, players win based on the comparison of two community hand values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses six standard decks of 52 playing cards per deck dealt from a shoe and two Pai Gow dice cups, each containing a single standard six sided die.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of High|Side is to bet on the higher of two&lt;br/&gt;hand values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first hand value is determined by the roll of two dice.&lt;br/&gt;The second hand value is determined by the draw of a single&lt;br/&gt;card. Card values equal the number on the card with Aces&lt;br/&gt;playing as 1, Jacks as 11, Queens as 12 and Kings as 13.&lt;br/&gt;The winning hand is the High|Side and pays even money.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
