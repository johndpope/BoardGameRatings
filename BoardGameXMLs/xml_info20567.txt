			<description>(From the designer's website)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Njal's Holiday, you try to make the ultimate viking horde. In true fashion, you raid your neighbors, kill other vikings, loot the gold and take thier women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The norse gods like to help or hinder your progress however. Other hardships of Viking life are here, too. Random invasions, strange beasts and natural disaster await you. Darwinism might be proved correct, for only the mightiest Viking clan will survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out why NJAL'S HOLIDAY is the fastest growing late night con pickup game around!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Njal's Holiday is a game for 2 or more players. 3 or more players is highly recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;             To produce the game as inexpensively as possible (and passing the savings on to you), The game elements come on uncut sheets of card stock. ***&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains: One rule sheet, One page each of 80 counters for Vikings, Women and Gold, One Sheet of six Boats and 7 sheets of 10 cards (68 for the game and 2 blanks so you can be creative).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need 1 six-sided die for each player, a pair of scissors to cut the cards and a little patience to cut them with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
