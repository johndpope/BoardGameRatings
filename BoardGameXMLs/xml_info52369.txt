							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sweet Agatha</name>
									
			<description>From the Publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One morning Agatha was gone vanished without a trace leaving everything behind, her apartment reduced to a collection of objects from a life interrupted. It falls on you to find her, but to do so you will have to make some hard choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Agatha is a bridge between the worlds of traditional fiction and cooperative storytelling. An engrossing mystery presented in a collection artifacts including a poster and a gorgeous 30+ page full color journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These items tell the story of Agatha&amp;rsquo;s sudden disappearance, casting you, the reader, as the sole person looking for answers. Exploring the complex, stylized, and often cryptic journal, you will become an active and integral part of the story. Play begins as soon as you start reading. Eventually you will share the experience with a friend, and together you will complete the story of Sweet Agatha through simple, driven, collaborative storytelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Agatha is a reading experience unlike any other. It captures the excitement of a good book or film AND allows the reader and his or her friends to actively participate in the story. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a hokey chose your own adventure. This isn&amp;rsquo;t another mystery novel. Sweet Agatha is a uniquely designed artifact that readers participate in. The act of reading and manipulating the pages changes the outcome of the story. You are in control of Agatha&amp;rsquo;s destiny. You will decide how it all ends. Not quite a game and not quite a novel, Sweet Agatha is a unique product pushing the boundaries of both mediums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
