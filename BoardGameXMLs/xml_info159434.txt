			<description>The object of the game is to have fun and learn more about the past and present of America's birthplace. A secondary object is to &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; the game by either controlling the entire city and forcing the other players out of the game or possess the most cash value at the end of an agreed on time period - 60 minutes, 90 minutes or whatever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game everyone begins at Independence Hall and receives $1776.00. Players take turns in order moving the allotted number of spaces (dice roll) in a clockwise direction around the board. If a player lands on a property with special instructions, they must be followed. If the player lands on an unowned property, it may be purchased. If the player lands on a property owned by another player, then rent must be collected. If the player lands on a property they already own, that player than receives rent from the bank. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again. A second roll of doubles send that player to the Roundhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may sell any properties they own to any other player at any time during the game. The bank is forces to buy back any property a player choose at 67% of the original cost. The rent of each property is 10% of its original cost. If a players owns two properties of a kind (for example the Art Museum and the Academy of Music - cultural institutions) the rent is doubled. If a player owns three properties the rent is tripled. A player may not collect any rents while his pawn is at the Roundhouse or on the Expressway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player rolls a &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; that player gets to draw a Travel card. Whenever a player rolls a &amp;quot;six&amp;quot; that player gets to draw a News card. If a player rolls both a &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;six&amp;quot; on the same roll that player can select either type of card, but not both. If double &amp;quot;ones&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;sixes&amp;quot; are rolled, that player draws nothing. When a player ends their turn on a block marked &amp;quot;Travel Card&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;News Card&amp;quot; that player draws the appropriate card. A player that ends their turn on either the Free Library or Franklin Institute gets to answer a Quiz card drawn by the player on their left. The &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; answers to the Quiz cards are left to the discretion of the game players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
