			<description>The LCD shows the word that players need to find out, and clues are given, while the time to respond is counted. The device is passed from hand to hand with the correct answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two game modes: individual or team. Individual has the option for easy or difficult (so there is really 3 modes). After choosing the options, start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual mode: The first question appears on the screen. For example: words beginning with &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; and containing the letter &amp;quot;N&amp;quot;. From that time it begins to count time (which leads the device). The player with the device in hand says a word with those conditions, and if you do, the device passes to the next player quickly, which should be another word that has not been said already. When the time expires, an alarm sounds and the player with the device on hand at the time (in this moment), is eliminated. New question appears on the screen, repeating the same cycle with the players that are left. The goal is not to be eliminated, as when only one player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team play is quite different. The question appears on the screen, and each of the teams will discuss among its members the number of words that are able to say with those conditions, in 60 seconds. It's like an auction. The team that makes the best bet, will play the first round of 60 sec. and each of the team members will be saying a word and pressed his team number on the device (1 or 2) so that it takes account at the end of 60 seconds. If successful you will get the first point, otherwise, the point is for the other team. Then comes another round of 60 seconds. with new question and following the same mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When starting the game will have agreed how many rounds will be played or how long the game. Once completed, the device itself will tell how many points each team leads, and whoever has the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
