			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;S RESOURCE by Julian Neale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs have final emerged from the dungeon laden with loot prised from the clutches of their slain foes. Heroically returning to civilisation, they divide up the choicest items, sell the dross and other unwanted treasures and gleefully count their share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, they ask &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s for sale in this town, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At that point, likely or not, the game grinds to a halt as the GM frantically generates what items are available for purchase or he simply says &amp;ldquo;anything up to the gp cap.&amp;rdquo; (After all, most GMs have better things to do with their prep time than generate what the PCs might want to buy on the off chance they return to town after a successful foray).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s For Sale, Anyway? banishes these problems by providing over 150 pre-generated, ready-to-use lists for the busy GM to immediately use in his campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
