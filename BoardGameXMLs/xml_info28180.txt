							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Honey War</name>
									
			<description>2-5 players control their own apiary. The goal is to build the largest and best apiary - the first player to get 10 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honey War is loosely based on real beekeeping, and includes many of the same problems and solutions real beekeepers face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a board, bee cards (queens and workers), pollen cards, honey cards and action cards. On a players turn they roll the dice and move that number of spaces around the board, collecting special cards as they land on the relevant spaces. These cards are used to get new bees, inflict disease on other players hives, or cure your own infected hives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
