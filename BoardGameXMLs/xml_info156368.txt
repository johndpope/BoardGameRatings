							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Druids</name>
									
			<description>Druids is played on a six-sided board divided into 88 triangular cells.  There are three long sides of the board, equivalent to six of the cell's sides in length, and three short sides, two cells in length.  The overall shape is of a triangle with it's points cut off, and the game's pieces (Stones) share this shape.  Half of the board's cells are recessed, and divided into three color groups: black for a triangular Field in the center of the board, and red, yellow, and green for each of the Camps in the corners of the board.  In each of the recessed Camp cells are a number of dots in one of these quantities: one, three, six, ten, and fifteen, with the smaller quantities being closer to the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts play with nine Stones of the same color as his Camp, placed in all the cells of his Camp.  The game is played only in the recessed cells of the board.  Players take turns moving their Stones one at a time in an attempt to move all the stones of their color into one or both of their opponents' Camps.  Stones may move to any one vacant adjacent cell (there are up to six adjacent recessed areas) per turn, so long as they do not re-enter their own Camp.  Stones may jump over one opponent's piece to an empty adjacent cell on the opposite side; stones are not removed from the board.  Jumps over friendly Stones are not allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules allow for final scores to be tallied based on the number of dots covered by each player in their opponent's Camps, and for alternate winning conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
