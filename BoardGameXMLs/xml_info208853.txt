							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">When the Levee Breaks</name>
									
			<description>Each player is a City Planner in New Orleans. All players must begrudgingly work together building levees to keep the city from flooding during the next big storm. During a turn, one player will be designated as the City Manager and select 3 levees for the City Planners to bid on. The levee that gets the most money, will be built. Unfortunately everyone has a different vision of the city's future and wants some districts to be destroyed for future revitalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this semi-cooperative game, players will make and break promises to save and destroy the districts according to their secret goals. The game ends when the great storm comes and floods the unprotected districts. Players earn points for successfully fulfilling the their secret goals, and lose points for failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
