			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What good is science fiction without starships? The original Star Frontiers treated space travel as a means to an end, not a source of adventure itself. In the Alpha Dawn game, your characters booked passage on starliners and mining vessels, were dropped off and had an appointment to rendezvous at a later time. Your character may have known how to fix a skimmer, drive a ground cycle, or navigate around on a planet&amp;rsquo;s surface, but when it came to space, you needed help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now your character has been around, built his reputation and skills. You have a pile of credits obtained through various (sometimes nefarious!) means. You&amp;rsquo;re tired of waiting two weeks at layovers, looking for passage on the next ship that leaves port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want your own starship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what the Knight Hawks game is about. It&amp;rsquo;s actually two games in one: First, it&amp;rsquo;s a strategic board game complete with cardboard counters (you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download these separately) and a game board (well &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll have to supply the hex map too...). Second, it&amp;rsquo;s a campaign expansion that brings your advanced STAR FRONTIERS characters new options, equipment, skills to select, and let&amp;rsquo;s not forget starships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those alien planets just got closer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the counters: you can download them from the same place you got this book. Print them to Avery project paper (you know, that full-page sticky paper) and peel &amp;amp; stick it on project board (not poster board, but that thicker stuff) and get out a ruler and an exacto knife. You&amp;rsquo;ll have playing pieces in no time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the game board: You can make your own by printing out the hex map you&amp;rsquo;ll find towards the end of this book. Print to project paper, peel &amp;amp; stick on something permanent. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s white with black lines while space is mostly black... but use your imagination, man!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
