			<description>Part of the 4 Tiles Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a very straightforward trick-taking game in tile form. I think requires too much record-keeping for such a quick, simple game. It's completely untested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of four tiles that don't need to be any bigger than a Carcassonne tile. The squares (that are paired together as rectangles) in the images below need to be pasted tiles such that the matching tile numbers (the number in the gray circles) are on opposite sides of a tile. You'll need about half a sheet of paper to keep track of what number have been played and for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3198731#3198731&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3198731#3198731&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
