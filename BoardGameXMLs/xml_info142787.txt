							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TCW Total Championship Wrestling Promotion Book</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total Championship Wrestling (TCW) was born when famous wrestler Tommy Cornell purchased the Hollyweird Grappling Company, an over the top cartoony wrestling organization that had garnered some popularity in the South East US. Cornell took the promotion national and put on live events, as well as selling DVDs, for years all across the US. Cornell inserted himself as a star of the show, along with such wrestlers as Liberty, Rick Law, BLZ Bubb, Painful Procedure (the champion tag team composing of BJ Shearer and Randall Hopkirk, plus Ronnie V. Pain), the Demons of Rage, and Madman Boone. But true success arrived in 2011 when Cornell struck a deal with Rogue Net, an upstart TV network with coverage across the US and Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The series premiere of TCW featured a cast of original members but by week two, Wayne &amp;ldquo;The Jock&amp;rdquo; Walker and Chip Babylon, some of the most popular wrestlers in the world, joined the roster. They immediately got into a feud so intense it ended in a Loser-Leaves-Town match. Liberty won the right to face Tommy Cornell by beating BLZ Bubb, despite Cornell being the special referee. And Rick Law and Genghis Rahn‟s argument, or as much of a spat as you can have when you don‟t speak the same language, over whether Rick‟s nightstick was superior to Rahn‟s tribal staff led to a match where clubs were legal. Other rivalries soon developed for TCW‟s first PPV to take shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
