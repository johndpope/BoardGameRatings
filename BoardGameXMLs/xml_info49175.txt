							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shattered Statue</name>
									
			<description>This is a module published by TSR after they had acquired Dragonquest from SPI.  It is an AD&amp;amp;D adventure that has rules for adapting the encounters to be compatible with Dragonquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A mutual friend has praised your skills highly. If you seek rich reward and the oppurtunity to delve into mysteries ancient and lost, bring this bottle forthwith to my demesne in the village of Volkumburgh. Together we may seek to bring mankind the lost wonder of the awtawmatawn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious note, a disappearing 5-foot-long religious artifact, and the ruins of two magical schools. What do these things have in common? How deeply are your party members involved in all of this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Shattered Statue&amp;quot; is the first dual-game-system module of its kind. Players of both the AD&amp;amp;D game system and DRAGONQUEST game system can use this adventure. It is suitable for use with the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
