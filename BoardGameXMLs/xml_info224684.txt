			<description>Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 2nd Edition Rules Supplement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following changes to the AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition game have their origin in feelings of dissatisfaction with the original rules. Some have been designed to give the players greater freedom in developing their characters; others have been introduced in order to make my campaign world more 'realistic'. The changes are, of course, only applicable in my Forgotten Realms campaigns. They are not intended to be the final word on these matters - players who feel dissatisfied with my rules are encouraged to create their own versions. Playtesting will then show which one adds the most to the fun of the entire gaming group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
