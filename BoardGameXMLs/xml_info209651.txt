							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sentinels of the Multiverse: 5th Anniversary Foil Villain Collection</name>
									
			<description>This is a set of all of the villains ever who do not come with their own oversized cards, including several variants! It's the same content (with minor errata on one card) as the Villain Oversized Pack that we recently printed. However, the Foil Oversized Villain Collection comes in a sweet box with a magnetic closure (pictured above) and all of the cards feature foil art! (from the kickstarter update)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
