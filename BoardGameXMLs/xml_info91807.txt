			<description>A word game with a difference! -- Phonogram focusses on the phonetic pronunciation of words, rather than their spelling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students, Phonogram has also been a hit among English language educators as a quick and fun way to improve knowledge and use of the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a colour-coded selection of 210 phoneme tiles, each player works independently to create their own 'crossword' (no board required). When a player uses up all their letters, all players take a new tile from the pool. When all the tiles are gone, the first player to use up all the tiles in their hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is suitable for solo, group and team play, and may be adjusted to reflect different accents and even other languages that can be expressed in basic IPA phonemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
