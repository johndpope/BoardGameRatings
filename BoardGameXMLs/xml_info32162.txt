			<description>Published circa 1955 (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.spielbox-online.de/indxtemp.html?/sbmain/ersatzs.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.spielbox-online.de/indxtemp.html?/sbmain/ersatzs....&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nice family game where you have to deliver the pre-dealt wooden chips onto the corresponding circles on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time you have to visit as much of the 36 cities (each one provided with a card)on the map as possible. These are of 3 different values regarding how large they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to watch out that your visits include 4 cities at the far east, south, north and west borders of the board and to avoid the already laid out green chips: If you travel by one you have to pick it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when all 36 cities have been visited or if a single player has delivered all his green chips and is in posession of at least 8 city cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored for each city card to its full value for the player, each green chip scores 2 and each border city not visited 10 points against the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
