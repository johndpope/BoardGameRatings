							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Micro Fleet: Napoleonic Naval</name>
									
			<description>The Micro Napoleonic Naval Game gives the Napoleonic naval enthusiast the one thing he has yearned for for so long; A set of rules which are easy to follow and do not involve long complicated calculations but still manage to maintain a high degree of historical accuracy. The game also offers a means of fighting large scale naval battles under sail and also eliminates the many hours of tedious work involved in producing sailing ship models.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The basic game is designed with the view of fighting naval actions involving squadron size forces of up to seven ships of the line per side together with their accompanying frigates and smaller vessels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer may be S. Birnie who is credited with the copyright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Micro Warfare Series from Tabletop Games. The games in the series were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a mapboard) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used un-cut cardstock counters for the game units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supplements&lt;br/&gt;Naval Napoleonic&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MN-301 Trafalgar Fleets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
