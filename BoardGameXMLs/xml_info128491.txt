			<description>Derby Bingo is a combination of Bingo with a betting dice game. There are red wooden discs to cover the spaces on the bingo card and square paper chits (yellow/plain) with which to bet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4x4 Bingo Cards represent a player's horse.  Betting on your horse is part of the game.  You can bet to WIN, PLACE, or SHOW at the top of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two die. One die is the conventional d6 die with 1 to 6 spots. The other die is a special one with letters R, A, C, E, P, and T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One your turn, roll the two die. When rolled, the letter die gives the column (R, A, C or E) on the bingo card and the number die the space. If you have a match, then you cover up that spot on your card. You finish by filling a bingo line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;POT&amp;quot; is started by players paying chits for their Bingo card. Also if a player rolls a P the player must pay into the POT.  Players rolling a T take money from the POT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If more than three are playing then the game ends when first, second and third places have been decided and all bets are paid off. The &amp;quot;POT&amp;quot; is shared by the players owning the winning horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
