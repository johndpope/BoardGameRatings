							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unearthing the Past</name>
									
			<description>From the Web Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unearthing the Past&amp;quot; is a four-part Cliffhangers adventure for 3 to 5 1st-level characters. Characters who survive the adventure should advance to second level. DMs can easily modify the adventure to accommodate higher level characters by increasing the number of foes in each encounter. Many of the villians are humanoids, so another good way to adjust the Encounter Levels within the adventure is to substitute more powerful humanoids in each encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place around the village of Travensburg. The town has had a rough winter, and although the promise of spring seems just around the corner, the town has had to purchase food from a nearby village. The area feels peaceful, but the winter has driven a few small bands of humanoids to search for food outside their normal territory. To protect the valuable shipment of supplies, four guards were sent to escort the wagon. Now the shipment of food is overdue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
