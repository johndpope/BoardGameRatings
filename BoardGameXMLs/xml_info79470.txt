			<description>From back of the Amiga game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fend off challengers in the Phoenix Grand Prix.  Overtake rivals on the streets of Monaco.  Execute a savage hairpin turn on the Suzuka Circuit.  It's World Championship Formula One racing at its most intense with MicroProse's World Circuit racing simulation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other racing simulations, World Circuit offers you all 16 of the Grand Prix's demanding racetracks.  The Monza circuit...the Mexico City circuit...the Barcelona circuit...they're all here in accurately mapped 3D representations with variable weather and track conditions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But spectacular speedways are just the beginning!  Because, as is customary with all MicroProse games, World Circuit has special features that put you right in the thick of the excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features like: authentic Formula One handling and performance; dramatic slipstreaming effects; joystic-controllable driving functions; detailed and animated pit stops; stunningly realistic crashes for the unlucky; and difficulty levels from rookie to ace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, World Circuit pits your Formula One racing skills against 25 independent computer-controlled drivers.  All of whom are challenging you for the glory of being named Grand Prix World Champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
