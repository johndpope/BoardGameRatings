			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Broken Swords is a story roleplaying game about adventurers in a fantasy world on a long and unfulfilled quest. The quest has dragged on for years. The adventurers are old, tired, and ready to give up. But maybe the fabled relic lies in the next dungeon up ahead. Each adventurer has a secret reason for being on the quest, which could usurp the journey. In the end, will you fail together? Succeed alone?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Broken Swords is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
