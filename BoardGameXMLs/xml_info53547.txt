							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Palladium RPG Book 11: Eastern Territory</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 224 page fantasy sourcebook packed with towns, cities, monsters and adventure in the Eastern Territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This region of the Palladium World has never been described in the past, and is one of the most anticipated books in the Fantasy line, don&amp;rsquo;t miss out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the area is unexplored forest inhabited by inhuman races not happy to see &amp;quot;human invaders&amp;quot; ravaging their land like hungry locusts. The boom towns of the Eastern Territory also attract bandits, bushwhackers, thieves, assassins, mercenaries and monsters who see the new towns, cities and wilderness colonies as easy pickings, ripe for plunder. Likewise, these new communities represent new places for criminals to establish rackets, thieves' and assassins' guilds, dark cults and rare opportunities for all types of scoundrels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eastern Territory also holds its share of secrets and treachery, at the hands of both humans and nonhumans alike. All of this makes for a fertile land of adventure. A place where heroes, adventurers and opportunists (even rogues) can carve out a reputation, become famous and/or build a fortune, maybe even their own kingdom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 25 pages of maps!&lt;br/&gt;Notable cities and towns, each unique and different.&lt;br/&gt;New monsters and menaces.&lt;br/&gt;The Danzi, a new optional race of warriors and shamans.&lt;br/&gt;Danzi Spirit Tattoos and Elven Mosaic magic.&lt;br/&gt;Overview of the land and society.&lt;br/&gt;Key people and places.&lt;br/&gt;Hints about the impending Wolfen Wars.&lt;br/&gt;All kinds of avenues of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
