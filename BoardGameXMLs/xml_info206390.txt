			<description>This party game from UPL is more challenging than most. Each player is given a booklet with 36 riddles. The players must first solve the riddle and then associate the answer with one of the 36 first names listed on the back of the booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, No. 33 is &amp;quot;He's learnt in Kindergarten&amp;quot;, and the answer is Alf (from Alphabet). No. 34 is &amp;quot;He's heading for baldness, and the answer is Dan (from Dandruff). Some involve period references or slang. No. 26 is &amp;quot;He's an Army volunteer&amp;quot;, leading to Terry from Territorial; No. 29 is &amp;quot;She throws him over?&amp;quot;, leading Jill from Jilted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest giving players 20 to 30 minutes, after which the player with the most correct answers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
