			<description>Each player deploys his ships secretly on a square grid. Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location. The defender responds by &amp;quot;Hit!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Miss!&amp;quot;. You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them. First to do so wins. It is extremely similar to the popular game Battleship, the difference being this version uses a pen and paper grid instead of the peg-board found in that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
