			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead to Rights: Retribution is a fresh reboot of the Dead to Rights series. Again following cop Jack Slate, the game pits the player against the Triads of Grant City. Gameplay is similar to previous games in the series, and the player has a number of weapons to choose from to dispatch their enemies. Additionally, Dead to Rights includes a number of melee maneuvers that allow Jack to disarm his opponents or just finish them off. Jack&amp;rsquo;s dog Shadow can also be employed as a weapon, as he can take out enemies on preset commands, or even be player controlled to perform stealth kills. The game also includes a cover system whereby Jack can hide behind a number of objects, move from cover to cover, or even use human shields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
