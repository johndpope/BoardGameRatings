							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catfolk, Ratfolk, and Dhampir Feats</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catfolk, Ratfolk, and Dhampir Feats is our latest Mythic Mini devoted to an assortment of furry and ferocious playable PC races. The catfolk and ratfolk are each cunning, agile, and shifty in their own way, with their animalistic characteristics outside hiding cleverness and courage within. Dhampirs are in some ways the opposite, outwardly human but with the blood of a beast roiling in their veins and a hunger kept barely controlled by their dedication to a life of adventure and heroics. This product contains 13 marvelous mythic feats for your beast-blooded heroes from Blood Feaster and Tunnel Rat to Claw Pounce, Natural Charmer, and Burrowing Teeth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Minis are short, inexpensive products designed to take one rules concept or set of Pathfinder RPG rules and bring them to you in a new way for the mythic rules, including converting existing rules as well as introducing entirely new rule options. Created by the same designers that helped bring you the official mythic rules, Mythic Minis skip the fluff and give you all crunch, all the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows mythic like Legendary Games, and whether it's new mythic feats, class abilities, path abilities, magic items, or anything else, every Mythic Mini delivers a delicious dollop of dazzling design that will fill out your mythic experience one slice at a time. Check for a new Mythic Mini every Monday to make your game just a little more Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
