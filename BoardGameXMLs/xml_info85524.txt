							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MegaTraveller 2: Quest for the Ancients</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vacations never last long for Travellers - we should have known that. Yet here we are on a desperate mission to save a planet from impending doom, battling an armed corsair full of intergalactic pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasma blasts are rocking the hull. Jurgen is evading the barrage as best he can, but we're badly outclassed. Their meson screens are strong and tight, and Dennar is still repairing the jump drive. Effane is manning one of the beam laser turrets, trying to keep pace with our newest team member, a retired Vargr soldier, who despite the canine features, shoots as well as she.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Me? I'm trying to stay calm and think of a way out of this - fast. A mysterious artifact reportedly built by a quasi-mythical race of early starfarers known as the Ancients, has suddenly come to life on the subsector capital of Rhylanor. Now the entire planet faces imminent destruction unless we act in time. The only hope seems to be learning the secrets of the Ancients - which won't be an easy task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancients were destroyed 300,000 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
