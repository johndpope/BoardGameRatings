			<description>A quick playing card game for two where Bigfoot and the clever Cryptozoologist attempt to outwit each other! Will Bigfoot's hideaways be discovered, leaving him with nowhere to go, or will the Cryptozoologist be left frustrated?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new game from up and coming designer Scott Almes is the ultimate battle of wits! Depending on what side you're on, you'll be playing a very different game - The Cryptozoologist is laying traps and attempting to trick the Bigfoot who must deduce and work out what's the best option...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays the Cryptozoologist who is hunting for Bigfoot, played by the other player. Each round, the Cryptozoologist will lay out a series of cards in two &amp;lsquo;paths&amp;rsquo;, which will contain sensing equipment and special actions. Then, Bigfoot must choose which path to go on, triggering any sensing equipment and giving the Cryptozoologist a few more clues about his Lair. The Cryptozoologist wins by pinning Bigfoot in one of his Lairs, while Bigfoot wins by eluding the Cryptozoologist for six rounds. Capturing this beast won't be easy...!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By slowly eliminating the various potential lairs, the Cryptozoologist will slowly whittle down the places where Bigfoot could actually be hiding. However, if this isn't done by the end of the sixth round the beast will escape the clutches of 'science'!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
