			<description>Similar to Battleship, but with more complicated rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player deploys ships in secret on their copy of the mapsheet. Then they try to find all of the enemy ships and destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules allow for simple movement and firing. The advanced rules cover submerging of submarines, reload time, torpedoes, and depth charges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship movement is always announced in terms of direction but not location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two different mapsheets are included.  One for basic play and another for advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
