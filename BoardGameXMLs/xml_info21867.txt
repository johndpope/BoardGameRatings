			<description>A venerable cabal bent on world-domination has sent one of their greatest champions to steal the reactor core... but so have their enemies. Bathed in atomic radiation, these champions fight to the death, in order to claim the sweet, sweet uranium for their people... and victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game of marker-management where each combatant can manipulate their various character ratings (Attack, Defense, Mojo, etc.) each turn while trying to eliminate their opponent's tokens. Tokens can be replenished or stolen from the central pot. The player to eliminate all of his enemies first wins but variable character special abilities, usable on their turns, as well as random mutations can complicate the effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Monkey, Ninja, Pirate, Robot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
