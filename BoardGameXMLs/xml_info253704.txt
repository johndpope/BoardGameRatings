							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nesme &amp; The Tomb of Yurtrus</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword Coast is the home of Waterdeep, the most influential and prominent city of the North of Faerun. Our adventurers are unaware of a plot to overthrow the government and spread chaos throughout all of Faerun. The evildoers are clever, patient, and well-connected. They have a multi-prong attack planned. By forming alliances with unlikely allies, the sides of evil may actually have a chance to pull this off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our story begins with our adventurers in the trade town of Nesme in the Savage Frontier, west of the Sword Coast. They are beckoned to complete a seemingly unrelated mission, but through their ongoing efforts are thrust into this web of destruction. Along the way, our adventurers gain experience, treasures, allies, and of course enemies. Will they be able to discover who's behind this massive plan? More importantly, will they be able to stop it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
