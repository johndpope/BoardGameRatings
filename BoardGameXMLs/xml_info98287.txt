			<description>Game Manual Excerpts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready to go out on the gridiron to test your football skills against your opponent for four grueling quarters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players compete in a football game with six men per team. There are 8 offensive plays and 8 defensive plays with the game contestants able to control their feature running, passing, sweeps, field goals, and punting. Defensive plays feature linebacker blitzing and pass defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The football field will appear on screen going from left to right. The field is 100 yards long and is divided into 10 yard increments. The &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; team is on the left and is controlled by the left hand controller. The &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; team is on the right and is controlled by the right hand controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the playing of the Notre Dame fight song. The time will indicate that there are four minutes (approximately) to go in the quarter and the score is 00 to 00. The teams are now huddled on the field. The first quarter is about to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team with the ball has 30 seconds to select plays one through eight . . . The defense then has about 2 seconds to enter defensive play 1 through 8 if he has not already done so. Play is started by the offense by making a motion on the hand controller. The game has begun. You can now maneuver your players by moving the hand controllers in the direction you want them to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When either team scores, the Wisconsin victory song is played. The score is displayed each time a team scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
