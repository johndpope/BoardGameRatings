			<description>A math domino game for 1-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of a 2-4 player game, each player is dealt six hexagonal crab dominoes. Each crab holds a number between its claws, which must be matched to the equation of another crab. Each crab has a single equation on one of its three hind edges, in which one of the factors is replaced with an empty box, that must be filled with an answer number from another crab. For example, a crab holding the number, 4, could be attached to a crab with the equation, 8x[]=32, on its back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the players have placed their six starting dominoes face up in front of them, the top domino of the draw pile is then placed in the center of the play area, and play begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they first draw a new domino, placing it with the others face up in front of them, and then try to add as many of their dominoes as they can to the line of crabs. Players may also move crabs from the front of the line to the back of the line, and vice-versa, but only if they can immediately add a domino from their hand, to one of the two new positions. If a player can no longer add more dominoes to the line, their turn is over. If a player plays their last domino, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may use the answer wheel to check their math at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with two solitaire variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
