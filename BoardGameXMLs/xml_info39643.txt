			<description>Another simplistic sailing simulation, this one is based on a real event: the sailing competition of the XXI (21st) Olympic Games, Canada 1976. It comes with a huge (58x78cm) board, 6 boats, 3 buoys, 2 dice, a set of sailing cards and a set of advantage cards. Players sail one of the triangle courses as printed on the map; each course is used for a number of boat classes. Start and finish lines are also printed on the board. Wind direction is constant (South), as is the wind force, but some currents are printed on the board that influence the direction sailed. Players roll dice to move, and they need certain die rolls to start the race, change direction or gain sailing or advantage cards. Sailing cards represent difficulties the player must cope with (so they are, in effect, &amp;quot;disadvantage&amp;quot; cards). Special rules apply in the immediate areas around the turn marker buoys. Otherwise, some basic yachting rules, in particular right-of-way rules, must be observed.&lt;br/&gt;The game is completely bi-lingual (English &amp;amp; French, as befits the location) and comes with an &amp;quot;Olympic Information&amp;quot; booklet that explains the sailing events (courses and boat classes) of the XXI Olympic Games as they took place in 1976 in Kingston Bay, Ontario, Canada. This booklet also has a glossary of sailing terms and illustrations of sailing maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
