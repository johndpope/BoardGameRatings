			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, folks, here we are in the thick of the holiday season&amp;mdash;and all of us at Wizards of the Coast wanted to wish gamers and their families worldwide a very happy holiday season and merry New Year. As we all know, every time a crit is rolled, an angel tears off a balor&amp;rsquo;s wings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, we wanted to express our appreciation to our fellow gamers by offering a little holiday treat . . . in the form of a D&amp;amp;D Gamma World scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamma Terra is a strange place&amp;mdash;on that, I believe, we can all agree. In the past, laser-eyed reindeer and a maniacal, robotic Santa have been perpetrated on unsuspecting gamers (by no less than James M. Ward himself). In the spirit of Gamma World and holiday frivolity, we venture to the great northern wastes of Canada, ay?, where you can find a certain workshop&amp;mdash;and duly invade it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We explored Rankin Bass&amp;rsquo;s Island of Misfit Toys several years ago as a D&amp;amp;D-themed encounter. This time, we decided that a Gamma World approach&amp;mdash;and a factory of misfit Omega Tech&amp;mdash;fit the theme even better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the holidays, and it&amp;rsquo;s Gamma World, so have fun with the following&amp;mdash;we hope you enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: This adventure was originally part of Dungeon (Issue 185 - Dec 2010) and is freely available along with maps on the Gamma World portion of the Wizards website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
