			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight with Flair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not just stand there and slug it out with your opponent. Learn to use combat maneuvers! Even if you do not have the feat, you can still try it. You are only going to provoke an attack of opportunity. Hey, didn't that stupid barbarian already use up that dragon's attack of opportunity for the round? You could prevent the dragon from using its breath weapon, or maybe that nasty bite attack. Maybe you want to grapple your opponent, pick him up, and actually throw him into another opponent! In addition, you could pull a rope-a-dope on that charmed friend of yours and then choke or sap him into submission rather than having to kill him. Come and learn at the feet of the Masters of the Arts - learn the Secrets of Martial Mastery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the pages of this tome, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    25+ new combat maneuvers&lt;br/&gt;    25+ new feats&lt;br/&gt;    The Master of the Arts Prestige Class&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
