			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South of Tarlac Keep and across Lake Lowe lies a dormant volcano and its set of caverns. This location is currently the home to the powerful Artillus Highwing a massive Black Dragon. Artillus and his mate were responsible for the destruction of Tarlac at the cost of his partner. Artillus lost most of his army that day and has since moved into the caverns and attempted to rebuild the army to set his revenge upon the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a group of mid-level adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
