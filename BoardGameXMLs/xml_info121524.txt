							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fairground Game</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game published by J S Fry &amp;amp; Sons, a leading manufacturer of chocolate at this time (most famous for the TV adverts for &amp;quot;Fry's Turkish Delight).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic roll and move game, taking ideas from Ludo in some places. Each player has four men and their designated start point. The board track covers various encounters with fairground attractions. When you land on one, you must follow the instructions. If you land on another player's piece, that piece is sent back to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to get all four pices home, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was despatched as a flat-pack, so you had to provide your own playing pieces and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
