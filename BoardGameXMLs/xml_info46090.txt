			<description>The first module in the DragonLance series, an effort that eventually led to the creation and expansion of a key Dungeons and Dragons setting.  This adventure is for six to eight characters of level four to six, and they strongly encourage players to use the included characters.  The module begins by pointing out what is different in Krynn:  Kender, steel instead of gold, no cleric spells and no dragons - at least when things begin.  In this adventure the characters orient themselves to their quest and begin facing off against the draconians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back cover text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You stand on the road east of Solace, tired from five years of adventuring, from a fruitless search for lost clerical magic. You know the old proverb that claims &amp;ldquo;You must return to find what you left to seek,&amp;rdquo; but the saying never really made sense. Soon, however, it will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the world of Krynn is not the same: refugees stream out of the northernmost human lands, telling horrible tales. An invading army has burned their villages and put their families and friends to the sword. Among these stories you hear even darker rumors &amp;mdash; that older evils, the dragons themselves, have returned to the world, for new and more terrible purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dragons of Despair&amp;rdquo; is the first in TSR&amp;rsquo;s new series of DRAGONLANCE&amp;trade; adventures for use with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS&amp;reg; game system. Your players will adventure in the world of Krynn, visit strange places such as Haven or ruined Xak Tsaroth, and encounter the bizarre draconians and spectral minions. They can play the modules as a set of separate adventures or as a great quest that spans the entire DRAGONLANCE&amp;trade; story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Character Levels 4-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
