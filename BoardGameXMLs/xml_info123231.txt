							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">National Park Wit</name>
									
			<description>One of a series of Wit trivia games, National Park Wit has 105 cards with questions about National Parks.  On the back of each card is a different photo from a National Park and a point value from 1-10 and 15.  On the front of each card are three trivia questions and answers, as well as a description of the picture on the back.  In turn, each player is asked a question of the asker's choice from the three on the card.  If he gets the question right, he keeps the card.  If he gets it wrong, all other players in turn (except the question reader) are given a chance.  If all fail, the card is placed in the so-called &amp;quot;stumper&amp;quot; pile.  After all cards have been asked, the stumper pile is revisited.  Then, all players add up their points and he with the highest points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
