							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Merchant House of Amketch</name>
									
			<description>For 4-6 characters of levels 4-7&lt;br/&gt;Two 48-page spiral bound flip books in a card folder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the city of Balic, an insidious new threat to the Tyr region has arisen in the shape of a humble beetle. Magically altered to deliver a psionic malady via their bite, the beetles have been used by templars, slavers, raiders, and worse to neutralize the psionic abilities of their captives and render them docile. In desperation, the Veiled Alliance has called upon your characters to track down the source of the sinister beetles and put an end to them. There's only one problem - the most powerful merchant house of the Tyr region is growing even wealthier from the parasitic trade!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merchant House of Amketch is designed for four to six characters of 4th to 7th levels. Explore the trade routes and intrigues south of the Estuary of the Forked Tongue, in the heart of the Tyr region! Merchant House of Amketch can be played as a stand alone adventure or as the sequel to Black Flames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
