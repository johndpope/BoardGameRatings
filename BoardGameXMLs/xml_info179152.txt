							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Carven</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You were formed long ago by a legendary wizard.  Now your race has come into its own, and some travel the world in search of adventure.  You are one of those travelers.  You hope to gain knowledge, martial skill, and perhaps some magic items to bring back to benefit your people.  You&amp;rsquo;ve also become intensely curious about the natural-born races, so you seek out their friendship along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement allows your players to play a Carven, a wooden race much like robots.  Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A full character class description (including new special abilities), for use with old-school games including LABRYRINTH LORD&lt;br/&gt;    Helpful charts to take your Carven from level 1 to level 10&lt;br/&gt;    Suggestions for incorporating  Carven into your campaign&lt;br/&gt;    Pregenerated characters at first and third level.  Just print and play (or use them as NPC&amp;rsquo;s)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
