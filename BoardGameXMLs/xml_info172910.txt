							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Back Alley</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 8 x 10 inch map of a Back Alley, and includes the VTT (Virtual Table top) files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;So you boys like to party huh? Well your party ends here tonight&amp;rdquo; [Thugs draw their switchblades and holdout pistols]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the fight to the back alleys of the city with our latest freebie! The environment is filled with debris that can be used as improvised weapons or shields. A martial artist might take advantage of the planks and pipes as weapons or toss boxes as feints. A tough guy might throw steel drums, tires, or even the TV or use the steel locker as a shield. A strong super hero might even throw the couch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Alley is a single page map of a debris filled alleyway lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Alley is intended for use in modern, pulp adventure, post-apocalyptic, or super hero games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysterious Donations: A local fraternity, Delta Epsilon Omicron, has stumbled upon a new party drug that a nerdy pledge cooked up for them. They have started selling it in a nearby back street alley behind the frat house. They are trying to make enough money to have the biggest frat party ever and become campus legends. The cash they make is being funneled to the frat house by &amp;ldquo;anonymous&amp;rdquo; donors. A local gang of drug dealers have taken notice of their recent drug sales and are not happy about them taking money out of their pockets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drug dealers have contacted the frat posing as college kids and set up a meeting to buy drugs from them tonight. The gang is actually going to wax them to get rid of the competition instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can be detectives or police officers who have become aware of the drug sales and are staking out the area that night in a sting operation to observe the sale and bust the frat boys and drug dealers. When the thugs come in to buy drugs and they start firing instead, they have to leap into action to save the frat kids if they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One twist is that the drug is actual a revenge cooked up by the nerdy pledge tired of hazing and bullying. Those who use the drug are driven to euphoria, but over time the drug starts to physically change its users into ugly monsters with each new dose. The frat boys turn into abominations in this case and rip the thugs apart. The Player Characters rush to save them, only to find themselves going up against hideous, muscle-bound creatures that barely react to pain despite bullet holes in them from the thugs. Another twist is that the Player Characters are actually super heroes who use the detective or police officer occupations as masks for their real identities and can fight this threat directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
