			<description>Intryga 13th Street (The Intrigue of 13th Street) is a board game for 3-4 players aged 12+. The average time of play - about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the role of one of the characters, which are: Kenneth Carter (Councillor), Kathlyn O'Brien (Detective), Gareth Newberry (Attorney), Emily Winfield (Technology) - in the past they were embroiled in an unsolved investigation. The goal is to reach the farthest field on the bonus track by discovering evidence of crime in investigations of other characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was realized as a giveaway for Hallmark Channel. As the execution time was frantically short (competitive companies abandoned the topic), Kuźnia Gier has decided to alterate and adaptate one of its earlier criminal games - Inwigilacja. The game was well received by the customer, as evidenced by the second printing of the game in the second half of the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
