							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saint Fiacre</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saint Fiacre is a village with a turbulent past and an uncertain future. Having weathered sahuagin raids and economic woes, the village struggles to grow and prosperity eludes its citizens. With its saintly patron now long dead, its economy is in decline and few travel to the village. On the surface, Saint Fiace rseems a relatively peaceful village, but several looming&amp;mdash;and as yet unrecognised&amp;mdash;threats lurk in the shadows. In short, Saint Fiarce is a village on the brink of disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
