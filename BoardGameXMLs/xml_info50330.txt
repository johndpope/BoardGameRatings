							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Aeons: The Atlantean Chronicles</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Aeons: The Atlantean Chronicles is a Lovecraftian roleplaying game set in a world of dark secrets and ancient legacies. In this dark reflection of our own world, it is the descendants of the survivors of Lost Atlantis that rule from the shadows, and ancient immortals still roam the earth, walking in shadow and light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this world, the creatures of the night roam the streets thirsting for the blood of the living; the dead return from the grave in the bodies of the hopeless in order to live out the lives that death&amp;rsquo;s cruel embrace denied them.   In this world, Sorcerers and Psychics are real; some trying to free from the world from the horrors of the Mirror World and the Abyss, while others are attempting to usher in a new dark age where humanity lives truly at the whims of demonic entities and the Old Ones.  &lt;br/&gt; In this world, the powers of the Faithful give hope to a dark world, while the Mundanes  attempt to live out their lives struggling from day to day to survive in a world that seems  out to get them. &lt;br/&gt; The Center Stage Game System is a diceless role-playing game system that has been designed to allow Actors to portray their Persona in both tabletop and live-action modes of play. The system requires a regular deck of playing cards that included the Jack, Queen, King and Jokers for conflict resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
