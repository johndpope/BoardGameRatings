							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ring of Destruction: Slammasters II</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Ring of Destruction - Slam Masters II, released in Japan as Super Muscle Bomber - The International Blowout, is a sequel to Slam Masters released exclusively for the arcades as a CPS-2 game. The game's format was changed to play like a traditional one-on-one 2D fighting game (similar to Street Fighter II), with the action restricted to one plane. The game's configuration was changed to a five-button setup (two punch buttons, two kick buttons and a grappling button). The objective of each match is to deplete the opponent's life bar in two out of three rounds. It is no longer necessary for the player to pin their opponent to win a match, although all the other moves have been retained.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Saturday_Night_Slam_Masters,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
