			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenes of Chance is a storytelling tool.  Whether you need a quick, on-the-fly scene, or simply inspiration for the story you're trying to tell, Scenes of Chance is perfect for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each massive, 3.5&amp;quot; x 5.75&amp;quot; card depicts a gorgeous, illustrated scene.  On every card are at least three icons, each representing 20 possibilities. If you're adventure is in a forest, try taking all of the forest scenes, shuffle them, and draw one at random. Fate chooses the three elements depicted in the Scene.&lt;br/&gt;    Players look at the card, viewing the beautiful scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scene contains three icons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The DM rolls three 20 sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;    Three elements of the scene are revealed to the DM.&lt;br/&gt;    The story is created, the DM reveals it for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenes of Chance is a collaboration between Twizz Entertainment and Tabletop Props.  The result is a unique take on storytelling; 48 cards, over a billion possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This deck consists of 48 giant cards in a custom tuck box. We are starting small to gage interest in this project but the possibilities for growth and expansion are endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
