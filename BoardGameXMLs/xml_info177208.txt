							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road of the Dead (Collector&#039;s Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expanded, reorganised edition of Road of the Dead features a better layout to enhance your gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, the Tuath were a mighty folk who strove against the goblins of the Tangled Wood for dominion over that ancient place. Defeated by treachery and their feral, warlike enemies the Tuath&amp;rsquo;s civilisation was thrown down. Their settlements were sacked, their places of strength broken open and their holy places despoiled; the few survivors melted away into the trackless gloom of the deep forest leaving behind nothing but remnants of their once-great culture. The Road of the Dead, a ceremonial pathway representing a soul&amp;rsquo;s journey to the underworld, is one such fragment that yet lingers in the Tangled Wood awaiting the brave or the foolhardy. A cunningly designed death-trap, it hides the forgotten treasures and legends of a fallen people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
