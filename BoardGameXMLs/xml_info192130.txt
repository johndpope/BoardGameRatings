			<description>Somewhere in the world there lives a blue-haired monster who has had enough of scaring people and hearing their teeth chatter every time they see him. That is why we sometimes can't find the cloths we are certain that we put at the right place the day before. Can you remember what you have in your wardrobe? You can find out in this game! A tricky memory game with big and small and cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common goal memory game. A card with several clothes is revealed. After memorizing it the players look at their own cards, and decide if they were represented on the common cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
