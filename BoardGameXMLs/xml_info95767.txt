			<description>While called Chessyball, the game really has little to do with chess, it is more a soccer game. The game plays on an 11 x 18 board, and each team has 10 players and one goaltender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move as Queens in chess, i.e., moving as far as they want in a straight line, or until reaching the outer edge, or another piece. When stopping by the ball, the ball shoots in the direction away from the moved piece, until it hits another player, or wall. The idea is to maneuver the ball for a goal, a three square wide area on a player's home side. Player one gets one initial move, player two gets two and then each player had 3 moves a turn. There are some additional advanced moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
