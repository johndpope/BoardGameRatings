							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Order of Vampire Hunters: Eten Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for The Order of Vampire Hunters can be added to any Hunt and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Highly Detailed Plastic Miniature.&lt;br/&gt;1 Vampire ID Card.&lt;br/&gt;10 Elder Influence Cards.&lt;br/&gt;1 Rule Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nete was a white witch, healing with herbs and bringing villagers together with love potions. Every formula was carefully recorded in her Book of Life. She lived just outside the hamlet, near the graveyard. She could easily harvest her ingredients in the fields and woodlands and at night, she secretly tended the graves, keeping them clean and beautiful. Especially that of her dead husband, who passed too young at 18.&lt;br/&gt;The villagers were no fools. They accepted her broken-hearted obsession and knew her spells were just quackery. Back then, people took care of their own. Still, sometimes the herbs helped with toothache and someone had to tend the graves. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t all charity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Night swept through, she was the first to be turned.&lt;br/&gt;The boiling corruption coursing through her body has inverted Nete. Now a powerful Elder with the full power of Influence, Eten reads backwards from her Book of Blood as she repels and harms Hunters in her vicinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
