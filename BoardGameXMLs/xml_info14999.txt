							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Collectable Monsters!</name>
									
			<description>Despite the game's title, probably not a Collectible Card Game.  Cards are labeled with numbers from 1 to 5.  For each number N, there are N different monsters with that number on them.  Players take turns playing cards to their personal tableau of monsters; at the end of the game, players score points for each monster they have played, but the value of a monster is diminished if you have played other monsters with the same number but different species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
