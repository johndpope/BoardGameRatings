			<description>Take a Penny is played over a series of rounds in which players will secretly choose 1 of 8 actions from the their action card. After all players have made their selections, everyone will reveal their chosen action simultaneously and proceed to resolve them in order.  Players cannot take the same action in consecutive rounds which adds to the strategic decision making required to out think their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can take two from the pot or only one and block others from taking any but you leave yourself open to others that might take from you.  Fake out everyone by returning one to the pot and on the next round by taking two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is decided once all of the pennies have been taken from the pot.  Whoever has the most without being tied wins unless one player manages to shoot the moon and give away all of theirs.`&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a Penny is a small, fit in your pocket, microgame consisting of 4 square action cards and 4 square bank cards as well as 15 penny tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
