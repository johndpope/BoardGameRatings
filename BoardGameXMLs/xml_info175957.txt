Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A murder was committed during the time of the American Mafia. Daniel, a man convicted of the murder crime is not at all concerned with the reasons or events that imprisoned him. He is out for the one who framed him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
