			<description>Scrum is a pure abstract board game that roughly remind Rugby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a number of pieces that remain for the whole game (there is no capture). In addition, a special piece, the ball, is present on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to bring the ball to the last row. Typically each player move consists of 2 player pieces movement. However, in special occasions, when the ball is surrounded by player pieces so that there only one exit cell, the player is only allowed one movement which consists of pushing the ball to this exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if the rules are very simple (one minute is generally enough to understand how to play), it is tactically and strategically deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Jocly (turn-based, live play or play against the computer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
