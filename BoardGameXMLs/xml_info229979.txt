			<description>Round 1: First Strike&lt;br/&gt;Round 2: Last Stand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for 13th Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;Scaled for 11th to 16th Levels of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all comes down to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conspiracy has been building for years against the powers that be in Stormreach. Started at the mercantile level as a way of ensuring fair trade and open exploration of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik, this conspiracy was founded and continues to be led by a group of powerful businessmen and leaders from many of the dragonmarked houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group calls itself the Table, a small conclave of wealthy nobles and warlords interested in keeping Stormreach from becoming an independent state that could lock the emerald continent&amp;rsquo;s only good port away from use by the Five Kingdoms. Their aim is to ensure that no haven exists in Xen&amp;rsquo;drik for those who would use such a closed harbor as a safe place to foment rebellion against the Five Kingdoms and the fragile peace of the Thronehold Accord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
