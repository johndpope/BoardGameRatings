			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Shady Dragon Inn is a set of pregenerated characters for use with the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS game. This player's aid comes in two parts: each character appears first in a section devoted to his or her character class. They appear again in the second section as members of a party. As a DM or as a player, you may use either or both sections; over a hundred characters await you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has a brief biography that will help you to create backgrounds for PCs or NPCs as needed. Also included is a rough physical description, and a list of items owned by each character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shady Dragon Inn also contains the D&amp;amp;D game statistics for those special characters who are presented by figures in the D&amp;amp;D and AD&amp;amp;D toy line, a provides a tavern setting from which players may start adventures or gather party members.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
