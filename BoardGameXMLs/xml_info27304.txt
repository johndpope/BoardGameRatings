			<description>The game of SUBSTITUTE GOLF is comprised of 9 beautifully lithographed Boards (10&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot;) representing the 9 holes of the indoor course. 7 disks representing Driver, Brassie, Cleek, Mid-Iron, Mashie, Niblick and Putter, 2 spinning blocks, 4 ball markers and Score Pads. Spinning those 7 disks give results as to the distance and direction that the ball has gone. Using the putter disk then decides if the putt has gone into the hole. The directions include ways for 8 or as many as 16 players to compete in a tournament with the winner getting some kind of prize that the host provides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
