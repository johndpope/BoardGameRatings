			<description>Time Crisis is a video game initially available in arcades  and later released for the PlayStation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Crisis is a three-dimensional first person rail shooter similar to Virtua Cop and The House of the Dead, in which the player holds a light gun and goes through the motions of firing at on-screen enemies. There are three stages, each consisting of three areas and a boss fight. Unique features are described herein:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A foot pedal which performs multiple functions: when the pedal is released, the player takes cover to conserve hit points whilst reloading the gun. While the pedal is released, the player cannot attack. In console conversions, a button command replicates the foot pedal's functions.&lt;br/&gt;    * A light gun (introduced in Point Blank) which utilized a special memory chip to synchronize areas of the screen's image as the player rotates the gun around. The light gun also features a blowback function which simulates real-life gun recoil.&lt;br/&gt;    * A countdown timer, recharged by clearing an area of enemies, as running down the clock causes an instant game over, the player must take risks, shooting enemies rapidly and hiding only when necessary. A time extension is rewarded when an area is passed. There are also time bonuses awarded for shooting certain enemies quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Time Crisis,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
