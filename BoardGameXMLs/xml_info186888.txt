							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paradox Advanced Rulebook (Faight Industries)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Rulebook handles all the rules that you may need from time to time.  From Optional Rules like Radiation and Diseases, to standard formula for developing Androids, Robots and Cybernetic Organisms (ARCOs); the advanced rulebook is there to help you with the technical specifications of your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Attributes, Race, Boons and Banes, Class, Skills, and Resources.  These statistics are intended to be subordinated to the Character Concept.  To ensure the build matches the concept, several point pools are provided and the process of allocation follows a priority system.  Attributes are grouped into Physics, Mental, and Spiritual categories, each having Stature, Might, Endurance, Reflexes, Dexterity, and Affinity.  Numerous Secondary Attributes also are derived.  The rules support several races, and present a list of Boons and Banes (advantages and disadvantages).  Characters also select a Profession (class) and then allocate Skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
