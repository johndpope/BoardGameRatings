			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Limit Yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's part of what you sign up for with a point-based game like GURPS, but nobody likes to be forced to omit part of a nifty character concept because they lacked the budget to buy what they had in mind. Fortunately, there are ways around this (besides cheating!): limitations. By adding some fitting drawbacks to your cool abilities, you can power up your character on the cheap and make the game more interesting for everyone -- you start play with a few new challenges to meet, while the GM gets some &amp;quot;hooks&amp;quot; to exploit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Power-Ups 8: Limitations is a collection of all the general limitations introduced since the GURPS Basic Set (over 45 of them!), plus:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Additional details on several limitations from the Basic Set -- and on concepts such as applying limitations to disadvantages.&lt;br/&gt;     Tips for getting the most out of existing limitations and fairly pricing new ones.&lt;br/&gt;     Tricks like either/or limitations, partly limited abilities, and going past the -80% cap.&lt;br/&gt;     Other cost-cutting measures: alternative abilities, potential advantages, internal advantages, and character point-powered abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you always find yourself a few points short or just like the game-within-a-game of building funky abilities, GURPS Power-Ups 8: Limitations offers all kinds of new ways to stretch your budget and do more with less!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
