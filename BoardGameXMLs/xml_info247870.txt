			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawkanoid is a new take on the classic Breakout game.  The ball travels incredibly fast until it reaches the base of the screen, at which point the game shifts to bullet time and you have a few seconds to draw a line that bounces the ball back up.  Levels are randomly generated, but you can purchase permanent upgrades to customize the way you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just look at it. Look how pretty it is. Look how crazy fast that goes. Look, that's bullet time JUST TO HIT THE BALL! You want to make cool explosions. You need to hit combos. You want ludicrous powerups. Of course you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smash things at hyperspeed in Drawkanoid, a re-imagining of the classic brick-breaking genre. Draw your paddle to bounce blindly fast balls exactly where you want them. There's bullet time to help you out, but the game gets faster as you get better. Upgrade your ship and deploy powerups strategically to help you survive and score huge combos in the blink of an eye.&lt;br/&gt;Last brick syndrome is dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
