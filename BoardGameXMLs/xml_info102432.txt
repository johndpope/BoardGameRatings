			<description>Fancy Pants Adventures is a series of free side-scrolling Flash games created by Brad Borne. Two worlds have been released so far, World 1 on 14 March 2006 and World 2 on 9 January 2008. Borne had announced that after the 2009 Comic Con, he would officially start working on World 3. A console version developed by Borne and Over the Top Games was released by EA 2D for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on April 19 and April 20, 2011, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fancy Pants Adventures features Fancy Pants Man as the playable character of the series. He is a two dimensional stick figure with spiky, choppy hair, wearing only a pair of triangular-shaped pants. (original pants' colour is orange). Fancy Pants Man's home is Squiggleville, a small country town run by the Mayor (first introduced in World 2). Players guide Fancy Pants Man through open levels which feature obstacles to overcome and enemies to avoid or defeat. These enemies include spiders, snails, and mice armed with guns. Enemies can be defeated by being jumped upon and crushed by Fancy Pants Man, who can also launch off them to perform an augmented leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Fancy Pants Adventures&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
