			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mike &amp;amp; Joe&amp;rsquo;s Card Game is a fast-paced challenge for 2-6 players that combines THREE GAMES into one madcap session. The object of the game is to be the first player to gather seven cards of the same color, red, green or blue. Cards are accumulated through victories in any of the three games, Patter, Peril or Pointz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each turn, players submit their Player Cards, face-down. Then the current player flips over the top card of the Draw Deck, the House Card, revealing the game for that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the game is Patter, the current player has but a few seconds, counted down by their opponents, to create a word from the letters on the revealed cards. They win the cards from whatever word they make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the game is Peril, the current player pits the Battle Icon on their Player Card against the icon on their opponent's card. If more than one opponent challenges, the player conducts Semifinals until only one challenger remains. The winner receives the Peril Prize, either two or three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they game is Pointz, the current player uses their finger to move along the board game squares on the bottom of the Player Cards. If they land on a pointing challenge, they have but a few seconds, again counted down by opponents, to point at the indicated item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to gather seven cards of the same color in their bank wins the game and is held in awe by the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
