			<description>The realm of Westarland is in turmoil. In the wake collapse of the Permon empire, the power vacuum has left nations scrambling to exert local control. Some previously minor kings now aspire to the dragon-skull throne of Westarland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Avondell is embroiled in all this political confusion. The King and his council of advisors, based in Blackstone Castle, are struggling to establish secure borders with the neighboring kingdoms of Hanshore, Magdar, and Grambling. To that end, the king employs emissaries, scouts, captains, and even spies to carry out his political machinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview and Objective of the King&amp;rsquo;s Quest Game&lt;br/&gt;You play as a courtier in the King&amp;rsquo;s court manipulating vassals to carry out the King&amp;rsquo;s political goals. Take actions to increase your influence with various knights and wizards in the court who can help you carry out the King&amp;rsquo;s political goals. Even gain influence with the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your knights and wizards to shift, swap, flip, retain, and guard vassal cards on the board.  Ultimately, you must complete three of the King&amp;rsquo;s political machination goals to gain favor with the King and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
