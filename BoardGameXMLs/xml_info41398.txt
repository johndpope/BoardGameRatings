			<description>Box blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;ADVENTURE GAME STARTER SETS are a complete introduction to the hobby of Fantasy Adventure Gaming, all in one box.  Each ADVENTURE GAME STARTER SET contains ten paintable plastic action figures in the standard 25mm size, a set of non-toxic water-based paints with instructions and brush, and a complete set of fast, playable rules for playing out your own fantasy adventures.  Even the gaming die is included. (For two or more players, ages 10 and up).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four were published:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wizard's Bane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cleric's Quest - &amp;quot;the adventures of a young cleric (holy man or woman) as he (or she) dons armor and weapons to fulfill a holy quest - a journey which brings him (or her) into combat with animated Skeletons, a pair of Hell hounds, a female Demon, and a fearsome Devil.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fighter's Fury - &amp;quot;the adventures of a young knight and his friend as they do battle with Goblins, foul Orcs, a huge Troll, and an evil Baron in a quest to avenge the death of the young knight's father.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woman Warrior - &amp;quot;the adventures of a young woman warrior and her friend as they do battle with Bandits, Kobolds (small fierce dog like creatures), giant Bugbears, and a huge fearsome Ogre, in a quest for treasure and glory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each contains two leaflets, one containing the rules and adventure; the other, a painting guide for the miniatures.  Though each game has a unique background story and series of encounters, the rules of play are identical.  On the last page of the rules leaflet is a promotion for Heritage's soon-to-be-released (at that time) RPG, Swordbearer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of running two characters through a series of four encounters (combats).  Each side in a combat takes turns.  During a turn, all characters on the active side fight, then all characters on the active side may use magic, pick up or throw things, or run away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting is resolved by cross-indexing the roll of a six-sided die with the letter code of the attacker's weapon (A, B, C or D) on a table corresponding to the defender's armor (which may be light, medium, or heavy) in order to find how much damage, if any, was done to the defender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniatures aren't necessary to play, and aren't even mentioned in the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
