							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perilous Oozes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s Always Room for More Oozes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slimes, jellies, and oozes make for exciting and terrifying monsters, simultaneously strange and alien, with their viscous and gelatinous anatomy, and familiar, at least to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever had a bowl of pudding. Sadly, as fun as oozes are, they&amp;rsquo;re in relatively short supply: in the first four Pathfinder Bestiaries, there are only 25 total oozes, and only five with a CR higher than 10. This book presents a selection of five exciting new oozes, ranging from CR 4 to 20. Inside, you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The black bubbler, a CR 20 Gargantuan ooze that can release a variety of noxious bubbles that produce supernatural effects.&lt;br/&gt;    The dancing death, a CR 8 Huge ooze whose spasmodic quivering causes it to act seemingly at random, and which becomes even more powerful when it splits in two.&lt;br/&gt;    The murder mud, a CR 4 Large ooze that can harden itself to a more solid consistency, or transmute those it grapples into statues.&lt;br/&gt;    The ocean gel, a CR 16 Colossal ooze which is truly massive, well beyond the size of most Colossal creatures, and can create deadly vortexes within its body.&lt;br/&gt;    The possession ooze, a CR 12 Medium ooze which is not only intelligent, it can dive inside the bodies of other creatures and control them from the inside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
