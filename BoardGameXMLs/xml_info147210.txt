			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; IN BETA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is in Beta and has not been fully released yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Opulencia, looting is what makes the world go round. If you&amp;rsquo;re not spending your every waking moment obsessed with the size of your treasure pile, then your neighbors will think something&amp;rsquo;s very wrong with you. At the center of every castle lies its crowning jewel, the overflowing treasure room. This room, and its juicy treasure-filled innards, is the stuff that hero&amp;rsquo;s dreams are made of. Reaching this prize won&amp;rsquo;t be easy, though, as each castle&amp;rsquo;s dangers will put your hero&amp;rsquo;s full abilities to the test!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily, he or she is more than up to the looting challenge at hand. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re the type who&amp;rsquo;d rather pick off your opponents from the relaxed comfort of across the room, or like being up close to see the whites (or in some cases, greens) of your enemies&amp;rsquo; eyes, there&amp;rsquo;s a hero and play style just for you. Your capable mouse-clicking, combined with your hero&amp;rsquo;s arsenal of deadly spells, weapons and powers, should let you loot those treasure rooms faster than you can say &amp;lsquo;golden palace&amp;rsquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 500 individual pieces of loot to collect, hundreds of community created castles and more being added every day, you can be sure that there&amp;rsquo;ll always be plenty more epic loot where that came from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your enemies lie weeping in the corner in the face of your superlative looting skills? Now&amp;rsquo;s the perfect time to try your hand at constructing a sadistic gauntlet of doom to call your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start by creating the perfect castle layout, using the tons of available room combinations (it&amp;rsquo;s a lot, we did the math).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to fill your new creation with hordes of loyal minions, ranging from fuzzy baby spiders to kill-crazy giant Cyclopses (or is it Cyclopi?). Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to liberally apply a healthy dose of devious traps to achieve that extra layer of deadliness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got your castle exactly the way you want it, it&amp;rsquo;ll be time to subject the community to your new ingenious creation. The more heroes fall within your castle&amp;rsquo;s walls, the more you&amp;rsquo;ll see your rewards piling up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, a house is not a home until it can kill intruders in at least 7 different ways simultaneously!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
