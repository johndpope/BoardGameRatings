			<description>Welcome to planet Dubious, home of the Dubious Blobs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most sacred currency here is ice cream and it is your job to hold onto yours whilst making your opponent lose theirs in this brand new card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is made up of 54 cards and can be played by both small kids and big kids alike; there really is no age limit when it comes to playing and there is also no limit of players that can join in depending on how many decks you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple to understand and the game is very colorful and lighthearted; the main objective of it is for the player to enjoy themselves (or become glorious overlord of all the ice creams if you so prefer.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play either attacks or defense once per turn. Some attacks steal ice cream, some destroy ice cream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to win the game by either removing, through destruction or theft the ice cream of the opponent, or they can achieve the highest honor of collecting all twenty ice cream, for maximum bragging rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
