							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadowrun Supplemental  (Issue 3 - 1997)</name>
									
			<description>From the Editors Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the third issue of The Shadowrun Supplemental. I would like to thank everyone who has read the first two issues, and hopefully say hi to some new readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue continues with the column-less theme, but now has text boxes for variety and emphasis. This issue is also table heavy, this may create some new formatting problems. If you use a Mac, Linux, or another unix variant, please let me know if it displays well, poorly, or at all. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had good luck getting the RTF to work under WordPerfect7.. If it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t display properly, there&amp;rsquo;s always the PDF and plain text versions. How typical. &amp;lsquo;Linux&amp;rsquo; is not in MS Word&amp;rsquo;s built in dictionary. Wonder why? : )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two new fonts this issue, Ogilive, which I stole without remorse from Gurth&amp;rsquo;s Kaboom! game. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit on the weird side, but I like it. If you can&amp;rsquo;t read the authors email address&amp;rsquo;s in that font, I have included them in the credits, on the last page, with the authors names. The other is &amp;lsquo;Decker&amp;rsquo;, which will be used for all the decker comments from now on. I think this will be the last issue that I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding new fonts, at least for awhile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the Big Big news this issue is that FASA wrote me into the upcoming Target:UCAS sourcebook! :) I&amp;rsquo;m Fro &amp;lsquo;Leading by example&amp;rsquo;. No royalties, but I&amp;rsquo;m still floating on cloud nine over this. Go buy Target:UCAS today! (If its out when you read this.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also apologize for this issue being a bit late - final exams times at my school, so I had to take a bit of time for studying and the like. Then, I just got lazy.. Oh, and I&amp;rsquo;ve lost access to the scanner : (&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
