							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crush the Castle Players Pack</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crush the Castle Players Pack contains hundreds of new levels made by fans for fans. Basically the same game as it's predecessor, but every level contains a fan build castle making the game both harder and an entirely new experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always the player operates a trebuchet with which he fires all sorts of ammunition towards the enemy castle. In the enemy castle is the king and some other folks, soldiers etc. As the walls come down, they crush the inhabitant, which is the goal of each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also present is a level builder to build your own castles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
