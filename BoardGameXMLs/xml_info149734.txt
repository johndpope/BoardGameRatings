			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime Lab: Case Of The Missing Masterpiece is a very short, shareware, single player game focussed on the forensic procedure of blood typing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Acme Art Gallery was burgled on April 1st, 1988 and the thief made off with a valuable painting, hence the title. In their escape they cut themselves, hence the game's subtitle 'An Exercise In Bloodtyping'. As a crime lab technician the player's job is to analyse a blood sample. After quite a few detailed screens explaining the principles of the science behind this process the player prepares two reference samples and a sample taken from the crime scene. Based on the results of their analysis they then choose from a suspect list whose blood types are known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is keyboard controlled, has no sound and can be replayed because the culprit changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
