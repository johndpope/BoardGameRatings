			<description>Hercules Cluster is simple, multi-player, designed specifically for postal play, including as one of the characteristics a low number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents a sector of the galaxy which is peopled by six distinct races each of which has developed its own form of space travel.  Each race has already spread across three star systems and is currently poised to continue its expansion into the remaining neutral systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is simultaneous and hidden.  A [referee] is needed to run the game.  Each turn players will receive reports on the occupants of any hex in which the player has units or systems.  Builds of new units are ordered at the same time as moves, but occur before moves.  Units may be used on the same turn they are built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a hex-shaped grid of offset squares, measuring 13 x 13 at the widest and tallest.  Players start around the edge of the board with vacant/neutral systems concentrated in the center, forcing play to proceed inward and leading rapidly to conflict.  The initial setup is known to all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player wins by gaining control of a majority of neutral systems.  However, each game has an unknown, randomly determined turn limit (13 - 17) which usually occurs before complete player victory - the leading player at the end of the last turn is declared the winner; ties are possible.  Each turn provides a number of points for unit building based upon the number of systems under control.  The game presents a wide variety of unit types, selectable by the owning player and limited by cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed for short-duration postal play (play-by-mail) and requires a referee to execute the programmed player turns.  Hercules Cluster was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 78 - Aug 1981).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
