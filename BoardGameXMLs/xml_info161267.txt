			<description>From the first page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Myth Nantar is the center of the sea elves' society. Although it once rested entirely beneath the waves of the Sea of Fallen Stars, the changes wrought by the Spellplague exposed Myth Nantar's upper levels to the air. Now the sea elves and the surface races mingle and trade freely here, protected from their enemies by ancient elven high magic. Thanks to the mythal, the citizens of Myth Nantar need not fear the threat of the Abolethic Sovereignty. Or so they believe. A two-round continuous-play Living Forgotten Realms Battle Interactive for characters of the Heroic and Paragon tiers (levels 1-20, but all characters must be of the same tier and able to play at the chosen Adventure Level).&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is combat-intensive, and the combat encounters are more difficult than those in a typical LFR adventure. You will need good resource management, strong teamwork, and a bit of luck to succeed. It is recommended, but not required, that at least three of the characters at the table be members of the same Adventuring Company. This adventure takes place after (and is directly caused by) the events of SPEC4-1 Cerulean Dreams and SPEC4-2 The Writhing Obelisk, but play of the prior adventures is not required or assumed.&lt;br/&gt;The encounters in this adventure are designed to be played using the poster maps that are included with the print products The Book of Vile Darkness and Haunted Temples from Wizards of the Coast. We believe that you will enjoy the adventure more if you use the poster maps, but they are optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
