			<description>There are two sets of cards, one with a question and one with an answer.  One player picks up a question card and reads it to the player on their left.  The player on the left picks up an answer card and reads it out loud.  All the other players, including the questioner, burst into laughter trying to make the player reading the answer to laugh.  If that player does not laugh or smile, the questioner takes another question card and reads it to the same person repeating the same answer as to the first question.  If the player answering the questioner succeeds in keeping a straight face on four cards (giving the same answer for each card) that player keeps their answer card.  The same questioner then asks the second player on their left another four questions, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player laughs or smiles while being questioned, they forfeit their card and now they take up a question card and become the questioner.  The game continues until all of the answer slips are gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player having the greatest number of answer slips in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
