							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Of Dungeons Deep! (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Of Dungeons Deep (Second Edition) is a vastly expanded version of the original game. It now play 1-4 players and consists of numerous Heroes and Henchmen to choose from to delve in the dungeon below. Here are some game highlights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2)Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3)Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4)No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
