			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Neveredge Falls the characters come across an obstacle in the form of a majestic waterfall. As wanderers and adventurers, the PCs will frequently be traveling, so this kind of obstacle should be common. Often, the pressure to complete or continue the main thrust of the campaign means that, when the players set out on these journeys, time passes and they &amp;quot;just arrive&amp;quot; after some bookkeeping by the DM. Critical Hits are designed to fill these moments with opportunities for exciting roleplaying and to force the players to take nothing in the campaign world for granted. In Neveredge Falls, we have kept the descriptions of location and place names to a minimum so that the encounter will fit easily into almost any campaign. Feel free to change any details that don't fit your world. The only really important aspect of the encounter is that the PCs have come to a gigantic waterfall, so all your game world needs is a large river and some high ground! The ridge should extend several hundred miles, to ensure the players don't just opt to go round. If your characters are being chased or hunted, the encounter takes on an added urgency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
