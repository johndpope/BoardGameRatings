			<description>From game box:  H&amp;auml;gar the Horrible's Glog Game introduces players to H&amp;auml;gar's lifestyle, a constant battle to keep Helga from confiscating his drink supplies.&lt;br/&gt;H&amp;auml;gar the Horrible is a hard working barbarian businessman-he's in sacking and looting.  He has a typical Viking's hard life of drinking and working-plundering cities and drinking the proceeds.  His wife Helga has a 24 hour-a-day job trying to civilize H&amp;auml;gar!  Stopping him spending all his time drinking or gambling with the boys.&lt;br/&gt;H&amp;auml;gar the Horrible's Glog game can be played by 2 to 8 players individually or 4 to 8 players in 2 teams.&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 8 pawns (2 of each color), 1 gameboard, 1 die, glog (money) counters, and 100 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
