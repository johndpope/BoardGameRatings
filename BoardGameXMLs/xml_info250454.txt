			<description>Critical Limit is a high stakes skydiving game. In this head to head game of chicken, its a race to the ground, but you'll need to push it to your limit to beat the others. Risk it all in hopes of guaranteeing victory, or hope that slow and steady wins the race. Use your experience to customize your character and be the first to become the skydiving master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will simultaneously reveal what position they will fall in. Will you perform a dive for high points? Be careful, if you focus on the ground you may crack under the pressure. Will you fall in style to impress on-lookers? Or have you already cracked and started Boxing to slow yourself down?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After players positions have been revealed they will now simultaneously reveal at which velocity they will fall. High Speeds bring great reward and high risk, where slower speeds will dampen your risk, but bring in less reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all velocity choices have been revealed roll the corresponding dice starting with those who chose to move at the slowest velocities. All players who chose the same velocities will share in the same roll, but how they mitigate the roll may be different based on which positions they decided to fall in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect the most points by increasing your risk, but be careful, if you don't deploy your parachute in time, you may lose it all. Earn EXP points based on what place you came in and customize your character. Then get ready for the next race. The first to master all positions will become the Skydiving Master and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
