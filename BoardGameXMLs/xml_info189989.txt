			<description>One Arm Bandit is based on the concept of a slot machine. Players pay a silver dollar for the privilege of selecting a red, yellow, or blue tile which they hope will complete a combination that pays off according to the House Odds chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After cashing in a winning combination, a player selects three new tiles and continues the search for another combination. If a player runs out of cash before putting together a winning combination, he pans out and is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain combinations with Jackpot tiles are more valuable than others, earning the holder additional silver dollars from the Bar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
