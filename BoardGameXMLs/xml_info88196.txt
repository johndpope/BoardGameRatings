			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gloire: Swashbuckling Adventure in the Age of Kings is a new and complete adventure miniatures game based on the proven mechanics of the .45 Adventure pulp-style rules. Gloire is swashbuckling adventure, like the stories of the Three Musketeers, Dr. Syn and the Scarecrow, and Scaramouche. Players can control master swordsmen, nobles of the court, highwaymen, military heroes, spies... in all more than two dozen character profiles are included in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes care to capture the elegant artistry of the swordfight, while retaining fast play that keeps players involved. But the game is more than combat! The emphasis on scenarios and encounters found in .45 Adventure is retained in Gloire, making games stories of their own rather than mere brawls. Special rules for dueling provide players with an opportunity to satisfy their honor with worthy foes during the course of a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gloire scenario The Waylaid Messenger won a coveted Battle Streamer at Historicon 2006, and is included in the rulebook, along with two other scenarios designed to get players involved in the game right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
