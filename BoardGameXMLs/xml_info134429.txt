			<description>This game is intended for children to teach them endangered plant and animal species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a spinner in the middle of the game board and boxes  representing different species on the edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player spins the arrow and draws a card. If the arrow points either the animal or the habitat, or the threat with other cards player has, he keeps the card and plays it in front of him. If the player is mistaken for a complete series, it must discard all cards of this series! &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who has got the most cards if the deck is exhausted..&lt;br/&gt;Many other variants are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
