			<description>The game consists of a large number of cards, some are syllable cards with one, two or three letters on it.  The rest of the cards have a single letter, which are also marked with a points value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single letters are displayed alphabetically.  The syllable cards are shuffled and one turned over as the starting piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes it in turn to add a single letter to the word, to make a longer word.  Each player scores the value of the letter card they added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game finishes when no one can add a letter to make a word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
