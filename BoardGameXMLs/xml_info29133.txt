			<description>Jackson's Foot Cavalry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will a block game with point to point movement covering Stonewall Jackson's classic 1862 Valley Campaign. The game system will be using our Forged in Fire rules with adjustments for the situation facing both Union and Confederate commanders in the Shenandoah Valley. Supply and surprise will be critical as Jackson races up and down the Valley fighting one Union force after another as the Union try to trap the Confederates. The game will include a main campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. Playable in 3-4 hours for the full campaign with 1-2 hours for scenarios. Victory is determined by how many Union troops the Confederate player can force the Union player to keep in the Valley. The Union player will try to keep the bare minimum of troops in the Valley to prevent the Confederate player from obtaining certain objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Worthington's June 1, 2011 update this game will be the first in a series including games on the Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Overland, and Atlanta campaigns as well as an update of Forged in Fire: The 1862 Peninsula Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
