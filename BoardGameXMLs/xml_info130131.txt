			<description>Star Command: Revolution is a real-time strategy game by Metropolis Digital, Inc., now Metro3D, Inc., and published by GT Interactive. It was originally released in 1996 for DOS, but it was re-released in 1998 for Windows 95/98 under the title Star Command Deluxe. A sequel, Star Command X: Armada, was hinted at upon successful completion of the campaign mode, but it was never produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main storyline follows an interspecies conflict in the Zeta galaxy after the discovery of an energy resource called &amp;quot;Solinite.&amp;quot; The races, previously coexisting in peace, begin fighting each other for control of the Solinite, until several political assassinations allow the tyrannical warlord Narvek to take over the galaxy. A small group of rebels who call themselves &amp;quot;Star Command&amp;quot; fight back against Narvek in an effort to dethrone him and restore peace to the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Command: Revolution&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
