							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of Time and Space: S.O.S.</name>
									
			<description>A starship has transmitted a distress call from the distant planet of Lemm.  Mysteriously, the distress call contains no details about the nature of the predicament.  You command one of the most qualified rescue ships in the fleet, and have agreed to answer the distress call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a free adventure from Dark City Games to introduce new players to their Legends of Time and Space series.  Players create a party of characters, determining their attributes and equipment, much like a traditional RPG.  Players then read paragraphs in the adventure book.  Each paragraph is numbered, and presents the player with a choice.  Depending on the player's choice, he will be directed to another numbered paragraph.  For example, Paragraph #1 may describe a room as having a door leading to the east and a door leading to the west, then read &amp;quot;To go through the east door, go to paragraph #2. To go through the west door, go to paragraph #3.&amp;quot;  When characters encounter enemies, players use a hex-and-counter map.  Instructions are given for the enemies' attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The S.O.S. adventure book is separate from the core rulebook for the Legends of Time and Space system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
