							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cardthrower Castle</name>
									
			<description>The card throwing game of fantasy siegecraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses an army which they can choose to customise if they wish, then takes turn throwing cards across the table at each other's castle. If the castle (enemy deck) is hit, it loses cards based on the accuracy of the hit and type of card thrown. Dead Mammoths deal more damage then severed heads. When a player's castle runs out of cards, it is considered to have been razed to the ground and they lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use sneaky tactics cards to foil your foes plans and fight ground troops using rock, paper, scissors (each unit getting advantages and disadvantages which decide draws.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a fast paced game which lasts around five minutes per bout, but rest assured, as soon as you're done, you'll want another chance to hone your throwing technique and grind your enemy's castle into dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
