			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game characters have three Attributes with values assigned form a points pool.  Conflict resolution involves a system of point wagering from limited pools possessed by individual players and the game master.  The game has a hard limit of eight hours of game time before a hidden bomb goes off (or is, hopefully, located and defused).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most interesting aspect of the game, however, is the mechanic being designed specifically for play by eMail.  In fact, it would be somewhat cumbersome to play the game at a table with a group due to the method of game master adjudication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
