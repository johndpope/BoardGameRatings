			<description>From their Web Stie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our gaming experience, drawing outside locations, especially wooded areas, seems to drive GMs to fits. The terrain tile set was created based on feedback from players who liked our crypt, tavern, and smithy sets. We put together a set that will allow the DM to put out the most common objects a party will run into in the woods. The idea is to provide the obstacles that the PCs will have to get around for any combat that they get into. Or just to make them worry that they will be getting into combat...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain Tiles are lightweight, store in very little space, durable, and quick to set up. When you're done, just scoop them into a box or bag and you'reready to go. Perfect for convention gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2x Boulder 10x10 (2&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;3x Tree 10x10 (2&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;2x Log 2.5x5 (0.5&amp;quot;x1&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;Tree 20x20 (4&amp;quot;x4&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;2x Log 5x10 (1&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;6x Tree 5x5 &lt;br/&gt;2x River 10x15 (2&amp;quot;x3&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;3x Trees 10x10 (2&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;3x Swampy 5x5&lt;br/&gt;Trees 15x15ï¿½ (3&amp;quot;x3&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;2x Stream 5x10 (1&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;3x Weedy 5x5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
