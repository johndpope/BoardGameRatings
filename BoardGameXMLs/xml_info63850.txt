			<description>This game uses a standard deck of cards. Each player is dealt 13 cards, and in their turn they play a card and draw a card (therefor the game normally last 13 turns). The card played has to either match the suit of the previous card, or be a face card. If the sum of all the cards played so far is divisible by five, the player scores points. At the end of the game they also score for the remaining face cards. However, if one cannot play any more cards (does not have face cards or matching cards), the game ends, and that player scores for the opponents's remaining face cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
