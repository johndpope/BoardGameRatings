			<description>Traditional polish card came for 2 to 4 players. The game is played using only 24 cards from 9 and up to the ace. All the card cards are dealt among the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards from player's hand. The last of the players having any cards on his/her hand is declared PAN. (every game you lose gives you a letter P then A then N). You lose after 3 lost rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player is the one having 9 of hearts. &lt;br/&gt;9 of hearts is placed on the center of the table and the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;Players can play card of the same value or higher. You can place  3 cards of the same value that are higher than the card on the table but never 2. If you don't have any higher cards on your hand you have to take no less than 3 cards from the pile (you can take more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full rules in Polish: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(gra_karciana&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(gra_karciana&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
