			<description>Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FreezeME is a A 3D platformer in the style of the N64-era but wait there is a twist! &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; the main character, has one special tool &amp;ndash; the camera around her neck. This camera allows her to literally freeze the objects she photographs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protagonist of FreezeMe is &amp;ldquo;R,&amp;rdquo; a brown-eyed moppet with a camera around her neck. R is hot on the trail of her best friend, &amp;ldquo;M,&amp;rdquo; who has been abducted by the dastardly Fat the Cat. Fat the Cat longs to create what he describes as a &amp;ldquo;Free-Dog-World,&amp;rdquo; and exactly how kidnapping M will help him with this goal remains something of a mystery, but R is determined to thwart him by rescuing M from his clutches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To enter Fat the Cat&amp;rsquo;s isolated lair, where M is being held, R needs a special key. The key can only be forged from pieces of an ancient material, which are yellow cubes. As R collects the pieces of ancient material, she will unlock new areas, and ultimately find enough pieces to assemble the key and enter the final boss&amp;rsquo;s lair to save her friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walfrido came with the inspiration for the premise from observing his girlfriend &amp;ldquo;and her photography obsession &amp;ndash; I mean, passion.&amp;rdquo; Developing of this game starter back in September 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developement started on XNA, but after 6 months Walfrido decided to move to Unity and develop the game fully on that engine. He hired a few freelancers for some modelling animation as well as the music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first playable alpha was released in August 2013. After that some older builds have been distributed to some specific people.&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 vast worlds to explore.&lt;br/&gt;Non linear progression.&lt;br/&gt;Wide variety of different gameplay situations and mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
