							<name  sortindex="1">Robert Ludlum&#039;s Das Bourne Komplott</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robert Ludlum&#039;s The Bourne Conspiracy</name>
									
			<description>Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy mostly derives from the film version of The Bourne Identity. Although the game does not use the likeness of Matt Damon (who portrays Bourne in the films), due to creative differences with the actor; it does derive more closely from the film storyline than from the novels, and features musical themes from the films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the movie, the player character begins as an amnesiac found off the coast of Marseille, but as the game progresses, the player is provided with more clues to Bourne's true identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jason Bourne's senses are an important part of surviving the game, with noteworthy items or locations highlighted - when a switch to this sense is triggered, the visual style changes, with important elements much brighter. A third-person espionage action game, the player encounters armed and unarmed combat, the latter usually resolved through quick-time events, and driving sections, also often dependent on quick-time events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three difficulty settings which the player can choose from when playing the single-player campaign: Trainee (easy mode), Agent (normal mode) and Assassin (hard mode).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also contains a boss battle feature, allowing the player to fight the boss without having to complete the entire level again, although some boss fights last entire levels. The game also contains a music player feature that allows the player to listen to music from the game. It includes an original score for the game written by Paul Oakenfold and performed by Cee-Lo Green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place prior to, and during the events of, the first film. In addition to scenes from the film, several chapters also reveal some of Jason's backstory and missions that take place prior to the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
