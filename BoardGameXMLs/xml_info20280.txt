							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piquet: Point of Attack WWII (1936-1945)</name>
									
			<description>Piquet is a style of wargame. As GURPS is to role play, Piquet is to wargaming. A system of play for ANY period you wish, the basic gameplay will fit within any period with some basic fundamental differences required by the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses specific generic piquet cards to depict when certain event occur on the battlefield. As the author states, &amp;quot;the future is not perfectly known&amp;quot;. With Point of Attack WWII, compare the turn sequence of Advanced Squad Leader, where you know when each phase and subphase is going to occur, and you can plan your attack to take advantage of the rules. Imagine this sequence: I know this unit cannot move to get behind me in time to avoid me shooting 3 times at his other tank before I withdraw. In Piquet, this does not happen as you do not know when the unit will withdraw (nor the real commander on the ground)  for the unit may withdraw now when this card is drawn, or you may wait and bet that your opponent does not get those 3 move cards before you get another withdraw card. Timing is varied, thus your tactics must be sound fundamentally for you to get the results you want.(Think...What are the odds of THAT happening?) Your plan of attack must have enough concentration to avoid the &amp;quot;nothing gets done&amp;quot; effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes base Piquet Master Rules, and Piquet cards. Also Point of Attack rulebook and Point of Attack specific cards. Piquet uses a unique play on the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 dice in that you change the die you roll for each type of effect. It is not a roll of a d6 add 1, it is instead of a d6 you roll a d8 as a higher die roll is better (more good things happen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also the use of Impetus for maintaining whose turn adds some mystery on how the game plays out. Seemingly &amp;quot;up to chance&amp;quot;, if you properly plan and support your troops, the tactics will be rewarded as the greater force maintains (or quality of troops, or quality of leadership also factors in) the &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
