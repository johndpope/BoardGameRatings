			<description>The players will be able to choose the two dimensional shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect the sides needed to create the surfaces of the shapes on the green cards. For example, if you were collecting the sides of a cube you would collect and group six square side cards. You can collect the sides of more than one shape at a time if you choose! &lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player plays all of her cards and wins or the time for the game runs out. If time runs out, add up the points on the cards in your hand. Subtract ten points for every stack of sides you successfully played in front of you during the game. The player with the LEAST number of points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;134 cards&lt;br/&gt;- 8 green 3-d shape cards.&lt;br/&gt;- 96 blue 2-d surface or side shape cards&lt;br/&gt;- 30 flat red flexible building blocks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
