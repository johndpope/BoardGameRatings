			<description>Field Regulations: Rules for land battles of the late 18th Century.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of these rules is to simulate and simplify aspects of 18th Century linear warfare. The play should be limited to what the rules specify in order to get the feel of the rigid, formal, and deliberate maneuvers and combat characteristic of the military doctrine of the era. Playability is the thrust of these rules, not complexity. Included are rules for setting up a campaign series of games, but players wishing more expansive campaigns will find the basics herein to enlarge upon. To reflect the conditions of the American theater during the various times of combat, heavy cavalry has been omitted -- but militia, riflemen, and natives (Indians) are included. With additions and adjustments of a minor nature, these rules will be eminently suitable for European warfare in the same period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
