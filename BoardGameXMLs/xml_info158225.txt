			<description>Players take the roll of stall holders at Expo, a comic book and media show, moving around the board collecting resources in order to serve the customers and get their money. The player with the most money at the end of three days is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can move anywhere they choose on the board but the player in last place always moves next, so it is important not to run too far ahead and give other players an advantage as they catch up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
