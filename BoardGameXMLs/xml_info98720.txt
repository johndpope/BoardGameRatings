							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cycle Speedway</name>
									
			<description>Cycle Speedway was the fourth game in the Subbuteo racing series, which also included &amp;quot;Table Speedway,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Table Motor Racing,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Horse Racing.&amp;quot; This particular game simulated bicycle racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, like all in the series, is an action/dexterity game. The player propels their rider around a track by means using a ball bearing rolled down a small tube. The pieces were mounted to Subbuteo style bases, and represented cyclists. Although all games in the series used the same basic set of rules, there were variations to represent the various sports being simulated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Peter Upton, the variations between this game and &amp;quot;Table Horse Racing&amp;quot; were minimal, in fact, the rulebook refers back to the rules for &amp;quot;Table Horse Racing&amp;quot; as a source for variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
