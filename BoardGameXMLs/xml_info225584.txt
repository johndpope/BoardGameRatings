			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beat City is a story about a group of friends, each of whom, in their own way, have said &amp;quot;No thanks&amp;quot; to the established community and have dropped out of society, in search of something else. Another meaning in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beat City is about restlessness; whatever you do, you will never fit into the materialism and emptiness of the outside world. It's about the road, about making some time to just go. To seek meaning in the world. Beat City is a story where players themselves decide the time and place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenery is heavily inspired by the novel &amp;quot;On the Road&amp;quot; by Jack Kerouac and his contemporaries, &amp;quot;the Beat Generation&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
