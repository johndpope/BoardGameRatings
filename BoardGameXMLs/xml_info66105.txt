			<description>Give Your Best Advice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dick and Virginia are a couple that suffer from a plague of sex and relationship problems. As their closest and most trusted friend, they have come to you for advice. Will your great advice help this couple keep it together through thick and thin or will an opponent swoop in with their two cents and become the couple's closest confidant? It takes critical thinking and an open mind to help this troubled couple. Find out how well your advice is received and how other players handle sex and relationship quandaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions:&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the deck and place face down. The first player draws the top card and gives advice to the fictitious couple. If another player wants to challenge the advice given, they may. The other players vote on the best advice and the winner gets the card. Each card is worth one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player collects five cards a round is complete. Depending on the number of players the amount of rounds changes. Once all rounds are complete the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
