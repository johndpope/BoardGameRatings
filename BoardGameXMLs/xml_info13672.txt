			<description>This is a matching game for children that uses a Chutes and Ladders theme. The top of the gameboard depicts 2 ladders which players start at the base of. Certain ladder rungs have chutes that lead down to lower rungs of either ladder. The lower section of the board has spaces to lay out the game's cards. These cards are either placed picture or number side up depending on which game your playing. The video tape is inserted into your VCR, cued to a game, and played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you watch the screen and listen to the story. A visual clue (either a picture or number) will appear accompanied by an audio signal. You must then quickly find and remove the card that matches the clue. If the picture beneath the card is a ladder, you move your piece 1 rung up the ladder. If a chute is revealed, and the rung of the ladder your piece is on is connected to the top of a chute, you must move down the chute to a lower rung. If your piece is on the top ladder rung when the story ends you win the game. You also win immediately if you move your piece &amp;quot;over&amp;quot; the top rung of the ladder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
