							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Air Control (2014)</name>
									
			<description>Air Control is a new-gen aviasimulator. It is almost perfect , starting from the design and ending with a gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;Speaking about the design and all-new spaces of the our airplane simulator , we can say that it gives you more freedom and realism ,you have ever seen in such kind of games before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first we worked at airplane's compartment.The result we have now, is so near to the real life . Working at the simulation and flights , we wanted to give players more in-flight adventures, and that is why we decided to expand horizons&lt;br/&gt;of gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;                                   &lt;br/&gt;You will have to play inside,and outside the airplane. While playing as a pilot,and blasting off the ground the airplane you will have to play as a 3rd person camera and while being in the flight,&lt;br/&gt;you will have an ability to play as a stewardess or just to get out of the cabin and walk a little-bit. While making a walk or serving passengers, you can see the airplane inside in every smallest detail : starting from the tvs over each&lt;br/&gt;seat,and ending with toilets or a kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;                                  &lt;br/&gt;Also before the flight, you will play as an engineer, and your work will be to prepare the airplane for the flight :&lt;br/&gt;1.to make sure that everything works fine.&lt;br/&gt;2.to bring the passengers' bags to the airplane and to put them inside&lt;br/&gt;3.playing as a stewardess before the flight, you will have to clean the airplane's compartment and to bring the food inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the pilot's work begins:&lt;br/&gt;1.You need to make sure that everything works ok.&lt;br/&gt;2.You need to switch on all the devices.&lt;br/&gt;3.To begin your flight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try the fullest flight simulation you have ever had in the computer games !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
