			<description>The game plays in a Train - the Silvesterexpress. It's a mixture of board game and role play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something strange or even a crime has happened in the train: e.g. someone has been murdered. The players try to find out, what happened and which person(s) have committed the crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a character (Police officer, passengaers, ...), and instructions on how to play their character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Moving a pawn around the 2 plans (Train, area around the Train)by rolling a die to find objects.&lt;br/&gt;    Interrogate the other players to get more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both should lead the players as team or against each other to solve the crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
