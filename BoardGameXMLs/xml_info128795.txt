			<description>Trick-taking game for mostly 4 players. It is played in Prisdorf, Germany area. Using 25 cards (A,10,K,Q,J,9,8,7 from non-Diamonds and 7 of Diamond), the game is played like an easy version of Skat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4-player game, players are dealt 5 cards. Among the remaining 5 cards, 3 of them are not used and 2 of them are placed face down in the middle of the table. Each player bids the number of tricks they can take with their choice of the trump suit. The game value is equal to these number of tricks called. Each of the following causes to double the game value: by not using the face-down cards (Hand game), by choosing a diamond as a trump (called &amp;quot;Ruten&amp;quot; - notice that there is only one diamond card in the deck), or by bidding 5 (called Durch).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also some special bids. Kieker is like null and he can use all 5 face-down cards to exchange his hand. Siebener Fips is the case to have all four 7s and an Ace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
