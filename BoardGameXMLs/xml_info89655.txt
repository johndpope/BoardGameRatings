			<description>An amateur cardgame describing the chaotic history in the end of Edo government, (Bakumatsu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 99 cards and one small map.&lt;br/&gt;The game is very similar to &amp;quot;Uno&amp;quot;.  Every player has a turn and try to play a card which matches either color or number to the last card played.  And when any one player plays all his hand, the game ends and the victory is determined by each player's secret victory condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map shows the current trend and changed its status by playing some cards.  This trend strongly affects the victory condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
