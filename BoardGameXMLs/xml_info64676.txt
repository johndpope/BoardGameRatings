							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leap of Faith</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the book's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leap of Faith is a scenario for the Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game. It is set in the years between the end of the Season 5 of the television series and A Call to Arms, which evolved into the Crusade spin-off series. It is designed for a wide cast of characters that can hail from anywhere in the galaxy and are likely between 5th and 7th level. The scenario begins with the characters, contacted by the office of a Senator of the Earth Alliance to come to EarthDome in an allexpenses paid trip that promises to be well worth their time. Characters who are active members of the Anla&amp;rsquo;shok (Rangers) or in the politics of the ISA should be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is a stand alone adventure that is designed to be inserted into any existing campaign played in the year 2264 and could be a great way to fill in the blanks for those gaming groups that have a great deal of down time between Babylon 5 canon events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
