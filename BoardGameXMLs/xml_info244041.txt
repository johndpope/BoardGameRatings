							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruined Abbey</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruined Abbey is the 2nd module in a new campaign arc dealing with the town of Phandalin and the surrounding area.  The module uses information on the updated town found in Return to Phandalin, but that module is not needed to complete the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure, the PCs are asked to investigate a problem with missing farmers trying to settle the lands around the ruined abbey only a couple miles outside of town.  Investigation leads to a Deathlock Wight and a setup for returning later when the PCs find a 'key' that opens a long-sealed doorway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The module is designed for 2nd level PCs which will earn enough XP to reach 3rd level at the end of the adventure.  The playtest took 3 nights of play, but 2 nights should be expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
