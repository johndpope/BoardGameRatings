							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Rush! (1982)</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you have five miners to dig as much gold as you can from the Lost Goldmine.  Each miner has ten sticks of dynamite (charges) to blast his way into the mine.  The miner gathers them by moving to the same space as the dot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of pieces of gold is counted and displayed at the bottom of the screen.  The number of charges left is also displayed at the bottom of the screen.  After gathering all the gold you can, you must move out of the mine to the Assay Office to exchange the gold for money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold Rush! was written by Joseph Weber and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 26, July 1982.  Separate source code was provided for Atari 8-bit systems and the VIC-20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was subsequently revised and ported - see Gold Miner for TI-99/4A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
