			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty Reasons To Exploit The Woodlands...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons are fine for treasure, sure, but how does one gain a sinful bounty of wealth in the woods? Simple. Exploit nature's resources. Woodland Commodities provides twenty different commodity items that can be found in temperate forest environments. From plants and animals found in the wooded environs of the real world to commodities that might exist in a fantasy realm or an alien environment, the dungeon master and player alike will find this brief but useful pdf to be chock full of interesting things to haul back into the villages.  From strange berries and consumable items to potential pets and familiars, Woodland Commodities has a little something for most everyone in the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the price, unit/weight, and item description, Woodland Commodities also contains a good deal of gameworthy notes. Likewise some of the items have an adventure hook for the campaign in need of a sidetrack or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
