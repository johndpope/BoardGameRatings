							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Laugh Trax</name>
									
			<description>Play is simple, the challenge is NOT!&lt;br/&gt;You laugh...you lose! At specific board locations, players stare each other down as a timer determines who will be the first to lose their composure. Neither can laugh or even grin... The first to do so loses! To increase this challenge, your opponent is staring at you wearing a pig nose or any one of the six props shown. Other players are free to talk, laugh, and attempt to sabatoge the dueling pair. As the game progresses, determination snowballs into explosive laughter that roars out of players as their twitching stomachs can hold back no more! &amp;quot;Victory&amp;quot; is relative since all of the &amp;quot;losers&amp;quot; are sore from laughing! We guarantee it! Get LAUGH TRAXtm and discover why losing is now FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: Game board, timer, die,&lt;br/&gt;6 props, directions, and playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
