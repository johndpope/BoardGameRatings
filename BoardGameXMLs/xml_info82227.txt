			<description>As with other MMORPG's, players control a character avatar within a persistent game world, where they will be able to explore the landscape, search for the Dragon Balls, train to compete in the Tenkaichi Budokai, aspiring to become like the warriors of legend, as well as interact with NPCs  and other players. As in most MMORPGs, players will be able to obtain money and experience which will allow them to level up and obtain new abilities. It is speculated that players may also be able to participate in &amp;quot;Time Machine Quests&amp;quot;, in which they will receive guidance from Time Patrol Trunks (タイム・パトロール・トランクス, Taimu Patorōru Torankusu) (also known as Future Trunks), in order to travel back in time and take part in notable aspects of the Dragon Ball history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dragon Ball Online&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
