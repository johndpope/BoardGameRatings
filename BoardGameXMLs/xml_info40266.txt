			<description>Tri-Casa is a fun and easy-to-learn card game for family and friends. If you like Rummy and Mille Bornes, you'll love Tri-Casa. This game is sure to be a hit with your family on vacations, camp outs, or an evening at home. English and Spanish instructions are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the play in Rummy, players receive seven cards to begin and draw from the deck or discard pile to begin each turn. Player discards one card to signal the end of the turn. The object of the game is to collect groups of three houses of the same color or three houses at consecutive addresses on the same street. Players lay down collections to gain the 10 points on each of the cards. A player can match a fixer-upper house with a cash card for 25 points. There is an old fire station card and an old church card that can be played alone and worth 25 points each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Mille Bornes, this game has a few roadblocks. A player can play a Haunted House card or a Termite card on an opponent. The opponent cannot lay down any point cards until the proper remedy card is played, which is a Medium or Exterminator. If the player has the Home Inspection Team card displayed, the player is exempt from Termite or Ghost troubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hands end when a player runs out of cards. Don't get caught with a lot of points in your hand, as they are subtracted from the points you have collected on the table. Play continues until a player reaches 500 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn more at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tricasagame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.tricasagame.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
