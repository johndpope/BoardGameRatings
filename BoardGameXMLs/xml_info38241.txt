							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WH40K Squads</name>
									
			<description>A two-player squad level card game based on the Games Workshop Warhammer 40,000 universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a separate deck, depending on the force the player is leading. There are decks for the Space Marine Squads, Ork Squadz, Eldar Squads, Chaos Space Marine Squads, and Tyranid Brood. The cards represent Units, Attachments (weapons), and Events. The Units are primarily squad sized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players deploy Units, which may be accompanied by Attachments, and all units in play can attack an opposing unit once per turn. All combat is considered simultaneous, so every unit has a chance to attack, even on a turn in which it is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to eliminate all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
