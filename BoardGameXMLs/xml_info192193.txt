							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">O Gangster de Retrocity</name>
									
			<description>During the Depression, the streets of Retrocity were controlled by the iron hand of Don Picolotto ... But he died. Now, four families are fighting each other to control the organized crime in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O G&amp;acirc;ngster de Retrocity is a competitive game for 2-4 players where each one assumes the role of a mafia boss that seeks to dominate the crime of Retrocity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one player can become the big boss and to achieve this goal, each player must create a strategy by joining board movement, card's special effect and attacks on their rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses modular boards, which allows the city to have a different setting every new play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of 60 cards is divided in three types: Action, Equipment and Building. All cards have a special effect and Action and Equipment cards can be used in combat against a rival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The length of a game is 30 to 60 minutes and as players become accustomed to the rules, the game becomes increasingly wild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
