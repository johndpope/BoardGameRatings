							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Lands: Curse of the Skinwalker</name>
									
			<description>Bad Lands: Curse of the Skinwalker is a western horror co-op survival game where you and your friends take control of a posse of heroes fighting off a pack of vicious were-beasts and other folklore creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your own adventures - The Bad Lands box comes with 6 heavy duty, double-sided, linen coated Board Tiles. You only need 4 Board Tiles play. We will include several different pre-made adventures for you and your friends to play, or you can make your own! The board tiles are double sided, and you can lay them out in a variety of ways to build your town your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Form your Posse - Bad Lands is a co-op survival game for 1-4 players. While most players will just control 1 Hero per game, you can still quite easily have a larger posse. The more Heroes in the adventure, the more Villains you will have to face, and the tougher the game will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kill Some Bad Guys - Bad Lands features a whole host of vicious Skinwalkers and minion beasts for your Heroes to vanquish. The core boxed game comes with a deck of 30 Encounter Cards. You draw a card, and it tells you what Villains are going to jump out and attack the Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get some Loot! - Of course, no adventure is complete without cool rewards. When you defeat tough Villains, they will leave a Loot Marker behind. If your Hero picks one up, you can draw a Loot Card from the deck. Each Hero may carry an unimited amount of Loot Cards, but may only equip and use two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
