			<description>F1 Pole Position 2 introduces Satoru Nakajima to the series as a hidden character that can be saved in either of the two provided files.  This relationship would eventually continue until Human Grand Prix IV: F1 Dream Battle was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to edit the contracts for the engine manufacturers in addition to the individual players and their respective contracts. The engines in this game look similar to Human Grand Prix III and Human Grand Prix IV. Licensing was possible by Fuji Television and FOCA. World Grand Prix mode allows the player to re-enact the 1993 season. Battle mode allows for a single race to take place against up to 13 CPU-controlled players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, time attack mode allows players to practice on the tracks. There is a guiding arrow for turns that allow players to correct judge how much pressure that he or she can put on the turns.  This feature would eventually be used in other Human Grand Prix games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F1 Pole Position 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
