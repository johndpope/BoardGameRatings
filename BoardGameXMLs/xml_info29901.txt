							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Right Off The Bat</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box and the game rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right Off The Bat - a baseball game that required no skill because all plays would be determined by the roll of the dice.  An accurate and exciting game that could be played anytime, anywhere, with any teams of your choice, past or present - that produced its own realistic statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin the game with the visiting team up first.  Each shake of the dice represents a pitch.  Proceed around the game board until there are three outs.  Leave your game piece on the 3rd out of each inning as you will begin from whatever space your third out is for the rest of the game.  Keep track of each man's at bats, balls, strikes, outs, hits, etc., and enter the total hits, runs, and errors, (if any), of each inning in the designated innings on the score card.  The Home Team does the exact same thing in the bottom of each inning.  Be sure to remove all base runners left on base at the end of each teams ups.  As in real baseball, the game is played for nine innings to determine a winner of the game.  If the Home team is ahead after 8 1/2 innings of play, the Home team wins and does not bat in the bottom of the 9th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game rule book, there are 3 versions of game play that can be played from this gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;Basic version is approximate 30 minutes playing time.&lt;br/&gt;Intermediate version is approximate 30-60 minutes of playing time.&lt;br/&gt;Advanced version is approximate 60-90 minutes of playing time.&lt;br/&gt;There are also optional variations of play with each version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
