							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Green Eggs and Ham: Speedy Diner!</name>
									
			<description>The fast-paced frenetically fun food game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sam-I-Am has opened a caf&amp;eacute; and invited his friends, Fox, Mouse, and Goat, for dinner. Help serve up his signature green eggs and ham along with a menu full of other silly Seussian foods. Listen closely because these critter customers can&amp;rsquo;t decide what to eat! And hurry, hurry, hurry&amp;mdash;the musical timer is playing and speedy service is the key to 5-star success!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fast-paced, frenetically fun game for preschoolers, players work together to deliver food to the caf&amp;eacute; guests as fast as they can. Take turns being the Chef calling out orders to the other players, who serve as waiters, running back and forth to pick up the foods and deliver them to the correct customers. The faster you deliver the food, the more tips you&amp;rsquo;ll make! But watch out&amp;mdash;when you hear &amp;ldquo;Bugs in the Kitchen!&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ve got to race back to the dining room and check all the tables for insects. Players use color, shape and other pre-reading skills to identify food items and counting to collect their reward coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the classic Dr. Seuss children&amp;rsquo;s story, Green Eggs &amp;amp; Ham - Speedy Diner! Game serves up big laughs and fast-action role-play fun. The whimsical Musical Menu Book helps kids make the association between letters and words, inspiring confidence and a love for reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
