			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prove nothing, be awesome, and inflate your ego all in the name of pseudo-science!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dude, Run! is a competitive storytelling game of reality TV paranormal investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game session is called an episode; which is composed of a claim of the paranormal, a location that&amp;rsquo;s divided up into its most active Hotspots, and a specific amount of evidence the investigators must uncover to prove the validity of the claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the investigations are conducted in various Hotspots, the Skeptic will trigger rather mundane events that the investigators encounter, such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    wind howling past the window&lt;br/&gt;    a family of raccoons in the attic&lt;br/&gt;    a tree branch falling in the woods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators must then use a mixture of belief, investigation techniques, and a bit of ego to completely misinterpret the event as evidence of the paranormal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the investigators are successful at giving a paranormal explanation to an everyday event; they get closer to having enough evidence to close the case and validate the claim at the end of the episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is competition involved here, but not between the investigators and the Skeptic. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the investigator gathering &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; evidence than the rest of the group.  The player who provides the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; evidence over the course of the episode will wind up the Lead Investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just make sure to use a bit of caution while investigating.  If you try too hard you will wind up buying into your own misinterpretations and a creaky floorboard could have you running for the hills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dude, Run! is a complete role playing game system for 3-7 players with a bunch of six-sided dice and around 2 hours time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
