			<description>Victory is an abstract combat dexterity game for two players. The game mixes skill and a little luck to create an abstract battlefield the players overlook and attempt to control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will set their army of meeples up on their side of the table or floor. Then the players will take turns drawing cards and sliding their glass bead shooters, attempting to knockdown their opponent's army first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No game is never the same twice and the Action cards randomize abilities and opportunities available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is awarded to the last (meeple) man standing...and the player who owns it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
