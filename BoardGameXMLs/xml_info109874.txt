			<description>Card game by an unknown publisher, circa 1900.&lt;br/&gt;32 cards in 4 suits of 8. The cards in each suit rank in this order and, if won, they are worth the points noted;&lt;br/&gt;Bride 5 points&lt;br/&gt;Bridegroom 4 points&lt;br/&gt;Best Man 3 points&lt;br/&gt;Mother-in-Law 2 points&lt;br/&gt;Minister 1 point&lt;br/&gt;Bridesmaid A 0 points&lt;br/&gt;Bridesmaid B 0 points&lt;br/&gt;Bridesmaid C 0 points&lt;br/&gt;The suits are called Notes, Gold, Silver, Copper.&lt;br/&gt;The Notes are white because this game harks back to the days when bank notes were always white.&lt;br/&gt;The object is to win cards in tricks, that have a point value as described above. After dealing, each player should assess their hand and make a bid in turn as to how many points they will collect in their winning tricks. Each bid must be higher than the previous bid. High bidder can call any suit as trumps. When the cards are dealt, there will be 2 to 4 cards left over. These form The Widow and remain face down. The high bidder can choose to take The Widow (and discard the same number of cards taken from The Widow) thus, perhaps, improving his hand.&lt;br/&gt;Normal trick play rules apply.&lt;br/&gt;If the high bidder makes his points or more, then he scores. If he doesn't then all the other players score the amount equal to his winning bid. It will be noted in this game that the high bidder is on his own whereas the 'defending' players are a united team against him.&lt;br/&gt;First player to score 150 points or more, wins.&lt;br/&gt;The rules even carry suggestions as to how to use these cards for fortune-telling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
