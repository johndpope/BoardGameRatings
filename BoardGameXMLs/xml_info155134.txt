							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exotic Encounters: Compendium</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pathfinder Bestiary, and the long line of monstrous encyclopedia that came before it, do a great job of attacking the problem of providing game statistics and mechanical information for a very wide variety of creatures. There are a lot of strange creatures from fantasy novels and movies, from ancient mythology, and, as time went on, from the twisted minds of game designers and even GMs, for that matter. Anyone today who tried to go about creating an extensive bestiary of all the different cool and interesting fantasy monsters could fill three or four volumes with three hundred monsters each, and still have a long way left to go, with fans crying out for various &amp;ldquo;forgotten&amp;rdquo; monsters to get some attention. That kind of breadth doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave a whole lot of room for depth, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Exotic Encounters came in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exotic Encounters series focused on providing new and creative twists on well-known, iconic monsters, providing new options for GMs to use creatures like cyclopes, medusas, nightmares, and all manner of other monsters at a wider range of CRs. But the monsters included here are more than just existing stat-blocks with Hit Dice added or subtracted: each monster has at least one unique ability never seen anywhere else, and each of the monsters has been reimagined and cast in a new, creative light that transforms it into something that is both familiar and resonant, while still being new and exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exotic Encounters: Compendium is a compilation of all of the exotic encounters products released in 2013, gathered together in a single, convenient, bookmarked document. Buying each of the original Exotic Encounters products separately, this collection of 88 monsters included in this book would cost over $28, but you can get it for almost a third of that price. So what are you waiting for? Find your party&amp;rsquo;s next memorable encounter today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
