							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Legion of Sorrow</name>
									
			<description>This box set expands the Malifaux universe by adding the Legion of Sorrow. The crew contains Pandora (leader), Baby Kade, Candy, and 3 Sorrows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora is the Master of Willpower (Wp) duels. She features powerful debuffs, crushing offensive abilities, and deceptive maneuverability, making her one of the more dangerous Masters in the game. But she is also known for her steep learning curve, taking many hard fought games to fully grasp her potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora is focused around a web of effects consisting of The Box Opens, Emotional Trauma, Expose Fears, and Fading Memory. These four abilities form her core and are utilized by her spells and actions. The Box Opens allows her to affect just about any model in the game with her Wp-based effects while Emotional Trauma harms any enemy model failing a Wp duel near her. Expose Fears is her main defense against enemy models and forces any enemy model targeting her into a Wp -&amp;gt; Wp duel. Finally, Fading Memory adds a deceptive amount of maneuverability to an otherwise slow Master and, when paired with the other three abilities, provides her a unique defensive option of darting away from (or towards) an opponent trying to target her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora's starter box is about perfect. It gives you a nicely rounded list of 23ss, leaving you 2 more for your Soulstone Pool during the game, and has a mix of Wp based models and dual purpose models. It comes with Pandora, Baby Kade, Candy, and 3 Sorrows. If you're a beginning Pandora player, it is highly recommended you play with the box set as it is for several games, or until you get a good handle on Pandora's mechanics and practice using your Sorrows to their greatest effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
