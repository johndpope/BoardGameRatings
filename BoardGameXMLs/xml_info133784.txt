							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paranormal Investigators</name>
									
			<description>Paranormal Investigators is an homage to the classic &amp;quot;Monster Hunter&amp;quot; television shows. Straight from the tabloid headlines, these unsolved mysteries, urban legends, and other phenomena are here to be finally solved or debunked by your Investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assembling your own teams of Paranormal Investigators (or PI's, for short), players must rely on the diverse backgrounds of their PI&amp;rsquo;s to solve a host of strange Case Files. Once solved, these cases can be saved for the end of the game or used to solve larger cases and gain strategic advantages over your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game with only a couple of Investigators and a handful of Paranormal Aid cards. Each PI has their own unique background in various paranormal fields. Certain PI's also have a &amp;quot;Debunk&amp;quot; background, which allows players to attempt to solve a case by debunking it. Paranormal Aids can be used to add a background to a PI or increase it. Players also have the option of using these aids (as well as any solved cases they have) to enlist additional PI's or perform other actions, such as allowing PI's to add their backgrounds through partnering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns revealing cases on a Case Files card layout and attempting to solve them. These cases cover many paranormal backgrounds (cryptozoology, unexplained phenomenon, supernatural, extraterrestrial, demonic, and cursed) with five levels for each one. Each level needs the equal and matching background to solve it (for example, a Level 5 Supernatural Case File needs a combined Supernatural background of 5 to solve it). Each level on a Case File also equals the number of points it is worth at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, players will only be able to solve a limited number of these cases. But, as they enlist more PI's and use their aids/solved cases, players will slowly be able to solve larger ones. While the larger cases are worth the most towards victory, they also have powerful secondary abilities (like abducting an opponent's PI or stealing one of their solved cases). Players must weigh their options when doing this since cases that have their secondary abilities used are discarded and can't be added to a player's end game total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that does the best job of building their team of Paranormal Investigators and managing the most strategic use of their Paranormal Aids and solved Case Files will end the game with the largest number of combined Case File points and be declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
