			<description>The game box contains a game board, a pack of delivery cards, scrip (of various denominations), game pieces (vans, trucks &amp;amp; aircraft) &amp;amp; cheques that may be exchanged between players.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to deliver all his/her mail to the destinations indicated on the hand of cards dealt to the player at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game board is divided into quadrants representing four postal areas (A-D). Each quadrant is further subdivided into a route map of delivery addresses (1-18) which may be traveled on throw of a dice by each players transport vehicles. Each vehicle has a different capacity for mail (vans can diver up to two of the players cards, trucks carry three). Since each card dealt to a player indicates an address printed on it (e.g. B13, A6 etc. etc.), on his/her turn, dice must be thrown and vehicles moved towards those destinations in order to deliver the mail. When this is done, the player earns a cash bonus. A delaying element is added to the game via aircraft, which can be rented to deliver unwanted cards (to a maximum of four)from a players hand to another players depot when that player may seem likely to run out of deliveries &amp;amp; win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
