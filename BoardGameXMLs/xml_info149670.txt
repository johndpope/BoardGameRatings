			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often underused and unappreciated, cursed items have been part of the game since the very beginning but have lost much of their threat and danger in recent editions. Many GMs no longer make use of them, but the cursed item is a mainstay of both fantasy literature and films and deserves a place in every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as fiendish new cursed items, this ebook also contains ideas and tips on how to make cursed items more effective in your game. It builds on the concept of sleeper curses; items whose curses can lay dormant indefinitely, until activated by a very specific event, action, or method of use. Imagine the look of horror on your player&amp;rsquo;s face when he finds out that the item his 10th level character found at 1st level actually turns out to be cursed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     58 new cursed items of all types&lt;br/&gt;     Guidelines for using sleeper curses in your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;     An example list of dozens of possible sleeper curse activation methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondrous Creations 3: Cursed is the third volume in a series of magic item sourcebooks compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and suitable for GMs and players of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
