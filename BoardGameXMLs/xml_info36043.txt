			<description>The game is played using two custom decks &amp;ndash; an Army Deck and a Battle Deck. The Army Deck consists of units (Infantry Company, Cavalry Platoon, or Artillery Battery), each of which is rated for Attack Damage and Defense. The Battle Deck consists of Attack Cards, Opportunity Attack Cards, Defense Cards, Event Cards,  Leader Cards, and Terrain Cards. Each player starts with a random draw of five Army Cards and five Battle Cards. Variant rules are included for a quick start, balanced starting forces, and alternate victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
