			<description>Henry, a large plastic bird, swivels on his perch as players attempt to feed various items into his large, hinge-like beak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, one item MUST be fed to Henry until it either remains in his beak or causes another object to fall out.  Fallen objects are added to the player's pile of items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to successfully feed all their items to Henry wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
