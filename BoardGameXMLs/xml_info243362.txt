			<description>Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superchase is an arcade-style game where you try to eat all the treasures before the monster of dungeons eats you!  Sounds easy, doesn't it?  Well, it isn't quite that simple.  The faster you go, the faster he goes.  What's the point in going fast?  If you go fast, you get more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superchase was written by Anthony Godshall and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 29, October 1982.  Source code listings for VIC and Atari 8-bit systems were included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
