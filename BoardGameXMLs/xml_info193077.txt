							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guardians: Original Edition Rules for Fantastic Superhero Games</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if the first RPG was inspired by the super hero comic books of 1970s instead of Tolkienesque fantasy? This was the &amp;ldquo;bronze age&amp;rdquo; of comics in which ongoing story arcs and a new maturity of tone gave stories greater power than ever before without sacrificing the epic feel of earlier periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUARDIANS is a super hero retro-clone intended to be compatible with the original fantasy roleplaying game, Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry, Adventurer Conqueror King, Labyrinth Lord, Warriors of the Red Planet and other &amp;ldquo;OSR&amp;rdquo; games. It is part of the Original Edition What If? line. If your tastes run towards superpowered four-color heroes and villains you&amp;rsquo;ve found the right book. In a tradition inspired by the psionic abilities of Eldritch Wizardry and the mutants of Metamorphosis Alpha or Gamma World, even a first level Guardians character begins with mighty powers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters (PCs) are those who have been granted great powers. Standing as titans among men, they chose to serve as guardians of humanity and bulwarks against evil. But every super is also a person: a hero who can punch through a tank or fly to the moon may find their powers useless when they grapple with a hostile media, their best friend&amp;rsquo;s alcoholism or a romantic rival who doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss dates because they have to save the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules presented here are intended to be either a complete game or serve as a companion to fantasy games using the same overall system. This book is a resource for Game Masters to pick and choose from, whichever suits your fancy. The rules are based, in their most basic form, on the original fantasy roleplaying game; all elements are intended to be mostly compatible with that system, its successive editions and versions, and with the other old school retro-clones. These other books are not necessary to enjoying this one, but elements of those books combined with this one is sure to result in a truly unique experience suited to each group&amp;rsquo;s taste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
