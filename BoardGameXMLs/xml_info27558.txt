			<description>Quick-playing but detailed simulations of college basketball. Instant download, print and play game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features Easy to set up &amp;amp; play: Just shuffle the action cards and play. (If you want to keep score, enter the player and team names onto the provided score sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All play derived from 100 &amp;quot;action cards&amp;quot;: Each card is 2-sided. 3 trips through one side of the cards equals one half of play. This length of playing time varies according to each team's pace rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistically accurate: Every college team from the 2005-2006 season, along with the players, are rated in every possible statistical category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL college teams represented: Now you can simulate games between Division 1, 2, and 3 teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team and player rated in several categories: Every statistic you would expect to be covered is here. 2 and 3 point shooting, free throw shooting, rebounding (offensive and defensive), assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and fouls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep score as you play and compile stats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even play games between divisions: Match up a division I team against a division II team with simple formulas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional injury system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive &amp;quot;pace&amp;quot; ratings: One problem I've found with other basketball sims is the lack of realistic scores. Some teams regularly score 100+ points a game, others barely break 60. With the pace system, you will see the scores of your games closely reflect the team's actual output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic foul system: Another shortcoming with other hoop sims is the lack of realistic foul distribution. Although the highest fouled/fouling players are often correct, the rate at which a team draws fouls is often incorrect. In Center Court, each team draws fouls based on their actual performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete rule book, including a detailed description of a partial sample game, useful as a tutorial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set of action cards, ready for printing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foul chart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team cards, divided by division/conference. Each conference is printed on one separate .pdf file, all organized within division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
