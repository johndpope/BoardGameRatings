			<description>Catfight (also known as Cat Fight and CatFight: The Ultimate Female Fighting Game) is a PC fighting video game developed by Phantom Card and published in 1996 by Atlantean Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;The plot of the game revolves around a dark goddess Shinma and 10 female warriors competing to challenge her and obtain the ultimate power.&lt;br/&gt;Advertisement on the Atlantean Interactive website said:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Join eleven of the fiercest female warriors from across the Ethers [sic] as they battle it out for the ultimate power of the Universe! Watch the head-to-head fighting assault blaze its way to your screen -- with the hottest women in games engaging in the most violent fighting techniques imaginable! Some of the things you must endure are disembowelment, decapitation, and worse! It's the ultimate life versus death struggle, where you must pulverize your opponent in eight awesome arenas to survive! Here is your chance to claim your place next to the most awesome women in the galaxy!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Like the early games in the Mortal Kombat series, Catfight uses digitized actors for creating the sprites representing the fighters (the martial actress Katalin Zamiar of the MKII fame portrayed a female ninja character Chae Lee).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Catfight (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
