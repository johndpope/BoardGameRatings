			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several of the Republics of the USSR are in open revolt. They have seized weapons from the Soviet army and fight against Russia, while behind their borders, massacres of pro-Russian groups are reported. You are sent behind the frontline to save the citizens still loyal to the USSR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Soviet the player controls a combat vehicle (top-down view). The goal is to pick up as much hostages as possible before being detected by an enemy patrol. Once the player is detected, enemy forces converge on the location, making the rescue operation much more difficult. There are four stages in the game, the player proceeds to the next by rescueing at least 31 hostages (there are 50 hostages per level and the game is lost if 20 of them are killed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
