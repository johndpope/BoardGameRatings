			<description>The deck has 96 cards, 90 of value 1-7, with more of the lower value cards and fewer of the higher values.&lt;br/&gt;Each is decorated with different timepieces: a watch, a metronome, a stopwatch and so on.&lt;br/&gt; There are also six 'Parking Meter' cards with a star rather than a number. The aim of play is to meld sets of three &lt;br/&gt;cards, scoring the face value of melded cards at the end of the hand. The Parking meters are wild cards,&lt;br/&gt;which can be used when melding cards, but score nothing at the end of the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have two ways of gaining cards - the first thing they do each turn. They may discard a card and take as many cards as its face value from the draw pile. Alternatively, they may play one or more '1's and take that many cards from the discard pile. The drawback to the latter is that they must then meld at least one of the cards&lt;br/&gt;taken. Players are also limited to a maximum of 12 cards in their hand at the end of their turn and must&lt;br/&gt;discard any excess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having taken card(s), players may then make a meld - only one meld is allowed each&lt;br/&gt;turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
