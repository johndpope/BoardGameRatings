			<description>Imagine an intricately mechanized clash of spy against spy, introducing corporate espionage to a Steampunk world of industrial revolution; filled with all of the plot twists and thrills of both genres. That's the world of Steam Spy, a Steampunk themed role playing card game for 2 players. Steam Spy unites the character development and narrative of a traditional role playing game with the intimacy and spontaneity of a card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create a unique secret agent character who works for one of the organizations designated to protect and serve one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest corporations.  Then they face off against an operative from an opposing secret industrial organization in a one on one battle of wits, luck and exotic steampunk gadgets.  One player instigates some kind of espionage mission while the other does their best to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect, play and draw cards that help create a series of exciting encounters that ultimately determine if the instigating antagonists succeeds at their mission, or the determined protagonist chases them down and defeats them; players then advance their spy character, or create a group of secret agent specialists in preparation for the next face off against operatives from opposing agencies and corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steam Spy: Action and Adventure gives you the opportunity to leap into action as a Federal Agency agent, a straight shooting provocateur using the advanced weaponry of North America&amp;rsquo;s &lt;br/&gt;Renningson and Sons Firearms. Or you can join the Unified Alliance and use the resources of Navidad Pharmaceuticals to keep you and your team safe in the most thrilling adventures in the wildest environments in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
