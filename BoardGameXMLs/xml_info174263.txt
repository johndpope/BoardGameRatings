							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pascal Deal</name>
									
			<description>The most deadly virus known to mankind (known as the Pascal Project) has been stolen.  The perpetrator of the crime is looking to get rid of the virus quickly to avoid capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must use their influence in the global gang world by managing and playing cards from their hand in order to collect the information they need to set up the soon to be infamous Pascal deal and purchase the virus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information in this game is represented by cards in players hands.  Your goal is to identify which players hold these cards and to use your actions from played cards efficiently to steal these information cards from them, all while trying to put on your best poker face to attempt to hide any information cards you hold from other players so that they are not stolen from you.  The first player to obtain 3 information cards has everything they need to establish the Pascal deal and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
