							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Premium: The Insurance Game</name>
									
			<description>In Premium, a single pawn is moved around the board. When it lands on an unowned property, the moving player may purchase it and may also insure it for 50% or 100% of its value. After the first circuit of the board, players draw cards on every turn which may cause damage to the property landed on or specific named properties - the owners get paid if they have insurance policies but lose the properties without compensation if they do not. At the start of each circuit players collect income from every other player for each property they own. The object is to be the last player with money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
