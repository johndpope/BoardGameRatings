			<description>In-game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long, long ago, men knew many secrets which we people have forgotten. Nature was not so kind as today, and great creatures lived in the depths of the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 869, and you are an adventurer in Denmark. You are drawn by tales of a great treasure of over 5000 gold pieces, said to be in a castle inhabited by monsters of every sort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You come to the village near the castle. You are surprised by how easy it is to find a place to stay. Then you realize that the people expect to keep your belongings when you are lost in the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dungeon is on three levels. The first level contains the entrance, many corridors, and many rooms. The second level is almost the same as the first except that there are more monsters and more scattered treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third level consists of one large room with several branching passages and their adjoining rooms. The large room contains the treasure of 5000 gold pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective is to reach the third level and return to the surface with the 5000 gold pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Excerpts from the in-game instructions continue in the More Information section below.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
