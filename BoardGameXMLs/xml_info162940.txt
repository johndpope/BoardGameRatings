			<description>ESSEN: Waffles &amp;amp; Crepes is one of the ESSEN bonus tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing with the bonus tiles, players have one additional action during the Action phase. By placing their player token next to the bonus tiles, a player is allowed to either place a bonus disc on to a tile, or move one disc from one tile to another. If a disc is moved away away from a track, all progress made on that track is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bonus tiles are all intended for games with at least 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players are using one or two bonus tiles, use 1 bonus disc per player.&lt;br/&gt;When the players are using three or four bonus tiles, use 2 bonus discs per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESSEN: Waffles &amp;amp; Crepes&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, a waffle or a crepe with hazelnut-chocolate spread on it can make up for the paltry salary of booth staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When first placing a disc here, place it on the &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; space. In each subsequent activation of this tile, the disc advances on a track which corresponds to a discount of 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4 money when paying sellers during the Booth Setup phase. If a disc is moved away from this track, all progress is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
