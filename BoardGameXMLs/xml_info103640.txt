			<description>In Carr&amp;eacute;, each player has a set of sixteen tiles in different shapes which have to be stacked on his gameboard without hanging over the edges or leaving gaps in the structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player gets a chance to build his own tiles and to remove tiles other players have already built. At the start of his turn, a player rolls three dice. The player can now take his actions, paying for them using the dice:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     He may build one of more tiles. Each tile must be paid for with one or more dice, whose combined value is exactly the value of the tile.&lt;br/&gt;     He may buy one or two stop markers. These markers must be paid for with one or more dice, whose combined value is exactly five (for one marker) or ten (for two markers).&lt;br/&gt;     He may use a previously purchased stop marker to remove a tile from another player's stack. This must be paid for with one or more dice, whose combined value is exactly the value of the tile. If the player uses two stop markers, he may place his own matching tile on his own stack.&lt;br/&gt;     He may buy one or two bonus chips. These markers must be paid for with one or more dice, whose combined value is exactly one (for one chip) or eleven (for two chips). These bonus chips may be used to pay for actions; each chip counts as a die with value 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player has stacked all of his tiles on his game board, the game ends and that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
