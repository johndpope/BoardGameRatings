			<description>Game, Set &amp;amp; Match is a Tennis board game that uses a die and deck of cards for playing shots, and a board and pawn to show the position of the ball on court.&lt;br/&gt;Players serve by rolling a die marked Ace/Let/In/Out, then if the ball is in play, cards are played for each shot of the rally that determine the stroke played and the position of the ball on the court. Singles or doubles can be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
