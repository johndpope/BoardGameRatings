							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Angelic Vessel: Servant to the Gods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many who worship the Gods and are granted power by them. Some, however, are granted power beyond the God's other servants because of the strength of their devotion, their ability to surrender to their deity's will. These favored servants are guided and protected by the deity's most favored servants of all: Angels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Angelic Vessel acts as a host and conduit for the power of an Angel. This form of surrender grants the conduit protection, strength, and even the ability to channel the Angel's essence for short periods of time. It comes at a cost, however: the Angelic vessel must walk a narrow path, and must always seek to act according to the wishes of his deity and the Angel who shares his body. Should he ever waver, even for a moment, the Angel leaves his body and strips him of his powers until he atones for his sins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new Prestige Class for your D20 Fantasy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
