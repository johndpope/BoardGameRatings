			<description>The title of this game roughly translates to &amp;quot;Backpackers' free travels - 60 minutes to travel around the world&amp;quot;. The goal is to be the first player to reach 40 points through traveling to various famous tourist sights around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two game boards; one working board and one traveling board. Each player starts in his/her personal corner of the working board. The players take turns rolling two dice and moving around the board accordingly. A player landing on a personal working field gains experience. A player landing on another players working field triggers a bank payment to that payment, depending on that player's experience for that particular field. There are also travel fields on which a player collects a bus, train or flight ticket. A player moving on or over his/her personal starting space gets some money and another travel ticket (up to a maximum of five that can be held in the hand.). Additionally, s/he can decide to go traveling by moving his/her pawn to the traveling board. A player who is on the traveling board starts his/her turn by paying 500 Dollars, then rolling the dice and moving on the traveling board towards any of four tourist attractions that have been randomly marked. After doing the move determined by the dice, the player can use a ticket to influence his/her movement, as stated on the ticket (however, using the ticket costs dearly, too). If a marked tourist destination is reached, the player scores points. If at the beginning of a turn a player cannot afford further travel, s/he moves back to the working board, trying to raise more money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has reached a sum of 40 points, the game ends and that player is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
