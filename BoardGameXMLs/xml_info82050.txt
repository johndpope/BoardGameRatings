			<description>Barker Bill's Trick Shooting is an NES shooter made by Nintendo. It was released in 1990. It is based on the cartoon show titled Barker Bill's Cartoon Show, which was created by Paul Terry in 1952. Barker Bill's Cartoon Show was one of the earliest cartoon shows produced for television (formerly they were typically shown in cinemas and theaters only). Paul Terry, famous for his Terrytoons cartoons, bundled them together and had them presented by Barker Bill, a circus ringleader. Barker Bill was a static image and voiced by a presenter before the actual cartoons began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Barker Bill's Trick Shooting&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
