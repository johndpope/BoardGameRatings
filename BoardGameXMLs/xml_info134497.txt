							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Age: Council of the Clans</name>
									
			<description>In this tabletop political strategy game, players compete and co-operate with each other to create a community. Players gain honour by growing and managing their villages, and by interacting with other players. The more honour they gain, the better their position at the Landsmoot, a special democratic assembly where players vote for a Chieftain. Win the Landsmoot often enough, and you win the game as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Age was originally developed by a professor of philosophy to teach political science to his students. From the &amp;quot;soft power&amp;quot; of culture, trade, and diplomacy, to the &amp;quot;hard power&amp;quot; of the army, nearly every facet of real world politics is reproduced in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
