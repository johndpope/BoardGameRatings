			<description>A complex simulation about raising industrialization and associated incremental pollution. The game is unbalanced: Goal of the &amp;quot;Toxifax&amp;quot;-player is, to pollute the other countries until the are bankrupt. The &amp;quot;country&amp;quot;-players try to clean their towns and finally confirm a test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced by the former printing shop &amp;quot;Achilles&amp;quot; in Aachen on a very high quality level.&lt;br/&gt;The pawns are ink bottle caps in different colors.&lt;br/&gt;6 pages of rules were a high barrier at that time (not only for doctorates like Dr. Waldemar Lentz)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
