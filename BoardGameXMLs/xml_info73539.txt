							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NBA Inside Drive 2002</name>
									
			<description>From the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You think you got it? Then bring it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't just love the game. You exist for the game. You think, feel, sweat, and dream the game. So you won't settle for just another wannabe hoops sim. No, you've stepped up to the NBA Inside Drive 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's on and poppin', and this time you're out to prove that you've got the skills to pay the bills--on and off the court. With NBA Inside Drive, you're a player, coach, and manager--all in one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player, you can drop the dime off the pick and roll--or light 'em up from three-point land. With over 1000 animations, NBA Inside Drive2002 gives you a vast array of moves--including exclusive high-flying dunks that were motion captured from the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Champion, Vince Carter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the coach, you'll get to direct the action on the floor with Real-Time Coaching using playbooks created from actual NBA scouting reports and NBA coaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the general manager, you'll trade players and ink deals with free agents. You'll have to deal with major and minor injuries that could slow down players for a few days or even put them out of commission for the entire season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 200 individually modeled player heads, more than 10 custom body types, a full range of player accessories and shoes, and individual skin textures for each player deliver some of the most realistic-looking players ever seen in a video basketball game. Plus, each NBA arena has been individually modeled with painstaking detail, right down to the championship banners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And with Kevin Calabro and Marques Johnson sitting courtside with vibrant play-by-play and color commentary--along with Akemi Takei's sideline commentary for game analysis and injuries--NBA Inside Drive will get you into the game like never before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
