			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laleth Numandhyr was a celebrated elven bard in the kingdoms of elves and men alike.  While he was sometimes described as a little bit overambitious and hard to handle by his hosts, he wrote many significant pieces of art, and was even trying to incorporate his elven magical talent into his music, to create wondrous performances.  But all the fame and glory was not enough for Laleth.  There was still one thing to be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
