							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terminator Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A 2-player skirmish Game with a Terminator theme. One player is Skynet (Robots). The other player is the Resistance (Humans).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is undertaken on an 8x8 grid representing a destroyed city. The board is populated with terrain at the discretion of the players.  Terrain types include: wasteland (relatively clear), bone fields (demoralizing to humans), rubble (good hiding spots for humans), ruins (good hiding and cover) and massive debris (limiting movement and attack options)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side gets a set of units with differing movement abilities and strength (hits). Counters or chits are used to control movement around the board. Damage counters are used to keep track of the damage (hits lost) of the individual units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has his own unique deck of cards. Card types include: attack defence, movement and special. Cards may have limitations regarding which units they can be applied to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places his units in any of his last 3 rows. Units may not stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 Phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Supply Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 3 cards from your deck and place them in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Play cards from your hand (no limit). &lt;br/&gt;-   Use move cards to move one of your units up to the indicated number of spaces. Your opponent may use certain special cards to negate a move. &lt;br/&gt;-   Use attack cards to have a unit attack a target unit at the exact range indicated by the card and do damage to the target as indicated by the damage rating of the attack card.  Your opponent may use defence cards to reduce hits caused by an Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that destroys his opponent&amp;rsquo;s base first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
