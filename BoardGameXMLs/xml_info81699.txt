			<description>Moonbase Commander is a strategy computer game released in 2002 by Humongous Entertainment. In it, the player controls a main hub, which can send out other hubs, attack enemy structures, create defensive buildings, and collect energy for further expansion; this is accomplished through launching buildings and/or weapons from a hub. Each building is connected to its parent hub by a cord, which can not overlap other cords. The game features both single-player and multi-player formats. It won the &amp;quot;Best of 2002: The Game No One Played&amp;quot; award from IGN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Moonbase Commander&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
