							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whistler House</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gathering Awaits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A misty night, a darkened wood, a group of strangers travelling through the lonely English countryside on a moonlit ride... if this ain't the perfect setting for a tale of ghostly scares and frights, what is?! When the bus breaks down and the sinister glowing shape of the Wraith Hound bounds from the woods, the characters are chased through the door of Whistler House and to the edge of their sanity. Ensared in the mysterious, once-a-century event known as &amp;quot;The Gathering&amp;quot; and surrounded by a host of riddling ghosts, the PC's must unravel the ancient tragedy that fuels the madness within the mansion. They'd better hurry, too unless they want to join it forever - for midnight is coming and so is... the Whistler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whistler House is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 33pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
