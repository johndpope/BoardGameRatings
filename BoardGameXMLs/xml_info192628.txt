							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halo: Fleet Battles – Covenant Assault Carrier (CAS)</name>
									
			<description>Assault Carriers are monumental symbols of Covenant power, and among the deadliest implements wielded by the Prophets in their war against humanity. Each Assault Carrier is a potent instrument of conversion and compliance, capable of deploying thousands of troops and numerous fighter craft, backed by an array of devastating energy projectors that can burn entire continents to ash: a single CAS is sufficient to quell all but the most pernicious heresy, rebellion, or parasite outbreak. Colossally expensive to construct and few in number, the rare loss of an Assault Carrier is mourned by the entire Covenant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every major Covenant fleet has at least one Assault Carrier at its heart, if only because carriers themselves require a significant number of support vessels when operating away from High Charity or major outposts. Multiple carriers in a single fleet is unusual, but not unheard of. For example, the crusading Fleet of Sacred Consecration, commanded by the Prophet of Regret himself, is led by twin Assault Carriers, the Solemn Penance and Day of Jubilation. Together, these massive warships have scoured dozens of human worlds and bring righteous destruction to those within the Covenant who dare stand in the way of the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s holy mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 resin Assault Carrier&lt;br/&gt;    1 Medium/Small Sprue&lt;br/&gt;    1 custom Formation Base&lt;br/&gt;    1 Formation Sprue&lt;br/&gt;    4 Covenant Token Sheets&lt;br/&gt;    1 bag of 10 Halo Dice&lt;br/&gt;    2 Statistics Sheets&lt;br/&gt;    A5 Formation Overlay Sheets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
