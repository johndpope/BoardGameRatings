							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wintertop Fair</name>
									
			<description>From Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;A scenario book for HeroQuest, and the sequel to In Wintertop's Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a time for heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kerofini are disunited. The Red Moon chains them like thralls. She imprisons them, and her soldiers and servants besiege the last Exiles who cling to their ancient ways. The sacred mountain around which they live risks becoming their icy tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A leader must rise to free them. A liberator. Could you lead the Tarsh Exiles to freedom?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King's Ring meets in Wintertop, during the great Fair. All the tribes are there, as the men who would be king assemble. Who is fit to rule them all? Meanwhile, will the minions of the Red Moon sit idle, or will they prepare their own schemes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this is the Wintertop Fair, when all the tribes of the Exiles meet, to trade, to gossip, to compete, and to woo. In this complete scenario book, the heroes will not only find themselves drawn into the heart of Tarsh Exile politics and facing a renewed threat from scheming Lunar plotters, they will also be thrown into the rich life of the Exiles. From running with the bulls through the streets of the Fort, to judging disputes of blood and property, whether staking their claim to the 'champion's portion' and the honor that goes with it to venturing into the otherworlds in order to fight off a deadly disease which risks starving the Exiles into submission, your characters will soon realize how rich but also dangerous life can be, in Wintertop's shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
