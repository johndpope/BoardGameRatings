							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rules for World War I Naval</name>
									
			<description>Naval wargames rules covering the period 1914-1928. Designed to be played with 1:3000 models on a tabletop or 1:1200 models in a hall. Originally published in 1973. This entry based on the 1975 second edition. &lt;br/&gt;The rules have an introduction to the period followed by rule concepts and ship statistic calculation rules. Then firing guns and torpedoes, hitting mines, clearing mines fuel, submarines, ramming and weather are covered. The final section of the rulebook covers statistics for ships of the period plus where to buy models and get reference material: a task much easier now with the advent of the internet.&lt;br/&gt;The ground scale used is 1:6 and time scale is 1 minute per turn. &lt;br/&gt;Some preparation is required before play can commence as turning circles must be made and ship statistics calculated for the ships in action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
