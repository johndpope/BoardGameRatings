			<description>This is a simple race car game (predating PitchCar by decades) that's played by shooting wooden disks through an illustrated race course built inside its box. The rectangular box is 19.5&amp;quot; long and about as wide as a cribbage board. At one end is a start circle where the disks are placed at the start of a turn. A straight &amp;quot;racetrack&amp;quot; leads from the circle to the other end of the box, while a cardboard partition zigzags from side-to-side up the length of the box separating it into scoring areas (valued from 1-7). The partition has holes in it, illustrated to look like bridges, where it crosses the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player places his disk on the start circle and flicks it as straight as possible down the track. The farther down the track it goes, the more points the player scores. Points are recorded on pegboards along the edge of the box. The first player to score 20 points takes the checkered flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
