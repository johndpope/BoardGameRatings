			<description>(Summarized from the rules.  Published by Neil A. Kjos Music Co.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to &amp;quot;Slap Jack&amp;quot; this is an educational card game for 2-8 players to help learn music keys, signatures and chords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, the deck of Cat KEY cards are shuffled and set aside and then the Major KEY SIGNATURE cards, the Primary CHORD cards, and the WILD Mouse cards are shuffled together and dealt evenly among players.  A Cat KEY card is turned over to show what key the players are in, and which primary chords and key signatures they are looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns flipping over the top card from their deck and placing it in the central discard pile until the flipped card shows a Major KEY SIGNATURE or a Primary CHORD card belonging to the key of the Cat KEY card, then players race to &amp;quot;pounce&amp;quot; on it by slapping it with their hand.  The first to slap correctly adds the discard pile to his deck and then play continues.  If someone incorrectly slaps, he has to give a card from his deck to each other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who can collect the entire deck (or a majority, if playing with a time limit) is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
