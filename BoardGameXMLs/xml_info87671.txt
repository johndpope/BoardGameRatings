							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AZINCOURT</name>
									
			<description>Several versions of the battle have been produced. Each has been contrived to show a historic resolution, fun for the English player, depressing for the French. Azincourt (French spelling) is a unique approach. The French might have had more coordinated leadership. They might not have been so intent on an easy victory, and as a result been so careless. They might have taken advantage of the vulnerable English advance. They might have waited for the English to wear themselves out crossing the muddy field and allowed Henry to make the first attack. They might have employed their crossbows to better effect. Had they better control of their troops, crowded conditions would not have reduced combat effectiveness. Finally, had they considered avenues for retreating units, disruption of fresh units would not been such a problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Azincourt I address a number of these what-ifs but, moreover, I offer players the unique mechanic of commanding one flank of each opposing army. In effect players play BOTH the French AND the British. It works out much better than you would expect. Since the English line is necessarily pretty static, there is little problem in coordinating an English defense while splitting command of the French in the face of the enemy mirrors the historically poor French command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Azincourt is a card assisted, counter and hex game utilizing large colorful counters and a variety of aids that allows for a key battle component which other versions neglect to emphasize - the capture of nobles for ransom. Integral to Azincourt play is the capture of these nobles, English and French (including King Henry), of varying value. Ah and then there are the complications that such nobles bring. Wounded nobles become easy targets. Captured nobles make targets of their captors. Then there are Henry's terrible archers ... who WILL run out of arrows, and then what? To add to the game's variety is a random set-up and reinforcemnt schedule that toys with a number of possible historical possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playtesting has been a blast so far but continues so no publisher has yet committed. Still, all in good time...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
