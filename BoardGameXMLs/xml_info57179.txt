			<description>Can three different games and several variants be played on one board? Yes, with Huwelijksgeluk (Conjugal Bliss, or more literally translated Marital Luck) it's possible. As the title says: this is all about luck, because in life and in games we all need a little luck. &lt;br/&gt;Created as a gift for our wedding guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a 7 by 7 grid with different numbers in the squares. Players move by rolling two dice. The added numbers of the diceroll must be the same as the sum of the squares the players are moving through (and end up in).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three different kind of games: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a simple racing game: arrive first on the starting spot of your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;     a cooperative game: collect as many numbers as possible and try to enter the centre of the board before you run out of movement possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;     a tactical jumping game: form lines to move faster over the board. Try to enter the centre of the board first. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
