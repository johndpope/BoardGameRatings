							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neo Monks: The Dragonlord</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the Dragonlord Monk lacks in pure brute strength is balanced by an inner peace that few could dream of. By tapping into her very soul, she is able to unleash the fury of her own dragon soul, at the dismay of those who would challenge her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this product you will find a full 20th-level monk, right at your fingertips. With art by Larry Elmore, this new book is a must for monk fans everywhere (or perhaps those who always wanted a better Monk!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While not as powerful in unarmed combat as their core monk counterparts, the Dragonlord is armed with an array of dragon-like powers, and will be a welcome addition to any adventuring party. &lt;br/&gt; New Abilities include: Soul Edge, Dragon Reciprocation, Dragon Stomp, Dragon Scream, Soul Knife, Frightful Strength, Essense of the Dragon, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product comes with a portrait pdf (fully bookmarked) for easy printing, Landscape pdf (fully bookmarked) for easy online reading, and our standard Rich-Text-Document version for easy cut / copy / paste (because we know how much it sucks to do that in Acrobat Reader).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
