			<description>From the media kit:&lt;br/&gt;In Roundabout Five, players compete as individuals on teams that randomly change their composition and size on every turn (Dynamic Teams). On regular game cards, teams encounter trivia, odd comparisons (Which happened first? The United States attacks Libya or the Culture Club releases Do You Really Want to Hurt Me) , riddles, jokes, math and grammar problems. Second Option cards introduce elements such as debate (Would Daffy or Donald Duck last longer on the cartoon version of Survivor?), charades and personal trivia (Was I born before or after Woodstock?) to the game, creating a whole new level of fun. R5 can be played by 3 or more adult players for a total point objective, select number of turns or within any given time constraint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.roundaboutfive.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.roundaboutfive.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
