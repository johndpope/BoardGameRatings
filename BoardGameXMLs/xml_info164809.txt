			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Gone Wild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great thing about GURPS is that its skill list covers not only classic adventuring tasks like combat, covert ops, and unsafe driving, but also social interactions, sciences, parrot-training, basket-weaving . . . And now, thanks to this new supplement, GURPS comes with options that can enhance certain action-oriented playing styles: wildcard skills that modify character sheets by replacing many standard skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Power-Ups 7: Wildcard Skills greatly amplifies on the few words in the GURPS Basic Set, giving you all of the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; wildcard skills published up to November 2013 (more than 65 of them), plus:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Answers to questions about how wildcard skills interact with such fundamental concepts as bonuses, controlling attributes, defaults, and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;     Advice on defining new wildcard skills in terms of high concept, skill count, and skill breadth, with extra detail on those that simplify character templates, martial-arts styles, and supernatural abilities.&lt;br/&gt;     Optional rules for wildcard skills to relax penalties, combine multiple wildcards, grant bonuses that reach beyond skill rolls, enhance critical successes, and even bend the story itself!&lt;br/&gt;     Discussion of how to use wildcard skills in your campaign, ranging from &amp;quot;no wildcards&amp;quot; all the way up to &amp;quot;wildcards only.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     Wild speculation, such as wildcard techniques and wildcard advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoy cinematic, streamlined gaming without massive skill lists, then get GURPS Power-Ups 7: Wildcard Skills and see a whole new side of GURPS: the wild side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
