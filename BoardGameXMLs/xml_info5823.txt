			<description>UNO stands for United Nations Organization (i.e., the UN).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game two players take both the roles of industrialized countries and as well as the role of a developing countries.  The game is driven by chance cards, which have different effects for the industrial and developing countries (and also are different at different stages of the game).  Players buy improvements of various sorts in an effort to earn &amp;quot;honors,&amp;quot; but equal points are awarded at the end of the game for having the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
