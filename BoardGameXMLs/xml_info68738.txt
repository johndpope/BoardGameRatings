			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back with a Vengeance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minionomicon: the minion and widget building supplement for RandomAnime. Building upon RandomAnime's already fast and versatile universal role-playing game system, Minionomicon introduces expanded rules for fanatical cohorts, powerful magic items, and amazing technological gizmos!  The Minionomicon supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded minion creation rules. Create and customize exotic faceless minions to add variety and challenge to your games. Battle your characters against ravenous zombies, winged monkeys, or even swarms of robotic killer bees!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded widget creation rules. Build and customize weapons, armor, tools, and even musical instruments just the way you want them with Minionomicon's new point-based widget creation rules. Use your widgets in the game and upgrade them with the Style Points you earn to make them even more powerful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over 50 new gimmicks for minions, widgets, and characters. Summon hordes of ninja, create plague-bearing zombies, combine skeletons into fearsome patchwork bone monsters, and take control of your opponents' minions. Create magical healing potions, ultra cool gun-swords, retractable ninja lines, flying carpets, and even city-smashing super cannons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New game mechanics and action systems add even more versatility to your RandomAnime games. Build and repair items and weapons, assemble cunning traps, use group battle tactics to gang up on your opponents, or blast your way to victory with powerful explosives. Minionomicon even includes hints on how to fine-tune your games for just the right balance of cinematic style and over-the-top action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minionomicon: Because you can never have too much of a good thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
