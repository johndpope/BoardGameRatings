			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting new way to play with words.  Letters, instead of dots, turn this popular classic into a dashing, two-dimensional game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using basic domino rules, the object of the game is for players to take turns placing their lettered tiles &amp;quot;domino fashion&amp;quot; to build words and create a domino crossword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends when one player uses up all his tiles and the bank is empty.  Points are deducted for tiles left in anyone's hand.  And the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find 50 tiles, each with numbered score points and two letters arranged horizontally on one side, vertically on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
