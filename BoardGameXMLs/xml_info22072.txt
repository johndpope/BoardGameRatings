			<description>Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Box with game rules printed on the top lid&lt;br/&gt;One rectangular board&lt;br/&gt;16 wooden disks (four for each player)&lt;br/&gt;three spinners&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idea of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player must get their four travelers (wooden disks) from the starting square along a path of spiraling squares to the &amp;quot;Inn&amp;quot; (the finishing square.)  Players alternate turns spinning a spinner and moving one of their travelers the indicated number of spaces.  Players cannot move a traveler to a space that is already occupied.  Along the path is a &amp;quot;highwayman&amp;quot; space that requires the traveler to stop until the &amp;quot;highwayman&amp;quot; is paid (payment is made by spinning the correct color.) First player to get all four of their travelers to the Inn wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
