			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A role-playing game (RPG) is a cooperative experience between multiple participants. At its simplest, it can be described as an organized form of group make-believe, with a set of rules and procedures to keep things consistent and fair. The goal is not to win &amp;ndash; there are no real &amp;ldquo;winners&amp;rdquo; in a role-playing game &amp;ndash; but simply to have a good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Live-action role-playing game (LARP) involves participants physically acting out their characters' actions. This includes interacting with other characters through conversation, exploring the environment, and potentially taking part in physical combat with specially designed props and weapons. Participants will most often wear costume appropriate to the setting of the game, carry with them all the gear their character may need to use, and are expected to maintain their character&amp;rsquo;s persona in all situations. The game may be anywhere from a few hours to two days in duration, so participants are asked to bring all costume, props, etc., that they may think applicable to each game type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules and guidelines in place to ensure the game proceeds in a fair manner, and all participants are expected to follow these and answer honestly to any questions put to them in relation to the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chimera Productions aims to create a safe environment in which everyone can participate in all aspects of LARP. This book contains details of these game rules, guidelines for behaviour whilst at an event, and some information on the setting of the game. A further book containing details of the world of Dantir, cultural and background elements will be available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
