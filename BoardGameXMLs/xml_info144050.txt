Having each faction its own characteristics. For example: air elementals are faster, and can pass through other element spaces, while earth elementals are very hard to capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team has 15 pieces in four levels, higher level (4) are stronger and dangerous but have less movement capability.
