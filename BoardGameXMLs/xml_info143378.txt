			<description>The conquest of medieval Europe is one which battles kings and countries to dominate these lands through trade, attack, defense, strategic placement, movement and expansion. One requires the strategy of planning for successful offensive military execution as well as for defensive game play, and while the roll of the die may determine specific results, both bold offensives and conservative defensives shall impact the overall outcome. Only with banners held high and rule held sound would the victor reign medieval Europe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Castle Toppe - The Game of Sovereigns, players attempt to gain rule of medieval Europe through trade, building, expansion, and conquest.  Game play is pulsed with Event Cards which can advantage or disadvantage a player's resources, buildings and tactics.  Players can both strategically defend or aggressively conquest with boldness.  Boats and Ships are even used in expansions and battles.  The player to first successfully fly 5 banners (obtained through building a castle and/or a ship) in at least three ruling countries wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
