			<description>An abstract auction game for the piecepack. Each turn consists of the following steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The player who won the last auction takes the four dice and rolls them. The rolls determine the rules of this auction.&lt;br/&gt;   2. All players take one tile from their hand as their bid, and place it face-down. When all players have chosen, turn all tiles face-up. The highest value wins the auction (null is zero, Ace is one).&lt;br/&gt;   3. The tile played by the winner is given to the second-highest bidder, who in turn gives their tile to the third-highest bidder, and so on. The winner of the auction takes the lowest bidder&amp;rsquo;s tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to reach 100 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
