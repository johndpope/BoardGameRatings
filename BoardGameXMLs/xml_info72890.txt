			<description>The game consists of a metal frog which is put into a water basin (an empty fish tank, a bucket, whatever) and covered with water. The frog contains a hinge so the top part (the &amp;quot;mouth&amp;quot;) can open. Each player receives a long straw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players now take turns blowing air under the frog's head. The aim is to be the last person to blow without the frog opening its mouth (thus releasing the air). When the frog opens its mouth, the last player to blow before the current player receives a point. The game is played until a certain number of points is reached by a player.&lt;br/&gt;When the first player to blow makes the frog open its mouth, all other players receive a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frogs were handmade as art objects by Reinhold Wittig from scrap metal (small copies with soup ladles, larger ones with drinking troughs), and there are also some unique designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
