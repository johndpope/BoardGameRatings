Japanese have air superiority, the first Japanese tank army, Andean mountain units and Ethiopian guerrillas and other Japanese units against the Italian Army (same units as the Italian army of 1936 in Lion of Ethiopia). The Afrika Korps, British SS legions and Arab SS cavalry legions enter as reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map. &lt;br/&gt;Divisional level with a few brigades/regiments/battalions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
