			<description>Unng&amp;aring; stuing is a children's card game that is bundled with &amp;quot;U&amp;AElig;&amp;AElig;H!&amp;quot;. It consists of sets of four equal cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Unng&amp;aring; stuing&amp;quot; is played exactly as &amp;quot;Svarteper&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;Old Maid&amp;quot;, but there are four cards in each set and three copies of Stuing/Svarteper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before starting, one card named &amp;quot;Stuing&amp;quot; (Stew) is removed from the deck, and the players then draw cards from the previous player. Any pair is immediately discarded. At the end, one Stuing card is left, and the player holding that card is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
