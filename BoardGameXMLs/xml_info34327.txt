							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mummy&#039;s Message</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides exposing the players to interesting and fascinating facts about ancient Egyptian culture, the Mummy's Message classroom simulation game allows each of the players to experience the thrills, frustrations, and horrible dangers as they become archeologists traveling through the interior of a pyramid. The 50 Problem Cards and the possible impact that facing these dangers have on the expeditionary teams&amp;rsquo; successful progress through the pyramid, took three years of research alone. As the players will discover, archeological expeditions into pyramids encountered many physical and emotional challenges as the result of the sadistic mind of the pyramid builder, who incorporated deadly traps in order to frustrate and confuse grave robbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three groups are created, each with two competing archeological teams (approximately five players per team). The teams progress through the pyramid by correctly answering Question Cards, selecting a Passage Progress Card and collecting Hieroglyphic Cards, each with a hieroglyphic symbol and the translation of that symbol. Although most of the symbols were created to resemble actual hieroglyphics, the simulated experiences encountered as the players collect, piece together, and correctly translate a real message from a hieroglyphic tablet, is authentic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the two competing archeological teams is to travel to each of the three chambers; the Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s Burial Chamber, the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Burial Chamber and the Great Hall. As each chamber is entered, a piece or several pieces of a Hieroglyphic Tablet is/are discovered. Using the Hieroglyphic Cards accumulated, the team that can correctly piece together and translate the Mummy's Message wins the simulation game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
