							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princess Pony Trek</name>
									
			<description>A pre-teens game for girls, published in an annual for Princess Comic fans. A Goose-type game, spin and move, obeying any instructions on the squares you land on. First to 60, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules:&lt;br/&gt;First you will need a top with numbers on it which you can make yourself out of a piece of plain postcard and a matchstick (see the picture above), or a dice.&lt;br/&gt;Two or three of you can play this game and you will need a small coloured counter each (or a coloured bead) to represent you on your pony as you trek along. Each of you must throw the dice or spin the top in turn, and go forward the number of squares shown by the top of the dice, or the side of the top that comes to rest on the table.&lt;br/&gt;But when you have reached the proper square you must follow any instructions that are lettered beside it. The winner is the one who gets back home first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
