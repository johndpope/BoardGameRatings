			<description>It is the distant future. The world has become a dangerous place where the balance of power rests between opposing forces known as Factions. These groups manipulate and influence the citizens of the Community in an effort to join their side and vanquish the opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Faction uses movement and control to turn the tide against their opposition. By expanding influence over the Community, power can be acquired. Choose a side and become the Master of Wills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master of Wills can be played one-versus-one or two-versus-two. It&amp;rsquo;s all about moving the cards&amp;mdash;you want to move as many points to your side of the board as possible while your opponent is trying to do the same for their side. Community cards are each assigned a value, and each card is represented by a character from one of the eight sectors of the Community. Moving those cards can trigger the basic movement of other cards on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards move from a neutral area in the middle of the board toward your side or the opponent&amp;rsquo;s side through three rows. Each row represents how close the character is to joining your Faction. The rows are called Recruits, Loyalists, and Allies. Each row represents how loyal the character is to your side. If they reach your Allies, those points are locked in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game begins, each player will choose a Faction and build a deck of Faction cards that caters to their own style. These Faction cards allow for even more powerful card movement. For instance, let&amp;rsquo;s say you choose a Faction card that says, &amp;ldquo;Choose any card from your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Recruits or Loyalists and move to your Allies.&amp;rdquo; Then imagine your opponent has a card with a 15-point value in their Loyalists row. You can snatch up that valuable card and lock it into the Allies row on your side of the board, giving you a large number of points and taking those same points away from the opponent. A single, well-timed Faction card can be a serious game changer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
