			<description>Simple 2-8 player card game with two separate decks that will comprise a players hand or cards immediately played - the &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; deck and the &amp;quot;Draw&amp;quot; deck.  The red Work cards cards adds hours worked to your hand.  The Draw deck is split between blue &amp;quot;Dick Off&amp;quot; cards that subtract hours worked to your hand and green cards that are played (read) immediately, then discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players receive four Work cards, then, in turn order, they draw a card from the Draw deck until a &amp;quot;Time Cards Due&amp;quot; card is revealed.  As players draw cards from the Draw deck they either read and immediately play the green cards or add to their hand the blue &amp;quot;Dick Off&amp;quot; cards.  Once the &amp;quot;Time Cards Due&amp;quot; is drawn, the round ends and players add their &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; card hours and subtract their &amp;quot;Dick Off&amp;quot; card hours for their net score.  Play continues over a series of rounds (determined by the players) with the player with the lowest number of hours worked declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
