			<description>A Cat's Life it's a family game for 3 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take the role of a domestic cats. They have to struggle to keep high their moral since they aren't alone in the house and there is not space for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also they must be careful with the actions they do. If the actions are good for the eyes of it's owner, they can get great profits. But, if they are catched fighting, scracthing the curtains or eating from the trash they will suffer the wrath of their owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed by a modular game board and a set of action tiles. Each time you play the game, the board and the distribution of the action tiles will be different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of four pawns numbered from 1 to 4. By turns, they place the pawns on the board, actions or rooms. First the  number 1 pawn of all players, and following this way till they place the last number 4.&lt;br/&gt;Then they reveal the destination of the owner of the cats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now begins the actions phase. First the owner moves one room towards his destination, then the players remove by turns their pawn number 1 executing it's action. They follow this way till they remove the four pawn of all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the owner is in the same room than a pawn, the player has a reward or a punishment depending if the action is legal or illegal. If two or more players are in the same action tile with the same number, they has to fight for the action since only one player can make the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can run to reach faraway rooms, hunt for tresors, make meow to call the owner and perform some skills to break the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has seven rounds, the player with more victory points at the end of the seventh round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
