			<description>Developer Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;June, 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years. &lt;br/&gt;By day there are cicadas, and by night, the higurashi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hinamizawa, a small village in the Japanese countryside. &lt;br/&gt;While there are fewer than two thousand people there, every year, 'something' happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 4 years, someone has died, and someone else has gone missing. &lt;br/&gt;This series of deaths and disappearances is connected to the local resistance against a now-abandoned dam construction project. &lt;br/&gt;A murder during the construction, covered up by the local authorities, is being re-enacted year after year. &lt;br/&gt;Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone who was supposed to be there... isn't. &lt;br/&gt;Someone who wasn't supposed to be there... is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone who was alive last night is now dead, and someone who is here right now isn't alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no way to avert this tragedy. There is no choice but to give up trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even so... please don't give up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
