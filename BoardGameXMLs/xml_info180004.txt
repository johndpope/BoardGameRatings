			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human Feats is our latest Mythic Mini devoted to feats of ambition and daring for that most versatile, adaptable, and ubiquitous of all fantasy races: humanity itself! This product contains 15 mythic feats for both helping your heroic humans try anything and achieve everything, taking out and dishing out unimaginable amounts of punishment, from Fast Learner to Surge of Success, Fearless Curiosity to Martial Versatility, and Inexplicable Luck to Improved Improvisation (say that five times fast)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Minis are short, inexpensive products designed to take one rules concept or set of Pathfinder RPG rules and bring them to you in a new way for the mythic rules, including converting existing rules as well as introducing entirely new rule options. Created by the same designers that helped bring you the official mythic rules, Mythic Minis skip the fluff and give you all crunch, all the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows mythic like Legendary Games, and whether it's new mythic feats, class abilities, path abilities, magic items, or anything else, every Mythic Mini delivers a delicious dollop of dazzling design that will fill out your mythic experience one slice at a time. Check for a new Mythic Mini every Monday to make your game just a little more Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
