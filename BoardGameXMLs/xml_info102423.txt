			<description>Test Drive 6 is a cross-platform racing game, first released in 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cop Chase mode is expanded to allow the player to earn credits for every arrested vehicle, which can be used to wage bets in single race and tournaments. A vehicle is arrested by turning the vehicle's morale bar completely red. Morale decreases when the racer's vehicle is blocked and contacted by a police car, and increases when the racer's vehicle passes a police car or evades police car pursuit for an extended period of time and distance.&lt;br/&gt;Challenge mode allows the player to earn credits by completing the course within the posted time limit. After successfully completing a challenge, an extra challenge level is unlocked (if one exists), and the completion time becomes the new challenge mode time limit to gain credits through the course.&lt;br/&gt;In Single Race, player can wage 500-2000 credits per race. The opponent vehicles have the same class as player's chosen vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;In Tournament, player must have at least 1 vehicle of a particular class to compete in tournaments of the respective class. There are 2 tournaments per class. In addition to betting between races, portions of the bets are also directed to the tournament pot as grand prize. The grand prize is awarded to the vehicle that completes all tracks with the least amount of total time. Upgrading can be performed between races, but not switching vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;Stop the Bomber Mode is unlocked by arresting all 5 cars in London, Paris, Rome, New York, and Hong Kong tracks in Cop Chase mode.&lt;br/&gt;Drag Race mode was removed in this release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Test Drive 6&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
