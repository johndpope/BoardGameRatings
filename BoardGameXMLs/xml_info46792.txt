			<description>&amp;quot;Biancaneve e i tre porcellini&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the series collection: &amp;quot;I giochi del Duemila&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;32 pages booklet. Characters' profiles and cardboard heros must be cut from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet, whose title means &amp;quot;Snow White and the Three Little Pigs&amp;quot;, includes all the informations and materials that allow to play On Stage! in the world of the classic fairy tales. All of them are mixed in a single, twisted situation that the player have to face: there is a single Blue Prince that has to deal with Snow White, Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty; the wolf has to deal with Red Little Hood and the Three Little Pigs; the Hunter hunting him is at the service of the Queen, Snow White's stepmother, but he has also a guilty secret since he abandoned his own very little son in the wood...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The booklet includes the special rules to set-up the game, the special places where to set up scenes in the fairy tale world, some special rules for particular characters, a list of magic items, some notes on the political structure of the fairy tale world (where there are quite a lot of queens, princes and kings), a list of 48 non-players characters and a crazy &amp;quot;Arabian Nights&amp;quot; variant lasting 1001 scenes instead than the usual 12/15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
