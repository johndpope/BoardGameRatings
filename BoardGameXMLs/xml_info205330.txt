							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fatalism</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing one is about to die offers little recourse. There is a constant consuming fear that gnaws at all of the group. Each tree is a loose collection of branches waiting to fall, every wire a new possible garrote, a pair of headlights in another grill to be splayed across, and none have used an elevator in months. Despite this morbid overhang most most prefer it to the alternative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fatalism is a prime example of the survival horror genre. In fatalism there is no greater good. One is simply is fighting for one's own existence, more often than not this may require rather unsavory interaction between players. In fatalism however, instead of some forgotten horror terrorizing the world players will rail against fate. Of course, one person will survive, in case things prove interesting enough for there to be a sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
