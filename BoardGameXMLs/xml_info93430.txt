							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conflict of Heroes: Blitzkrieg â€“ France and the Lowlands 1940</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;We will prevail because we are the strongest&amp;rdquo;  French Prime Minister Edouard Dalladier, September 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The West, May 1940. After the fall of Poland the French and British are preparing themselves to face a new, bold kind of war: &amp;ldquo;Blitzkrieg&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supreme Commander Marshall Gamelin is confident he can hold back the German armies long enough to give its army time to re-equip and prepare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Franco-German border solidly defended by the fortified Maginot line, he develops an aggressive plan: the allies will race North to meet the enemy in Belgium and Holland, and stop it cold on the Dyle-Breda line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the Germans have chosen an unexpected, almost scandalous plan: its aim is nothing else than the utter destruction of the whole allied army by breaking through the &amp;ldquo;impassable&amp;rdquo; Ardennes Forest, further to the South.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attack through the Low Lands is an immense feint, aimed at luring the French and British armies North and trap them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then begins an implacable race against the clock, as panzer spearheads emerge to the south of the allied armies and run at breakneck speed to the sea. The Allied High command watches horrified the panzer columns emerging on its back. The nervous German High Command is every bit as worried that its spearheads might get isolated and shattered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the armored tide can be stemmed, or is defeat all but assured?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blitz 1940 is a new Conflict of Heroes game that depicts the western campaign of May-June 1940. It pits the French, British, Belgian and Dutch armies against their arch-enemy, Germany. The battles take place in plains, forests, cities, airfields, in the skies and on the seashore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are presented with the same tactical dilemmas and decisions that commanders faced during some of the most ferocious engagements of WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict of Heroes (CoH) follows the evolution of modern tactics, from WWII to the present. CoH features a fast and fluid system that is easy to learn, but realistic for every unique theater of battles portrayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Fun: Quick simultaneous play allows players to interact without waiting.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Easy: Teach a new player how to play in under 5 minutes. No charts!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Historically Accurate: Portrays realistic forces and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Units: Depict individual vehicles, airplanes, boats, guns and squads.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Consistent: Each game in the series uses the same rule system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blitz 1940 includes:&lt;br/&gt;4 - 15x19 inch geomorphic mounted map boards that integrate with the maps of all other CoH games.&lt;br/&gt;280 - LARGE 1&amp;rdquo; square counters that include infantry, tanks, guns, aircraft an even ships.&lt;br/&gt;2 - player summary sheets, customized plastic counter storage tray,&lt;br/&gt;32 page firefight book with a full historical overview and 16+ firefights.&lt;br/&gt;A rule book organized to lead in the player through the rules, with plenty of examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blitz 1940 is an original game and does not require any other Conflict of Heroes game to be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
