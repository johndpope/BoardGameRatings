							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavernous Lake Expansion Set</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third installment in the breath-taking Cavernous Water series, and it provides some very cool new pieces to give collectors MANY more options with their Cavernous Lake set-ups. Some of the pieces are straightforward but highly useful 4&amp;rdquo; x 4&amp;rdquo; pieces that are mostly open water with some different corners having some land so they can be connected with other pieces to form peninsulas and other interesting shorelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other pieces are more specialized, but they make up for it in their awesome appearance. The 3D Lake Whirlpool piece is sure to be a player favorite, and the Stepping Stones piece will offer some fun (and dangerous) adventuring scenarios. Also, Stefan has sculpted a really sweet Lake Landing piece (with veins of mineral deposits) that can be used in many ways. It even comes complete with a removable wall and door so it can be used in many ways &amp;ndash; including providing the entrance to the lair of some mysterious tribal band who likes to decorate their bamboo door with the skulls of curious adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Stefan has included a piece that many collectors have clamored for since the first Cavern Set came out in 2000. It is a Lake Stairs piece that is designed to fit snuggly up against a cavern wall so that collectors can finally add some raised areas to their set ups. The piece can also be placed in the middle of a lake to act as an island of sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MM-031 Cavernous Lake Expansion Set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lake Landing x1&lt;br/&gt;Lake Landing Wall x1&lt;br/&gt;Lake Landing Bamboo Door x1&lt;br/&gt;Lake Stairs x2&lt;br/&gt;Lake Single Shore x3&lt;br/&gt;Lake Opposed Shores x2&lt;br/&gt;Lake Triple Shores x2&lt;br/&gt;Lake Stepping Stones x2&lt;br/&gt;Lake Whirlpool x1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
