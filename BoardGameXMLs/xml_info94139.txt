							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Love or Money</name>
									
			<description>For Love or Money is based on an Australian TV game show first broadcast in 1959 on ABC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prize card is drawn and placed on the board (examples of prizes are fridges, drills and lawn mowers).  Along with the prize's value, each prize card also has a code on it.  The code is input into the Money Machine in the centre of the board and corresponds to a cash prize amount in shillings.  The code is input by turning two knobs on the board until the correct numbers are displayed.  A random question from the question book is read out which all players can answer,  The player to give the correct answer can choose to take either the prize card, or go for the cash prize displayed on the Money Machine.  If they select to go for the cash, a dial on the Money Machine is spun to determine the outcome.  Getting a question wrong means a player loses a life, and when all three are lost, they are out of the game.  There is also a jackpot prize to be played for.  The winner is the player with the most money and prizes at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;Another Chad Valley Television Game: For Love or Money - With the 'Magic Flying Shilling' Sign.
