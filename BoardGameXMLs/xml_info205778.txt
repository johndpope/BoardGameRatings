							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spin It</name>
									
			<description>This two-player game from Milton Bradley comes with two acorn-shaped wooden tops and a target sheet of cardboard inset in the box bottom. The sheet has 18 holes with values ranging from 5 to 100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns spinning their tops and recording the value each time it stops. First player to 500 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earliest version of this game has a box cover showing two children playing the game on a small table, with a rural landscape seen through the window behind them. While the game is undated, the style of the graphics and the &amp;quot;Bradley's Best Games&amp;quot; logo on the box suggests a 19th Century or early 20th Century publication date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
