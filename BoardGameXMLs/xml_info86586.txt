			<description>This game is from Volume Sprayer Mfg Co of Tulsa Oklahoma and was produced in 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with money in 1,000, 500,100,and 50 dollar denominations, 36 yellow and green combination cards and 36 red and black combination cards. The game also has 2 Dudecahedron dice (12 sided)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the number combination cards are placed face down and each player draws a card and places it face up. The first player  decides if he  is rolling red or yellow. The dice are then rolled and anyone who has a card showing on the table with the combination that has been rolled wins. If no one wins then they all keep the first card and turn over another one. The player must always declare the color that he is rolling. The accumulated cards that you have increases the payoff if you have a winning card.  (you hold 6 cards, 4 red and 2 yellow. The roller declares Red and rolls a 3 and a 9. One of your red cards has that 3 and 9 grouping so you win the value of the roll times 4 for the number of red cards that you have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time limit is suggested as to when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
