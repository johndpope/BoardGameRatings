			<description>The Anchorhead Cantina Skirmish Map is now entering the tournament rotation for Imperial Assault, and this neoprene playmat offers the perfect play surface, showing the tangled hallways and common rooms of the cantina, along with the junkyard outside. Measuring 26&amp;rdquo; by 26&amp;rdquo;, this playmat features the entire map printed directly onto its surface, ensuring that your setup never takes more than seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you play, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of room around the borders of the playmat for you to set up your Deployment cards and tokens, as well as handy references for each team&amp;rsquo;s starting setup zones. You&amp;rsquo;ll even find additional copies of the Anchorhead Cantina Skirmish cards included with this playmat, giving you everything you need for the definitive Imperial Assault skirmish experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this playmat draws you and your opponent deeper into the Star Wars universe with evocative artwork of two characters who called Tatooine home. On one side, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the relentless bounty hunter Greedo, eager to earn a reputation as a fearless hunter. Across from him, you can see the old Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi, now emerging from his self-imposed exile to aid the Rebel Alliance once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
