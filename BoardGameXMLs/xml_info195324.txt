							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nuns of the Bone Goddess</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For decades there was a monastery on Skull Mountain. The&lt;br/&gt;presence of the nuns there was thought to be a ward against the possible evil the mountain represented &amp;mdash; and the evil the mountain contained. But then the corruption set in, and though it remained hidden for a long, long time, it was finally discovered by a group of travelling mendicants. The sole survivor of their group delivered the news to the church and Saint Anglard was dispatched to destroy the nuns and the perverted, heretical goddess they idolated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was a man renowned for his ability to root out evil, but after razing the monastery to the ground, Saint Anglard still fled from the ruins in horror. He was reticent to speak of it after, not that he had much chance to do so. His next mission was his last, and some believe his experiences on Skull Mountain contributed to that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
