			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animate Your Game Today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2015 is a compilation of all the material produced in 2015 for Necromancers of the Northwest&amp;rsquo;s popular article lines Best in Class, Obscure Arcana, Magic Market, and Exotic Encounters, plus a few additional extras scattered in. With over 180 pages of gaming content, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to believe that this book was a full year in the making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somehow, we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to pack no less than 40 combined archetypes, bloodlines, and spirits, a new base class called the cultist (plus three cults to choose from), over 125 new spells, ranging from 0-level to 9th-level, and providing something for every spell list at every spell level, nearly 120 brand new magic items, plus 20 monsters from CR 1 to 20, six new templates, 10 detailed NPCs each with unique special abilities not found anywhere else, and 5 new player races, all in one single, massive tome of exciting new content for your Pathfinder game. With A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Almanac: 2015, you&amp;rsquo;ll have all the options to make exactly the character you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what&amp;rsquo;s more, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to search through dozens of articles to find it. Everything has been collected, archived, and gathered in an organized fashion. Even better, the digital version boasts not only extensive bookmarking, but also hyperlinked tables and spell lists, allowing you to jump straight to an item, monster, or spell with a single click.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
