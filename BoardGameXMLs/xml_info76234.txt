			<description>[Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_White_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_White_2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black &amp;amp; White 2 is a video game developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Electronic Arts and later by Feral Interactive as a port to Mac OS X. It blends real-time strategy, city building and god game  elements. It was released on October 7, 2005 as stated on the official Lionhead website, but to those who preordered it arrived on October 5, 2005 from most sources. The Mac OS X version, however, was not released until January 6, 2009 [2]. It is the sequel to 2001's Black &amp;amp; White, also the brainchild of Peter Molyneux. The lead designers are Peter Molyneux and Ron Millar, who previously worked at Blizzard Entertainment on titles such as StarCraft and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
