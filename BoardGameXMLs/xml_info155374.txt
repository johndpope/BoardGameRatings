			<description>RE:VERSUS is all about getting points on the board and stealing from your opponents! Combine your cards to score quickly, but beware -- the other side is out to get your points too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 83 cards in the deck. They are numbered 1-10, twice. There are also 2 Re:Versus, 2 Wilds and 2 combo Re:Versus/Wild cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a white half and a black half. The two players (or two teams) each choose a color and draw seven cards. They must then play these cards in sets of three (either three-of-a-kind or a run of three) according to the number that is on the side of their respective color (white or black).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn includes drawing a card, scoring (by laying down a Meld of three cards, as previously explained), and discarding a card. Melds (or sets) are scored by adding their values (e.g. three 2's would be 6 points; a run of 4, 5, 6 would be 15 points). Melds can also be stolen from the other player by setting down the same Meld, but in your color. The opponent's Meld that the active player matched then goes into the active player's hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special cards in the deck allow for &amp;quot;wilds&amp;quot; in the sets as well as the two players switching colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn ends after the active player has discarded a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has scored 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
