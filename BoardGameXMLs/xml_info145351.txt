							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agrik: Order of Mamaka, Master of Steel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Mamaka, Master of Steel, is the most politically powerful clerical order in the H&amp;acirc;rnic church of Agrik, the evil god of war and violence. The order's grandmaster is the Agrikan church's highest representative on H&amp;acirc;rn and the order's control over the H&amp;acirc;rnic church is threatened by the other Agrikan orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Mamaka reveres weaponcrafting and alchemy as the practical worship of Mamaka of Mameka, the Holy Smith of Balgashang. The order, which refers to itself as the &amp;quot;Masters of Steel,&amp;quot; produces the fabled Mamakan Blades wielded by its clerics and their sponsored fighting order, the Warriors of Mameka. The priest-artificers of the Masters of Steel use alchemical formulas recorded in their holy scripture to produce some of the most terrifying weapons known to contemporary warcraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order defines much of their religious practice in terms of testing and ordeal and Mamakan ceremonies are acts of mental or physical torture leading to the &amp;quot;Sacrifice of blood and pain.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
