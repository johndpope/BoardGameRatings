							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leaves: Earth Operating System</name>
									
			<description>Leaves is a game about life, earth, humanity and the relationship between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete, cooperate, or roll the dice to earn green leaves by answering questions about life, earth, humanity and the relationship between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When players contribute green leaves to the board, they are rewarded with benefit coins.  The player to end the game with the most benefits wins.  However, enough green leaves must be place on the game board to sustain the earth and make the individual victory meaningful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2009, Leaves won two Dr. Toy awards, received recognition in the press,  and gained entrance into prestigious museum gift shops as well as game stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, its question cards were used at The Youth Energy Summit in Sacramento, and the games were included in two celebrity venues: Earth Day in Hollywood and the Grammy Green Room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
