			<description>Five Nights At Freddy's is based off of the very popular game app with the same name.  The board game version is a jump scare game that will surely make you jump!  You take mini pizza's from the tray in front of Freddy Fazbear.  Watch out, because if you mess around with his pizza's too much he JUMPS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Game Play&lt;br/&gt;You set the game up by pressing Freddy into a locked position.  Take all the total of 24 mini plastic pizza pieces in red (8) blue (8) and yellow (8) and put them in the pizza tray/box in front of Freddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to turn Freddy on, once you do that, you will hear the haunting  Calliope style music plays in the main base of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player on their turn spins the multi colored spinner which has corresponding colors to the pizza slices - Each slice on the spinner has a number value.  That is the number of pieces you have to remove from the tray in front of Freddy.  On the dial there is also a skip a turn, but in this game that is a good thing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players uses a bear paw shaped salad style tongs (grey in color) to pick the pizza slices out by the color and quantity shown on the spinner.  As you reach in, there is a lower level tray bottom that is pressure sensitive and will slowly based on the number of times you agitate, randomly activate Freddy to jump at you and spill the pizzas all over the table top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(If at any time a color is spun that is not in the tray, a player must take another color pizza instead)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one that does not find themselves the unlucky person that made Freddy JUMP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If playing more then two players, then the person that makes Freddy jump is eliminated.  Players return the pizza back to the tray, set Freddy up again and continue playing in the same manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once it is down to two players, then the overall winner is the one that does not set Freddy to JUMP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(If the players remove all of the pizza before Freddy wakes, then the game ends in a tie)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires 3 AA Batteries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
