							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power Gig Guitar Controller</name>
									
			<description>Power Gig: Rise of the SixString ships with a unique guitar game controller that acts as both a standalone six-stringed guitar and game controller with note-matching games. Because of the nearness of the controller and gameplay to that of a real guitar, it has attracted musicians including Eric Clapton, Dave Matthews, and Kid Rock that have shied away from music games before due to the simplicity of the button-mashing concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Power Gig: Rise of the SixString&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
