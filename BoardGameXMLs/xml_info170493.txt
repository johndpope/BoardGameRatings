			<description>From the rules sheet in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play&lt;br/&gt;All Letter Tablets are separated, placed face down and shuffled. The Black Tablets are separated and placed face up. Each player takes five Letter Tablets and places them on a Letter Rack, hidden from the opponents. Divide the Black Tablets between all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in turn each place a Black Tablet on the Playboard leaving at least on square (including diagonally) between all the Black Tablets. Play continues until all Black Tablets have been placed or cannot be placed. The first player must now try to place a complete word anywhere on the board ensuring that it fits between two Black Tablets. If the player is unable to do this a single Letter Tablet is placed anywhere on the board. The player replaces any Tablet used.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues around the Tablet until all the Letter Tablets have been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;Players score either when they place a complete word on the Playboard or when they place Tablet(s) which complete a partly made word. In either case the player scores one point for each Letter Tablet in the completed word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
