			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What If...&lt;br/&gt;Magic had been discovered by the Romans in the Third century? What of the Chinese developed their alchemy and discovered immortality during the Han Dynasty? What if the Scandinavians had Thor, Freya and Odin living amongst them, guiding them? What if you could be part of that? The Earth of what could have been comes alive here. Roman Artificers, Chinese Alchemists, Scandinavian Priests, African Shamans and much more come to life in this world of Alternate History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternate World History&lt;br/&gt;The world as we knew it has taken a turn. Creatures have begun to appear that were once safely in the land of myth and imagination. Races and creatures, close to the legends but different, carry on plots, follow their own agendas and satiate their own desires. Standing against them are the men and women of Earth, their magics and bravery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete System&lt;br/&gt;Roma Imperious is powered by the Iridium System, a skill based RPG system that includes three magic systems, many classes and a detailed combat mechanism. This book has every rule you need to play Roma Imperious, no other books are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online support&lt;br/&gt;Visit roma.hinterwelt.com for the latest downloads and CHARGen support for the Iridium System. CHARGen is our online character creation, update, storage and retrieval system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
