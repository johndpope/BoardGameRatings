							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Small Space Elevator &amp; Launching Station</name>
									
			<description>Blurb From Publisher --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another Day, Another dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space elevator &amp;amp; launcging station is a grided map of a planetside to space station elevator &amp;amp; its planetside launching station. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;   With the idea of a trip from earth to space taking a few days the elevator is built to transport freight supplies and recreational passangers. The top two floors are dedicated to passenger transport while the bottom 3 are for freight, supplies and crew. So that the elevator has somewhere to house it on the surface of whatever planet it goes down to I've included a launching station. It serves the same dual purpose as the elevator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is great for futuristic games such as Travler or a Sci-Fi themed Cypher system game. The highres JPG's included are a square grid and a hex grid &amp;amp; pre-formated for 8.5x11inch portrait @ 300DPI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
