							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mighty Switch Force! Academy</name>
									
			<description>Mighty Switch Force! Academy is an homage to classic arcade games where all the action takes place on a single screen. Part party game, part puzzler, all action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mighty Switch Force! Academy recalls the glory days of Nintendo Power magazine, which featured huge spreads that showed off entire level layouts on the page. We wanted to see what it would look like to play a puzzle-based pixel game where you could see the whole game at 1:1 ration on a 1080p screen. We tried it and loved the results. From there it was a deluge of inspiration &amp;mdash; implementing classic screen-wrap (a la Pac-Man), high concept levels designed entirely around fun play patterns, 4 player versus mode, and local multi-player on every level in the game. Previous titles of Mighty Switch Force! have grown to be speedrun games, and we wanted to see how the speedrunning community will embrace a 4-Player speedrunning game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mighty Switch Force! Academy is based on WayForward&amp;rsquo;s Mighty Switch Force! series of games, which star officer Patricia Wagon and friends. The game is being developed in GameMaker: Studio, and is being programmed and designed by Austin Ivansmith (director on Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition and Ducktales: Remastered)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;Take on 20 all-new deviously designed stages!&lt;br/&gt;Play alone, or with friends in 1-4 player co-op &amp;ldquo;couch play&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;Bonus Courses: 5 Classic Stages for up to 4 players&lt;br/&gt;4 Player Versus: Duke it out in competitive arenas!&lt;br/&gt;Includes Steam Controller Support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
