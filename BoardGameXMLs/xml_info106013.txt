			<description>Titus the Fox is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Titus Interactive for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS. The first version of the game was released in 1991 under the name Lagaf': Les Aventures de Moktar - Vol 1: La Zoubida. The international edition - Titus the Fox: To Marrakech and Back was released in 1992. The main character of the game is a fox. The game was programmed by Eric Zmiro, with graphical design by Francis Fournier and Stephan Beaufils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Titus' beloved Suzy has been kidnapped on the other side of the Sahara desert, and to get her back he has to advance through 15 levels. Player's goal is to avoid dogs, construction workers, giant bees and similar creatures. The player can fight back by throwing objects back at them, or - most notably - picking walking enemies up from behind and throwing them as projectiles at other obstacles. Stacking thrown objects is often required to get to the end of most levels. The game features a code-based &amp;quot;saving&amp;quot; system, with the codes calculated uniquely for each machine. The game is compatible with almost all CGA, EGA and VGA graphic adapters. In the Game Boy Color version removed the ability to stand on thrown objects, as well as throw enemies. Players could no longer enter through doorways in levels and a new gimmick was added that would cause walls and ladders to appear if you walked on their invisible activation space. Also added were bonus stages where between levels which consisted of a linear path where the player picks up golden boxes which would increase their score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Titus the Fox&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
