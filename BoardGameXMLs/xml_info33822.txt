			<description>From box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;America's newest and most exciting party game.  With this game all players really get down to the nitty gritty.  Makes a great gift! (Any number can play)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of OFFICE PARTY is to have a rollicking good time.  This will be achieved by drinking, stripping, winning chips, and indulging in general hanky panky.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a board, die, candle with holder, chips, pawns, a &amp;quot;Boss's Cards&amp;quot; deck, and a &amp;quot;Sexetary's Cards&amp;quot; deck.  The candle goes in the center of the board for ambiance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has many tracks, similar to a Careers board.  Players roll and perform various actions depending on the space landed on.  The currency in the game is chips and articles of clothing.  Chips can be bought for articles of clothing.  &amp;quot;When a player has run out of both chips and clothing, he is declared a PARTY POOPER, and is at the mercy of the other players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;NOTE: OFFICE PARTY does not condone gambling nor alcohol.  Neither does it specify the measure of each drink taken.  What the chips represent, and what is used for drinks, is left entirely to the discretion of the players.  All we can say is, 'HAVE A BALL!'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
