			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located at the division of land between the Duchy of Starryshade and the famed Horselords is the historic Mystic Wood. Home to the site where the peace treaty was signed between the two countries this area is rumored to have a strange effect on magic. Information has reached the local thane that a gathering, or conclave, of humanoids is to occur this weekend. He has dispatched his military but they are too far to be of use. He has heard of your growing fame and asked your party to investigate this rumor and take appropriate action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a party of mid-level adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
