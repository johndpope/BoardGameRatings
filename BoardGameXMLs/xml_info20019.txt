			<description>General Glen's Combat Rules for Toy Soldiers is the set of rules you need to get your dusty old toy soldiers out of storage. Whether you play in 54mm scale with exquisitely detailed soldiers, or with small 20-28mm plastic soldiers, you'll find these rules bring the focus of WWII skirmishes back to what it should be: detailed yet fast paced, balanced yet fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of these rules pretty much allows a maximum of a platoon per side for a 4-6 hour game, with maybe a dozen per side for a 3-4 hour game. For us, this means we can run the games in our big 54mm size, because we don't have that many minitatures to bring with us - only about 30-50 soldiers per side, if you include all the different poses - standing , kneeling, prone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our rules encourage the use of actual postures of your miniatures, so that line of sight and actual cover are used to determine whether a toy soldier can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; another. The exclusive use of a d12 for all die rolling has caused us to dub our game the &amp;quot;d12 system&amp;quot;, long before those other guys came out with their &amp;quot;d20 system&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.redshirtgames.com/gg.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.redshirtgames.com/gg.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
