			<description>All those business cards that people hand you can finally be put to good use! PowerLunch(tm) is a two-person game where these cards can be used to battle each other for the one thing they are best suited to attain: a free lunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws 5 business cards from a pool of at least 20.  Cards are then flicked across the play area and if they land near an opponent's card, they attack using the digits of the main phone number on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are classified as one of three types:&lt;br/&gt;1. Free Agents: Someone who is self employed or freelance (or don't specify their employment).  These get two moves per turn.&lt;br/&gt;2. Chiefs: Any card from an executive or someone in an obvious leadership position.  These get +1 to attacks if they touch their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;3. Underlings: Anyone else.  These may be attached to a Chief, and then moved (by hand) to the Chief's new position after he/she is flicked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
