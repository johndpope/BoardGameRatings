							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Judah the Christian Soldier Game</name>
									
			<description>Judah the Christian Soldier Game's object is to complete the picture of Judah the Christian Soldier by placing armor cards in the correct location on the game board.  &lt;br/&gt;This is done by obtaining game pieces by flicking the spinner, and if it lands on a piece of the armor that you do not have, you get it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple and easy to learn.  The premise of the game is to help teach children about the spiritual armor of God that is referred to in the book of Ephesians 6:10-18 in the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
