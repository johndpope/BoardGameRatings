			<description>Publisher tagline&lt;br/&gt;Burglars want to get in. Kids want to keep them out. Who will win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introductory text from the item&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is December 22th. You are 9 to 12 year old kids of two related families, traveling to a rich aunt&amp;rsquo;s house in a New York suburb. There you are supposed to spend the days before Christmas, so your stressed out parents can prepare everything for the holidays.&lt;br/&gt;It is snowing heavily when the cab drops you off at the driveway at noon.  The pre-payed driver mumbles something about this being his last trip for today &amp;ndash; the streets will be closed, a small blizzard is coming in the afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;At the front door then the big surprise: Nobody is home! Thanks to a hidden key in the yard you can at least enter the house and call your parents. Well, there was a misunderstanding with your aunt. There is Pizza in the freezer. Wait until tomorrow morning and please, please don&amp;rsquo;t do anything stupid.&lt;br/&gt;Alone at your aunt&amp;rsquo;s mansion the fun stops during a snowball fight as you eavesdrop on a conversation of what seems to be a corrupt cop. He talks to a friend on the police radio: It&amp;rsquo;s like a ghost town here &amp;ndash; nobody is around, the ideal time and place for burglary. He agrees with the other person to meet&lt;br/&gt;here at dawn &amp;ndash; right before your aunt&amp;rsquo;s house &amp;ndash; to rob the neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;You call your parents again, but they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to believe your childish stories. Instead they order you to not go to the police as it might look bad: Why are there kids in a house without supervision? So it&amp;rsquo;s obvious what you have to do: defend the house and make sure the burglars don&amp;rsquo;t steal your aunt&amp;rsquo;s pricey possessions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;This is a short scenario playing with the core idea from the 1990 movie Home Alone by John Hughes/ Chris Columbus. The scenario was first published in German in the anthology NIP'AJIN Shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
