			<description>This game was published in spielbox 1992 #4.&lt;br/&gt;From 2 to 6 players try to build the surface of a new planet. Each player gets a copy of the board and a felt-tip pen of different color. In the first phase, the players, alternately, put a mark of their colors on a free field of the board in order to show their ownership. This phase lasts different rounds depending on the numbers of players (7 rounds for 2 players, 5 for 3 players, 4 rounds for 4-5 players and 3 for 6 players. In the next phase, each player, in his turn, determines a direction and expands his landscape (for example, blue = water) in this direction. The game ends when all fields are filled. The player who has occupied the shortest amount of fields receives zero point. The other players receive points corresponding to the difference between the number of fields they occupied and the number of fields the last player has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
