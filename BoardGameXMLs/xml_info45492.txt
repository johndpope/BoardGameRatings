			<description>From the back of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Strange cries I've heard over the walls at the Royal Palace at night. Demons is practiced, mark me. The king's tried everything else. Now he's turning to the powers of the night,&amp;quot; whispered the bent and wrinkled old man. &amp;quot;We're all doomed, we are.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The king of Ophir is dying. He refuses to name an heir, believing he will be cured. His nobles are sure no cure will be found and that the country will soon be left without king or heir. The nobles are amassing private armies, plotting for the throne, while the king's army hides. Bandits now raid freely, and the Ophireans are refugees within their own land, fleeing to the safety of the cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is through this land you, Conan and your company of mercenaries, journey. For there are reports of good work for any who can swing a sword or cut a purse. In this troubled land, however, the trick is to avoid having your own throat or purse cut...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey through this land of chaos and confusion based on the CONAN THE TRIUMPHANT book by Robert Jordan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
