							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Key to Marina</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 4-6 characters of level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gardens of Marina lie forlorn and neglected in an unfashionable district of the coastal city of Morphoton. A single senile gardener tends to the vegetation but the magnificent central fountain which once drew in visitors for miles around now lies dry, forgotten and broken. Those who remember why the fountain was built shake their heads at this neglect whilst glancing nervously down dark alleys and suspiciously at strangers. When the party is bequeathed a valuable painting of the fountain with a cryptic message written on its back it would seem as if the time has arrived for them to begin investigations &amp;ndash; wherever they might lead &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four Dollar Dungeons are standalone adventures designed to be logical, entertaining, challenging and balanced, and easily integrated into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure has enough material to last two to three playing sessions and enough experience to raise four characters of the appropriate level up by one extra level. Treasure is commensurate with the encounter challenges faced. Scaling information is included for adventuring parties of five or six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is set in a city by the sea. One third of the action is city-based; the remainder takes place below it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
