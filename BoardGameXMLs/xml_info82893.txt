			<description>A player steers a fantastic submarine and discovers a mysterious undersea world. A deadly fight with a shark, drowned ships, undersea tunnels and chest with treasure are waiting for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you are not alone. Your submarine is equipped with the unique board computer which you can use in order to complete a mission by mission. You will never get lost in the undersea world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual, there are the 3-D graphics, the camera with two modes (&amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo;), real sounds, an extraordinary soundtrack, and the voice and the voice prompts. Thus, a player may comment the events on your behalf and the board computer leads you through the key points by the voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
