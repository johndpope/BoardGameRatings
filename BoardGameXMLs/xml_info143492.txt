			<description>Push Panic is one of the most insanely addictive and fun action-based Puzzle games available on the App Store. Do you prefer going for the gold in Classic Mode? Or Can you beat the high-score in one of the 3 additional modes without losing it?

Link as many same colored blocks together as possible to score more points with massive combos. Random power-up blocks include chain-links that combine multiple color strings, point multipliers, time freezes, bombs, and a raise-the-bar blocks that give players more wiggle room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four exciting, fast-paced gameplay modes alter objectives and keep players in a frantically fun tizzy.
