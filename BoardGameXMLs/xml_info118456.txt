			<description>&amp;quot;Consisting of forty eight pictorial cards illustrative of the Adventures and Games of the Boys of Dr. Lion's Jungle School from Constance Stannard Chapman's Original Designs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each numbered cards of the sets are similar, for example number 2 of each set shows an animal with a musical instrument. There are 48 cards arranged in 3 sets of 16, each lettered A, B or C and numbered 1 to 16; all the illustrations are different and have an appropriate title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set number of cards are dealt, probably 5, to each player. The object of the game is to complete a set of three cards, one from each letter, for example a set would be cards A1, B1 and C1, not 1 to 16 of A. The player to the dealer's left begins the play by asking his next neighbor on his left side for A, B or C of any set to complete the three cards of the set. When a player has succeeded in completing a set, he must show the completed set, and may then draw a card from the pool but no card must be drawn from the pool except upon the completion of a set, and only one card drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the one who completes the most sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is copyright Thomas De La Rue on the box, but the rules say that H P Gibson are the copyright holders. As far as I know, there has never been a reissue of the game so I assume H P Gibson still hold the copyright. However, I am crediting them both with this game. Almost certainly, De La Rue printed it and H P Gibson distributed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
