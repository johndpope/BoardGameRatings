							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ten Cent Maps Volume 2: The Spires of Chimney Cove</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What follows is an assortment of fantasy maps and illustrations based around The Spires of Chimney Cove - an original, hand-drawn map over 3 and a half feet in height. It&amp;rsquo;s been colored and enhanced to bring it to life. Each map can easily be dropped into any medieval campaign setting. Versions of the maps with text and labels removed have also been included. If you would like your world to have an old-school gaming feel then this supplement should fit right in. The maps can be used separately, as a series, or as part of a complete setting. They are yours to populate and fill out as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
