			<description>Intellector - chess XXI century&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is similar in many respects to the ancient &amp;quot;game of Zion.&amp;quot; But Intellector more than classical chess - is a completely new abstract puzzle game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the pieces has a move that is much like pieces in chess, in terms of the 'feel' of the game, but with the hexagon board it will offer unique features to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hex board of 59 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to capture the Intellector pieces, again think of it as the king piece.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;    Agressor - first striker; can be moved only in the dark hexagon located on a straight line connecting the vertices (corners) of dark hexagons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progressor - moving forward;walks straight ahead (through the line) to an adjacent hexagon, that is, only those of the hexagons, which are closer to the &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; of the enemy in relation to the hexagon in which it is located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Liberator - goes through one of the hexagons, which adjoins the faces of its hex&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenssor - defender;  goes to any of the adjacent hexagons, which adjoins the faces of its hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dominator - can be moved to any of the hexagons located in the direction of forming a series of hexagons contiguous faces.&lt;br/&gt; Intellector - smart, literally from the Latin word &amp;quot;understanding.&amp;quot; It goes on any neighboring hexagon, which is in contact with the face through the hexagon, in which it is located&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
