			<description>This is Game #31 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a 2 player traitor game.  In the game, players don't know if they are on the same side, or opposing sides.  They try to figure this out and either help the human side win the race, or undermine it so the neutral player wins by either losing the race or failing in too many attempts during the race to exceed the current number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During turn, players will play cards from their hand, trying to exceed the prior turn's target number, in a mechanic like 2-5 Skidoo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
