			<description>The Trollish Game of Squiggly Fun!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are small and Stupid?  What do Trolls love to jump up and down on? Squiggly Beasts!  Squiggly Beasts are so silly that they make even Gobbos look clever.  Maybe that's why Gobbos look after them.  Squiggly Beasts are also very tasty.  Maybe that's really why Gobbos look after them.  Trolls spend days thinking about jumping on Squiggly Beastes.  Think hurts Trolls.  Trolls only take minutes to jump on Squiggly Beasts.  Jumping doesn't hurt Trolls.  But Squiggly Beasts make such a great noise when Trolls jump on them....SQUELCH!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect lines of Squiggly Beasts and Gobbos, who protect Squiggly Beasts from being squelched by Trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
