							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Greenline</name>
									
			<description>Greenline is a roll and move game that represents the moving of the resources of a large corporation around the world. Players compete to get to the end of the board first...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, unlike a simple roll and move game, there are some interesting wrinkles. Each player uses a different mode of transport: airplane, train, truck, or boat. Each mode allows a player to avoid a hazard or gain an advantage in a particular situation that may or may not come up during any particular session. At the beginning of the game, the player who rolls highest gets to choose their mode of transport, followed by the next highest rolling player, etc. Each mode uses a different color pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, players have the option of rolling for one of 5 special attributes at the beginning of the game. These attributes - 1. invoice, 2. letter of credit, 3. customs documents, 4. freight insurance, &amp;amp; 5. the goods... are not exclusive to any one player and are randomly determined. A player may roll as many times as they like for these attributes (which can potentially prevent setbacks or lend an advantage), but once they've started moving on the board, they are not allowed to roll for any more attributes. Players must balance a desire for having as many attributes as possible with the notion of getting moving on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main path on the board (also the shortest path) is the Greenline of the title. However, if players land on certain squares they must roll a die to see if they are diverted onto a red circuit. This creates a delay as the player must go through a side path that usually has other negative encounter possibilities. There are also a number of yellow spaces on the board that represent random challenges which require the player to have one of the special attributes to avoid a penalty or to gain an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game appears to have been developed by Philips to build teamwork or to encourage employees to think in terms of working as efficiently as possible. Apparently this game only appeared in Dutch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
