							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slayer&#039;s Guide to Troglodytes</name>
									
			<description>An ancient evil awaits&lt;br/&gt;Troglodytes are a thoroughly foul reptilian race with all the chill mercilessness and cruelty of a cold-blooded snake. Many consider them to be as evil as the most loathsome of demons. Troglodytes inhabit the underdeep of the world for they are creatures of the dark but may also be found in the rocky peaks and passes of desolate mountains. These few tribes who live near the surface wage a constant war on nearby settlements during cold, moonless nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past many Games Masters have simply used Troglodytes as sword fodder for adventuring parties. Their skill with javelins, foul scent glands and chameleonic ambush abilities combined with large numbers make them truly lethal opponents. Up to now they have rarely been treated with the depth and detail such a race deserves. With this book, everything changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
