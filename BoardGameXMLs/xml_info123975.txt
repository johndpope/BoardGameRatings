			<description>As your senior year is about to begin you promised yourself: It&amp;rsquo;s going to be legendary!&lt;br/&gt;From Skipping School to Hack Grades to Road trips, you are ready to do whatever it takes to have a blast. Even if it involves subtle manipulation, a bit of betrayal and destroying a few hearts along the way.&lt;br/&gt;And if things don&amp;rsquo;t turn out your way, gather your gang and Start a Teenage Riot! &lt;br/&gt;This is your last shot to go down on history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to score the highest number of victory points. Players score victory points by:&lt;br/&gt;- Successfully performing events: &lt;br/&gt;- Accomplishing the Plan&lt;br/&gt;- Beating the Snitch Brigade&lt;br/&gt;If the Snitch Brigade defeats Bullies, players responsible for bulling loose victory points. So watch out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Victory Condition&lt;br/&gt;If a player manages to start a teenage riot he wins the game even without having most victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by cult teen comedies &amp;ldquo;Endless Days&amp;quot; is a board game for 2 to 4 players, aged 12 and up that can be played in 25 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
