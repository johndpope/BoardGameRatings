							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New York Reclamation Zone</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best city money can buy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the greatest city on earth, New York was abandoned in 2038 after terrorists blew the levees protecting her from rising sea levels. Forgotten by America, the Big Apple became soggy, slowly rotting away, with only a brave few remaining within its bounds, refusing to give up their once-proud home. Yet in the half-century that followed, New Yorkers proved time and again just how adaptable they could be in the face of disaster, natural or otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the waters may still hold the Big Soggy hostage, but its denizens reject any notion of surrender. The city has changed, with flooded streets and ancient subways teeming with aquatic predators while human colonies scrape out a brutal existence on those skyscrapers that haven&amp;rsquo;t collapsed into the sea. As corporations turn their hungry eyes on the forgotten city, it&amp;rsquo;s time to rediscover the Big Soggy, where new territory is being fought over, new hybrids are emerging from the waves, new technology is being manufactured in the blackest labs, and new secrets are being dug up from the ocean floor&amp;mdash;or buried there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It remains a city of survivors. The only question is, how long will you last there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 57-page book you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed look at New York city, Newark, and their inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;    New character archetypes&lt;br/&gt;    Occupation&lt;br/&gt;    Edges&lt;br/&gt;    Weapons, armor and equipment&lt;br/&gt;    A host of hazards, bio-horrors and NPCs common to the region!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
