			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaming conventions are brilliant. They combine the best of social hobbies, in a place where you are surrounded by like-minded people, with all the buzz and excitement of a festival. Yet, they can also be intimidating to the newbie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, or who&amp;rsquo;s who, you might think all the fun was happening elsewhere. Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve been to Cons before, you might be nervous about stepping up to run games, or volunteering to help with the organisation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide is for everyone who wants to get an even better Con experience. It&amp;rsquo;s written with the UK community in mind, but the etiquette of Cons is pretty universal, and travels well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first section, &amp;lsquo;Rules to Live By&amp;rsquo; is for everyone, but especially if you&amp;rsquo;re new to Cons. The second section &amp;lsquo;Mastering Games&amp;rsquo;, is for those who want to run games at Cons, or just run even better Con games. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s for you, it&amp;rsquo;s well worth a read. Running good Con games is easier than you think, and incredibly rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
