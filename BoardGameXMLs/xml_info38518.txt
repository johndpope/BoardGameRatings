							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Berenstain Bears Giant Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of play is to collect the four members of the Berenstain Bear family (Mama, Papa, Brother and Sister Bear) and their matching hats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The begin play, shuffle the cards and place them face-down in the center of the table. The top card is turned face-up and placed in a separate discard pile. Decide who will play first. The first player selects the top card from either the draw or discard pile. If the selected card is a Berenstain Bear, the player takes the card and places it in front of him. If the card is a hat or WIND card, the player places it on the discard pile. Play passes to the left with the next player selecting a card from either the draw or discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players collect members of the Berenstain Bear family, the may &amp;quot;cap&amp;quot; each character with the appropriate hat. For example, on his first turn a player draws a Brother Bear card. On a later turn he draws Brother Bear's baseball hat. He may then &amp;quot;cap&amp;quot; Brother Bear by placing the hat card on the Brother Bear card. If a player draws a hat but does not have the character that matches it, OR if the character already has his/her hat, the card must be discarded. Note that some cards feature two hats. Players may choose which hat, if any, to use and &amp;quot;cap&amp;quot; the appropriate bear. Once a character is &amp;quot;capped&amp;quot;, the hat may not be removed unless it is blown off by a WIND card (see below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player draws a WIND card, he may blow one hat off any of his opponents' cards. The hat and WIND cards are then placed on the discard pile. A player may not remove a WIND card from the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to match all four Berenstain Bear characters with their correct hats wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
