							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bats in Your Belfry</name>
									
			<description>OBJECT: to collect the most bats by catching them in the included 'MONSTER CLAWS'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game does not have a game board per-se - it utilizes a 3-D supposedly haunted dwelling resembling a castle or mansion for gameplay.  The model measures about 35cm high x 20cm across x 15cm deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small black plastic vampire bats are placed on a spring-loaded platform at the top of the model.  The players select one of the two garishly colored neon plastic Monster Claws each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marbles are inserted into the top of the dwelling and roll through passages within the interior of the model.  The route of the marbles can be manipulated by using the 'Skunker Skulls' - little green skulls which are located at the base of the castle.  The marbles may roll completely through the model (there are instructions, such as &amp;quot;Take Another Turn&amp;quot; where these terminate) or they may activate the spring-loaded platform where the plastic vampire bats have been placed.  The bats are propelled into the air and must be caught in one's Monster Claw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
