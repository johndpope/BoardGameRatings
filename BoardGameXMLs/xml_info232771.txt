			<description>Explorers parachutes into an Amazonia Forest with a mission. They have to explore the forest and get to the rescue point inside the jungle. On their way they have to catch food, water and others resources to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After four rounds all players have to mount camp. Each movement is based on a choice of three directions -front, left or right - into different areas of the jungle. These are represented by event cards (that can be in river or forest areas). &lt;br/&gt;There are magical happenings in full moon nights with special cards taken for each individual player.&lt;br/&gt;On the way you can photograph animals in risk of extinction and expose situations that harm the forest life. These actions give extra bonuses. &lt;br/&gt;The first player to arrive at the rescue point receive extra bonus points and finishes the game. The winner is the player with most points in his counting card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
