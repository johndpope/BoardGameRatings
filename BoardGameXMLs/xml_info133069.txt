			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;March or Die is a set of simple rules for the hard fought actions between the French Foreign Legion and the Arab Tribes of Morocco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed so that all of the participants are on the same side (the Legion) whilst the marauding Arabs are controlled by dice-driven action tables in the rules.  The game can be played solo, with a group of friends or as a public participation game at any of the numerous wargames shows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules themselves are not designed for the serious wargamer, but for those of us whose main aim in wargaming is to enjoy the game no matter the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea for March or Die has been greatly inspired by that most enjoyable game Pony Wars, Miniature rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
