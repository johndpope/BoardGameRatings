							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS King Red + Operation Deadstick</name>
									
			<description>This Advanced Tobruk System module contains maps &amp;amp; scenarios for two separate invasion points during the D-Day operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, King Red, and the amphibious landing by Commonwealth forces at the eastern portion of Gold Beach, where the 5th Yorkshire were faced with Weapons Nest 33 (Wn33), a Nazi emplacement bristling with weaponry.  This aspect of the game features modified Churchill and Sherman tanks, the &amp;quot;funnies&amp;quot;, such as the anti-mine Crab variant and the emplacement-busting AVRE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, Operation Deadstick was the codename for an operation by airborne glider troops of the British Army that took place on 6 June 1944 as part of the Normandy landings. The objective was to capture intact two road bridges in Normandy across the River Orne and the Caen Canal providing the only exit eastwards for British forces from their landing on Sword Beach. Intelligence reports said both bridges were heavily defended by the Germans and wired for demolition. Once captured, the bridges had to be held against any counter-attack until the assault force was relieved by commandos and infantry advancing from the British landing zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set includes new scenarios, maps and all the combat counters needed to play out King Red and Operation Deadstick.&lt;br/&gt;Ownership of the ATS Rulebook and standard system markers is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
