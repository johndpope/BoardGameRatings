							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rule the Hand</name>
									
			<description>Trick-taking card game for 3 or 4 players where votes are cast after the deal and for what conditions apply for that hand, such as which suit is trump (if any) or passing your entire hand to the right. Players cast their votes by placing some (or all) of their chips onto a specific rule card. Once you've used your allotment of chips, you can no longer vote in later hands. Players get 10 points for each trick won, unless modified by a rule that was voted for that hand. High score after 4 hands wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
