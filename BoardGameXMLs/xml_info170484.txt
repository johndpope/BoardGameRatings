			<description>Players attempt to empty their hands by extending the paths of an erupting volcano.  Every card has to match the prior color, but most cards change the color of that path.  The paths will branch, change colors, and sometimes be blocked entirely.  Furthermore, colored villagers are fleeing from the volcano, and cards can also be played to match their colors.  Players play up to 3 cards each turn, so it is important to plan ahead and build &amp;lsquo;combos&amp;rsquo; by saving up sets of cards that can chain off of each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
