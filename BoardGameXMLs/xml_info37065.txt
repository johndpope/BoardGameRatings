			<description>Associate! is a racy team game suitable for parties and similar environments. It's simple to learn and great fun to play. Here's how it works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divide into teams and race against the clock to find the missing link between words - the more your team guesses in thirty seconds, the further round the board you go. It's a non-stop beat-the-clock battle of wits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One member of your team reads out some of the pre-written clues, it might sound something like this: &amp;quot;Control&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Missile&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Liner&amp;quot;. Your team shouts out guesses as to what the missing word is that links those words. In this case it's &amp;quot;Cruise&amp;quot; which is linked by the phrases &amp;quot;cruise control&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cruise missile&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cruise liner&amp;quot;. You're racing against the clock to solve as many different links as you can before time runs out and your turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
