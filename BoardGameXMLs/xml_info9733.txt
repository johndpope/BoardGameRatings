							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Escape</name>
									
			<description>The zany prisoners have escaped from the jail and have handcuffed all of the players to the game board.  To make matters worse, they have taken the one key that will open the handcuffs and mixed it with 5 keys that will not open them, and put them all in the jail house.  As players move around the board, they must get 4 key cards, all of the same color.  Each time they get 4 matching cards they may pick one key from the jail and try to open their handcuffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
