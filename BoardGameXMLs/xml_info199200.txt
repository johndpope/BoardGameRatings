			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are assumed to be young crime fighters. They may simply act as vigilantes but their crime fighting activities may be more subtle.  Characters are defined by Traits (narrative tags) that may offer a bonus in some activities.  Action resolution involves a variable dice pool roll compared to an action table to determine results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By far the most unusual aspect of the game is the structure of having two game masters for the campaign - an &amp;quot;A Plot&amp;quot; game master, and a &amp;quot;B Plot&amp;quot; game master.  These two players have distinct areas of responsibility but otherwise act as traditional game masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several &amp;quot;Setting Booklets&amp;quot; were planned, but never produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
