			<description>&amp;quot;Loot! Pillage! Burn!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;From the fury of the Norsemen, oh Lord, deliver us!&amp;quot; So prayed the Irish monks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the victims of a Viking raid, the Norsemen were bearded giants with bloody axes. But the Viking was much more. He was a skilled navigator and a brave explorer and trader. He was a fighter to whom honor and reputation were far more important than life. He was a free man in an age of petty tyranny.  He was a dreamer whose songs and stories live even today. And yes, he was a bloody-handed sea rover who took what he wanted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a complete guide to the Norse world. It includes maps, historical background, and details on society and religion. A separate chapter discusses Norse magic and runes. The new edition also provide templates for playing the magical races of Viking lore as player characters, and expands the number of campaign options available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can game any sort of Viking campaign, from fully realistic to magical and cinematic. Create a historical campaign, with sea battles, duels and bloody raids &amp;ndash; or become a legendary berserker for mythic adventures with Thor and Odin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may live, you may die. No man knows his fate. But act bravely and the skalds will sing of your deeds forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
