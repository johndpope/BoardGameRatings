			<description>This is a set collection game using a deck of cards with historical figures who played important roles in the Bakumatsu period (1853-1867) on them (these cards also serve as a standard deck of cards). Each player is dealt five cards. On their turn, the player draws one card and discards one card face up in front of them, trying to build one of 43 sets, which are thematic (people from the same domain, people involved in the same incidents, etc.), require 2 to 5 cards, and are rated from one to fifty points. When a player is one card away from completing his or her set, they say &amp;quot;Iza! Jinjo ni!&amp;quot; (Roughly, &amp;quot;Let's fight properly), and discard their card sideways. If they see the last card they need in front of another player, they may take it and finish their set. When a player finishes their set, they say &amp;quot;Bakumatsu,&amp;quot; and discard their last card. They are done. The game ends when the deck runs out, at which time the sets are scored, highest score wins and deals the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
