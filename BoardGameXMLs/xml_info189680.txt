			<description>Math Rummy is a children's educational game designed to teach basic addition and subtraction. It was released in the Leapfrog My Card Games set. Although it shares a name, it bears little resemblance to the classic card game Rummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Math Rummy, each player is dealt eight cards, each of which show a number (both the numeral and picture showing the matching number of cartoon bugs in a jar) or a plus or minus sign. On each player's turn he or she discard cards by making an equation (x +/- y = z) on the board.  If the player cannot do so, he or she draws a card from the draw deck or chooses a face-up card that left next to the draw deck. If an equation still is not possible, the player places one card of his or her choice on the face-up pile next to the draw deck and passes.  Once the first equation is made, all players play off that same equation on their turn by covering all or part of it with new cards, making sure to keep the equation correct.  After each player's turn, a marker is advanced on a turn track.  The game ends when one player uses all of his/her cards or when the turn marker reaches the lily pad after turn ten.  In that case, the player with the fewest cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
