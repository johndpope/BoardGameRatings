							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perfectorium Of The Golden Tentacle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big adventure that will challenge mid to high level characters.  People have started to flock to a place called the Perfectorium.  They enter and leave with wonderful gifts. Receivers Of The Golden Manifestation they now are.  Across the land they walk looking for people to journey to the Perfectorium and become Receivers like them.  It all seems so nice and pleasant.  Some suspect that there is something demonish at work behind it all.  The party must investigate!  Evil is watching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First in a 2 part module series.  The Perfectorium can be explored, fought, retreated from, lost to and won against.  The tentacles await your face!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
