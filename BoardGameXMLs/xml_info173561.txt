							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kenya Safari Game</name>
									
			<description>The Kenya Safari Game is a roll-and-move game that simulates a traveler exploring the sights and tourist attractions of Kenya.  Players start from a pre-chosen base in the capital city of Nairobi.  They draw a variety of different-colored cards, each of which represents a different type of site or tourist attraction they must visit or an animal they must photograph on safari.  They then roll two dice each turn to move around the board by a roads, trails, trains and airplanes to visit the required locations.  The first player to complete all their photography assignments and see all their designated sights returns to his or her Nairobi base and is declared the winner.  Special rules allow players to take flights or extra turns when rolling doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is primarily a roll and move game an element of strategy is introduced by the fact that players must visit a variety of sites in a variety of areas and may travel by various routes.  Players who plan the most efficient routes from place to place may gain an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
