			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a sailing crew taking your Sailboat from Home Dock to the Island Port. When you get safely there, celebrate a great day of sailing by breaking out rations of milk and cookies. Then it&amp;amp;#039;s hoist anchor and set sail for home again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sailing is a challenge, demanding the best effort from everyone on crew. Everyone&amp;amp;#039;s contribution is valued. Each of us has a supply of Action Cards that we share with each other. We use them to advance the boat, negotiate Strong Currents and High Winds, while trying to avoid Rocks and Reefs. In each game, the location of the Reefs is different. We must keep a Seadog&amp;amp;#039;s eye out for potential Breakdowns that could ground us. Save the Coast Guard cards in case we need to be rescued. Or else we could end up being adrift at sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
