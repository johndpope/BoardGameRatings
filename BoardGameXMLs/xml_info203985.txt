							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Become a King</name>
									
			<description>Become a King is a solo game in which the player works their way up the ranks from a baron to a king. Using a deck of cards the player can choose the path of diplomacy or force to gain control of the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the player will choose a Lead card giving them a certain bonus of Force or Diplomacy. The Lead card will also determine how many cards can be played as Followers. Followers will add more Force or Diplomacy to the player's turn and may also grant special abilities. Using these the player will gain new cards and will be able to manipulate their deck.&lt;br/&gt;But beware! Along the way the player will create rivals that will fight against him in the final effort to gain control over the kingdom. The more rivals you create the higher the strength of the kingdom that stands before you will be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to Become a King?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
