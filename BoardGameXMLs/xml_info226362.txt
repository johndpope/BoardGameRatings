			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaces of the Unknown is a fantasy tabletop RPG, designed for play-by-post gaming on the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a dead simple, light, fantasy role-playing game designed to be played on the internet using the most awesome human invention: the written word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: At least 2, one GM and one or more players with characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: An online forum, shared email thread, or shared Google doc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice: Standard gaming dice, including d20s, d10s, d8s, d6s, and d4s. Recommended for online rolling: brockjones.com/dieroller/dice.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPG inspiration: Early Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and Searchers of the Unknown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will explore abandoned and overrun ruins, and reclaim them for civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't need a new system? The game includes 6 lairs stocked with monsters, ready for old-school play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes it different than other RPGs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GM rolls all dice during play.&lt;br/&gt;    All PCs are fighters (with some ability to cast magic)&lt;br/&gt;    Spells are typically cast by reading a spell scroll&lt;br/&gt;    There's no gold and no gold economy&lt;br/&gt;    When a PC's Hit Points are reduced to 0 or less, the PC is not killed or knocked out; he or she is sidelined. A sidelined PC is still conscious and can grant bonuses to other PCs, but cannot attack for the rest of the fight.&lt;br/&gt;    The party levels up as a group, not PCs individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
