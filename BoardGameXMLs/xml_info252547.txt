			<description>Players try to hire the most productive employees to produce the most resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: 2 or 3 decks of cards (jokers removed) shuffled together; a sheet of paper per player to keep score (one column for bids; three for suits club, diamond, heart [spades are wild-added to other suits]; and rows for employees' cost/production values).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play: each round, 2 cards are dealt in the center of the table: the first is the cost of the employee, the second is the amount the employee will produce per round. Bidding takes place; the highest bid wins the employee and becomes the cost of the employee per round. After bidding is over, players add the production amount of their employees (if any) to the appropriate suit column, and subtract the cost employees (if any) from the matching column. Asign a suit to add Spades to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selling: once four employees are hired, the company can be sold. All resources are added and that number of points given. If resources are in negative numbers, those are subtracted from the points to pay off debt. Half of employees are shuffled back into the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: to have the most points after 20 rounds, or the lowest negative resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
