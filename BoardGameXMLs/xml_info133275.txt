			<description>Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 3 (爆笑!!人生劇場3?, &amp;quot;A Hearty Laugh! Theater Life 3&amp;quot;) is a Nintendo Family Computer board game that was released on December 20, 1991. The game is about a toddler who goes through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and eventually senior citizenship. There are decisions to make (dating, marriage to one of seven different potential mating patners, telling the truth, whether or not to peek at Christmas presents) and sometimes an elderly figure that represents God intervenes to help players determine their best path in life. Turns can be lost due to illness and bad weather and gained when the player buys an automobile for 15,000,000 yen (approximately $100,000 USD). This money can be earned back much later in the game at a casino if the player decides to go on a vacation. Once all players reach the &amp;quot;finish line,&amp;quot; God tells individual players about their destiny after retiring from work and into the life of a senior citizen. Things that could happen include: the loss of a spouse, becoming a world traveler, becoming terminally ill later in life, and striking oil in the desert.&lt;br/&gt;Marriage almost always results in children but divorce occurs randomly just in real life and is symbolized by a falling leaf. As the player gets older, the female characters' faces get wrinkles and the male characters' faces get facial hair and the shape of the face become more chiseled. Tokyo Disneyland is included as a cameo role in one of the squares that the player can land on near the beginning of the game. The game decides whether the player gets lost in Tokyo Disneyland or not, either adding to or subtracting points from the avatar's intellectual strength. In addition to the standard game boards, there are also game boards for vacations, leaving the parents' home by either airplane or train, and incarceration.&lt;br/&gt;Like other games in the Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou series, university education is a completely optional path that leads to all career paths being enabled. Career cards have to be chosen in certain squares in order to represent a successful or a failed venture within the career. However, university education has a mandatory interactive quiz that must be done successfully in order to enter university. Failing this quiz twice will result in the player being bumped into career mode. Since the questions are in Japanese, there is no possible way for a non-Japanese reader to play the game without skipping university and straight into career mode. Choosing this path will offers limited choices and lower pay unless a career book is purchased later in the game for 300,000,000 yen. Only this important tool allows a choice of multiple careers either with or without a university education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bakushou!!
