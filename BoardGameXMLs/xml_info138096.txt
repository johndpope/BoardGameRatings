			<description>Each card has both a letter and one face of a standard die.  Before each turn, 5 dice are rolled and placed on the dice board in order of their colors. Then the player tries to play a word of 3-5 letters, whose die faces match a contiguous subset of the dice on the board.  If they do, they score the sum of the cards' pips, doubled for 4-letter words and tripled for 5-letter words.  There are also wild cards, and slug cards that can be added at either end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first person to reach the specified total score, e.g. 100 for 4-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
