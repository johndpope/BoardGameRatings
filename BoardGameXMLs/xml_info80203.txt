			<description>Battle Lode Runner is a video game based on the Lode Runner series of games originally released for the NEC PC Engine by Hudson Soft in 1993. It was released in Japan on May 29, 2007 and also released in the North American and European regions for the first time in April 2007 for the Wii Virtual Console. It is also the first game originally released only in Japan to be available on the Virtual Console for another region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ike other games in the Lode Runner series, Battle Lode Runner's gameplay revolves around traveling through 11 different time periods, collecting gold without being caught by many creatures. Your character can climb ropes and ladders, walk on top of enemies, collect power-ups, and most importantly, dig a hole on the right or left of himself. In some versions you can set traps, but Battle Lode Runner doesn't contain this feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battle Lode Runner&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
