							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Village of Oester</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refugees from the village of Oester have been flooding the city, fleeing from an unspeakable terror that has ravaged the northern settlement. Their faces still show the horror they have endured, but their tongues are silenced because of fear. Could it be a plague? Could a terrible monster torment them? It is up to the adventurers to discover the cause of this panic. Little do they know a shadowy evil has risen from the dead to possess the abandoned tower on the hill overlooking the village. Most have forgotten about this sinister force, except the king. He knows his family's past has come to haunt him and threaten his line's succession. Do the adventurers choose to help hide his family's past and preserve the monarchy or reveal the truth? An adventure setting for character levels 3-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
