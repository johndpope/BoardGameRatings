							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spanish Fury, Campaign!</name>
									
			<description>This is module number 2 of the Spanish Fury Renaissance Warfare series. The Dreux campaign of 1562-1563 has been included as a scenario and as such, the rules will use examples from that campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each turn represents one week of real time. Note that although an army could march further in the allotted time than the game may allow, most armies were not able to uniformly march about to their heart&amp;rsquo;s content. Bogged down by the wounded and sick, the need to secure supplies, broken artillery carriages and a rest periods caused most armies to move only when they could, not when they wanted to. Each strength point of troops represents roughly 200-300 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Key: Every game system has a key element that is critical to successful play. It in the 16th supply was the main concern of a commander who had any hope of success. In &amp;ldquo;Campaign!&amp;rdquo; supply has been portrayed in Action points. The more action points, the more an army can do. Action points are tallied at the beginning of each turn, and the closer an army is to supply lines and friendly towns, the more it will achieve. Treasury points may be expended to buy action points. Excess action points can under certain circumstances be converted to treasury points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components included&lt;br/&gt;Campaign! rules (.doc)&lt;br/&gt;Scenario for the First War of Religion (.doc)&lt;br/&gt;Map for Scenario (.pdf)&lt;br/&gt;Counters (.pdf)&lt;br/&gt;Order of Battle Sheets (.pdf)&lt;br/&gt;Conversion Charts (.pdf)&lt;br/&gt;Component Explanation Chart (.pdf)&lt;br/&gt;The Complete Spanish Fury Miniatures Interface (.doc)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game FREE to download: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://perfectcaptain.50megs.com/Campaign_Playtest.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://perfectcaptain.50megs.com/Campaign_Playtest.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
