							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walker in the Wastes Player Aid Kit</name>
									
			<description>All the maps and handouts from the Walker in the Wastes campaign reproduced at a higher quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer's notes:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A campaign the size of Walker in the Wastes deserves special treatment from both the publisher and the Keeper, as it will reward the effort put into it with lots of entertainment and excitement. The player and Keeper aids in this pack are more extensive and elaborate than were possible in the campaign book itself, and so we have tried to do them justice here instead. We believe they will add realism and flavor to your campaign, and enhance your experience greatly. We hope you feel the same.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
