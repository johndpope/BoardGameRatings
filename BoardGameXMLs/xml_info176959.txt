			<description>夢想之道 (The Way of the Dream) is about the journey toward the dream. In the game, each player takes two roles at the same time: the one who tries the best to make their own dreams come true, as well as the key person during the pursuit of other players' dreams. What will happen during the journey depends on other players' choices; some are good, while others might hinder you a bit. Therefore, you can focus on disturbing other players, or concentrating on how to realize your own dream. Or, try to make a win-win situation with wisdom of crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a player's turn she will draw destiny cards and distribute them among all players as their hand cards. Then each player must give the active player one card from their hands, and the active must use what she has got form her fellow players' &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; to lay the cards onto the game board, paving the way toward her dream. Once a player reached the central goal area, her dream comes true and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
