							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spacenoir: A Bulldogs! Technoir Transmission</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TransGalaxy Pangalactic Corporation. One of the largest and most powerful entities in the galaxy. Though the Company has their fingers in everything these days, they started out as a shipping service, and that&amp;rsquo;s still a core part of their business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Class D Shipping Division. The difficult and hazardous cargo section of the Company&amp;rsquo;s shipping arm. Home of the desperate, the unqualified, and the just plain stupid. That&amp;rsquo;s where you ended up, most likely through fault of your own. The Company buys whatever junkers they can find for cheap, hires anyone who applies, insures the Hell out of the whole thing, and crosses their fingers that you losers can deliver enough hazardous cargo to hostile destinations to make it worth their while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are so desperate, such a fuck-up, or so insane that you took on this job. Unfortunately, so are your crewmates and so is your captain. Best of luck surviving your five-year contract!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spacenoir is a Technoir Transmission using the mad galaxy featured in Bulldogs! You need a copy of Technoir to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
