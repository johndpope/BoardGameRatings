			<description>In turn, players each place a wall of their colour, building up a grid.  When a square in the grid has three or four walls  of the same colour a castle of that colour is placed within the square.  When players run out of walls, they are allowed to reposition one of their previously played walls.  The first player to play all five of his castles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three player variant of the previously released game Castella, by the same designer and publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Castella&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
