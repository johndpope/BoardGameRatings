							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gene Rummy</name>
									
			<description>This is a genetics-themed educational rummy-influenced game, with some of the mechanisms derived from genetics as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are different from normal playing cards in that each card is a genetic base and also has a sequence number corresponding to its position in a DNA triplet.  Players draw cards and attempt to sort the cards into different sets of codons.  There are several different versions:&lt;br/&gt;- Quick Game (three complete sets)&lt;br/&gt;- Complete Game (extended to building proteins using the sets of codons)&lt;br/&gt;- DNA Draw (Poker-based)&lt;br/&gt;- DNA 3-card showdown&lt;br/&gt;- Supper-advanced Gene Rummy (collect 5 sets and build the 5 specific amino acids that occur in the chosen protein).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used as part of the game is an accurate genetic code dictionary and a protein chart of 8 proteins that are found in the human body.  The game also comes with a laminated score chart, a wet-erase marker, 60 cards, and rule booklet.  The rules also includes 10 pages of background information on genetics and the human body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
