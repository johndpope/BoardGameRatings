							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Brusilov Offensive</name>
									
			<description>The Brusilov Offensive&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Russia's Last Campaign, 1916&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In mid-May 1916, the Allies were faced with two crises.  At Verdun the French army was gradually being bled to death, and in Trentino, the Italian army was rapidly nearing its breaking point.  As in August 1914, the Allies sent out a call of au secours to the Russians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Russians responded on 4 June with an offensive along the entire line of General Brusilov's Southwest Front.  This operation resulted in the capture of some 150,000 square miles of territory, inflicted losses of over 3/4 million, and force the Central Powers to weaken their offensives.  As great as it was, however, the Brusilov Offensive was not the strategically decisive victory the Russians needed to stave off internal collapse.  In the game the Russian player must break through the Central Powers line and encircle masses of enemy troops, while the Central Powers Player must make careful withdrawals and timely counterattacks.  For both Players, the game is demanding and requires coherent planning and careful execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
