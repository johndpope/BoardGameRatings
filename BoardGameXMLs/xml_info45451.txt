			<description>The Global Financial Meltdown of 2008 is widely considered the greatest shock to the world financial system since the Great Depression fueled by a perfect storm of speculation in the housing market, the mismanagement of hedge funds and a lax regulatory atmosphere.  In short, pure unbridled greed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game allows you to enter the mayhem as a speculator with immense influence in the affairs of major United States banks heavily invested in real estate throughout the country.  Your aim is to invest in these regional banks and build them up.  If the banks get large enough, you begin to score points for your efforts.  However, as the game wears on, events in the world threaten your more ambitious investments and other major financiers may also decide to make risky investments that run counter to your interests.  Likewise, it is also possible for the end of the bubble to never come in this game - and the same investments that can bring about your own downfall may very well make you a very rich person indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place over four turns or quarters.  The game ends prematurely if three banks fail or the financial system fails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is print and play and can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.jkntech.com/blog/page/Downturn-Board-Game.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.jkntech.com/blog/page/Downturn-Board-Game.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
