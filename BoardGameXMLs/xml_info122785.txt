			<description>Ys V: Kefin, The Lost City of Sand (イースV 失われた砂の都ケフィン Īsu Faibu Ushinawareta Suna no Miyako Kefin) is an action role-playing game for the Super Famicom developed by Nihon Falcom Corporation. It is the fifth game in the Ys series of video games.  Ys V was originally released in 1995. In 1996, Falcom released a second version of the game for the Super Famicom with a higher difficulty level, known as Ys V Expert.  A PlayStation 2 remake of Ys V was released in 2006 by Taito Corporation, titled Ys V: Lost Kefin, Kingdom of Sand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adol is travelling through new lands, in search of more adventure, when he hears of the vanished desert city of Kefin. He sets off to investigate this ancient city's disappearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RPG-style statistical elements and the overhead view of most of the previous games are retained in Ys V. However, the combat system has been changed again; the player now must press a button to swing Adol's sword and attack enemies. Adol is also given the ability to jump and defend with his shield in Ys V.  A new magic system is introduced in Ys V as well, which requires the player to charge up spells by holding a button before they can be cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soundtrack to Ys V was composed by Falcom's Sound Team JDK.  Ys V has received three soundtrack releases to date:      Ys V Image Album (1996): A short selection of original tracks from Ys V, followed by three arranged tracks from Falcom's J.D.K. Band, and a vocal arrangement.      Music from Ys V (1996): The complete soundtrack to Ys V.  Ys V Orchestra Version (1996): A selection of orchestrally-arranged pieces from Ys V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ys V: Kefin, The Lost City of Sand&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
