							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dream Realms</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dream Realms- at once the most alien and most familiar of the myriad facets of the Multiverse, visited nightly by the slumbering masses of the Young Kingdoms yet little understood by even the Sorcerer-Emperors of Melnibone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether the worlds of dreams lie within the dreamer or across the million spheres, they are home to strange creatures and stranger inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreamthieves, those few with the skills and daring to brave and chart these alien climes, impose a certain order upon them- however such order goes only so far and even an experienced dream traveller may fall prey to the slightest flaw in his character or the first failing of his skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet, from these mutable and dangerous demesnes, solid reality of treasure and power can be brought back to the Young Kingdoms. The bold, the desperate and the selfless risk much to make dreams come true. Follow in the footsteps of Elric of Melnibone, the dreamthief Oone and countless adventurers and unfortunates who have confronted their dreams and others&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book, you will learn to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Defend your own dreams against assault from home-grown nightmares and external sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;     Enter the dreams of others as a dreamthief, either ignobly as a purveyor of pilfered hopes and aspirations or nobly to rescue dreamers from their slumberous curses.&lt;br/&gt;     Experience the Thousand Year Dream practiced by the Sorcerer-Emperors of Melnibone, visiting distant, perhaps imagined realms and gaining unparalleled experience of the Multiverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
