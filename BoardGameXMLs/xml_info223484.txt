			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninja High School (also known as NHS) is a comic book series created, written, and illustrated by Ben Dunn, and currently published by Antarctic Press. It was at first published by Eternity Comics. On occasion other artists and writers have contributed to the series including Carlos Kastro, Eric Meheu and Fabian Doles. It is currently being developed into a Feature Film by Perfect Circle Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NHS takes place in a suburban town known as Quagmire, located &amp;quot;Somewhere in the Midwest&amp;quot;. The series originally centers on the misadventures of one Jeremy Feeple, a 16-year-old boy attending Quagmire High School, an alien princess named Asrial from a planet called Salusia, and a young female ninja named Ichi-Kun Ichihonei, from Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally intended as a mini-series, the comic hit such a boom of popularity that it became a full series, currently totaling over 160 issues (as well as two mini-series, &amp;quot;Ninja High School V2&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Quagmire USA&amp;quot; and the color mini-series &amp;quot;The Prom Formula&amp;quot;). There have also been two-issue furry parodies which went by the name &amp;quot;Furry Ninja High School&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Furry Ninja High School Strikes Back&amp;quot;. Fan-contributed editions of the series include the &amp;quot;Ninja High School Yearbook&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ninja High School Swimsuit Edition&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new Savage Worlds based game setting puts you in the center seat, it allows you to control what is happening in your own version of the Ninja High School comic. Your imagination, this book, a pencil, some paper, and some dice are all that are needed for you to tell the story you have always wanted to tell. This is the first official RPG in its thirty year history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to &amp;hellip;..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninja High School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
