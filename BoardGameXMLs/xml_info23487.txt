Play then continues as each player then discards one card of their choice from their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cycle of Drawing &amp;quot;Future swings&amp;quot; and discards goes on for two turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the second round of &amp;quot;future swings&amp;quot; the dealer then takes the stack of future swings and deals each player 2 cards face  down.  After all players have received their face down future swings each is allowed to look at his/her two cards and discard any two cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all discards the players turn over the cards in their hand &amp;amp; the lowest score wins that hole.
