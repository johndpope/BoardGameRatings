							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Road</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King&amp;rsquo;s Road represents a stretch of road or trail through the wilderness, perfect to stage an ambush on the party as they travel between dungeons, encounter a mysterious wanderer or camp for the night after a long day&amp;rsquo;s journey. The mat has plenty of cover during battle with many rocks, trees and rocky slopes as well as a trio of roadside graves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These high-quality vinyl surfaces are ideal for staging encounters during your adventures! Each mat lies flat for ease of play and is sold in sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. Both Game Mats measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and are marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
