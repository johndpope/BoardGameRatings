							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Name of God</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Name of God is a little cynical trip into a bizarre hole, filled with homeless people, weird omens, dangerous situations, and ritual chanting. No, seriously, you will have to intone the words, or you will never find your true self again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Name of God is a nanogame. As such, it fits in less than half page and can be cut to appear as a tiny deck of business cards. Kicked into existence thanks to the lure of the GameChef2013, it has been inspired by the great ideas of Epidiah Ravachol, but then took a bizarre twist of its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Name of God is freely inspired to such works as Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere, American Gods and Anansi Boys. And The Prodigy's song Narayan which more or less means &amp;quot;The Name of God&amp;quot;. And also to my undying love for Unknown Armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 3-4 participants.&lt;br/&gt;Zero Prep.&lt;br/&gt;GM-less.&lt;br/&gt;Lasts about 3 hours.&lt;br/&gt;Surrounding people will direct worried glances in your direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
