			<description>A game all about betting. One player is elected to be the bookmaker. He offers odds as he sees fit and the players then bet on the race. A vinyl record is provided and, when played, will be a commentary of a race. Depending where the needle settles on at the start, you can get different races with the same runners. The box claims it can be different every time. The other side of the record has a different race, just for variety. The record is rather nice, what would be later called a picture disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
