			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mines of Titan is a single-player role-playing video game, developed by Westwood Associates (later Westwood Studios), and released by Infocom in 1989 for PC, MS-DOS and Apple II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mines of Titan is a remake, or update, of the Commodore 64 game Mars Saga. Mines of Titan is lengthier, with some new storylines, a few more creatures and a few details like colors are different. And of course the game's location is moved from Mars to Titan. Still the cities and maps looks the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a role playing adventure, set in the year 2261, long after mankind has colonized the inner Solar System. The game takes place entirely on a barely-terraformed Titan, the largest moon of the gas giant Saturn, at the edge of frontier space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are charismatic 22-year old astronaut Tom Jetland, who has crashed on Titan after bullet-sized rocks from the Rings of Saturn pierced your ship's hull, and were forced to eject your payload and now have no means of transport off the world. In order to raise money, Jetland (or whatever you choose to name him; Tom Jetland is merely the default name for the protagonist) must search for, recruit, create and control a party of characters ready for exploration and combat. You develop yourself and your characters by improving their natural attributes and by adding and training in over twenty new skills which will aid in both your central quest and various side missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success depends upon competence in battle with various creatures and human foes alike; exploration of underground colonies and mining settlements; using your characters' skills to their best advantage; utilising a wide array of weaponry and aid acquired from merchants; and most importantly tracking down the clues to solve the mysteries of Titan. For only by uncovering a vast conspiracy and learning the fate of the disappeared Proscenium Colony will you be able to raise enough credits to pay for safe passage off Titan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
