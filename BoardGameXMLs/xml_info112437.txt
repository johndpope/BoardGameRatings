			<description>Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was supposed to be the last job you and Vinnie would do for the mob. After this, you'd both have enough money to escape Liberty City for good. Then Vinnie's getaway car went up in a ball of flames, along with all the cash. Suddenly every cop in the city is chasing you down. You're determined to get out of Liberty City, but not before you find Vinnie's murderers and turn the tables on whomever it is that's out to get you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open-ended gameplay that provides hours of portable entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An all-new, revenge driven storyline that puts you on the tail of your mentor's murderers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore and exploit a huge, sprawling Liberty City - in the palm of your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
