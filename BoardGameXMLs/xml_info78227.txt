			<description>Bomberman is an arcade-style maze-based video game developed by Hudson Soft. Bomberman spawned the long-running series with many installments building on its basic gameplay. The earlier game Warp &amp;amp; Warp by Namco is most likely the inspiration for the Bomberman gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eponymous character, Bomberman, is a robot that wants to be free from his job at an underground bomb factory. He must find his way through a maze while avoiding enemies. Doors leading to further maze rooms are found under rocks, which Bomberman must destroy with bombs. There are items that can help improve Bomberman's bombs, such as the Fire ability, which improves the blast range of his bombs. Bomberman will turn human when he escapes and reaches the surface. Each game has 50 levels in total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Bomberman %28video game%29 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
