			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your BBC Micro is under attack. The components on the circuit board are attacking the CPU. Can you stave off the many marauders by firing pulses of electricity along the data lines of the 6502. A full feature arcade game that will take you to your wits end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set inside the computer, on the circuit board itself. In the middle of the screen sits the heart of the computer the CPU with all its data lines. The humble components on the rest of the circuit board are jealous of the CPU's prestigious position and have worked their way loose from their soldered positions and travelling along the circuit tracks towards the CPU. Your only chance of preventing them from reaching the CPU and saving your precious computer is to fire pulses of electricity from the 6502 along the lines to destroy the oncoming meanies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programming by Chris Butler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
