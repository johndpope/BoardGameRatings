			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RuinCrawl is a fantasy setting in the style of those old fashioned sword and sorcery paperbacks that we used to read as kids. It is built for no particular author or world, but a great, amorphous fantasy setting where the trappings of one adventure need not spill over and restrain the next adventure, but with a framework where some consistency can remain as the situation requires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAG&lt;br/&gt;TAG stands for Tom's Adventure Gaming. This system is based on a set of rules that I put together during my time in the U.S. Army. It was specifically designed to fit in a cargo pocket-sized notebook to allow for role-playing sessions &amp;quot;out in the field.&amp;quot; My original design was heavily influenced by Ken St. Andre and his &amp;quot;keep it simple&amp;quot; principle but, over the years, I have continued to make and refine my own rules matrix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, TAG has become a fairly coherent and smooth-running system, requiring only a smallish, portable book, six-sided dice, and a few friends to get a great RPG session going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
