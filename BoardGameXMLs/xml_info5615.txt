							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">James Bond 007: Goldfinger</name>
									
			<description>Goldfinger is hiding in Fort Knox (the center of a 9X9 grid) guarded by 8 henchmen (blue).  16 agents (red), under the guidance of Mr. Bond, have been sent to apprehend him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement of pieces is easy... move any one of your men any distance along a straight line.  If you can trap an opponent's piece between two of yours, it is captured and removed from the board.  Goldfinger requires all four adjacent points occupied before he is captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object for the red player is to capture Goldfinger;  for blue to win, Goldfinger must escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If either player has a winning move on his next turn he MUST tell his opponent.  According to the rules: &amp;quot;Winning should occur by strategy, rather than by oversight.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
