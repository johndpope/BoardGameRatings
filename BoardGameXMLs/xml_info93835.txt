							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BOZ&#039;s BIG World Adventure Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Christian preschool DVD series &amp;quot;BOZ the Green Bear Next Door&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Be the first to make it around the world and back to BOZ's treehouse by completing challenges along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The first player draws a card and completes one of the following Adventure Card challenges:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counting (Red): Look at the picture on a RED card.  Is it a nose? Count the noses in the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charades (Blue): Use your imagination to act out what you see on a BLUE card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Spy (Yellow): Colors and shapes are everywhere! Can you spy the color or shape you see on a YELLOW card?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank You, God (Orange): When you draw an ORANGE card, tell God something you're thankful for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go (Green): Find the matching picture on the game path and move to that square when you draw a GREEN card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  After you complete the challenge on your turn, move to the next square that matches the color on your card.  If you draw a green card, immediately move forward or backward on the game path to the green square with the matching picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Play continues to the left until someone reaches the striped square at BOZ's treehouse and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
