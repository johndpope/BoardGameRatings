			<description>Players in this game compete to be the first to collect the 6 cards depicting the 6 pieces of the Armor of God. The first person to collect all 6 cards and discard all other cards from his hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players start with 3 cards each. On their turn, they draw a card from the draw pile and decide to either keep the card or play it. The rules do not mention a hand limit but logically a hand limit of 6 should be applied. Otherwise there is no way to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards can be pieces of the Armor of God, or action cards. Action cards include :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Drop 1 and Reverse - the targeted player needs to discard 1 piece of the Armor of God failing which they will miss a turn. Then the direction of play is reversed.&lt;br/&gt;     Drop 2 and Reverse - Similar to Drop 1 and Reverse except 2 cards need to be discarded.&lt;br/&gt;     Jumper - This card can be played at any time and takes precedence over all other cards. Play jumps back to the player who played the card.&lt;br/&gt;     Skip - This skips the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;     Little Angel - This counters the Drop 1 and 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
