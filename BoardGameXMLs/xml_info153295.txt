			<description>Welcome to Bureaucrazy. In this country, its unfortunate inhabitants need to spend days picking up and stamping forms for any activity they want to do in their lives. The players play the role of agents who try to help their clients to complete a series of simple tasks like buying a house, drive a car or work. But do not think it will be easy, because usually Burocrazy does not help its citizens: the offices only operate during certain hours, there are endless queues, and forms and signatures expire quickly, forcing you to restart the process the next day! Good luck and lots of patience will be needed to not go crazy in the process!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bureaucrazy is a worker placement game, with an approximate duration of 45 minutes. Holds 2 to 5 players. A match lasts 5 turns, in which players try to get the highest possible amount of money in order to be the winner at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
