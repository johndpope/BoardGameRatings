			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;Almost non-existent. Cards are numbered and have hearts printed on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Gaining the most points by laying down cards in columns/rows in descending order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;There are 100 cards numbered 1-100. These cards are grouped into 4 groups of 25 (1-25, 26-51,...), with the groups being different from each other in background colour.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, there are four jokers (one for each colour; can be used as a number of your choice within that colour's range), two super jokers (that can be used as any number), and 4 thief cards (allow you to steal another player's lowest card and place it in your own display as long as its value is lower than the lowest card already in your display).&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, some cards are removed if playing with fewer than 4 players. The remaining cards are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns. On your turn, you draw the top card from the stack and decide if you want to keep or discard it.&lt;br/&gt;The first card that you keep is placed in front of you in landscape orientation. Below this first card, you can later put additional cards. These are placed in two columns. Each card that you put down has to have a lower value than the previous card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round ends when&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a player has accumulated two rows with 6 cards each, or&lt;br/&gt;     the draw deck has been exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are counted as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each row with two cards counts two points.&lt;br/&gt;     If both cards in a row are the same colour, you get an additional point.&lt;br/&gt;     Complete rows with a coloured joker also get you a bonus points (rows with super jokers don't).&lt;br/&gt;     Rows with only one card count zero points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 4 rounds, and the player with the highest total score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
