							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zen Squire</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zen Squire is a 2-4 player card game inspired by medieval marginalia, absurd illustrations found in the margins of medieval illuminated manuscripts. The first edition (released on Kickstarter) includes 72-cards, a 54-card main game plus an 18 card expansion. All illustrations and design elements were produced in pen and ink and hand-painted with watercolor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Zen Squire is to collect 1,000 points. Each player begins the game with five cards, drawing one card and playing one card each turn. Cards are played into the area directly in front of each player, this area is your Castle, the total sum of which is your score. Diplomat cards contain positive or negative points. Any player can play Diplomat cards to any Castle. Once your Castle totals to 1,000 points, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenger and Defender cards contain actions, which can be played to the Discard pile in order for their action to occur. Actions may allow players to draw additional cards, steal cards from opponents, or even swap Castles! Rulers are played to any Castle and pair with a Diplomat card already in that Castle. Rulers cannot be removed by Challenger or Defender cards. Multiple Ruler cards can be paired with the same Diplomat card. Once paired with a Diplomat, Rulers may double that card's points, change a negative value to a positive value, or make that card immune to all actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
