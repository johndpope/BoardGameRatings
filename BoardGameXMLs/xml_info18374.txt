							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rulettes for 16th Century Naval Warfare</name>
									
			<description>A &amp;quot;Rulette&amp;quot; is a small rules booklet, according to the publisher.  The whole booklet is very short and the rules are very concise (not covering every possible detail), but still very playable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a set of skirmish rules for wargaming, where one model equals one ship.  (However, if transporting troops, a based group of figures represents 500 foot soldiers or 250 horse.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set largely in the Mediterranean Sea, it deals with both sailing and oared ships.  Only a few of the ships have cannons - most do not, in this era - but most forts have them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are given for movement by oar and sail (wind is a factor), beaching, launching, shelter from the wind, and also for land units transported by these ships.  Combat covered includes cannon fire, small arms fire, hand-to-hand fighting, and morale.  Rules for terrain are covered, including islands, beaches, assaulting a fort, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
