							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Era: Survival â€“ Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a century. 100 years since Contagion spread. No-one knows where the Infection came from. No one-knows whether a biological weapon was set off or a parasite evolved. And, honestly, no-one cares all that much anymore. Because over the last 10 decades, one thing has become clear: there will never be a cure. Research was abandoned after the Infected, humans as well as animals, started to mutate and civilization collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, only a number of small towns and villages are left. There is no unified government and very little order. Factions have formed. Some of them promise they can save us, others are bent on installing totalitarian regimes across what is left of the world. One &amp;ndash; the Red Cross &amp;ndash; distributes the only substance which is able to delay Infection, but supplies are running low. Chaos runs rampant. Treachery abounds. And every day, our numbers dwindle.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forget whatever you think you&amp;rsquo;ve come to know about post-apocalyptic roleplaying games! Era: Survival doesn&amp;rsquo;t present your standard zombie setting, but a world wrecked after 100 years of Infection. &lt;br/&gt;Humanity was almost wiped out after Contagion hit, but small pockets of survivors are trying to steer clear from the parasite that has turned humans and animals alike into degenerate monsters, mutating them in horrible, twisted ways. Most of them have grouped together in 14 different playable factions. Others are loners who believe their best chance of survival is to keep as little contact as possible with their fellow men and women.&lt;br/&gt;Era: Survival uses the same rules system as previous Era games, all successfully funded through Kickstarter, with minor tweaks to better reflect the genre and the addition of a Karma mechanic. The Core Rulebook doesn&amp;rsquo;t only include everything need to play, but also presents adventures and campaign outlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
