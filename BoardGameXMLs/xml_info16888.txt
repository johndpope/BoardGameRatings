			<description>&amp;quot;Coloption&amp;quot; is also known as &amp;quot;Col*ption&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;COLOPTION is a fast paced adult game with some gaming elements familiar to generations of games players and new devices [...]. The object of the game, which is played on a geometrically designed game board, is to move your men from their home base to a goal. To do this, you must roll combinations of dice and color cubes and move your men through an exit triangle, hazard hexagon, safety zones, alien colors and goal paths. If that's not enough, there's also the danger of being 'bumped' by other players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;COLOPTION can be played by two to six players which immediately makes it more sociable than backgammon which is played as a twosome. A round is over when all of one player's men have either reached the goal or been bumped. A round usually lasts from fifteen to thirty minutes. Play can be for several rounds as in backgammon or for point totals as in bridge.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
