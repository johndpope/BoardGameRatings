							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat Patrol: World War II â€“ Supplement for the South Pacific.</name>
									
			<description>Provides a comprehensive set of rules for skirmishes set in World War II. This supplement provides guidance for adapting the rules to the unique conditions and tactics of fighting in the South Pacific. The Japanese began the campaign with elite forces at high morale. US Marine forces also began the campaign at a high level of training and morale, while with the exception of the 25th Infantry Division, the US Army began the campaign with little experience and poor training. Most of this changed after Guadalcanal, where elite Japanese forces and US Marines experienced heavy losses. By that time, US Army National Guard divisions had greatly improved. Throughout the fighting in the South Pacific the Australians were widely regarded as having provided the most proficient and effective infantry. Fighting in the South Pacific was not homogeneous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each campaign and island provided a unique set of circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;This supplement adds Japanese morale result tables, Banzai Charges, Night Infiltration, Die in Place, Hidden Japanese Positions, with a detailed vehicle and weapons list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requirement for new action decks for the Japanese is not required but makes the game easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
