			<description>The game consists of 5 boxes, of decreasing sizes, plus card holders for each player and a bunch of 'bite cards&amp;quot; - thin strips of card which fit into the card holders. The boxes are stacked on the floor, largest first, in order of size. On your turn you place your bite card in its holder on top of the pile of boxes. Then you try to pick your card up with your teeth. You may have three attempts and only your feet may touch the ground. If you fail, you are out of the game. When everyone has had a turn, the top box is removed from the tower and the remaining players attempt to pick their cards up from that level. If the card has been successfully picked up from the lowest level by more than one player, it is next placed on the floor. If there is still a tie after that, the tower is rebuilt and the remaining players continue as before, but standing on one foot. The winner is the last person left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
