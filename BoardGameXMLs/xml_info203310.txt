			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are in England, at the beginning of the 20th century, a period of notorious and pioneering advances in science and investigation have led to the development of men with supernatural powers. The limits of science have been overtaken, and now they wonder what can be done with their magnificent gifts. In order to counteract those who use their powers for the benefit of evil, her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, has decided to act, and has enlisted the philanthropist and chemical engineer Ernest Solvay, to recruit the most loyal and capable men to her cause. So began one of the most exciting and bloody wars humanity has ever known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;Attack and beat your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;92 cards and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PREPARATION&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by any number of players from 2 or 5.  &lt;br/&gt;Divide the cards into three stacks:&lt;br/&gt;1- Scientists.&lt;br/&gt;2- Countries.&lt;br/&gt;3- Combats. &lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the three stacks separately. &lt;br/&gt;Deal the following cards to each player: 2 scientists, 2 countries, and 6 combats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CARD MANAGEMENT&lt;br/&gt;Keep the unused stack of combat cards separately and face down on the game table, when the stack has no cards left, shuffle the discarded cards once again.&lt;br/&gt;The unused scientist and country cards should not be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR HAND&lt;br/&gt;Before you start playing, each player must put their Scientist and Country face up on the table:&lt;br/&gt;Scientists&amp;rsquo; cards: Two allies to attack with. The first value corresponds to the damage caused, and the second to the turns the player must rest after each attack. &lt;br/&gt;Countries cards: Places where you attack, the sum of the value indicates the life you have.&lt;br/&gt;Combat cards: Don&amp;rsquo;t let your rivals see them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEGINNING AND END OF THE GAME.&lt;br/&gt;You can decide who starts however you chose, and follow in turns in a clockwise direction. At the end of each turn, you can&amp;rsquo;t have more than 6 cards in your hand. The player who outlives the others is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAGES IN EACH TURN&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has three stages:&lt;br/&gt;1- Combat action. You can use combat cards once only, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to combat, you can use your turn to discard the cards you don&amp;rsquo;t want. &lt;br/&gt;2- Scientist action.  You can attack with one scientist only in each turn. &lt;br/&gt;In order to use them you have to activate their powers previously by using two Formula cards (see Combat cards). &lt;br/&gt;3- Take as many cards as you need from the Combat stack until you have 6 cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
