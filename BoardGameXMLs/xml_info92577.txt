			<description>This is a trivia game centered on the world of gossip and celebrities, with questions from the past and present that must be answered by the players in order to be the first to reach the GOAL square, and answer &amp;quot;The Challenge&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The game play consist in the roll of two dice, first one for moving through the board, and then another to choose from the four questions in the card. With a result of five in the second die the person questioning chooses one of the four, and with a six you move to the next space of the board, and your turn ends. &lt;br/&gt;If you fail the question, you normally have to move backwards several squares, and if you answer correctly you move forwards some squares. How many spaces you move will depend of the type of square you land on with the roll of the first die. (there are five different, and then the GOAL square)&lt;br/&gt;The Challenge consists on answering correctly three of the four questions of one card. If you do it, victory is yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
