			<description>Score the most points by collecting sets of 3 and avoid the 'Bite Me' card. You obtain cards from other players by asking them for specific cards, by incorporating the words on the card in a sentence, phrase, question, etc....Example: You have a Clueless card and ask someone for theirs, by saying: You are so clueless about women. If you do not have the card being asked, but have the 'Bite Me' card, you can pass that to the person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 61 cards and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
