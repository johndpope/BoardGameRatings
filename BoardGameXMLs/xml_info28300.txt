			<description>The object of the game is to be the player to have the most points when the game ends. (Copied from the game's instructions)&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move their token first to complete the 'car' track, then to use their boats to move to different islands.  Different spaces will allow players to draw a card from the elephant deck.  Alternatively players may visit shops to collect souvenir cards.  When a player reaches the end of the track the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
