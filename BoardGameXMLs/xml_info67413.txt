			<description>From the front of the box: &amp;quot;The game of memory &amp;amp; morals.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memory:  The object of the game is to collect six gold coins.  You travel around the board on one of six different roads.  Movement occurs after turning over a picture that matches the picture next to the next space on the road.  Each road is three pictures long and ends at an inn where you collect the gold coin.  You may then choose to move to whichever road you want to travel next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morals:  The pictures next to the roads show the consequences of 18 of Christ's miracles.  The pictures that you turn over to match with them are the same scenes before the miracle occurred.  The rules also contain a short story of &amp;quot;Malek's Journey&amp;quot; wherein he learns the secret of great wealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with instructions, a game board, 6 &amp;quot;Malek&amp;quot; sandal pieces, 6 flat leather purses on which you lay the coins, 18 match pictures, and 42 cardboard coins (6 coins in 7 colors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
