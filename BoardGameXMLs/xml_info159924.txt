							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fields of Fire: War Along the Mohawk</name>
									
			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in 1757 on what is now the eastern American/Canadian border, Fields of Fire allows you to play your part in the titanic struggle between the British and the French for the control of the region. You lead your own hand-picked team in a series of sometimes daring, but always dangerous, missions trying to cope with the many obstacles that the enemy will place in your path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fields of Fire's format is simple. First decide whether you are fighting for the French or the British and select which character you will play as - there are over 40 to choose from, including British soldiers, French soldiers, Rangers (from the British Colonies), Hurons, Abenaki's, and local townsfolk, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You report to your Commander's Office at your home Fort where you are given a perilous mission to undertake. Go to the Rest House and select whom you are going to take with you and play out the mission on a 'real-time' scrollable map of the area. There are over 17 missions for you to master as a British operative and a different set of missions for when you play for France! By the way, the enemy has been known to attack your home Fort so make sure you keep it well protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
