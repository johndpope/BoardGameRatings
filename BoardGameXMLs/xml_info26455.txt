			<description>Just as in the NRK show you have to answer questions in your favorite subject and try to reach the top with the 48 000 kroner question. You have 15 seconds to provide an answer, everything while the electronic timer plays faster and faster. Simultaneously your opponents make it even more stressful for you when they place their chance cards and thereby signal that they want to &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; your question. The subject cards are divided in two levels of difficulty (children and adults), so that the whole family may compete at equal terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience the excitement from the TV screen and try to win as much money as possible with your knowledge. The wealthiest player wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the box - translated from Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
