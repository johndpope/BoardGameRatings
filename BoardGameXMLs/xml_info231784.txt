							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">10 out of 10 Maths Number</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematics National Curriculum is split into five Attainment Targets: this suite of SIX expertly designed educational games covers 10 essential areas of the Levels set out in the second - Number. The ten topics covered by the package - listed on the front of this box - are taken from various Key Stages and, as children learn from the games, their progress is automatically recorded in 36 specific areas of Attainment Target 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The programs are fun for single players or groups and the unique assessment system monitors the progress of between 1 and 64 children with no input from parent or teacher needed. Watch them, join in the fun or leave them and return later to check progress. You're in control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnival - Here's a great shoot-'em-up that checks number skills along with fire power. The speed of the numbers can be increased to challenge even arcade experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon Brain - This game makes calculator uses and practice compellingly fun. Key presses are graphically displayed on-screen to let you look back when answers are incorrect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab It - Find and grab answers quickly as they jump around the screen in this fast-action game. It's a great way to practice number skills from tables to estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheers - Strategy is needed in this unique quiz game. It will keep everyone on their toes. Use any of the six fully graded sets of questions or compile your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover Up - This challenging game of matching really gets children thinking. It's a game of real strategy - especially in the multi-player modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Bang - Keep cool and answer quick is the aim of this game. Quick responses are needed for high scores - an exercise in scale reading as well as arithmetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Matthew Atkinson&lt;br/&gt;Amiga version by Darryl Kiley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
