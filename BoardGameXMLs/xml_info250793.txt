			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a supplemental Game Master's Kit for the Call of Cthulhu scenario Sun Spots. It contains a number of tools to help the GM run a fun and creative game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Pre-generated PCs: Eight pregens are included to bootstrap your party, complete with hand-drawn illustrations by Reuben Dodd and backgrounds. Perfect for running a con game!&lt;br/&gt;    Playtest Notes: Reviews various playtests and ideas that were included (and some that were not) as the scenario was created.&lt;br/&gt;    Maps and Placemap Prop: This scenario includes three maps by Jake Coolidge, including a hand-drawn map of the town of Evergreen. We have then taken the hand-drawn map and created a period-apt placemat map prop for in-game use, showing all the in-game locations for the PCs to explore. &lt;br/&gt;    Diary Entries: Reprints the diary entry game prop in a separate pdf file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
