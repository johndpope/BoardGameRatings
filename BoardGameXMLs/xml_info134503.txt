			<description>Rollaway is an abstract dice game about picking the right time to play whatever actions you roll.  The interaction of six simple actions (win, lose, skip, double, give, and take) produces a rich variety of gameplay.  A die that normally scores one point could earn you four, or could be taken away.  You might use a skip-die to prevent the next player from giving you a burdensome lose-die, or you might take the lose-die so you can pass it on to someone else.  Rollaway is simple to learn, highly interactive, and provides hours of lightly strategic fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
