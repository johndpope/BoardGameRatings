							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellfire: Booster Pack, Set 14 â€“ Millenium</name>
									
			<description>Spring 2002 - This second on-line booster came out in 2002.  This was produced by the &amp;quot;Spellfire Triumverate&amp;quot;: Mike Huebbe (repressenting the judges), Steve Naus (representing retail), and Hayden William Courtland (representing the fans).  Again, based on fan suggestions, they created a 99 card set.  However, they added a new concept to Spellfire that has been in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons for years: dice.  Many cards required rolls to find their effects or level.  While protested by some fans, the set has gotten general approval and is the most recent part of the canon and tournament scene.  These cards, like Inquisition, can be downloaded and have an un-official guide in process (Grading a Millenium).  Landmark cards: Duergar (#1), Aurumvorax (#8), Feinoue, Void Shaper (#14), Cockatrice (#17), Doomgrinder (#21), Rigged Dice (#22), Corruption (#29), Amish Nick (#41), Insanely Good Fortune (#47), Two Fisted Player (#51), Kronos the titan (#62), Poisoned Oasis (#68), Gellidus, Dragon of Ice (#73), Hornung's Randomness (#78), Bansmareton (#79), Wealthy Oriental Vassal (#81), Elven Towers (#89), Stomp (#92), and Stunning Fist (#98).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
