							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elric of Melniboné Companion</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Elric Companion is a boon for all Games Masters who are desirous to send their players off into the hazardous world of Elric. Expanding upon Elric of Melnibon&amp;eacute; and Bright Shadows, the Elric Companion creates a more vivid experience of the Young Kingdoms and beyond. Inside you will find a multitude of new rules and scenarios to enhance your gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New rules, which cover sailing and the vessels that ply the oceans, allow for travel between major ports and the investigation of mysterious islands. The Eternal Champion travels between the million spheres, now any party can have the opportunity to visit other planes. The unknown east is described in depth, allowing for adventures in lands never fully revealed within the original stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insanity and madness are commonplace in Elric's world, due to the unnatural influence of Chaos and now you can add this new danger to further threaten Player Characters. The cries of battle ring out across The Young Kingdoms and new rules allow for these to be played out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inhabitants of this world are also not neglected within the Elric Companion. From the heroes in Elric's saga, to foul monsters, strange creatures and the evil of demons, all provide new challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally there is a scenario included, involving the sorcerer Tork'aandn, whose desire to forge a strong empire could ultimately result in the forces of Kelmain storming the Young Kingdoms and altering this world forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So strap on your sword and leap astride your warhorse, for adventures within the Young Kingdoms have taken a new turn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
