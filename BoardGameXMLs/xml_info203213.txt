You control the actions of a daring adventurer finding the way through a dungeon filled with undead monsters and treacherous traps. In the mysterious creepy corridors of the dungeon your quest continues against the evil forces that oppose you. Your daring adventure begins and your quest awaits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to clear the dungeon of evil and to defeat a evil Necromancer. You and the other players join together looting monsters and plundering the dungeon in search of magical items and weapons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a character-driven game, which uses both cards and dice to deal with the many obstacles within the dungeon and the battle with the Necromancer. Players play cards from their hands and roll dice to complete their goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a character deck at the beginning of the game then equip their special items and weapons. Each character is unique and uses different styles of play. The awesome forces that oppose you can prove to be more than a match and adventurers will die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together, on their own or against the other players. They battle monsters and avoid traps. When the Necromancer is defeated the player that collected the most gold wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
