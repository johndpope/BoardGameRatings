			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all things that creep and crawl in the dark places of the earth are descended from the vast diversity of animal life. In fact, a number of dire strains of fungi and mold call the deep home, and can be just as deadly to the intrepid explorer as the most rapacious subterranean monster . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackdyrge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackdyrge returns with a new template that infects plant creatures with those famous dungeon molds and fungi, adding a unique and creepy twist to their appearance, traits, and abilities. Moldering creatures gain a number of new and potent powers, but also gain a debilitating weakness related to the infecting organism. In addition, moldering creatures are perfect for subterranean encounters; they allow you to surprise PCs by inserting plant monsters, normally found only in aboveground environments, into a dungeon setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you're tired of waiting for your PCs to blunder into that carefully placed patch of green slime, then take the slime to them with Blackdirge Publishing and the moldering template.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackdyrge's Templates - Moldering contains 9 pages of new d20 material and includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An introduction by Blackdyrge&lt;br/&gt;     The moldering template&lt;br/&gt;     Iconic monster #1 - a moldering shambling mound&lt;br/&gt;     Iconic monster #2 - Korgok Nur, a colossal moldering tendriculos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
