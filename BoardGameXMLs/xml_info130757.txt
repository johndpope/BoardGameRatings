							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zoombinis Mountain Rescue</name>
									
			<description>Zoombinis Mountain Rescue is the second game in the franchise and boasts improved visuals and sound over its predecessor, Logical Journey Of The Zoombinis. After re-releasing the original game, The Learning Company developed two sequels, one of which was this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the foundation of Zoombiniville, the Zoombinis find peace once more, until a small group of them get trapped inside a cave seeking shelter from a storm. They meet up with strange creatures called Boolies who occupy a city known as Booliewood. As a result of the storm, the Boolies have been scattered across the land, and their leader, the Grand Boolie Boolie, has disappeared. The goal of the game is to recruit a total of 400 Boolies to Booliewood to resurrect the Grand Boolie Boolie.&lt;br/&gt;After they've all made their way home, the Mighty Boolie Boolie returns and the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;Other puzzles in the game include multi-dimensional movement, rotation puzzles, and several deduction problems, as well as new versions of puzzles from its prequel, Zoombinis: Logical Journey.&lt;br/&gt;The graphics have been upgraded in this game and the Zoombinis now use 3D graphics. There are now three difficulty levels for each puzzle instead of four.&lt;br/&gt;The term Boolie is a pun of Boolean, the type of logic used for the characters here. The Boolies are either happy or sad: they must be one or the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Zoombinis: Mountain Rescue&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
