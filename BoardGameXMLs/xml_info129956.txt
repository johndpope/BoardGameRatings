			<description>Are you ready for some football dice? Gridiron Dice is a fast paced push your luck style dice game. Players take turns grabbing custom dice and rolling to reach first down. There are three kinds of dice; easy dice with the least number of sacks and incompletes on them, normal dice with longer yardage but more chance of receiving an incomplete, and hard dice with the worst odds and biggest payout of them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't make a first down in your first three dice, you can choose to grab a fourth and roll, or punt the ball. Advancing their marker down the field they try to reach the endzone, or at least get in field goal range. First player to 30 points wins in a normal game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
