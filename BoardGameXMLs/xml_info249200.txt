			<description>Five A Side International Soccer Association Championships (FASISAC) is a card and dice game simulating the management of five-a-side football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a fictional five-a-side league made up of players from all over the world who have been plucked from futsal, the 11-a-side game and freestyle exhibitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins with managers drafting a squad of 8 players, they then select from one of 6 tactics drawing on the skills of their team but also trying to combat the opposition's expected tactic. A line up of 5 players is chosen and the tactics result in a number of attacks and boost cards used to play out the first half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacks are carried out by rolling a custom 8 sided dice to see which player is attacking, the defending player rolls a different custom d8 to see which player defends - strikers are more likely to attack, defenders are more likely to defend! Stats are compared - dice rolls and boost cards are added. If the defender wins the attack is over, if the attacker wins he has a shot on goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At half time managers can change their tactics and their playing line up before battling out the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After careful selection of squads and tactics the matches play out quickly with a net full of drama, personality and goals a plenty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
