			<description>From Published Material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A KICK START TO POST-APOCALYPTIC ADVENTURES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players of SURVIVORS OF THE FIRE don't need to get bogged down with a lot of flavor text and information their eyes were never meant to see!  That's why FRIZ GAMES now offers an economical digest-sized version of SOTF that has the rules players need to play the game as well as make and equip their characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SURVIVORS OF THE FIRE is a role-playing game set in a 1980 that never was - six years after World War III in a North America ravaged by biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, just emerging from the depths of a nuclear winter!  Characters of the game are hard men and women - products of the toughest times humanity has ever known!  Will they be a force to help mankind recover from the brink?  Or will they help push it over the edge into extinction?  It's up to the players to decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
