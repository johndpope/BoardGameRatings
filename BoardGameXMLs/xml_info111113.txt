			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 4th-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 9, 14, or 19 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This serial is the culmination of the W.A.R.D. Off Evil mini-series, which focuses on the Worldwide Alliance for Regional Domination (W.A.R.D.) and its efforts to obtain a super-weapon. In this mini-series&amp;rsquo; first Living Spycraft serial, SPA2-02: The Beast of Dunvegan, W.A.R.D. tried to steal an experimental&lt;br/&gt;resonator weapon from the British Government. After that effort failed, the organization set up a secret laboratory in Malta to produce a retrovirus capable of killing thousands (see SPA3-03: The Maltese Experiment). Fortunately, a defecting W.A.R.D. agent briefed the Agency, allowing one of its agent teams to shut the laboratory down before catastrophe struck. Finally, in SPA4-05: The Yellow Submarine, the agents recovered the HMS Sea Lion, a British nuclear submarine, but failed to bring home her dangerous payload. That payload is the focus of this serial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W.A.R.D.&amp;rsquo;s European commander, Sir Simeon Smythe, poses as a senior civil servant in the British Ministry of Defence. He plans to detonate his newly acquired warhead at a London conference for European heads of state, scheduled shortly after the opening of Parliament. He expects that in the ensuing crisis, W.A.R.D. will swoop in and seize command of the stunned nations targeted by the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
