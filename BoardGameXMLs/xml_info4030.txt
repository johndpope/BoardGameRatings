Those with greater power can make sweeping movements greatly altering the course of the struggle. Lesser Priests, while more limited in might, are able to move more freely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A piece can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally exactly the number of spaces as the value currently on the die. After, you move, transfer power with the pieces you jumped (see below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on Pieces: You may land on a piece (yours or your opponent&amp;rsquo;s) only if your piece has a higher value than the one it is landing on. The piece that you land on is destroyed. The capturing piece gains +1 power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Transfer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As pieces move over one another, they exchange power. You give (1) power from your moving piece to each of your own pieces that you jump. Your piece takes (1) power from each enemy piece it passes over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underpowered and Overpowered Pieces: During movement, if a piece falls below (1) power, it is has become underpowered and is removed from the board. Likewise, if a piece gains more than (6) power, it has become overpowered and is removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two possible ways to win Metis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Occupy seats in your opponents Temple of Metis. There are two areas in each players temple: The inner chamber (darker) and the outer chamber (lighter). Occupying a seat in the inner chamber is worth 2 occupation points. occupying a seat in the outer chamber is worth 1 occupation point. You must hold 8 occupation points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Destroy opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces until she has three or less (making the above goal impossible for your opponent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
