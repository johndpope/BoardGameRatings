							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Liao</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assaulted by the Federated Suns, then betrayed by the Word of Blake, and shunned by virtually all others, House Liao&amp;rsquo;s Capellan Confederation stood against the Jihad alone. The Celestial Throne has been pummeled, and entire worlds lie in ruins. But the spirit of the people has never been stronger, and all across the defiant realm, research and development teams continue to hone the state&amp;rsquo;s technological edge. In factories and test sites deep within their borders, powerful new secret weapons are being forged to protect the Confederation against all of her enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Technical Readout: Liao samples the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of the Capellan Confederation. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake continues. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;have yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
