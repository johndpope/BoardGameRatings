			<description>Voyagers is a trivia game based on regions of the world.  There are five groups of 80 cards each - North America, South America, Africa &amp;amp; Oceania, Asia, and Europe.  Each card has three questions on it - for People, Places, and Things.  You choose which region to start in.  Once you have answered a question in each of the three categories (People, Places, Things), you can move on to another region.  Each correct answer allows you to continue your turn.  Once you miss, play passes to the player/team to your left.  The first player or team to answer each category in all five regions wins.  It's listed for ages 10 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
