			<description>The game consists of tiles with four edges in four different colors. The tiles are placed between the players so each player faces one color edge (all tiles have to be aligned accordingly). Each edge contains a number which forms a larger number together with all the tiles in one row. There are also commas, which can turn a potentially large number into a very small one. The idea is to place commas in positions which are at the rear of one's own line, but at the front of another player's, so the other player's number is minimal and the own one is large.&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of simply flipping over one tile and placing it into the grid. When all tiles are placed, four spaces in the 6 x 6 grid remain empty, thus further influencing the results.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the largest sum of all six lines is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
