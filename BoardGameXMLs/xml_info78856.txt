			<description>&amp;quot;Rad Racer (ハイウェイスター Highway Star) is a racing game developed by and published by Square for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. It was programmed by Nasir Gebelli, designed and supervised by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and featured music by Nobuo Uematsu, all of whom later contributed to Final Fantasy in similar roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By 1987, few racing games existed for the NES, and Rad Racer was seen as Square's answer to Sega's Out Run. In 1990, Square followed up with an exclusive North American sequel, Rad Racer II. It differed little from the first version, and players considered the gameplay inferior; as a result, it was not as successful as the first version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appeared in an infamous scene in The Wizard, where Lucas Barton (Jimmy's rival) uses a Power Glove to play through the first stage of the game, a feat in itself considering the much noted unreliability of the device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rad Racer is Uematsu's 15th work of video game music composition. One of its songs was used, with vocals added, as the theme song for Stinkoman, the anime-parody version of the character Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner Flash cartoon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Rad Racer , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
