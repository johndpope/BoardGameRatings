			<description>In Noboribetsu, a.k.a. のぼりべつ, each player wants to build a fine city, but you never know what you're going to get &amp;mdash; and in the end your plans might just get shot to hell anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with an onsen (hot springs) card, and a deck of twelve locations, twelve characters, and four Hell cards is shuffled. On a turn, the active player rolls the die. On a roll of 2-5, they take the top card of the deck and add it to their city. If it's a location, they place it on the road from their hot springs; if it's a character they place it in a location or hot springs; if it's Hell, hey, it's also a location, so it gets connected to the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a roll of 1 or 6, the first player to call &amp;quot;Noboribetsu!&amp;quot; gets to take the taxi (which allows them to draw two cards on a roll of 2-5) and move one top card in a city. They can steal an opponent's location or character; they can move a character to a matching location; or they can place a lone Hell card on an opponent's location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the deck runs out, players score nothing for Hell-inflicted locations, 2 points for each location and matching character card on it, and 1 point for all other cards. Whoever scores the most points earns 1 victory point, and after multiple games whoever earns 3 victory points first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
