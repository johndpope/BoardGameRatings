			<description>In a wicked twist of inspiration, the Elemental Kings have decided to choose their champions by restricting all magic to a single source of spells in the form of an oracle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires the following components from TKG ARENA: The Elemental Kings &amp;amp; TKG ARENA: Rise of the Magi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FULL SPELL DECK:    1&lt;br/&gt;STANDARD DECK (DECK):    1 for each player.&lt;br/&gt;OINKS:    5 from each element for each player (Default)&lt;br/&gt;LIFE:    20 for each player (Default)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this game scenario is to achieve the highest number of KILLs in the rumble. A KILL refers to the elimination of another enemy player by reducing his/her LIFE to 0 during a player&amp;rsquo;s turn. If a player is self-eliminated due to an unfulfilled deck out cost, this will not be considered a KILL. The eliminating player will get all remaining Oinks of the eliminated player. The game ends when it is evident that it is not possible to score more KILLs than any leading player who will become the winner. If all players are self-eliminated or there are players tied with equal number of KILLs, the last player to deck out will be the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved. Each player may attack each other according to the rules as described in TKG ARENA: Rise of the Magi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FULL SPELL DECK is shuffled and the top 5 cards are drawn and placed face up. During a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, he/she may choose to expend 1 Oink in acquiring a special card of the same element among these 5 cards. The special card replaces its counterpart card (of the same ELEMENT and FACE VALUE) and the counterpart card is removed from play in the game. After replacement, the DECK is reshuffled. The acquired special card(s) goes to the bottom of his/her DECK and the player draws sufficiently from his/her DECK to recover his/her hand to 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a counterpart card is in a player&amp;rsquo;s CURRENT HAND during his/her turn to acquire spells, the player may acquire it without cost. A player may make as many acquisitions as long as he/she has the necessary counterparts in his/her CURRENT HAND. If there are no counterparts cards in his/her CURRENT HAND, the player may still acquire the special card(s) by expending the appropriate cost as above. In addition, the player must end his/her turn immediately after the transaction. If the player does not acquire any special card(s) during his/her turn, he/she can choose to engage in battle with any other player in the group and the same rules of engagement (for the usual 2-player mode) apply including the use of the CHARGE BAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a special card is acquired by a player, another is drawn from the FULL SPELL DECK pile to replace it. If a cycle of turns (from player back to the same player) passes with no players acquiring any special cards, all the available 5 special cards will be placed at the bottom of the FULL SPELL DECK pile and another 5 new ones are drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may wish to use their own customised DECK in tournament mode for this scenario and omit the oracle (spell source) altogether. It is recommended that all players should then be fairly matched to warrant a fair game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
