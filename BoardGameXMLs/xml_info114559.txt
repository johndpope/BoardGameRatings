			<description>An abstract game for two to four players. The game board has an inner area of 6x6 spaces with numbers 0,1,2,4,8,16 printed on them, and an outer ring with numbers from 1-31. Players take turns to place, move, or remove one of their 6 tokens on the board; only one token of a colour can be placed on the outer ring. None of the tokens placed may be on the same horizontal or vertical line as another of the same colour. The winner is the first player to place their six tokens on the board so that the sum of the five tokens on the inner board equals the number that the sixth token is placed on on the outer board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
