			<description>Rymdimperiet (Space Empire in English) is one of the few games the Swedish publishers &amp;quot;&amp;Auml;ventyrsspel&amp;quot; did on their own without licensing an already exciting American game. The gameplay in itself is simple and each player will play the part of a space trader shipping goods across the galaxy. The goal of the game is to generate a net of 150,000 credits and return to your home planet before any of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move on already existing trade routes which they later can choose to buy to make their own for a set price. Once a trade route has been bought it will earn that player revenue each time another player is forced to use that particular route, as well as create safe passage way for your own trading ship when traveling in the sense that you do not have to pay the expenses to another player and give them the edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trade routes are different in length and usefulness and players will also be given the option to upgrade their ship to go in Hyperdrive, thus allowing them to move around the board to their destinations faster. The game uses a table where you look up the revenue from each trade between the starting planet and the goal for your shipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The element that makes the game difficult is that you cannot actively choose your trade route. It is randomly generated by dice rolls through a table to see to what area and which planet on the board you have to go to. This is also where owning and buying trade routes plays the part of a tactical element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Rail Baron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
