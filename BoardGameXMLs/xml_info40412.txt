			<description>This game is different from the card game Fan Tan.&lt;br/&gt;For the Piecepack Games version, see Piecepack Fan Tan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stewart Culin describes it in his book &amp;quot;The Gambling Games of the Chinese in America&amp;quot; as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;a game usually played upon a mat-covered table, with a  quantity of Chinese coins or other small objects which are covered with a cup.  The players guess what remainder will be left when the pile is divided by four, and bet upon the result.  The name means &amp;quot;repeatedly spreading out,&amp;quot; and refers to the manner in which the coins or other objects are spread out upon the table.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment needed to play include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing mat (called the t'an ching)&lt;br/&gt;Coins, buttons, or something that is numerous and can be spread out&lt;br/&gt;A cup or cover for the coins (called a t'an kun)&lt;br/&gt;A rod used to separate the coins (called a t'an pong)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes two people to run the game, One is called the &amp;quot;t'an kun&amp;quot; (ruler of the spreading out) and the other one is called the &amp;quot;ho kun&amp;quot; who acts as a cashier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Culin writes that the game is believed to have been invented by Kwan Chung, a renowned statesmen of antiquity who died in 645BC. Culin also mentions the likelihood that the game was invented for soldiers as a way for them to pass the time in camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is identical to the Phillipine game Capona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
