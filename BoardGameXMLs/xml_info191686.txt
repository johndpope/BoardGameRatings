							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Calais Bunker</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;A game for three or more players, set in occupied France during World War II. The characters are German soldiers manning a bunker on the coast of Calais, just prior to the Invasion of Normandy. One soldier is a traitor (although who this is is not known at the start, and indeed is determined only through cooperative narrative).&lt;br/&gt;The action is driven by scripted radio events over a period of fifteen minutes, at the end of which the characters get visual sighting of the Allied invasion fleet. At this point, each player describes one final statement or action for their character, and the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
