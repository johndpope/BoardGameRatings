			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 is a fighting game for the Xbox 360 and PS3. The game has its roots in the Naruto franchise, and allows players to take control of one of 44 characters from the Shippuden universe and fight their way through an engrossing story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a standard fighting game, with the player taking control of a fighter and engaging in combat 1-on-1 with an opponent. Defeating the opponent advances the player to the next stage. There are a number of features that set Ninja Storm 2 apart, however, including the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engaging Story Mode &amp;ndash; Adventure mode places the players in the world of Shippuden, where they can explore the region and re-enact fights from the show, as well as complete sub quests for different characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Battles &amp;ndash; On top of the standard combats that drive Ninja Storm 2, there are a number of specialized battles that add elements to the match, such as fight-exclusive powers, additional stages, quicktime events, and cinematic touches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deeper Narratives &amp;ndash; There are three main plot threads in the game, each of which is centered around a different character. The different stories each offer a unique perspective on the game and the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninja Storm 2 contains 23 interactive stages for players to compete on, and also includes local and online multiplayer capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
