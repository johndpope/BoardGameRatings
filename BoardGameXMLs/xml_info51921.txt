							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Metal Warriors</name>
									
			<description>Metal Warriors is a tank battle game that can be played by two or more players. This is a game played on a hex map or hex terrain. Each player takes on the role of a tank commander and plays tactics cards to manoeuvre his tank for tactical advantage before firing. The basic objective of the game is to eliminate the enemy tank(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been heavily influenced by three great games: RoboRally, Wings of War, &amp;amp; The Great Space Race. I would like to acknowledge the clever design elements in those games. Plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery. The rules for Metal Warriors are free for use and sharing, I only ask that you give credit to their origin. Enjoy your battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STATUS: Playtesting Phase II. Rules will be publishing on BGG when this wave of playtesting has been completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
