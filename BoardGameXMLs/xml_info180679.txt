							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Win/Lose/Draw Game of Gettsyburg</name>
									
			<description>Similar game to Monopoly or Easy money. Local Gettsyburg properties and businesses are depicted on the board. There are deeds for the businesses which can be bought. Also certain properties are tied to the cards in the game that function similar to the cards in Monopoly. There are no hotels or houses to build for improvements though. The object is to bankrupt all your opponents as you amass more property and money in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is meant as an advertising tool for the community and as a fundraising product as well. There is a list of owner\donors in the center of the map  board face. On the back are numerous pictures and stories of Civil War events. Dice are used for moving and some events. The player tokens are colored pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
