							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Brimstone: Resin 3D Depth Track</name>
									
			<description>This is a special limited edition piece for collectors. A 3D version of the Depth Track for Shadows of Brimstone lets you track your progress through the mines in style! This set comes with 3D ring markers in both wood grain - to represent the Hero Posse and chiseled stone &amp;ndash; to represent the Darkness Marker. These rings fit easily over the raised number pegs on the track and will ensure that your status is locked in, even when the game table gets bumped! The Depth Track is used in virtually every Mission of the game, so this exquisitely-detailed Resin centerpiece will make an excellent addition to your Adventures! We have very limited quantities due to the cost and difficulty to cast. Dimensions: 2 &amp;frac34; inches x 8 &amp;frac12; inches x 1 1/8 inches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
