							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.N. Critters Volume 2: Beyond the Campfire</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What creatures of the darkness lurk just beyond the periphery of the firelight as you settle down for the night? Four new nightshades lurk within the shadows themselves, while other creatures are drawn to the warmth of the fire, or to the campers themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second book in the E.N. Critters line brings you 24 illustrated creatures for your d20 fantasy campaign.  The creatures in this volume are primarily of lower challenge ratings as when parties reach the higher levels they are more likely to use magic such as secure shelter, teleport, tiny hut and so forth to avoid having to camp under the stars unaided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Volume 2 we have added three new features: full color illustrations, suggested knowledge tables and counter sheets. Each critter now has a table to aid GMs in determining what characters know about them on a successful Knowledge check. In addition, counters (front and back) for all critters in the book have been included after the statistics pages. The counter pages are set up to be printed two-sided on cardstock although you may just as easily print them out on two sheets of paper and glue them to the front and back of even thicker cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
