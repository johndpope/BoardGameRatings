							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadowglade Knightguard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural suspense, horror, and action await the unwary in Shadowglade! 500 years ago, the world ended. More than that, it was forgotten, the minds of those alive scoured clean of knowledge, history, and identity. In the intervening years, society has rebuilt as best it could, new alliances have been forged and blood-sworn enemies made as the surviving nations have begun to rediscover their roots. Out in the wilds and darkness, however, not all that lurks is friendly...or human...or even alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Shadowglade, shining knights of virtue are rare. A world of grey, where no one is truly good or truly evil, few paragons exist that exemplify the best the shattered race of man has to offer. While not perfect, the Knightguard of Shadowglade do their best to support their fellow residents and stand as a testament to the power of order and compassion.&lt;br/&gt;The Shadowglade Knightguard is a 20-level class written for use in the Shadowglade campaign setting but suitable for other settings as well. Essentially a lawful neutral paladin, the knightguard exist to uphold the law and defend all protected under its watch. Police and protectors of Shadowglade's interests both at home and abroad, the knightguard offer security in a questionable world, a step up for the less fortunate with the skill and heart to become a knightguard, and a shining example of the best Shadowglade has to offer the world. Included in this booklet are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Levels 1 - 20 for the Shadowglade Knightguard! While Shadowglade operates with a strong Epic 10 recommendation, all players interested in the class should be able to play it anywhere!&lt;br/&gt;     New Equipment! A handful of new pieces of equipment suitable for the knightguard and others in similar lines of work.&lt;br/&gt;     Favored Class Options, Traits, and Defects! Small hooks, but strong additions to the right back story, several hooks in the form of class options, traits, and defects are included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
