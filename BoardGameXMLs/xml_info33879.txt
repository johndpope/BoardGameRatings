							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Shot Checkers</name>
									
			<description>This game appeared as a web based game on the Cartoon Network site. It easily can be played with a standard checker set, and two pawns.  The object of the game is either capture all of an opponent's checker pieces or get their &amp;quot;Big Shot&amp;quot; piece (it rests on top of one of their checker pieces) across the board.  The game is very clever, and has subtle tactics and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
