			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re Bawling about You Down on the Farm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chicago sprawl is host to all manner of strange creatures&amp;mdash;ghouls, toxic spirits, hellhounds, barghests, and chickens. Yes, chickens. The city is mostly urbanized, but there are also large swathes of vacant land, and some enterprising souls have been farming that land. This is the Sixth World, though, which means that whenever you have someone trying something bold, you have a dozen other people thinking, &amp;ldquo;How can I use that to hurt other people?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The runners are going to have some unusual jobs on this mission, including spreading some poisons and making sure innocent lives are spared (if they&amp;rsquo;re so inclined). They&amp;rsquo;ll have to be on their toes to steer clear of the authorities, get all the pieces of this particular scheme in place, and in particular answer the pressing question: Just what is Mr. Johnson up to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amber Waves of Grain continues the latest Shadowrun Missions plotline set in Chicago. Whether you played other Chicago Missions, including the first one in this plotline (Ten Fifty-Seven) or are just launching into the series, this Mission provides plenty of action packed into a single adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amber Waves of Grain is for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
