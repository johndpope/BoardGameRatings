			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow Realms is a game of epic fantasy. You help bring to life this story. As a Player Character you create a living personality within this world. The role you play is your choice. But remember; the actions you choose will shape your future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow Realms has an Honour Based System. This means that a Game Judge (known as Plot Marshals) will not be required to approve all character actions. Since a Plot Marshal cannot always be present, each player will have a Shadow Realms Character Sheet. This sheet will list all the skills available to the player. Players should be especially familiar with all the skills that pertain to their character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players are expected to follow the rules to the best of their abilities. Any form of intentional cheating is unacceptable and can result in Experience Point Reduction or Expulsion from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun! LARPing is a way to not just tell a tale or read a fantastic novel or even immerse you in video game. LARPing is a way to live that tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
