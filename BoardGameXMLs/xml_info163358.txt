			<description>Forest Sprite is a cooperative game for 1-3 players in which players control a team of sprites and forest creatures on a mission to defend their home from an invading force of evil sorcerers and the monsters and misfortune they bring into your forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forest Sprite can be played as a standalone board game (challenge mode) in which player(s) can choose pre-generated character(s) and play any 1 of the Chapters. HOWEVER&lt;br/&gt;Sprite is best enjoyed by playing in campaign mode. In campaign mode, a player creates his or her own character and uses that character to attempt to beat each Chapter in order. Chapters get progressively more challenging, but as your character gains experience, it may attain new levels. When your character attains a new level, experience points can be spent to add new spells and abilities and upgrade stats. Characters will also pick up items as they progress through Chapters and defeat monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is pretty simple. The turn begins with the drawing of a mission and moving of any monsters that are on the board. The player may then take 3 actions using his or her character and/or forest animals in order to complete one of the open missions. When players fail missions, monsters get released. If 6 missions are failed, player loses. If the players draw all of the missions and fail less than 6 of them, they win (and gain experience points in campaign mode).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forest Sprite is a game full of tense decisions. (starting with creating a good character!) There are no dice (the only luck is in the order in which missions are drawn). This is a game of planning, skillful gameplay, and coordination of resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Awards;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Game&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Art&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Thematic Game&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Large Game&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most Innovative Mechanic&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place (tied)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
