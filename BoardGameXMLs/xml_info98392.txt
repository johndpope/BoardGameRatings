							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Claude Valmore</name>
									
			<description>Publihser Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claude Valmore, a former member of the Cerberus Division, is now one of the most enthusiastic champions of the Azur Alliance. A devout follower of the Arbitrator Arkeid, who he considers a beacon of hope for Ga&amp;iuml;a, this intrepid fighter is ready to prove that his inhuman endurance can only be matched by his determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - Light Azur Alliance - Level 45&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vermilion Parry (Ki, Dodge) - If the dodge is a success, the attacker suffers Seal Lvl 2.Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counter of the Cross (Ki, Counterattack) - Attack +4 / Defense -2. By using this Counter, Claude may counterattack even if he failed to dodge the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolute Defense (Ki, Effect, Reactive) - This ability may only be activated during the Maintenance Phase. Counterattacks become free actions for the rest of the turn. If an enemy unit engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Claude try to escape, Claude perform a free attack against it before it rolls for the escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
