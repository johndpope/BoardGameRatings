							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dr Fox&#039;s the Pepsi Chart No. 1 Board Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You've just launched three new singles ... they're hot and ready to trot ... hovering just outside the Pepsi Chart Top 50! BUT, so have your rivals just across the table ... WHO is going to be first to the NUMBER ONE slot?? &amp;quot;Take a chance, Take a chance&amp;quot; as some Swedish group once said.  Rock and Roll that dice and get those records moving up the chart! It's not just a steady climb upwards, things can go Down just as easily.  On the way you may have a FLOP or two, all just one of life's set backs on the way to fame and fortune.  Pick yourself up, dust yourself down, and start all over again!  Still, you'll need more than a little POP knowledge if, or WHEN you land on one of those tricky little 'trivia' spaces.  Good luck.  See you at Number ONE!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Nuff said!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
