			<description>The Walking Drunk is a social-interactive card game designed to create an unforgettable time with your friends. This game is part social interaction, using fun and creative activities to get players laughing and enjoying themselves, part drinking game including all sorts of alcohol related activities, and part board game including just enough strategy to keep the game moving along between activities. The Walking Drunk provides around two hours of gameplay for 3-8 players, although most probably you will run out of alcohol before you could finish the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
