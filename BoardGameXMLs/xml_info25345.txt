							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Flensburger Förde Spiel</name>
									
			<description>The game is a commercial game, related to Monopoly, for the purpose of promoting the area of the &amp;quot;Flensburger F&amp;ouml;rde&amp;quot;, a landscape in the North of Germany.&lt;br/&gt;The players move around a board, which consists of 40 squares. On most of the squares are parts of companies, which can be bought. The companies have values between 1000 and 8000 Euro. Three companies are combined by a color. Whenever a player lands on a win&amp;amp;loss-square, he must draw a card and the wins and losses of the business year are settled. According to the outcome the players gain money or have to pay money for their companies.&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one player goes bankrupt, the game ends and all company cards are sold for their original price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
