							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Things That Went Wrong While You Were Away</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you were away all sorts of things went wrong. The King was assassinated and the council of merchants now rules the town, your family was banished to the sewers, and that unused magical sword you sold to the item shop is revealed to be cursed and haunted, and now its new owner wishes to take over the world. What can we say, an adventurer&amp;rsquo;s life is always filled with, well, adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the heroes return to a known location, every change in the status quo helps impart the sense that the world is a dynamic place and things evolve even without the characters&amp;rsquo; presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
