							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicken Roundup</name>
									
			<description>A fox has invaded the farmyard and now each player must get as many chickens into their coop as possible.  Chicken Roundup is a two player card game of spatial rearrangement with a touch of tower defense where the players try to send the most chickens into their coop by shifting and swapping cards while observing the pecking order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 104 card deck consists of 100 Chicken cards in 5 colors, 2 Coop cards, 1 Fox card, and 1 Rooster card.  The Chicken cards are dual use and either represent chickens in the farmyard or can be used for different actions which are used to manipulate the grid of cards in the play area. The Fox card can catch Chicken cards which can then be used for their action. Coop cards are the target that the players are trying to herd chickens toward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
