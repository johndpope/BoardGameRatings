			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every system, every planet needs someone to live, work, and thrive in it.  &amp;quot;Denizens I&amp;quot; provides just that.  Not just people but, characters, people with something to lose, something to gain, and something that could enrich the lives of your players.  &amp;quot;Denizens I&amp;quot; provides two dozen detailed characters for the use as non-player characters and as player characters, for when you don't have the time to toll one up.  Inside you will also find pages of information on different culturals, planets, and societies in the form of library data.  Let's not forget the ships.  &amp;quot;Denizens I&amp;quot;, introduces three new ships found in the Foreven Sector.  Each ship comes with stats and a full set of deck plans.  What are you waiting for?  It's time to start really exploring the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
