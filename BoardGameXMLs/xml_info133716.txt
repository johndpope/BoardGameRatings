			<description>Space Shuttle Mission 2007, also SSM2007 is a highly realistic Space Shuttle stand-alone mission simulator for the Microsoft Windows XP, Vista and Win 7, 32/64Bit operating system. The simulator was released on January 1, 2008 after having been under development for more than six years.&lt;br/&gt;Space Shuttle Mission 2007 has been developed by a team of Space Exploration enthusiasts whose idea was to bring the old and venerable Virgin Shuttle Simulator alive again and match the new PC technology by re-designing a new Space Shuttle simulator from the ground up and adding better graphics and more features. The team planned to develop Space Shuttle Mission 2007 as a freeware game, but as the project became more ambitious and significant resources had to be invested to meet the new design requirements, the team decided to release the simulator as a commercial indie project. Initially released as a DRM downloadable, in 2011 it has been released as a CD Boxed Edition under the title &amp;quot;Space Shuttle Mission Simulator: The Collector's Edition&amp;quot; (or SSMS:TCE), in EU and USA, fully localized in English, German and French. The 2011 boxed edition includes all the new content, features and missions released for the 2008 edition and printed manual. On December 2011 the development team announced the plan to release a new version titled &amp;quot;Space Shuttle Mission Simulator 2: The Legacy Continues&amp;quot;, around December 2012. According to the initial announcement, the new version will have dramatically increased Earth resolution, enhanced scenery, fully active 3D cockpit, enhanced ISS, fully modeled ISS interior and more missions etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space Shuttle Mission 2007&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
