							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vile Magic of Argonax the Mad</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Vile Magic of Argonax the Mad, the first product in the new Super Genius Presents line of books. Each of the products in this line is the strong vision of a single game designer, bypassing the normal planning,development, and revision process used for most Super Genius Games products. While we consider those processes to be a major part of maintaining a high level of compatibility, quality, and balance in our main product lines, we also know that sometimes a writer has a strong vision that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly match the style of our company, or that the designer doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be diluted through normal development processes. In those cases, if we believe in the skill and vision of the designer, we now have the option of presenting their work without laying claim to it as part of one of our standard product lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most Super Genius Games products are the carefully developed work of a team (even when there&amp;rsquo;s only one designer, the input of the whole Super Genius staff is likely to have affected the product), Super Genius Presents are the editorial pages, the solo rants, and the soapboxes. As a company we&amp;rsquo;re giving individual creators a chance to present their ideas more directly to the consumer. As commercial works, we&amp;rsquo;ll ensure such products are professionally produced and edited, but the tone, content, and voice are largely under the control of the authors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
