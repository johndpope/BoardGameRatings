							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rain Forest Frog Jam Game</name>
									
			<description>Each player has four moves to move all three of his frogs or any combination of his frogs. Frogs are moved onto tokens. Tokens are then flipped to reveal picture of a particular frog predator. The number of tokens flipped gives the player the same number of chances to match the token to other tokens. Players keep tokens when two match. Players can land their frogs on opponent's frogs and send them back to their starting corners. When all tokens are gone, the player with the most matches wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
