							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rusty Ziggurat</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ziggurat was dug by a sweet and loving Queen Ant by the name of Amblin.  Under the guise of ant, the demon Xylo told her that riches were to be found the further she dug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As she dug she uncovered many vile things, but no riches.  Losing most of her hive to battles with undead, fungi, and invading predators, the Queen continued to dig deeper at Xylo's word.  Eventually she did find gold.  But not the fiscal kind.  It was an amber well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the tale is a sad one.  She became addicted to the amber, sending her ants out like slaves to gather more and more.  Now her hill is in shambles, a rusty visage of what it used to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 1st - 3rd level characters.  Oddly, the map for the adventure is provided as a URL to an image site, and most of the treasure is provided as a URL to a document site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
