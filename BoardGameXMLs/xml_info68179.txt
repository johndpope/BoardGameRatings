			<description>On June 8th, 1864, in Kyoto, there was a very famous sword-action between Shinsengumi and Kinnoh-rohshi.  Yes, it was Ikedaya.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikedaya_Incident&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikedaya_Incident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was rumored that the most radical group of Kinnoh-rohshi had planned to kidnap Komei-emperor from Kyoto while they set up fires around Kyoto-city.&lt;br/&gt;Shinsengumi, the patrol group hired by Edo-bakuhu decided to assault the Kinnoh-rohshi's meeting before the final moment.  They found the meeting at Ikedaya.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small postcard game.  It was distributed on A-game shop's yearend-yearopening campaign between 2009 and 2010.&lt;br/&gt;Basically this game uses the same game engine as 47 Ronin.  Each player take action by one of his stack alternatively.  Each stack can move and then fight to adjacent enemy stack.  This is chess-like puzzle movement.  A goes to attack B to open the path.  But, the enemy moves C to defend the path just opened.  And so on.&lt;br/&gt;Also, if you have issue #1 of Wargame Japanese History, you can use counters from Shinsengumi Chronicle for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though this is a small game, it is filled with puzzle-like tactics and excitement of swordplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;updated&lt;br/&gt;This game is reprinted as a second game of Wargame Japanese History #27.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
