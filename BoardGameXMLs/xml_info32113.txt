			<description>Give Us A Job is a roll and move game where players are trying to get a job, keep it, and then gather enough money to be able to buy five luxury items and have &amp;pound;100,000 in cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are chance cards and players collect a salary every time they pass their home square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The items required to win the game are: a helicopter, a house, a yacht, a sports car and a swimming pool (whether they have a house to go with it or not).  Sadly, these are represented by cards rather than models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
