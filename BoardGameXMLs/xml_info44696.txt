							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starblazer Adventures</name>
									
			<description>Starblazer Adventures is based on the classic British comic series, Starblazer, from the 1970&amp;rsquo;s and 80&amp;rsquo;s. Each of Starblazer's 281 issues explored a whole adventure set within the vast galactic empires of the far future, giving this massive 632 page roleplaying game a wide variety of settings to explore. From low-fi space exploration to galaxy-busting wars to space fantasy epics at the end of time, there is plenty for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starblazer Adventures is powered by the critically acclaimed FATE rules system.  FATE was recently seen in action with Evil Hat Productions' popular Spirit of the Century RPG and has been tweaked to give Starblazer players the full intergalactic meal deal. FATE lets you leave the maths behind and really focus on exciting stories. There are many options to let you skip the more detailed rules and keep it lite and fast or play starships, star monsters and even whole empires just like characters. For those familiar with FATE there are new FATE rules for alien powers, robots, vehicles, starships, giant war machines, empires, equipment, careers and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core release includes three detailed settings based on the very best stories from Starblazer. It detail recurring characters, organisations, empires and aliens such as the Fi-Sci (the Fighting Scientists of Galac Squad), The Star Patrol, The Suicide Squad, The Planet Tamer, Cinnibar the barbarian warrior of Babalon and galactic cop Frank Carter to name just a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose from 8 alien races or play whole star empires! There&amp;rsquo;s over 100 worlds, 70 heroes, alien races, monsters &amp;amp; starships. There&amp;rsquo;s an introductory adventure &amp;amp; tons of support for Story Tellers including adventure seeds, several plot &amp;amp; planet generators and over 400 pieces of inspirational art!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by British publisher D.C.Thompson, the original Starblazer comic was the home to some of the best British science fiction space opera of the 1970's and 80's. Featuring stunning art and classic space opera stories, comic creators such as Grant Morrison and John Smith, artists Enrique Alcatena, Mike McMahon, Cam Kennedy, John Ridgeway, Alan Rogers, Jaime Oritz, Ian Kennedy, Colin MacNeil and Casanovas Junior helped bring the fantastic 'spacefiction adventure in pictures' to life. Over 400 pieces of Starblazer art from these heroes of sci-fi art have been used throughout the book to bring the world of Starblazer Adventures to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starblazer Adventures was nominated for 3 ENnie 2009 awards:&lt;br/&gt;- Best Rules&lt;br/&gt;- Best Game&lt;br/&gt;- Best Product of the Year&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
