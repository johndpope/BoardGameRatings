			<description>Oblasta is a simple, fast playing, two player abstract stategy game. &lt;br/&gt;  Players take turns rolling two sided playing pieces, and using them to perform actions on the board. Each side allows the player to perform differnt actions on. But, the player is limited to eight pieces, and the pieces used to roll, are also the pieces used as units on the gameboard. So players are forced to try and strike a balance between units in their hand powering units on the board, and units on the board actually fighting the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;  A player wins by either, eliminating all the opponents offensive units, or by postioning his own offensive units in an unbreakable defensive postion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
