			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;THEほうきギターズ (THE Houki Guitars) in English means &amp;quot;THE Broom &amp;amp; Guitars&amp;quot; (with the emphasis on THE intentional).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game of THE Broom &amp;amp; Guitars, you lead a music band of high-school students, and compete against rival bands with your live performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the traditional Japanese game  Shichi Narabe with some twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four suits that correspond to parts of the band: Vocal, Guitar, Bass, Drums, and each suit has seven levels ranging from 1 to 7,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You buy an instrument card you want to upgrade, and at a later turn you place that card out at appropriate position on the board like Shichi Narabe (the card being placed must be adjacent to an existing card), but unlike Shichi Narabe, vertical connections and diagonal connections are allowed as well as horizontal connections. You advance your skill of that instrument (or vocal) in this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all cards of one suit are bought, it's time for live performance. All players count victory points according to skill levels they reached for each suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's one round. After the second round, the highest scorer wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;メンバーを集めてバンドを結成します。&lt;br/&gt;バイトをして楽器を入手したり、楽器を練習をやりつつ&lt;br/&gt;ライブで客をより熱狂させたほうが勝者です。&lt;br/&gt;カードを一定のルールを元に出し、それに応じてコマを進めるゲームです。最も効率よくコマを進めることを目指します。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
