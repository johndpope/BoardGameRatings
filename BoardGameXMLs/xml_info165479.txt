			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Webs is Thunderegg Productions' first supplement in a line of system-agnostic, multi-genre universal generators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book allows for fast lifepath-style character background generation regardless of system. The book also gives several options for connections between PCs before the game begins. No more simply gathering anonymously at the tavern!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last feature is a system for detailing who your PC knows as well as recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is spelled out clearly. The book is printer friendly so you can hand out copies of each table to players. Every section fits on a single page, including the explanatory text. No awkward flipping between pages here. It's all right where you want it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each page is designed to give all results in usually a single roll. You can have a character's backstory in the same time that it takes to roll your starting stats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
