			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Futures is a Science Fiction conversion for the Pathfinder RPG system, but its intention is not to follow any particular genre of Science Fiction but rather Infinite Futures provides all of the tools for creating an RPG campaign in many different types of Science Fiction genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need is provided within the pages of Infinite Futures, new races, new classes, feats and skills.  A full Psionics system usable in a Sci-Fi setting is also provided, along with advice on running a Sci-Fi based RPG, foes, and dangers, space travel and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011 Avalon Games released the first of many genre expansions for the Pathfinder RPG.  Infinite Future took the Pathfinder system and applied it to the Sci-Fi genre, allowing game masters and players to explore all the different possible game available within the Sci-Fi setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Futures was always meant to be a living system, which would grow in scope, adding more to the genre and allowing players and game masters more and more possible opportunities to explore their favorite games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this in mind Avalon Games is happy to release Infinite Future 2.0.  This second edition to the game has allowed Avalon to make the core system to be used as a tool box for game masters and players to invent their own settings, and to bring forth more interesting and exciting possibilities for the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Futures 2.0 is everything you loved about IF, but made better, so get ready the future is now and you are invite to explore it with Avalon Games and Infinite Future 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
