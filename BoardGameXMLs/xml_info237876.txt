			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalogued by the Deep Guild simply as Allas'nerig 417, the Temple of Elanna stands upon the vast Ruhig Plains, its weathered stones but one aging structure set within the sprawling ruins of a long dead civilisation. Covering many square kilometres of the Ruhig grasslands the ancient ruins of Allas'nerig are best known for the massive Temple Dome at their centre, however it is the smaller ruins that spread from its edges that provide the best opportunities for the Brethren of the Deep Guild. The Temple of Elanna is one such ruin. Although the upper precincts of the temple have been ruined by long exposure to the elements its lower levels have survived intact, and research has shown that it may well be the resting place of an artefact long sought by the Guild. Somewhere within its darkened halls resides a statue of blue Azuril, a representation of the Daughter-Goddess Elanna that, it is said, holds a gem of great value and even greater power. You have been commissioned to find this talisman and return it to the light of day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
