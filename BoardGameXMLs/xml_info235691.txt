Communities along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play with the ME-GA Expansion Set...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Replace your old Challenge Cards with NEW Challenge cards from the ME-GA Expansion Set &lt;br/&gt;     Shuffle the NEW Chance cards in with your existing Chance cards &lt;br/&gt;     Get your GA-ME on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
