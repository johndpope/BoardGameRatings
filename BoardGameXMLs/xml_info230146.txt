			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obelisk is a cooperative, tower defense strategy game for 2 to 5 players. Defend the world from monsters appearing from a nearby portal. Change the path the monsters walk by rotating map tiles. Place towers (dice) and use them to capture monsters as they wander around the map. Use the captured monsters to buy powerful tower upgrades which allow you to capture bigger monsters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts by randomizing 25 tiles on a 5x5 grid to form the game map. Each of the tiles has different attributes which will make it easier or harder to attack monsters, depending on the tile. Players are given towers (dice) and starting resources. The monsters are the resources in this game which means as you capture more monsters, you can afford more tower upgrades. During the setup phase, the number of monsters that will spawn is chosen based on the number of players as well as a handicap value (more later). The rest of the game play consists of cycling between two phases, the build phase and the move &amp;amp; fight phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the build phase, players can perform one of three actions: place a tower on the map, rotate a map tile, or upgrade a tower. Towers can be placed in the corner of tiles and they will be able to attack monsters on the four adjacent tiles. Rotating board tiles causes the monsters to change the path that they move. Each tile is inscribed with an arrow that describes which direction monsters exit the tile. Upgrading a tower increases the strength by one, allowing the tower to defeat larger monsters. Multiple players can collaborate to upgrade one tower several times during the build phase. Players may act simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the move and fight phase, monsters on the board move and players can choose which towers they will activate and which monsters to target. Monsters vary in movement speed versus strength. Strong monsters are slow and weak monsters move fast. Towers can attack any time during the monster&amp;rsquo;s movement which allows towers to capture monsters &amp;ldquo;as they walk by&amp;rdquo;. The killed monsters are awarded to the towers owner as resources they can spend for later upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when all the monsters have been captured. Lose conditions include monsters walk off the map, monsters walk into a mountain, or monsters return to a tile they have already stepped on (walking in a loop). This prevents players from endlessly looping the monsters around in a circle while picking them off one by one. As you win or lose games, your handicap value adjusts the ratio of easy to hard monsters to give you a challenge every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The print and play version of the game features the interlocking tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
