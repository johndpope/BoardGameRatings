			<description>Dirigibles of Doom is a beer'n'pretzels type game that allows players to duel it out ... very slowly ... in the skies!  The game takes a little planning as both momentum and latency of response are key parts of the mechanic.  Too aggressive and a midair collision will wipe out you and your enemy.  Too conservative and you are a sitting duck.  Blimp.  Whatever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These book contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six pages of rules, resplendent with diagrams&lt;br/&gt;Seven scenarios for head to head, multiplayer, and tournament play&lt;br/&gt;Simple snip-n-flip models for blimps, &amp;uuml;berblimps, hot air baloons and a dragon ... aw, man, how did That get in there?&lt;br/&gt;Terrain flats, so you can have citites to destroy with your dirigibles&lt;br/&gt;Maneuver cards, formatted to print right out on a standard 10 business card sheet&lt;br/&gt;Suggestions for in-game onomatopoeia!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
