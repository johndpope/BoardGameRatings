			<description>&amp;ldquo;Shall I buy or sell? Am I a risk-taker or conservative investor?&amp;rdquo; What future earner will want to avoid investing in the stock market? Decisions is a money management game played in the context of the stock market. Players attempt to increase their wealth through strategic decision-making in buying and selling stocks. They rely, in part, on their sense of probability. The emphasis is on accurate computation and record-keeping. Players build communication skills as they explain the reasons for every move. The winner is the player with the highest net worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
