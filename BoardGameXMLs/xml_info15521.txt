							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boondoggle: The Game of Comic Elections</name>
									
			<description>Game consists of a railway track frame-like fixed together, 4 engraved hard plastic pawns, a large amount of vote cards and event cards.&lt;br/&gt;Players try to be the first to round the track throwing a dice.&lt;br/&gt;Up to 4 players try to achieve this goal, each one representing one fictitious party : Boondoggle, Soap Box, Pow Wow and High Hat.&lt;br/&gt;Before Game starts every player gets an amount of randomly distributed vote cards, depicting different values.&lt;br/&gt;With these cards an enemy party can be challenged landing on foreign territory. The involved parties choose an amount of vote cards they like belonging to their own party and turn them round simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;The one with the lesser sum shown on the cards has to draw his pawn back as many steps as is the difference in value.&lt;br/&gt;Spice is added by event cards, 4 different lots for each side of the track frame.&lt;br/&gt;There are places where your pawn is safe and where you can replenish your number of vote cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All game components are high quality, and all have comical drawings on it(hence the name of the game), which adds to the replay factor.&lt;br/&gt;No form of money involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
