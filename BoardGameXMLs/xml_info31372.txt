							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anzio: Drive to Rome (1944)</name>
									
			<description>Anzio &amp;ndash; Drive to Rome is a two player, World War Two regimental level simulation covering the first month of fighting in the Anzio bridgehead in Italy during January and February 1944. Under the auspices of Operation Shingle, Allied units from both the United States of America and Great Britain conducted a beach landing in the area surrounding Anzio in an attempt to seize the strategic Alban Hills and cut the supply to German troops fighting further south near Monte Cassino. Ultimately, the invading forces had the potential of capturing Rome, described by Churchill as &amp;ldquo;the keys to Europe&amp;rdquo;. Planning for the invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord, was well advanced and any success or failure at Anzio would surely lead to ramifications for the larger invasion planned for France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Anzio &amp;ndash; Drive to Rome, each player takes command of either the Allied of Axis forces, and each player moves his supplied pieces in an attempt to fulfill the victory conditions as set out further below. The game commences on 22nd January 1944 following the Allied invasion and finishes on 1st March 1944 unless the automatic victory conditions are fulfilled by either player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
