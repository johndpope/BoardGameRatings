			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;In the Old West of Pre-statehood America, towns are small and struggling. It only takes one fool with a head full of pride and their sins become a wound on the town&amp;rsquo;s purity, wounds which are soon infected with demons. The crops go bad, the heat turns everyone&amp;rsquo;s temper to fury, and soon the brothers and sisters of the Faith are turned against each other. Knowingly or not, people stray from the path into blasphemy, and then possession and sorcery soon follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But hope is not lost. God&amp;rsquo;s Watchdogs are called by the King of Life Himself, to speak with His authority. Your words are His Law. Your actions are His will. Your bullets are His judgement. And you will save the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s Watchdogs is a rules-lite variant of Dogs in the Vineyard by Lumpley Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is identical (but not presented in full here) and the set-up is much the same, however the conflict rules have been changed completely to make conflicts faster and easier while still retaining the impact these conflicts have on the story. This is following a couple of games with players who strongly favour rules-lite systems and don&amp;rsquo;t really care for the admittedly excellent tactical element of the original conflict rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
