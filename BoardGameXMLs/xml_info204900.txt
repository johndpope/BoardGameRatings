							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paddle Rally Cross-Country Race</name>
									
			<description>This Sixties race game from Whitman has a very unusual mechanism for determining how far a player can move. This is an 8&amp;quot; long blue plastic paddle, shaped like a rounded diamond with handle. A small red ball is attached to the end of the paddle by a 4&amp;quot; string. There are six holes in the paddle, five in an arc at the 4&amp;quot; limit of the string, and one in the center near the nose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player swings the paddle in an effort to get the ball through one of the holes. The easiest, in the center, is a move of 1. Values increase toward the edges, with 2 and 3 partway and 4 and 5 on the edges. The hole near the nose is worth two free turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the board box shows a map of the United States, the board itself is an abstract grid allowing orthogonal and diagonal moves. Black dots are obstacles that force a player to stop and then go around. Landing on a dot of your own color allows a free move in any direction. Landing on another player's color allows that player to move you one in a direction of his choice. First to cross the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
