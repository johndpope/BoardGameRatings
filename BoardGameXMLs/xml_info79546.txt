It features the minions from the 2007 Overlord video game in the game you play as gremlin creatures called the minions tasked with the mission to solve puzzles and fight enemies, controlled by the DS stylus. There are also items to found in the levels and a timer of how fast the player in finish. The minions can be controlled directly by the player, unlike the original game where the player controlled them by controlling an eponymous Overlord-character. Controlling the Special Farces team of four, players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only four minions from four types, which makes all of them specialized in skills, for example Giblet, a brown minion from the first Overlord game, is the strongest in melee combat, Blaze is a wild pyromaniac, which grants him the ability to sling fireballs, Stench is the most stealthy of the bunch, and Zap can swim/heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Overlord: Minions , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
