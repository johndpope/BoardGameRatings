			<description>Roman Mendez, a street criminal, suddenly wakes up in the gloomy isolation cell in which he has been shut for a few days.  The prisoner understands at once that something has gone wrong: strange noises break the usual jail silence.  Peeping through the cell slit leaves him facing a deserted corridor: no wardens, no other cries, just a blood smell.  But, the door lock releases and he won't think twice about getting out of the small isolation cell.  Some steps will be enough for Roman to understand that his breakout plans will not be easily carried out...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
