			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are atypically abstracted, being things such as beliefs, a mythos, or similar.  Character creation involves drawing iconography which is circulated around the table, gaining additions on the way.  The page of icons then returns to the initial player who abstracts traits from the images and assigns these traits to card suits.  The game is played as a series of wagers based on card hands drawn from individual packs of stripped French cards.  The principle goal of the game is for the player's character (e.g., iconography) to gain narrative ascendance among the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
