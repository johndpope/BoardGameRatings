			<description>User Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan set of miniatures rules are inspired on the Pod Racing from the movie Star Wars - The Phanton Menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules require some models of pod racers, some six side dice, deck of cards, tape measure and some scenery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn in the game has four phases which each player must complete before the next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn of racing the player can speed up and move his Pod in a straight line or turn it, but there is a chance he will Spin-Out his Pod or even stall its engine.  There are even rules on how to ram other Pods (just like the movie).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At anytime in the game each player can play a card which can benefit him or play on anther player (dirty tricks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who crosses the finish line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are free and avaliable from &amp;quot;The Armchair General&amp;quot; website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
