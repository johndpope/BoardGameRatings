			<description>Kingmakers is set in 1560 Europe. Five powers struggle for dominance through military power, cultural and scientific prestige, far distant explorations and diplomatic back-stabbing. England, France, Germania, Spain and the Ottoman empire are all equally strong and for the moment they maintain a power balance. However, anything may disrupt this delicate state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player you take the seat as chief advisor to the ruler of one of the five powers. You are the true power behind the throne. Use resources to grow the empire and make cultural progress. Send trusted emissaries and generals to other nations in order to gain influence via diplomatic trickery or military skills. Gather the best captains to explore the New world or the far east. Ally with the minor powers of Europe in order to influence them into aiding you against your enemies. Use the ruler as long as it fits your plans and find a new when they don't. Your next move will change the power balance in Europe. Make your move, but choose your actions carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In brief, the game is played on a large map of Europe. Players take turns using cards for their effect or for action points (AP). With APs they may perform different actions engaging leaders of their power. Each power have a certain number of leaders with different strengths available for use. These leaders may be used as ambassadors acting on your behalf in the courts of Europe, as explorers or colonizers bringing back knowledge and treasures from distant countries, as patrons of the arts or the scientists or as military generals conquering the lands of your enemies. The power who first conquer a defined amount of key spaces in Europe or collects most victory points (VP) after a number of turns wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 Game board&lt;br/&gt;     108 Strategy cards &lt;br/&gt;     36 Conflict cards&lt;br/&gt;     50 Character tokens &lt;br/&gt;     110 Influence discs &lt;br/&gt;     100 Victory point tokens&lt;br/&gt;     5 Players screens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
