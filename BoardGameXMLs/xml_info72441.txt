			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A versus dance rhythm/fighting game by Metro Corporation. Two players play against each other and must enter simple button commands on the screen, and the last button pressed must be according to the rhythm of the song playing. If the player succeeds, the character will improve his dance and the player is then presented with an harder combination of buttons to press before the next rhythm hit, and then an even harder one, up to a certain combo number, scoring higher each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also attack each other by pressing the attack button. If the other player notices, he can press the avoid button to avoid the attack; however, the dodging can cause trouble for the player anyway, as it slows the combo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name &amp;quot;Bust a move&amp;quot; was in US/EU changed to &amp;quot;Bust a groove&amp;quot; due to the fact that the puzzle game Puzzle Bobble had been renamed to &amp;quot;Bust a move&amp;quot; for the US/EU release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
