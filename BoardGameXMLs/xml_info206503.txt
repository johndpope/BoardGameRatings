			<description>War has come again to the gaming table. Your troops are spilling out of your dice bag. It is up to you to determine the best way to deploy and support them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware! Your battle plan never survives the first clash of troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to outmaneuver and conquer the other generals?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyhedron Conflict is a fast-paced card and dice game. It is a gateway game for two (2) to four (4) players ages eight (8) and up that is loosely based on the classic American card game, 'War.' The average game is about 15-30 minutes and can be taught in just a few minutes or during gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play from a hand of seven (7), placing one card facedown. Once all players are ready cards are revealed then they roll whatever dice their cards represent. Winner of the round is the highest score. The game winning conditions are determined before the game starts with either the person with the most cards or with the most points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
