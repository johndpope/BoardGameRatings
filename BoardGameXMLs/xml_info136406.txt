			<description>Vampire Season &amp;ndash; Monster Defense is a tower defense game where players have to defend count Dracula from the forces of good through various levels. There are many ways to dispatch Dracula&amp;rsquo;s attackers, beginning with an ample menagerie of monsters and items that will paint a grin on the evil side of your brain. Resources are scarce and each decision counts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 Story Mode levels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make it through all 30 (zirty) levels of hazardous fighting. Through forests, swamps, dungeons, labs and more, enemies will relentlessly try to reach Dracula&amp;rsquo;s coffin. Who is behind all that hate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survival Mode (Easy, Medium and Hard).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those seeking a challenge, this is where it gets real. An infinite amount of enemies will attempt to kill the count. Pick your favorite and strongest monsters, but don&amp;rsquo;t underestimate your luck, &amp;ldquo;The Horror Roulette&amp;rdquo; will make you use the best of your strategy skills. How long can you last?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: We are not responsible for device detonation against the wall. Specially on Hard mode. It&amp;rsquo;s just hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One does not simply ignore their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be fighting wizards that can freeze, princes that can charm, pirates that can plunder and even ninjas that can&amp;hellip; ninja. All of the enemies will make every decision you make Count. No pun intended (pun intended).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accessorizing for success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use in-game items to make your monsters more powerful. Give Excalibur to a Ghost not only to increase his damage, but also to make everyone&amp;rsquo;s argument invalid. Seriously. How can a Ghost wield a sword?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We can make your monster better, we have the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade monsters as you play. Do you like the Headless Horseman? Make him the envy of the battlefield. Think the Warlock should be the backbone of your army? Turn him into a magic wielding behemoth. Don&amp;rsquo;t know what a behemoth is? We can&amp;rsquo;t help you there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no I in combinations. There&amp;rsquo;s two Is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secret monster and item combinations await you. Like when you mix the Zombie and the Vampire to create a powerful Zampire. Ok, that one&amp;rsquo;s not secret anymore, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it less powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to cutting edge wizardry, you will be able to use different spells to boost your army for a short period, making their jobs easier. Show your monsters some love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
