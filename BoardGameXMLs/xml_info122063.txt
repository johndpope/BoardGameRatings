			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A run n'gun game in which the player leads a combat robot against an army of Cat Men. The concept was the winning entry in a game design contest organized by Crash Magazine. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Two hundred years ago the planet Earth was wrecked by Solar explosions. The lucky few who escaped have spent their time rebuilding the human population, and the offspring have returned to their homeland - only to find it plagued by the Cat Men!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M.T.-E.D. is put in the forward battle line to blast his way through a heavy array of mutant robots and destroy the central battle computer. He is alone except for a guiding force - you! Can you help him out-wit the Cat Men? Get your finger on the button for the first round!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
