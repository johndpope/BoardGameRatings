			<description>Two Games in One!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NINE MAN MORRIS&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;THE KING &amp;amp; THE KNIGHTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games of Skill &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mfg. by&lt;br/&gt;OLD TIME GAMES, INC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;KUBB - The Viking Game(tm)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- from the tube&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE KING &amp;amp; THE KNIGHTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This old Viking game, discovered in a Danish reenactment village, is played as a competition between two players.   The game consists of a King, three Knights, and the same playing field used in the game Nine Men's Morris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Knights attempt to corner the King, and the King attempts to avoid capture until landing on one of the points originally occupied by a Knight, or, in a variant, for a set number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NINE MAN MORRIS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has nine playing pieces. The first player to reduce their opponent to two pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first stage of the game players take turns placing their pieces on the board, attempting to make a line of three. Once all the pieces have been placed, players may slide them, still attempting to make a line of three. Whenever a player makes a line of three, they remove an opponent's piece of his choice. When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three. As soon as one player is left with only two pieces, his opponent wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
