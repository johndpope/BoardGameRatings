							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meepile: Box &amp; Bits</name>
									
			<description>A box you say? Yes, an official box for your Meepile!&lt;br/&gt;Since the first edition of Meepile did not come in a box, we decided to create one. Yes, we've created a nice little home for your beloved Meepile. Now your Meepile no longer needs to be dusted before play, and can rest snuggly on the shelf, between your other Simi Game Knights small box games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While we are at it, we might as well add some bits. Because you can never have too many bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and a few cards, because there was still a little room in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How about a new way to play? Because you can never have too many ways to play with your Meepile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bits - &lt;br/&gt;Each player has a collection of 6 interestingly shaped wooden bits to place on the Meepile. Each player also is given a deck of 6 cards that represents each of their 6 wooden bits. The cards are shuffled and on a player's turn one is revealed. The player then is required to place that piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual, all pieces knocked off of the Meepile are gathered into your stockpile, so if you turn over a card and you have more than one of the matching shaped bits, you may attempt to place all of them. Work your way through the 6 cards and then shuffle and start again, until someone has placed all of his/her stockpile and wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional way to use these bits and cards are included in the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
