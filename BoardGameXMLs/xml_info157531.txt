			<description>designer description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storyteller Cards are a deck of 54 playing cards designed by Jason Tagmire and illustrated by Campbell Whyte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card features an illustration with 4 unique elements. There is a character, holding an item, completing an action, in a location. Each of these elements can be used to create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a rank, suit, mood, season, letter, and color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are encouraged to create your own work with the cards, there is also a Storyteller Manual loaded with games from various designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
