			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in this rules-light game have four Core Abilities (Attributes): Drive, Agility, Brawn, and Mind.  These have a Score ranging from 1-3, assigned from a points pool at creation.  Characters also may select up to three Aspects (Traits) which are narrative tags or descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficult or opposed actions use a unique system for resolution.  An eight-point &amp;quot;compass card&amp;quot; is used, and the game master selects a point (which varies with each use).  The player then attempts to guess the point.  The player may select one point for each Score in their relative Core Ability.  Action difficulty yields a &amp;quot;spread&amp;quot; of points from which the guessed number may vary from the selected number and still yield success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is not well developed but in general has a action/adventure/swashbuckling feel to it.  The setting would not be usable in a campaign without significant development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
