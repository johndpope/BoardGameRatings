							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of Rebels</name>
									
			<description>Rise of Rebels is a 2 player territory control wargame. Players deploy units, research tech and battle for control cities in an effort to achieve their secret objectives. Each round players choose three action cards which constrains the actions they may take during the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has acquired the requisite number of Victory Points by claiming successfully completed objective cards they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the game is the Rise of Rebels: Legacy variant. The Legacy variant takes two players through a campaign that details the story of the rival factions represented in the game (the rival Rebel organizations) as they battle for control of the space station. This variant involves making permanent modifications to the game bard and faction components based on the outcome of each battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
