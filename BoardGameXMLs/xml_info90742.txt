							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rat and Cat</name>
									
			<description>A two player strategy game about a mutant rat and a cat inventor. As the rat you are trying to escape down your hole. As the cat your goal is to catch the rat. &lt;br/&gt;  The rat's super powers allow him to Dash down passageways at lighting speed and mentally shift physical objects. The cat however is the owner and operator of a force field generator and a transpacial warp generator.&lt;br/&gt;  The board is a grid made from 30 square tiles. The cat using his transpacial warp generator is able to jump across the map in one move and with his force field generator block any passageway. The rat, however, is able to move rows of passageways, enabling him to trap the cat and form a safe path to his hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
