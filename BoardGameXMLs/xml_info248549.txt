							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fury of the Final Blade</name>
									
			<description>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 7&amp;ndash;11.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liberty's Edge faction leader Colson Maldris was so certain that Andoran's elites were ruining the country that he took drastic action, allying with the Gray Gardeners in a plot to kidnap several of them and bring them to Galt. Though the Gardeners promised Maldris that they would grant these individuals a fair trial and carry out any executions without the use of their infamous soul-trapping Final Blades, their word was not to be trusted. Now all of Maldris's kidnapping victims are scheduled to face the guillotine. Maldris has sent a desperate plea for help to the Pathfinder Society, hoping for aid in freeing his victims from this terrible fate. However, Maldris's efforts to lay the groundwork for a rescue plot have seen him captured as an enemy of the revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only does it fall to the PCs to prevent an international incident, but the fate of this faction's leader also lies in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents in Fury of the Final Blade also contribute directly to the ongoing storyline of the Liberty's Edge faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
