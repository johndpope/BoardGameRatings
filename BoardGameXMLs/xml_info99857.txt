			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During World War II the Nazis conducted extensive research programs to aid in the war effort. The majority of these programs were scientific in nature, but a few delved into mystical and arcane knowledge. A select few of these programs were a combination of both, such as the Fenris Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Named after the great wolf of Norse mythology, the Fenris Project was based on blood and tissue samples collected from an actual lycanthrope captured by the Waffen SS in occupied Romania. Through their research, the Nazi scientists hoped to develop an injection that would turn their soldiers into the superhuman berserkers of Teutonic folklore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, the early attempts were partially successful. The injected serum greatly enhanced the strength and ferocity of the test subjects. However, the project was of limited practical value, since the recipients often attacked their friends or each other. Furthermore, the subjects suffered horrible physical transformations that resulted in an excruciatingly painful death within a matter of hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
