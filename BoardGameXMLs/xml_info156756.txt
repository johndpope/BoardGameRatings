			<description>In the quick and ruthless game Office Life, you play as a randomly generated office worker, competing for the interest of a likewise randomly generated boss. Each player has three attributes, and depending on the attitude of the boss, each attribute could help you a little or a lot &amp;mdash; or could even hurt you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During gameplay, you play cards to improve your standing or hurt other players in a &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot;-style game. This game condenses years of underhanded office politics into just minutes of gameplay. Back stab, lie, cheat, and steal your way to the top, baby!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
