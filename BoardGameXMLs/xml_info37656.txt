							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Anger Control Game</name>
									
			<description>Game as psychological therapy tool for &amp;quot;teaching cognitive skills necessary for effective anger control&amp;quot;. Participants roll-and-move around the board, occasionally stopping to respond to hypothetical situations in six categories of &amp;quot;cognitive-behavioral deficits&amp;quot;. Chips are awarded for giving a good response to the card. Winner of the game is the player with the most chips at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game must be guided by a counselor or therapist. This authority-as-game-master not only chooses from which card category players must respond to, but also acts as sole judge in determining whether a participant's answer is good enough to warrant an award of victory chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
