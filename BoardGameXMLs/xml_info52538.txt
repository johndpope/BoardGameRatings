			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orion Foundation knows the Web was up to something. The question was what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Foundation can't very well ask the Soviets, who have a submarine that isn't supposed to exist undergoing a refit that wasn't supposed to happen. And Orion can't get much out of a mysterious top KGB agent assigned to the case, seeing as he was propped up in the back of a Polish tavern, wearing that glassy-eyed expression that comes from taking one too many shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only option is to send a group of agents to the Gdansk, Poland, shipyards. And if they can foil tight security at the dry dock and sneak aboard the Soviet submarine, and if they can learn the identity of the traitorous Web agent aboard and prevent him from implementing his nefarious scheme, then maybe, just maybe, they can figure out a way to bring a deadly Web secret to the surface from the murky gloom of a crippled attack sub on the ocean floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
