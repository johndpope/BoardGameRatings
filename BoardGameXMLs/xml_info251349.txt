			<description>Kickstarter Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a quest.  An extremely dangerous quest. Dr Henry Armitage, Chief Librarian, needs you to search the perilous Restricted Collection for fragments of lore from among the grimoires, and recover pieces of a particular sigil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five rounds in the game. Each round continues until no-one is left in the library, having left &amp;quot;voluntarily&amp;quot; or having been expelled. Basic play consists of taking turns to select a Library Card and placing these cards face up on your player mats. There are three types of Library Cards. Sigil Pieces, Grimoire Fragments, and Graduate Students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sigil Piece Cards - three pieces make a set and earn a lore card. Picking up a duplicate leads to expulsion unless you can use your defenses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grimoire Fragment Cards - three pieces make a set and earn a lore card. Picking up a duplicate leads to expulsion unless you can use your defenses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate Student Cards - Collecting four means you can re-use one of your defense cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a chance to win Black or Red sanity cards which increases your score. The game ends when the final fifth round is played. You then add up all the score cards they have received and the one with the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
