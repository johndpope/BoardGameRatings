			<description>Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 (abbreviated as PES 2009) is a football video game in the Pro Evolution Soccer series by Konami. It is also the exclusive licenced game of the UEFA Champions League. Gameplay has been changed for Pro Evolution Soccer 2009, with key additions to the Teamvision system, tactics change according to situation, off-the-ball fluency AI recognizing strategies that works accumulating data on an ongoing basis within Master League and League modes. Another new addition is the readjustments for ball movements. PES 2009 has new air resistance calculations for the trajectory of the ball. There are also new friction routines to affect ball movement in terms of ground conditions, backspin routines are calculated so that ball slows accordingly, and the bounce of the ball can be used more effectively: players can flick the ball up to tee a shot, or to lift it over a defender's trailing leg. If a player has the ability, they will be able to perform skillful turns. PES 2009 also features a new game mode called 'Become A Legend', much like 'Be a Pro' from the EA Sports FIFA Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Pes 2009 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
