			<description>A robbers card game for 2 to 6 players. The title translates to Prowl in English.  After a robbery you and the other robbers try and get the most loot from the haul. There are master thieves, pickpockets and thieves cards and 1-8 numbered value cards in a deck of 112 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses matching of cards to raid your opponents loot and has an element of role selection as you can use cards to choose to raid another player or the discard pile. The mechanism involves using your cards matching them and plundering points from other players. For example the master thief card allows you to steal a pile of loot from another player, the pickpocket allows you to get a card from an opponents hand. The game ends when the draw pile is empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
