							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clubhouse Golf Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Clubhouse Golf Dice Game loosely simulates a round of golf through the same scoring system - the lower the number of strokes, the better your score. The game comes with 5 dice: A white Tee die, a light green Fairway (F) die, a blue Water (W) die, a yellow Sand (S) die and a dark green putting (G for Green) die. Except for the putting die, the dice have letters on them indicating the next die to be cast. The putting die has numbers on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hole, a player starts by rolling the Tee die (the first stroke). Subsequently, the player rolls the next die indicated by the previous die, adding one stroke to their score for each die rolled. However, when the Water die is rolled, the player adds 2 strokes instead. When the Green (G) is rolled, the player rolls the putting die and adds the number rolled to his/her score - the hole then ends for that player and his/her score is the number of strokes played. Players can play 18 holes for a full round of golf. The lowest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easier to get a hole-in-one in this game than in real golf - roll 'G' on the Tee die, followed by a roll of '0' on the putting die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
