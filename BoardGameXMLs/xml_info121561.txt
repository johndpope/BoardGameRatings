							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shaman King: Funbari Spirits</name>
									
			<description>Shaman King: Funbari Spirits, is a cel-shaded 2D style fighting game released in Japan only.  It is not to be confused with Shaman King: Power of Spirit, a game produced by Konami to go along with the 4kids Entertainment dub. This is a pseudo-sequel to Shaman King: Spirit of Shamans, a 2D fighting game for the PlayStation. Interestingly, this game is based upon the Manga and is the very last Shaman King game to be released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funbari Spirits features simple controls and plays quite like a 2D fighter despite being 3D. There is a 2 player mode, adventure story mode, mini game mode, and a free play mode along with training mode. The game also has voices from the original anime, as well as colorful cel-shaded graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the main characters are present as playable characters, along with a few exclusive-to-this-game-only characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shaman King: Funbari Spirits&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.bandaigames.channel.or.jp/list/shamanking_hun/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.bandaigames.channel.or.jp/list/shamanking_hun/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
