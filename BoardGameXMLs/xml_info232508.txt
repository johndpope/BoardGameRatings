			<description>From the introduction to the adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first chapter of a ten-part campaign for Advanced Fighting Fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is set in the north-east of Khul, the dark continent, and begins in the city of Arion. &lt;br/&gt;As with many gamebooks, it skips the recruitment phase of the adventure and goes straight to the part where the mission is explained to the Heroes. Players unused to this style of introduction may bridle at the suggestion that they take a mission they didn&amp;rsquo;t agree to, but hopefully they will just accept it and jump straight in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is designed for a party of 4-6 new Heroes. It should not be a problem if the Heroes have an advance or two. If there are less Heroes than this, hirelings or followers could be used to make up the numbers, as some of the challenges may be tough with three or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important that there is at least one spellcaster, whether Wizard or Sorcerer, in order to proceed past certain parts of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
