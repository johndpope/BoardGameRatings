			<description>Clean Up Your Room! is a family friendly card game with a simple goal: score the most points while trying to get all of the objects off your room floor. On each player's turn, she can put an object, such as power tools or a pink fairy armadillo, one of her pieces of furniture. She might also steal an object from a sibling's room floor. Or, she might throw something from her room into another room. Players can also use event cards to mix things up, but sometimes they have unexpected consequences like making animals run from room to room! When one player's room floor is clear of objects, the game ends. All players count up points for objects put away plus any bonus points and subtract one point for any objects left on their room floors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
