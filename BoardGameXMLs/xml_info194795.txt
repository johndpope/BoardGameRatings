			<description>In Glass Road, players will strive to produce glass and bricks over 4 building periods, each of which consist of three card-playing rounds. Glass and bricks are considered the major resources in the game, but players will also need to generate other materials in order to construct buildings (wood, clay, etc.). A deck of Specialist cards is used by each player to accomplish varying tasks related to the building process. There is a wide variety of buildings that can be built, each with its own abilities and/or scoring opportunities, and the player that best manages his resources, in order to build the most valuable buildings, will be the winner at the game&amp;rsquo;s end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
