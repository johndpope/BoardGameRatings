			<description>A word card game with a mild political theme.  The deck has 52 letter cards, and 2 jokers which can stand for periods or  apostrophes in contractions or abbreviations.  (There is an elephant on the back of each card, and a donkey on the front of the jokers.)  An extra deck is recommended if more than 3 play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt 10 cards, and the top of the draw is turned over to start the discard pile.  In a turn a player draw one from either pile and discards one.  If they think they have a winning hand they &amp;quot;call a vote&amp;quot;, and everyone lays down their hands to score.  The player with the highest-scoring hand adds its points, plus a 10-point bonus, to their total.  Play to 150 points for the win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One or more words can be formed from the hand when scoring, but the points favor longer words.  Each word scores the &amp;quot;triangle number&amp;quot; of the number of letters it contains: &lt;br/&gt;1 - 1&lt;br/&gt;2 - 3&lt;br/&gt;3 - 6&lt;br/&gt;4 - 10&lt;br/&gt;5 - 15&lt;br/&gt;6 - 21&lt;br/&gt;7 - 28&lt;br/&gt;8 - 36&lt;br/&gt;9 - 45&lt;br/&gt;10 - 55&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several possible bonuses: a player who can use all his hand to spell words may &amp;quot;vote his hand&amp;quot; (similar to going Gin), automatically winning the hand and getting a 20-point bonus.  Spelling certain Reward Words:&lt;br/&gt;  WORK, THRIFT, PROFIT, YOU, WIN&lt;br/&gt;earns double its point count.  Spelling certain 10-letter Winning Words:&lt;br/&gt;  REPUBLICAN, PATRIOTISM, CAPITALISM, PRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;earns 150 points and wins the game outright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
