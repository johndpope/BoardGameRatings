							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from Ga-&#039;Tyr</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You thought the sleepy seaside village of Haro's Port was the safest in Ilesia, but the shockingly violent sack of the town by pirates shortly after your arrival proved you completely wrong. The evil band, under the command of the inexperienced but brilliant rogue Kasatar, a former Ilesian lieutenant, was cruel and virtually unstoppable. You were bound, blindfolded and beaten until sleeping potion could be forced down your throat. That is the last thing you remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability: 1st level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
