			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantastic maps for modern gamers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're setting the scene for your players: a busy modern city street, crowded with buildings of every kind, traffic on the road, people bustling past, the smell of exhaust fumes and fast food... &amp;quot;This is all very well&amp;quot;, say the players, &amp;quot;But what's the actual geography of the street? If we're going to break into that bank, we need to know the layout!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You reach for your map, and lay before them an eagle's-eye view of the street, decorated with a multitude of perfectly crafted symbols, showing vehicles, food stalls, statues, trees, even the fire hydrants! Suddenly everything is crystal clear to the players, except for one thing: &amp;quot;Look at the detail! Where did you get all these fantastic symbols?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Symbol Set 3, this can be your gaming experience. Stun your players with the lush detail and vivid realism that only comes from a set of over 2000 lovingly crafted modern overland and floorplan symbols for Campaign Cartographer 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol Set 3 also includes more than 50 new bitmap textures, more than 100 new drawing tools, and six unique drawing styles in imperial and metric dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your modern worlds to life with Symbol Set 3: Modern Symbols&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
