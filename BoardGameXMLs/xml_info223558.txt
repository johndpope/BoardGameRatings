			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You huddle into your long coat, sum up the resolve, and step out into the mire. The cold air is heavy with tar, salt, and sin, and you already miss your warm four-poster bed. The mail boat between Vladivostok and Shanghai is rusted and weather-beaten between lashed fishing boats. Your steps leave messy footprints in the gray mud, and then the gangway creaks under your weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crappy summer morning, 1951. A postal vessel departing from Vladivostok bound for Shanghai, five-day journey. Aboard are thirteen passengers; twelve adults and a child. The silent Russian crew is kept on a short leash by Captain Henderson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as a PDF document created from an HTML archive during 2006.  The scenario was presented during 1998 at Mystifisticon II and Hong Con.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
