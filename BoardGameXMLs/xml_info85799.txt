							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quantum Legions: Vanguard</name>
									
			<description>The publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Legions&amp;trade; is a game of science fiction ground combat &amp;mdash; or more specifically, a series of games simulating battalion-level conflict within the universe of the Thirteen Provinces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative command and combat mechanics allow players to quickly and easily fight out any number of battles of varying sizes, keeping the focus on tactics rather than rules. Though designed as a &amp;quot;hex-n-counter&amp;quot; board game, Quantum Legions can easily be adapted as a miniatures wargame. Details on how this can be accomplished are provided in the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, like most Majestic Twelve products, Quantum Legions includes rules for creating your own units so you can add to its exciting background, simulate your favorite movies and television shows, or create your very own universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Legions: Wargaming on an Epic Scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Details:&lt;br/&gt;Units are represented by counters with basic information (movement, range, attack dice, etc.) Players roll 2d6 for the number of command points available at the beginning of the turn. Command points are used to remove suppression markers, activate ordered units and place orders on units to activate on future turns. Combat is bucket of dice with the target number depending on the attack order and number of dice modified by the target's terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes five 11&amp;quot;x17&amp;quot; map sections. Two map sections are used in the basic scenario. Also included are 1&amp;quot; unit counters and 5/8&amp;quot; order and suppression markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
