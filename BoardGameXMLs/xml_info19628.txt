			<description>Described on the box as &amp;lsquo;a gripping new dice game&amp;rsquo; this is Waddington&amp;rsquo;s take on Yahtzee.  The object of the game is to secure the highest score with eleven turns of rolling five dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first try for six combinations (straight, full, high, etc.).  If they fail to score a combination they will add up the matching numbers and enter the most advantageous of them in the left hand numbers column on one of the scorecards.  Players may re-roll the dice three times on their turn.  On each throw the dice needed are put aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinations are only scored once each.  If you fail to get a combination but have already filled in the number boxes then a zero must be entered in one of the score boxes.  The &amp;lsquo;Click&amp;rsquo; of the title is a combination of all five numbers the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
