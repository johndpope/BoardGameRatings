			<description>The blockchain (also known as &amp;quot;the trust protocol&amp;quot;) is a technology that aims at decentralization as a security measure. It is &amp;quot;an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and verifiably and permanently&amp;quot;. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In BlockChain: The Dice Game, players will use cards to represent fundamental processes for calculating and validating a BlockChain block. Cards, for example, allow you to move dice from the stack (main dice queue) to its board; or increment or decrement one of the dice you are using. Each block has a value to be validated, where subsequent blocks have values â€‹related to the previous blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some situations, players will use the cards to participate in the validation of a block made by another player. To do this, they needed to spend part of their tokens (representing the cost of processing that data) and became part of the validation pool of that block. One of the most common examples is the use of the PUSH card, where the player can &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; his dice to the board of another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each block validated, players are given tokens for validating the block or for having helped validate it. At the end of the fourth block validation, the player with the most tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
