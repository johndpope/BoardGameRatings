							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Weapons and Warriors: Castle Siege Game</name>
									
			<description>This simple action game in the spirit of the Weapons and Warriors series has 2 castles (wall with drawbridge, 2 towers &amp;amp; keep) over which two players or teams (Red Army and Blue Army) fight.  Also included are 4 Defense Shields, Combat Cannons, Power Catapults, 2 Crossbows, Battle Balls, and 2 Card Battlefields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Siege has quite a few more units overall than former games in the Weapons and Warriors series, adding new types including archers, knights, and battle tents while featuring 1 shield (instead of 4).  The winning criteria in Siege is that all the knights/archers must be hit in addition to the General and the regular army units for a player to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
