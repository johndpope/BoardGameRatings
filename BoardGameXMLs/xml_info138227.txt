			<description>MOVE 'N FLIP is a 2 player Strategy game played on a 8x8 Chess Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 12 pieces which are double sided &amp;ndash; with different directions of movement on each side. At the end of each move the piece is &amp;lsquo;flipped&amp;rsquo; to the other side giving different directions for the next move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is similar to DRAUGHTS/CHECKERS i.e. either a single move or a jumping move over one or more of your own AND/OR your opponents&amp;rsquo; pieces. Any opponents pieces jumped over are captured and removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sole survivor is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
