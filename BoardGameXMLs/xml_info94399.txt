							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adrift (2011)</name>
									
			<description>Adrift is a sci-fi game that (in theory) requires no vision at all to learn and to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your spacecraft has just been destroyed. Perhaps you were attacked. Perhaps something malfunctioned. Perhaps a rogue bit of space debris struck a vital component. Either way, it all went wrong, and all that remains of your mission is this escape pod and the crew members who managed to climb aboard. In the chaos, even your pod took some damage. Lighting has been shut down to save power for more necessary systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and a handful of survivors, huddled in the dark, trying to make your way home through the most dangerous patch of space in this sector. Can you work together to make it home safely? Or will you spend the rest of eternity floating aimlessly in space, adrift?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adrift is a prepless, GMless RPG that can be played in two hours or less and exists in an audio/tactile format, meaning the rules and materials are audio files, and the randomizers rely on the sense of touch. It is meant to be played in as dark a room as possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
