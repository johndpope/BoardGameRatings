			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 32 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Medieval Plantation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;May the harvest be good this year M&amp;rsquo;lord and you get what you deserve.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Medieval Serf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Plantation is an exterior map of a medieval farmer&amp;rsquo;s enclosed croft including the exterior personal garden, interior barn, grain house, and farmer&amp;rsquo;s house with an outer field organized into furlongs with crops that belong to the manorial lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Plantation is intended for use in fantasy games and medieval historical settings. It can also be used in modern settings where the medieval open field agricultural system is still in place (this is a rare occurrence in the modern world as most farmland now uses an enclosed and fenced in system rather than an open field communal one, but still possible in some societies such as some small communities in Europe). Medieval Plantation also has the isolation necessary for a horror atmosphere as well (a cabin in the field instead of cabin in the woods scenario).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serf in Life, Serf in Death:  When a poor serf met a manure seller in dark gray clothes covered in manure, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t refuse the dirt cheap produce price for the manure. He used the manure to fertilize his personal garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is when everything went wrong. His garden never fertilized properly leaving him with crops that were not yielding fruits and vegetables. He was forced to take crops from his Baron&amp;rsquo;s fertile fields to feed his family and this left his wagon short for taxation by the Baron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His Baron was angry and sent a tax collector protected by knights and their squires to collect the additional crops owed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the knights arrive they find the family in poor physical condition. They are gaunt and haggard looking like they are both starving to death and their eyes have such bags that they appear to have not slept in weeks. They claim to be tormented at night by the sounds of the restless dead. Their personal crops were ruined so they were forced to take food from the lord&amp;rsquo;s crops to survive the winter. They plead with the knights to stay until dark and witness the truth of their situation&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
