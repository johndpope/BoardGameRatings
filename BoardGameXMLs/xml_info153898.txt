			<description>Glyph is a card game system designed to be able to play an enormous variety of games and take up a small amount of space. The deck of 98 cards can be whittled down to a standard 52-card deck to play all the classics, though it contains 6 full standard suits and plenty more, including story suits for storytelling games (with images), 3 colored suits, and 6 minor elemental suits that have no problem sharing their cards with other elemental suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are orientation-dependent, so the properties they take on will differ depending on whether they are played right-side-up or upside-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to playing some of your favorite card games, you can use the deck to create new games. The different types of suits can be played separately or mixed and matched for tons of unique gameplay possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the ways the cards can be organized are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Six suits (HEARTS, CROSSES, CLOVERS, TOADSTOOLS, DIAMONDS, and HORNS) numbered 0-14. Aces, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are further marked for use in a standard deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Three suits (RED, BLUE, and GREEN) numbered 0-29.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Two full sets of six suits (EARTH, FIRE, WATER, AIR, MAGIC, and ALCHEMY), numbered 2-9 plus the additional classes ACE, APPRENTICE, MAGICIAN, and WIZARD. These suits come 1, 2, or 3 to a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Five story suits (WILD, ITEM, EVENT, CHARACTER, and LOCATION). Each card in the deck has a different image that can be used in creative and storytelling games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck also contains 8 wild cards that can be organized by color (making 4 groups of 2) or by layout (making 2 groups of 4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
