			<description>Sabotage - &amp;quot;A Pocket War Game for two players&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sabotage is a game of securing weaponry and attacking strategic buildings, railways, bridges, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: There is a small board (lined with felt on the bottom - a nice touch), 3 pawns of a distinct color for each player, red chips, blue chips, 2D6 and a deck of target cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of 3 columns of 8 spaces each. Each column has a blank space on either end (starting spaces), one blue space with a picture of a grenade, one red space with a picture of a bomb, and 4 spaces with a picture of a different target (there are 6 different targets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You move up and down the columns according to dice rolls (each pawn staying in its column) trying to collect weapons. When two of your tokens land on matching weapon spaces, you collect a weapon - take a blue chip for a grenade and a red chip for a bomb. You collect two weapons (chips) of the appropriate color if you end your movement with all three pawns on spaces picturing the same weapon. If you land on your opponent, send them back to their start space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before rolling the dice on your turn, you can turn up a target card. Up to two target cards may be face up at one time. Each card shows a picture of a target and the 'cost' in weapons to successfully attack it. If you don't have the the weapons to successfully attack it, you lose all your weapons. If you 'Double land' (as described to collect weapons) on a target that is face-up, you attack it. You 'pay' the proper weapons to collect the target card. If you turn up a 'sabotage' card, you lose all of your weapons. First to collect 6 target cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
