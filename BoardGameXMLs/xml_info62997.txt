							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gemini Conspiracy</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BASH-ers! BASH-ers!&amp;quot; The cry rises 'round the coliseum as the Dort team rumbles down the field. Fur and fists fly. The ball floats upward on a mindwave, and the bearish players turn in fierce pursuit. But the ball is lost; in its place looms an enormous, unmarked spacecraft, blocking the sun.  The vessel descends slowly upon the field, like a buzzard settling on an egg.  Armored thugs pour from the ship's belly. Laser beams flash. Batons strike. In moments, the ship is gone. And so are 150 spectators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrorists? Perhaps. Only the Empire knows for sure. A plan for slaughter is brewing in the Region--a scheme of treachery, leading only to war: the Gemini Conspiracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GEMINI CONSPIRACY is a high-action adventure for the STAR ACE(tm) game, packed with enough space combat, sizzle, and surprise to challenge any mid-level Star Team rebel. Inside, you'll find an exciting adventure with these important bonuses:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 7 new spacecraft designs.&lt;br/&gt;- 140 paper spacecraft counters, which you can mount on poster board and use in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find new equipment, character cards, maps, player aids, and hours of role-playing fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
