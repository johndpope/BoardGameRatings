							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gambling &amp; Hookers</name>
									
			<description>Gambling and Hookers sees 2-4 players competing to have the wildest night out. Think the night before The Hangover, or one of Barney&amp;rsquo;s legendary nights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are vying to be the first to buy a set number of vices - vices like alcohol, gambling, drugs and hookers. But each vice bought leaves you open to different downers. Buy a hooker, for example, and risk other players hitting you with a pimp card, or an S.T.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s a take-that style card game, but one where you control which attacks you are vulnerable to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
