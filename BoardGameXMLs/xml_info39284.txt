			<description>The Hand That Feeds, The Hand That Beats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gods want power&lt;br/&gt;... they'll do whatever it takes to get it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world of faith, or better: a world of faiths, different followers worship different Gods.&lt;br/&gt;The more faith and followers, the stronger a God is.&lt;br/&gt;So they play their game of power and strength and sometimes just use the followers as playing pieces...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Hand that FEEDS, the Hand that BEATS, players represent a God and His followers. The priest of your faith&lt;br/&gt;may call a creature that scoops up the whole village and moves them around the board. The followers can then be used&lt;br/&gt;to acquire resources with which they build obilisks or the temple or a part of  one of the Gods' wonders: The Great Canal, The pyramid or the Mighty Colossus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three conditions trigger the game end:&lt;br/&gt;1] If all three of the Gods' wonders are finished at the end of a round, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;2] If the creature-deck runs  out, the round is played to the end, after which the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;3] After ten rounds, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try  to score the most victory points (VPs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If they build or convert obelisks or the temple they immediately score VPs.&lt;br/&gt;     If they build parts of the Gods' wonders, they can score VPs every round.&lt;br/&gt;     If they control the obelisk in the oasis, they score VPs if other players use the oasis.&lt;br/&gt;     Some of the actions, miracles and disasters will earn a player VPs.&lt;br/&gt;     Lastly, and most importantly, the most popular faith will be elected to feed all the players and receives VPs equal to the popularity of the faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
