							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloody Hell: Operations Goodwood and Spring</name>
									
			<description>When I came to the northern edge of the village (Cagny), I saw to my dismay about 25 or 30 British tanks which had already passed southward over the main road to Caen which ran from east to west.  The whole area was dotted with British tanks which were slowly rolling south against no opposition. How could I plug the gap?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Colonel Hans von Luck, 21st Panzer Division on July 18th when Operation Goodwood began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historians have described the British attack near Caen and the Canadian assault against Verrieres Ridge as disasters.  Indeed, following these operations the Germans were able to transfer to the western sector of Normandy much of their surviving armor to deal with the American offensive. Nonetheless, recently discovered material and some oral histories have shown the Allied offensives came close to success. Can you do as well, or better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloody Hell is designed as a &amp;quot;two-games-in-one&amp;quot; package allowing the players to play either of General Montgomery's operations (securing Caen and then breaking out to support Patton's Operation Cobra). Players can also combine both games into a grand-tactical simulation pitting Montgomery against General Sepp Dietrich and the 1st SS Panzer Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Bloody Hell is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four &amp;ldquo;11&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;17&amp;rdquo; map sections&lt;br/&gt;     300 double-sided, unmounted counters&lt;br/&gt;     Two sheets of game tables and charts&lt;br/&gt;     One set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
