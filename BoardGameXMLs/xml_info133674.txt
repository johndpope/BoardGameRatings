			<description>Players take on the role of rival hackers of the early 1980's trying to decipher each others secret rule they used to encrypt an important piece of code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S E T U P&lt;br/&gt;Deal each player 8 cards.  The remaining cards form a draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;Think of a secret rule using the colors, shapes, and numbers on the cards that you can begin with 2 cards from your hand&lt;br/&gt;Example rules:&lt;br/&gt;    even, odd, even, odd numbers&lt;br/&gt;    only triangles&lt;br/&gt;    only green and  numbers increasing by 2    &lt;br/&gt;Write the secret rule on a sheet of paper and keep it hidden from your opponents&lt;br/&gt;Place the 2 cards that start your pattern in order, face up in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G A M E P L A Y&lt;br/&gt;Player to the left of the dealer begins &lt;br/&gt;Play a card, face up, from your hand as the next card in one of your opponents patterns&lt;br/&gt;If the card is played correctly, your opponent says &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and leaves the card as part of the pattern&lt;br/&gt;If the card is played incorrectly, your opponent says  &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; and pulls the card towards them in that space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;Discard a card from your hand that you believe will not be the next card on any of your opponents patterns&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the player to your left, a player can pick up the discard and place it on their pattern, if it works.&lt;br/&gt;The card is pushed forward in its space to show this card was picked up from being discarded, but is correct&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;Play a key generator card from your hand in front of one opponent&lt;br/&gt;The opponent draws one card &lt;br/&gt;Then, ask that opponent to play  a card from their hand onto their own pattern&lt;br/&gt;If the opponent doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a card that will play as the next card in their pattern, they must discard a card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S C O R I N G&lt;br/&gt;When all  8 cards have been played from each players hand, players total the point value of the cards that are placed on their own pattern.  After 3 hands, Highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2 cards played to begin the pattern are worth 2 points&lt;br/&gt;Cards that were played correctly are worth 1 point&lt;br/&gt;Cards that were played incorrectly (pulled back) and cards that were picked up from the discard pile (pushed forward) are each worth 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;If a player has less than 3 cards played on his pattern (including key generaor cards), they receive 10 bonus points for the round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
