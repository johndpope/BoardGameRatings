							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Discipleship Plus Junior</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be the first person to give away your cards by matching the same color or shape on the discard pile.  Get a Judas card and skip a turn.  Get a Devil card and you have to draw another card.  Get the Jesus card to help you or someone else win.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discipleship Junior is a game similar to Uno or Crazy Eights, with a few differences. Each player's cards are kept face-down and are unknown to all players including the owner.  They are turned face-up one per turn, and can be discarded if they match the top of the discard pile. Judas cards cause the drawing player to lose his turn. Devil cards &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; a disciple card, and must be &amp;quot;cast out&amp;quot; by a card matching the trapped disciple. The Jesus card allows each player to discard all face-up cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
