			<description>The players have to move their four tokens from their red starting spaces to the starting spaces on the opposite side on the game board. Movement is one knight's move (as in Chess) per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If only 2 players are playing, only the part of the game board inside the red borders is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If 3 or 4 players are playing, 2 token of each player have to pass the right side of the game board center, while the other 2 pass on the left side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has the opportunity to beat an opponent token by landing on the same space, he has to do so. The beaten token is returned to it's starting space and has to begin anew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
