			<description>Players are secret agents who try to be the one who defeats the evil guys located on an island in the center of the board. To do this they've to arrive there with a certain (secret) combination of microfilms (every player starts with 10 microfilms in his own color - different colors can be acquired by fighting other players). Agents travel around the board rolling a die and using transportation cards to acquire equipment cards and transportation cards to fight other players. Fights are resolved by secretly choosing up to two equipment cards - better equipment (total number) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
