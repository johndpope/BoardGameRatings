							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kangaroo</name>
									
			<description>Kangaroo (カンガルー) is an arcade game that was released in 1982. It was manufactured by Sun Electronics but distributed by Atari. The game bears a strong resemblance in terms of gameplay and plot to Donkey Kong as well as the Popeye video game. The player takes the role of a mother kangaroo  who is trying to rescue her son. She must climb through treetops, while disabling pink monkeys that attack the kangaroo with apples. Points are scored for defeating enemies, eating the fruit scattered through the levels, as well as for punching out hostile monkeys (or by punching either whole apples that are thrown at the kangaroo, or apple cores, which are dropped dropped on her from above). Additionally, a bonus score is awarded for each level completed, with the size of the bonus determined by how quickly the level is solved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Kangaroo (video game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
