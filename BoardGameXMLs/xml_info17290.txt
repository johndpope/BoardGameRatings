			<description>A Bible trivia game a bit different from the usual Trivial Pursuit style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six questions to each answer, in decreasing difficulty (6 being the most difficult).  In this game, players progress along a game track.  Movement forward (or backward for incorrect answers) is determined by the level of difficulty you are attempting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several types of square, which determine who may answer the question.  A solo square means only the person whose marker is on the square may answer.  A Free-For-All square means all players have the opportunity to answer.  A Proxy square means the active player chooses another player to answer for them; the active player advances on the correct answer, but the proxy goes back if they answer incorrectly.  A Blitz square allows everyone to answer as the active player reads the clues from most difficult to easiest.  As soon as someone answers correctly, they and the active player move ahead the number of squares matching the level of clue that was the question was answered on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each players turn finishes after one move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also Providence cards, which usually result in either going forward or back a number of squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to reach the finish square wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
