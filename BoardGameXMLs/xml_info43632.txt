			<description>Published in Tortured Souls! (Issue 6 - Dec 1984), &amp;quot;ZOOT&amp;quot; is a fantasy board game for 3 players each taking the part of a team of 6 contestants (Dwarves, Orcs, Elves) striving to gain ultimate victory in &amp;quot;The Arena of the Golden Sphere&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The victory conditions are simple - in order to win one team member must exit the arena by the door appropriate to their team, and must have the golden sphere on their person. The Golden Sphere (usually refered to as &amp;quot;The Ball&amp;quot;) is an artifact of immense power that the gods have seen fit to provide a pair of fingle holes and a thumb hole to assist mere mortals in  the manipulation of the artefact, so that it may be used as a missle or melee weapon and thrown or passed or to another team member. To further complicate things the arena contains a series of Warp Holes that whisk the Ball or a contestant to another part of the arena, and a set of Power Portals, where contestant can gain spells to assist them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
