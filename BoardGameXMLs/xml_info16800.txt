			<description>Gawp is a card game for ages 7 and upwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a set of 86 playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 of the cards are laid out on the table (face up) in a 5 by 3 grid. Players look at the grid and try and spot &amp;quot;pairs&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card consists of a pattern of rectangles of different sizes laid on top of each other giving the effect of an outer, middle and inner rectangle. Each rectangle can be one of three colors red, blue or yellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; ALL the rectangles on one card must beat the equivalent rectangles on its &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot;. There is a combat rule to show what beats what: RED beats YELLOW; YELLOW beats BLUE: and BLUE beats RED. This sounds confusing but there is a combat help card as a reference, very soon this will not be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever someone spots a &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; he shouts &amp;quot;Gawp&amp;quot; and takes the pair from the grid. These are then replaced by 2 more cards, from the pack, by the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over once all the cards are laid in the grid, and all the &amp;quot;pairs&amp;quot; are found. The player with the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for several variations of the basic game: Sudden Death Gawp; Gawp Solitaire 1 &amp;amp; 2, and Advanced Gawp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
