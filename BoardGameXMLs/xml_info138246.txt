							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CarTag Scavenger Hunt</name>
									
			<description>Designed to be played by up to four people on a road trip, where players are searching for different items outside the car. Items inside the car cannot be used. The driver may have to referee, but should not try to play &amp;ndash; be safe and keep your eyes on the road!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player needs a game book and a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;All players are racing to spot the same items. When you spot an item - call it out and make sure you have a witness to your find. Whoever spots an item first checks it off - while&lt;br/&gt;everyone else must keep looking for the next occurrence of that item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player who gets 3 (or 4) items first is the winner of the round and he gets the sticker to their book. Once a winner is declared, move on to the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player with the most stickers at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
