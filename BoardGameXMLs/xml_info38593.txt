			<description>&amp;ldquo;The battle for Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang valley was called &amp;lsquo;the battle that changed the war in Vietnam.&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1965 the 1st battalion of the 7th cavalry was dropped by helicopter into the Ia Drang valley where three regiments of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and a battalion of Vietcong surrounded them. In the first major engagement between American and NVA soldiers the badly outnumbered Americans successfully defended the landing zone, suffering heavy casualties in the fighting. This scenario focuses on the Vietnamese attack on the morning of the second day of the battle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8).
