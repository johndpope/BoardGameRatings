							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For Sale: A Real Estate Game</name>
									
			<description>You are developer, builder, and real estate agent all rolled into one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board, which mainly consists of vacant lots. Players try to buy lots, build on them, and finally sell the developed properties at the highest price possible. The market goes up and down with each turn according to the roll of the dice. The price of everything is directly tied to the market. The first player to make one million dollars wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wild ride up and down the market. See if you have the stuff to be a high rolling real estate speculator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
