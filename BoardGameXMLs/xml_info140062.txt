							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gunship: First Strike! â€“ Magna Armor</name>
									
			<description>Magna Armor is created from an ore with unique magnetic properties that disrupts Ionization.  It's rare and somewhat expensive, so Command isn't going to give it to everybody.  And the ships that DO get it aren't going to get as much as they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if you're lucky enough to find a few plates on your Carrier's cargo manifest, give it a try!  You'll find it very effective against those annoying Bullseye Ionized shots to the old Power Generator!  Available only in the BGG Store and maybe at an occasional Con at the EPG Booth if you see us there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set includes 8 new Armor Cards and one Rules Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
