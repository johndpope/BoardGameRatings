			<description>The Quark Matter Card Game is a collection of four card games based on the elementary particles of the universe (quarks and leptons). The four games are funny as well as educational, as the game rules abide by the laws of physics. The four games included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Anti (2 players): Players try to get rid of their hands of cards playing them on the table and recognizing pairs of particle-antiparticle on the table, which annihilate themselves (i. e. the cards go to the other player's hand).&lt;br/&gt;     Quark Matter (any # of players): All cards are placed randomly on the table, face up, representing the primordial quark-gluon plasma. Players must be quick to grab the particles according to the correct sequence in the first moments of the universe after the Big Bang: first neutrinos, then lepton-antilepton pairs and lastly quarks and antiquarks to form baryons and mesons (which must be correctly formed). The player with most lepton-antilepton pairs and mesons and baryons is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;     Let's detect (2 players): The players use their cards to form correct particle decays. Each decay formed awards a certaon number of points, and the first player to reach 21 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;     Cosmic showers (any # of players): The players compete to form the biggest cosmic shower, like those produced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available in print-on-demand at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.lulu.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
