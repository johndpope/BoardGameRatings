							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Small Grass Sea</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were Seven Great Dragons. They built the Ziggurat and were going to save the world. But then one got corrupted. He transformed into the Dragon God and cut an evil swath through history. In Toys #121 the Seventh Great Dragon sets out to corrupt the Land of Fallen Gods. His herald is approaching the barbarian tribes there, armed and striding through the Grass Sea with an entourage of priests. He is called the Advent. The Advent is powered by those hideous gemstones that have wreaked havoc time and again throughout the Toys saga. The Advent carries two staves of them radiating gemstone evil. Good luck, puny humans. But no excuses. The Grass Sea is a holy place. You can tap into its power with prayer and some Ulgdish spirits. Strap on some stilts and run like the Red Grass Clan does. You can win this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
