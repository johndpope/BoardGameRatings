			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zool is a &amp;quot;Ninja  of the &amp;quot;Nth&amp;quot; Dimension&amp;quot; who is forced to land on Earth. In order to gain ninja ranking he has to pass six lands. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a pure arcade platform game, relying on smooth, fast moving gameplay, colorful graphics and a popular soundtrack by Patrick Phelan which overlaps with the Lotus 3 soundtrack and has inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. The game also contains a number of embedded minigames, including several arcade games, a scrolling space shooter and a game accessible only by making Zool play a certain tune on an in-game piano. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reviews for the Amiga version of the game were extremely positive. However some criticism was aimed at the blatant and pervasive product placement in the game for lollipop company Chupa Chups, in the first three levels (known as 'Sweet Zone'). Another frequent criticism of the game was that it was allegedly excessively difficult. Some contemporary reviewers complained of not being able to get further than the second level (Music Zone), a lot of reviewers thought that Zool was a Ant which is incorrect he is a Gremlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
