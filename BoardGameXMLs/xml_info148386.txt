							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deck Delver</name>
									
			<description>Deck Delver is a solitaire dungeon crawler type that plays with a small deck. A portion of the cards are dealt face down in a variety of layouts such as &amp;quot;the Pyramid solitaire game&amp;quot;, and then players will have a hand of 5 cards which will act as their inventory of potions and other items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To explore, simply uncover a card that is free. If it is a monster, you need to fight it by playing a card from your hand, adding the bonus to beat at least 2 of its 3 stats. Once a monster beaten, it goes to your discard pile which in turn increases your inventory like a deck building game. On the other hand, if you miss then you remove cards from the top of your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your deck runs out its game over. The goal of the game is to reach the dungeon's boss and beat it to reclaim an artifact to become stronger for your next dungeon. In the rule book is included 8 different layouts you can set up the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full color heavy ink version may be found in the link section since the file is too large to upload.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules have been updated to V1.3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an Expansion currently in the Alpha stage to include a multiplayer co-op rules and new cards too see details below&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
