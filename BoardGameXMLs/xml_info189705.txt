			<description>In the board game A Dog&amp;rsquo;s World, you are a dog, and your goal is to out-score your opponents by leading the best dog life possible. Pick your breed, learn tricks, perform heroic deeds, and mark your territory as you travel from the suburbs - to the city - to the outskirts of town. But watch out for the Dog Catcher or you may end up in the pound. Obtain the most points by the end of the game to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dog&amp;rsquo;s World is a strategy game. Its part board game, part card game, and players will need to find the best way to achieve the most points before they&amp;rsquo;re breed&amp;rsquo;s lifeline reaches its end. In the board game portion, players must travel to specific territories to play cards. Marking territory (and marking over opponents&amp;rsquo; territories) is also key. In the card game portion, players must build upon card combinations to advance their dog&amp;rsquo;s score. Players must learn Tricks, before they can perform Deeds or Heroic Deeds (earning points). Players will also need to figure out how to best utilize their breed&amp;rsquo;s special ability to gain an edge over their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dog&amp;rsquo;s World is all about dogs, and while it will appeal to dog owners and board game junkies, it is accessible to casual and die-hard board gamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
