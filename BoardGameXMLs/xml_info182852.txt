			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Exiles Of The Wicked Maze, a complete traditional tabletop game for 1 player! This game is a sword and sorcery style quest in which you play a prisoner exiled to a massive labyrinth located below the vast, wicked city that you once called home. The basic rules are simple enough. Start at the entrance of the maze and work your way through to the ending point, collecting enough treasure to pay a fine of 5,000 coins as you go. Along the way you will encounter a variety of different symbols, most of these will require you to make a random roll on a chart or two. Some of these symbols will allow you to gain treasure, while others may require you to avoid a deadly trap or fight a monster. Your gained treasures and suffered wounds are recorded on a simple character sheet, which in some ways is similar to the character sheets that you would expect to find with a typical table top role playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike a typical table top role playing game, no &amp;ldquo;game master&amp;rdquo; is required. The encountered symbols and random roll charts dictate the challenges and treasures that you stumble upon. Unlike a typical table top board game, you draw your way through freshly printed copy of the maze rather than rolling dice and moving an equal number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
