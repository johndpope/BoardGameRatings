							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Europa By Mail, Europa play aids kit 6</name>
									
			<description>(from the back cover:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EUROPA -BY -MAIL is designed so that players may use this kit when playing any EUROPA game. The kit contains an air system developed so that players may complete one complete turn of an EUROP~ game without having to run a seperate air turn. The various charts are optional and my be expanded on, used or not used depending on the players preference. Game Research/Design grants permission to individuals to reproduce the various charts contained in this kit for their personal use.&lt;br/&gt; DESIGNERS NOTES &lt;br/&gt;Playing an EUROPA qame by mail may seem like going off the deep end. I have played in a couple of Fire In The East games, so I know it can be done. In fact, it seemed easier to play FITE by mail than face to face. This kit is the expansion of the various ideas people came up with during the last game. I prevailed upon John Astell to come up with a combat resolution system tc finish the air system that we developed so that the problem of multi-phased turns, patrol and interception attacks could be taken care off in one exchange. Not all the problems have been addressed with this kit, but in and of itself you can play by mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personally I prefer using a third party, or gamemaster, but this system has been designed so that you need not to rely on anyone but the two sides to complete the game. To that end we have included the Random Number Analog which eliminates the need for a Dow Jones reading to resolve combats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS KIT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    RANDOM NUMBER ANALOG &lt;br/&gt;    CORPS/ARMY ORGANIZATION CHART &lt;br/&gt;    REPLACEMENT POINT &amp;amp; UNIT *REPLACEMENT CHART &lt;br/&gt;    AIR MISSION CHART &lt;br/&gt;    HIGH COMMAND ORDERS CHART &lt;br/&gt;    ELIMINATED UNITS CHART &lt;br/&gt;    AIR COMBAT RESOLUTION CHART &lt;br/&gt;    ATTACK DESIGNATION CHART &lt;br/&gt;    MOVEMENT CHART &lt;br/&gt;    SPECIAL EFFECTS CHART &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
