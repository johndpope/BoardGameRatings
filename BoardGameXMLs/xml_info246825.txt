							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary â€“ Days Gone Bye</name>
									
			<description>Relive Rick's first moments in The Walking Dead as he braves his way to his home then gears up at the police station in order to face the walkers head-on. The scenario supports 1-4 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the solo version, the player takes control of Rick, with another Survivor of his or her choice being controlled as an Ally. With 2 players, the second player takes the place of the Ally, playing as the Survivor of his or her choice to aid Rick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rick does not start with his normal 15-card Survivor deck. Instead, he uses the 10-card Wounded Rick deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controlling player must use these cards efficiently to ensure Rick survives long enough to make the trip from the hospital to the nearby Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Department. Once there, Rick will be able to recuperate and arm himself, at which point the player controlling Rick will switch out the Wounded deck for Rick&amp;rsquo;s normal Survivor deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, his fellow Survivor starts the Scenario on the other side of the map&amp;mdash;with a handful of Walkers in the way!&amp;mdash;meaning it&amp;rsquo;ll be hard for this Survivor to offer Rick much support at first. If this Survivor moves quickly, he or she can provide Rick with some valuable cover as he makes his way towards his gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting Rick fully armed is quite an achievement, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be enough to get him completely acclimated to the frightening new world around him. The Survivors will need to spend some time raising their Morale, which, unlike most Scenarios, starts completely depleted in &amp;ldquo;Days Gone Bye.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting equipped gives the Survivor&amp;rsquo;s a hefty Morale boost to start with, but they will still need to build their confidence by successfully evading Walkers and scavenging for Resources. If the Survivor&amp;rsquo;s manage to get their spirits up, Rick will be ready to head out on his own, earning a victory for the Survivor team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes Hospital Gown Rick Figure, his 10-card &amp;ldquo;Wounded&amp;rdquo; Survivor Deck, 4 double-sided Map Tiles, 10 Event Cards, and a thrilling Scenario that takes you back to the very first episode of the TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
