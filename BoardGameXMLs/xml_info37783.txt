			<description>Ground Combat in the Gamma Force Universe&lt;br/&gt;An Anime Toymaster Game for use with the Anime Games System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in 1990, Ground Assault Gamma Force is a stand-alone miniatures game using the Gundam anime series as its core with only a few alterations of names. Predominantly a game of giant robotic tanks (mecha) battling across the solar system - there are rules though that also cover more conventional vehicles and infantry.&lt;br/&gt;Players form teams and then select mecha and other units based either on an agreed upon point system or on what miniatures are available. Small plastic model kits are used as its miniatures with each taken from the Gundam series. The game uses a d10 dice system for determining initiative, attacks, dodges, maneuvers and other actions taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9 plastic models were offered individually for the game as its miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
