							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Netbook of Armour</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This netbook was written principally for use with Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2nd Edition). It tries to describe in detail the armours that were briefly listed in Player's Handbook (AD&amp;D 2e Revised). I felt these descriptions lacked a lot in terms of detail and explanations of use, so I sat down to write this. I&amp;rsquo;ve been as comprehensive as I felt was needed. What was required was a fairly brief but all-encompassing description of the item, a little history (for those running historical campaigns, or for those obsessed with accuracy), and maybe a new weapon statistics listing or Armour Class to reflect an item&amp;rsquo;s design. Armours from other locales and time periods I have largely ignored, for the simple reason that the AD&amp;amp;D rules do these items justice anyway. For all their sophistication and grandeur, an Aztec warrior&amp;rsquo;s most sophisticated weapon was the club, and his most sophisticated armour the hide shield. It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how many different types of club you describe, they all act in the same way. The same is not true of different types of swords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
