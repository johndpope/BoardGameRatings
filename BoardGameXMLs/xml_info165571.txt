			<description>You were on the way to a recycling process when fortunately for you - and unfortunately for the environment - you accidentally ran off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now your goal is to escape from the facility, which is an extremely difficult task due to the fact that you are a battery without legs. Equipped with a limited number of electric beams, you can connect to walls, move or destroy objects, turn switches, and charge generators. &lt;br/&gt;You also have the ability to jump or push off the walls - the rest is up to physics and gravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- super-fun gameplay mechanics&lt;br/&gt;- over 60 levels divided into 4 industrial-themed zones&lt;br/&gt;- boss stages&lt;br/&gt;- unlockable 16-bit levels&lt;br/&gt;- unlockable batteries&lt;br/&gt;- unlimited lives !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
