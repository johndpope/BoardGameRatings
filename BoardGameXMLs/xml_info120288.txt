							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guide to Minotaur</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We do not fear the labyrinth. We fear what lies within it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There exists much speculation surrounding the ancient history of the minotaur. The proud race of minotaurs have walked the lands for many thousands of years and, with this race&amp;rsquo;s great strength, fortitude, and uncanny skills of survival, its likely that they will remain for thousands more. Several records found throughout the histories of various cultures include tales which attempt to explain the origins of the minotaur, but as of yet scholars still have no clear understanding of how these creatures came to exist within the world. These tales include myths of the minotaur as being the true race created by the gods to display strength and honor to the race of humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racial Ecologies: Guide to Minotaur is part of a new line of small supplements from Fat Goblin Games. Each one is richly detailed with info on racial histories, personality, physiology, and all the details for playing the race. Expect to see additional bonus material, such as racial options, equipment, npc's, adventure hooks and many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
