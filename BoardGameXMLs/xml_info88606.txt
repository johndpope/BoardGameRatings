			<description>Primeval Groves: The Wanderers Guild Guide to Dangerous &amp;amp; Unusual Plantlife&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;The bounty of life surrounds us all and yet most of you will never see the true beauty and horror that the mother earth has given us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the usefulness of the Goodberry plant and the Gub Nut to the seething hatred running through the sap of the Pine Brethren mother earth can be a most temperamental bed fellow. Traveling from the deepest darkest woodlands and across the most treacherous of seas I have traveled with my companion, young Matron Grubb, so as to enlighten and warn you all with a selection of shoots, roots and legumes to behold, befuddle and ... b e w a r e.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Journals of Gubin Turnipheed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tome, the third in a series of guidebooks by the legendary Wanderers Guild, is a collection of essays and expositions by the renowned Gubbin Turnipheed. Gubbin has noted down his findings over the years of his exploration across the known, and some unknown lands, with his &amp;quot;companion&amp;quot; young Matron Grubb etching what he finds in his on &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; style. Here you will find detailed narrative and remarkable depictions of the creatures and races, herbs and useful plants, peoples and gods that Gubbin has encountered on his travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matron's etchings have been converted to a more distinguishable style by Guild Illuminator Scott Purdy and Gubins' original manuscripts translated by master scribe Andrew Troman. This d20 system source book has been brought together to ensure those traveling across the wilds are equipped with the knowledge that not all that is green is edible. Some of it may well be doing the eating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
