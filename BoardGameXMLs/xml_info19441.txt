			<description>A simple but somewhat clever word game. The players alternate turns placing cards with letters on them on the board, creating an ever-longer string of letters. Strangely enough, the object is to avoid spelling an actual word. However, the string of letters must always be such that it could conceivably be made into an actual word by adding more letters. The round is awarded to a player if either her opponent plays a card making the string of letters into a word, or if she catches her opponent making a play that eliminates all possible words that could be made from the string of letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
