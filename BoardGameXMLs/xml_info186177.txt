							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iconoclast Mini-Ruleset</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mini-ruleset you are looking at now is designed to be an introduction to the world of Iconoclast and the FORGE system. We've given you all the basic concepts you need to get started in just about 30 minutes. And even though our core system uses dice, you don't even need those to play this version of the game (though if you happen to have some 10-sided dice lying around, they won't hurt)--we've included a random number table at the end, so all you need is a pen or pencil to poke with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players run Icons (characters) that have a Genotype (race) with numerous Attributes.  There are ten Primary Attributes, three Secondary Attributes, and three Tertiary Attributes.  Secondary and Tertiary Attributes are derived.  Primary Attributes range from 1-100 with an average human being in the 10-20 range; Scores 25+ are considered &amp;quot;superhuman&amp;quot;.  Characters also have a variety of Skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are resolved using the FORGE (Flexible Optimized Role-playing Game Engine) System, which is based on a percentile roll.  All modifiers apply to the target, not the roll.  Numerous examples are provided as there is no standard approach to rating task targets.  The document is well-written and has high production values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
