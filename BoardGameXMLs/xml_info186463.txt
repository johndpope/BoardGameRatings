			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live Free or Die appeared as a &amp;quot;Free Version&amp;quot; in HTML on the internet.  Forum posts indicate the game subsequently underwent some extent of commercialization in planning for formal publication but no evidence of this exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a &amp;quot;Go/No-Go&amp;quot; system that centers on three specialized cube dice--green, blue, and red, with two &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;, three &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot;, and four &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; sides respectively; remaining sides are &amp;quot;No-Go&amp;quot; sides.  Go indicates success, No-Go indicates failure.  Resolution uses different colored dice based on how skilled the actor is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Aptitudes (attributes) including Brawn, Brains, Prowess, Presence, and Guts.  Aptitudes are assigned narrative levels of Inferior, Average, or Superior.  These three narrative levels correspond to the green, blue, and red die, respectively.  Characters have Skills which are rated as Untrained, Familiar, Qualified, Trained, or Expert.  Tasks are assigned a difficulty of Routine, Standard, Hard, or Oscar Sierra.  Skills and Tasks are cross referenced on a &amp;quot;Universal Task Matrix&amp;quot; yielding a number of Go/No-Go results required for outcomes of Golf Sierra, Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory, Excellent, or Outstanding.  While the system does eliminate handfuls of dice and complex math it does involve several discreet steps.  Combat is handled similarly but multiple Go/No-Go results are considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
