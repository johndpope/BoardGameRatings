							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ork Nation of Cara Fahd</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIVE FREE OR DIE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cara Fahd is caught in the middle as the conflict between Thera and Throal intensifies and war looms on the horizon. Anti-ork forces harass their borders and a myriad of dangers threatens the stability of this new nation. With thousands of orks having gathered from all over Barsaive, tension reigns as former bloodsworn enemies must work together to ensure their own survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ork Nation of Cara Fahd is a sourcebook for Earthdawn that offers gamemasters and players an in-depth look at the newly reborn ork nation. This book describes the nation's recently founded capital city of Claw Ridge and it leaders in detail. It also provides descriptions of the most significant and powerful ork scorcher tribes and cavalries that have joined this new nation, and the conflicts that motivate them. The Ork Nation of Cara Fahd also includes descriptions and statistics for several new magical items and creatures, as well as adventure ideas to help gamemasters incorporate the ork nation into their Earthdawn adventures and campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
