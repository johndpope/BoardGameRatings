			<description>When life gives you Lemons... make lemonade!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lemons is a card game where each Lemon card is played in front of a player and it counts as a minus point, but if a player gathers 3 matching Lemon cards he makes Lemonade and the 3 negative points become 1 positive point. So keep an eye on his Lemon stacks and make sure you don't play a 3rd card of the same type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of Lemon card in front of a player allows that player to play cards on his/her turn in a particular way. Which can be to his left or right, straight across or on his own stacks. On a player's turn he/she must choose one of the Lemon card stacks in front of him/herself and play cards as allowed by that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add a bit of suspense, when a player legally chooses to play a card in front of themself, it may be placed face down in their secret stash. When the game ends, these cards are added to the face up stacks, so you might not know how many pitchers of Lemonade have been made by a player until it's time to...  drink up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
