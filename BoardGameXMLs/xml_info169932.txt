			<description>Myrtille is a co-operative game trying to raise awareness of environmental issues. Players will build and explore the small world of Myrtille and complete missions what can have some environmental impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is made of location card (river, house, beach, forest, garbage dump, shop&amp;hellip;), colored pawns, objective cards (which indicates what pawns should go where), two dice (one with colors and one with numbers), and time cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one objective card and a few location cards. The four edges of each location cards have one of three colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, one location card is put on the table and will represent the board used by all the players. All colored pawns are placed on this card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On its turn, a player rolls the two die, and uses only one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they choose the colored dice, then they add a location card to the board, that will thus get bigger and bigger. To do so, they have to place one of their location card next to a card already on the board such that both adjacent edges have the same color as the die. Also, if the new card is adjacent to more than one card, all adjacent edges must have the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they choose the numbered dice, then they can move one pawn using as many movement points as shown on the dice, each adjacent card using one movement point. They can only move a pawn whose color matches one of the pawn depicted on their objective card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An objective card is complete when all pawns depicted on the objective card are on one location card matching the location of the objective card. The group as a whole earns the victory points printed on the objective card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a limited number of turn, which is tracked using the time cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
