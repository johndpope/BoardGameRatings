			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tale of assassination, murder &amp;amp; terrorism. Can the Globetrotters uncover a terrifying Commonist plot?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Thames ices over and the country grinds to a halt, a scientist is found murdered in the north of London, and the globetrotters are called in to investigate the theft of a mysterious device. What they find is a conspiracy that brings the British Empire to the brink of war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure, the globetrotters again encounter the mysterious Commonist League, anarchists hell-bent on ushering in revolution through a cataclysmic war, a violent offshoot of the scientific utopian Cosmist League. This time, the globetrotters uncover assassination, murder, and terrorist atrocities reaching to the highest levels of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But is everything as it seems? What lies behind the Commonists&amp;rsquo; actions, and the disappearance of Nikolai Fyodorov, the mysterious Cosmist leader, in the distant Pamir Mountains? Can the globetrotters solve the mystery before war consumes the Empire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Emerald Scarab Conspiracy is the second action-packed scenario in The Great Game campaign. Leagues of Adventure is a Victorian Steampunk setting that is powered by the Ubiquity ruleset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
