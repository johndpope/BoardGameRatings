			<description>Bloemeneiland - the Island of Flowers - is a game for 2 or 3 players who are flower buyers for the King. Players must buy flowers from the local merchants and growers and send them by ship back to the Palace to gain favor at court. The player with the most favor after six rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game:&lt;br/&gt;Beginning with the round&amp;rsquo;s Starting Player, players take clockwise turns doing 2 actions in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action 1: Players must move the Island Marker on the board in a clockwise direction from one Townsperson space to another (or to the Dock). They may move any number of spaces but only the first space moved is free. Each additional space costs 1 gold. If the marker stops in front of a Townsperson that player will receive a benefit if they choose. If the player stops at the Dock they&lt;br/&gt;will cause all players to deliver flowers to the Ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action 2: After the player visits a Townsperson they must move their numbered Player Marker to a Location which matches the Townsperson&amp;rsquo;s colored border. Locations occupied by another player may not be visited. You may then use the Location&amp;rsquo;s Special Action. If the Island Marker is at the Dock, no Locations may be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Island Marker is at the Dock, all players may now choose to deliver flowers to the Ship and gain Favor Points. Beginning with the round&amp;rsquo;s Starting Player and then continuing clockwise, each player may deliver one type of flower to the ship, but never more than the Palace currently demands as valued by the dice in play. After each delivery, adjust the corresponding die down by the number of flowers delivered. Anyone who delivers flowers receives Favor Points equal to what is currently shown on the Favor Point track above the Ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End: The game ends after the sixth Ship has sailed. In additional to the Favor Points earned during the game, each player receives an additional 1 Favor Point for every 3 flowers of each type they have in their possession. Gold is not worth any Favor Points. Whoever has collected the most Favor Points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an express version inspired by Santiago de Cuba by Michael Rieneck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
