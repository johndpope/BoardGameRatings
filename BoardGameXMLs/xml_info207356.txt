			<description>Grab some peanuts and Cracker Jack and pull up a seat to The Old Ball Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOBG is a head-2-head, traditional base ball game, featuring real-time pitching (no charts or die rolls to determine results). Players can enjoy a full 9 innings or set a score and play only the 9th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis in on the heart of the game - pitching, with timely hitting sprinkled in and solid fielding (except for the occasional error!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOBG moves along smoothly and quickly, with the time of play dictated by the time to pitch. Meaning you can take your time or play fast - it's up to you. There are special rules for stealing and bunting; and old-fashioned score boards keep track of the count and score, for that Authentic feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitching: The pitcher has 7 pitches to choose from. The pitching happens in 2 stages with the batter saying 'Take' or 'Swing' at each pitch. The result is a ball or strike. As the count goes deeper, the batter gets the advantage and knowledge will prevail over luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitting: When the batter swings at a Strike he gets a potential hit - he flips over a batting card to reveal a single, double, triple (or home-run!), hit to various areas of the ball park. (There are also infield flies.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fielding: The fielding team will select which fielding card to turn over to make the play. Results are Out, Hit or Error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
