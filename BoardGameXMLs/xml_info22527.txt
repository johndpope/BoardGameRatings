							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gold Broker: Y2K Collectors Edition</name>
									
			<description>In this Monopoly-like game, players compete to be the first to double their net worth by rolling the dice and moving around a board buying properties and investing in gold.  As in Monopoly, players have to pay each other rent when they land on owned properties, but this game focuses more on the fluctuating price of gold and takes advantage of the Y2K scare by including &amp;quot;Y2K Crash&amp;quot; spaces that cause money to be lost and &amp;quot;Computer Whiz&amp;quot; spaces where money is earned for fixing Y2K bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
