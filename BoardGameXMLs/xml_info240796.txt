							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steady Job Game</name>
									
			<description>Steady Job is especially designed for students of junior-senior high school age who have learning problems.  Occupational research shows that persons do not lose their jobs because of lack of skills and knowledge but because of poor attitudes and a lack of understanding of the responsibilities involved in employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steady Job is designed to reinforce the positive attitudes and behaviors essential to employability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first person to get a steady job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Steady Job Game is a roll and move game played with a d6 and  pawns on a liner advancement line from the Employment Office (start) square to the Steady Job Square (finish).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on a red - square causes the player to draw a - card and follow the (negative) instructions.  Landing on a green + square causes the player to draw a green + card and follow the positive (instructions).  The negative cards usually send a player back spaces due to negative actions (overslept, missed the bus, poor manners, failed to finish work).  The positive cards reward players with advancing spaces for positive actions (on time to work, took a bath, cleaned work area, remembered to use safety equipment).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seeks to reinforce positive work habits and demonstrate the consequences of negative work habits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to advance to the Steady Job square at the end of the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
