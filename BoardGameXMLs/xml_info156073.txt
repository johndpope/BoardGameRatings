							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Program</name>
									
			<description>Two nations dominate the space race, competing by building rockets, satellites and infrastructure with the aim of being first into space and beyond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 1962 and in an alternate universe the Northern States Federation and Central European Social Republic vie for the domination of space.  As President of one of these nations your scientists and engineers work tirelesly to produce blueprints for new rockets and infrastructure, submitting them to you for approval.  You advance your space program by placing the blueprints into dossiers to be actioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To keep up with your opponent you will be forced to bluff about how advanced your space program is.  But look out, enemy agents are always close at hand to reveal your plans, and your opponent is only a phonecall away from challenging your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Program is an abstract card game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a stack of blueprint cards known as their drawing board.  Each turn players play cards from their hand to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has two ways that it can be played. They can be laid down in a pyramid formation for their numerical value to score points, or for it's special ability. Players play their blueprint cards to the table to score the most points and can bluff about what they are playing and use the special abilities to switch the positions of the blueprints, use agent cards to reveal an opponent's cards, block an opponent's progress and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pyramid is like a 'technology tree' where the lowest levels represent the infrastructure and the levels above represent your satellites, rockets and manned missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over three rounds and the winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
