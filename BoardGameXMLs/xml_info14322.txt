			<description>Weave a tale of crime or passion, hiding a keyword that nobody but you knows. You might be the hero of the story, or perhaps a witness...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's how it works&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every one gets a story card to set the scene and start them off. They then continue their tall tale making it as wierd and wacky as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the tricky part&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick is to hide your special keyword so that no-one can guess what it is, but you've also got to incorporate a theme into your story according to which space you land on; Crime, Love Affair, Witness, or Hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;Tall Tale Cards&lt;br/&gt;Keyword Cards&lt;br/&gt;Sand Timer&lt;br/&gt;2 Dice&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
