							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jurassic Park III</name>
									
			<description>Jurassic Park III is a light gun arcade game based on the 2001 movie of the same name. Developed by Konami and released in 2001, Jurassic Park III uses the same cabinet and motion sensor technology as Police 911, requiring players to dodge the oncoming dinosaur attacks. It was preceded by The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 1997, also a light gun game, but from Sega.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player must kill dinosaurs by aiming at them and shooting them with the light gun. The player is given 8 bullets. The player must reload every time they use all 8 bullets. Reloading is done by shooting outside of the screen. After a boss is killed, the player is sometimes given more health if he or she did well killing the boss (or at random points you might get more health too) . A heath bar is shown. The bar gets smaller and smaller as the player receives damage. If the bar is gone, the game is over unless the player puts in more coins and hits the &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;continue&amp;quot; button. There are also two left and right arrow buttons on the dash of the console. Allowing players to &amp;quot;Run away&amp;quot; from the dinosaur(s) to avoid taking damage.(This feature is only allowed at boss battles.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jurassic Park III (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
