			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This frankensteinian contraption is so awesomely ridiculous. It slides over the GameBoy to augment it by adding side lighting, a magnifying lens that fit over the screen, stereo speakers like wings &amp;amp; a bit that fits over the buttons to turn the controls into a joystick . It becomes so unwieldy that they had to provide a neckstrap just so your arms won't fall off. It plugs into the GameBoy AC outlet, while the speakers plug into the headphone jack. This was made by the STD Entertainment company &amp;amp; was part of their &amp;quot;JoyPlus&amp;quot; products. :D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
