			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of years ago on the continent of R&amp;ucirc;l, the son of the Faerie Queen Titania defied his mother&amp;rsquo;s will by involving himself and his faerie followers in mortal affairs, allying with the First People to wage war against the invading Edene. Forever condemned by Titania as a traitor to faeriekind, the Betrayer, as he came to be known, turned to the Devil to bargain for his aid in defeating the Edene. But this deal proved to be a terrible mistake, as Diabolus dithered and balked at issuing forth his hogmen legions from Hell, giving the Edene God-Queen Umessa time to slay the Betrayer in battle and scatter the elf-lord&amp;rsquo;s followers throughout the continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In defeat, the Betrayer&amp;rsquo;s followers suffered the enormity of their leader&amp;rsquo;s bargain, finding themselves forever stained, sullied, and corrupted. Transformed into hideous thralls of Hell, these darklings have hidden in R&amp;ucirc;l&amp;rsquo;s shadows, forced by the Betrayer&amp;rsquo;s pact with the Devil to corrupt and lead mortals into damnation. But as the Demon Lord&amp;rsquo;s shadow spreads over the Urth, these wicked faeries find themselves drawn out of their exile in darkness, either to take up arms against the common threat or to join forces with the Hunger in the Void to bring an end to their suffering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scions of the Betrayer kicks off a new series of supplements for Shadow of the Demon Lord that reveal the forgotten peoples, places, and relics littering the lands of R&amp;ucirc;l. In this product, you'll find darklings, warped faeries forever bound to serve the Devil, now available to players as a new ancestry and to Game Masters as a dreadful new foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
