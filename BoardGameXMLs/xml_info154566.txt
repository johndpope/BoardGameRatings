			<description>This 18th century game is about the simplest two-player adaptation of Whist that can be imagined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses a standard 52-card pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer deals all the cards one at a time, turning the last card face up. The suit of this card, which belongs to the dealer, is the trump suit for the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Play&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to win tricks. Each trick consists of two cards, one played by each player. The first player plays any card and the second player must play a card of the same suit if possible. In this case the higher card wins the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the cards have been played, the player who won more tricks wins in proportion to the difference in tricks between the players - for example 8 units if the winner has 17 tricks and the loser 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
