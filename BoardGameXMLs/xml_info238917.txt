							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATK! The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>ATK! The Board Game is a 2 player 3v3 MOBA Style Board Game. Assemble your team of 3 Elemental Heroes. Each Hero has a spinnable base that is used for the attack mechanism. Your team is also equipped with 2 towers and a base. These structures have a health system that is easy to keep track of with a counting system built in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to destroy your opponent's base while protecting your own. Any time you defeat enemy Heroes you earn specialty cards that can assist you to victory. These cards include damage boosters for single attacks, respawn delays to assign to your opponent's hero, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battling structures is simple, choose your Hero, flip upside down and spin the spinner. Reference your Hero Cards to add a value or action to your spin's outcome. If it's an attack, subtract that amount to the structure's health. Deplete all health on a tower and it is removed from play giving you a clear path to the base. When attacking an enemy Hero, flip both Heroes over and spin. Higher number wins without elemental influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategically maneuver your way into your opponent's base area and destroy their base. Upon doing so, claim the title of the ATK! Champion. Reset and Play Again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
