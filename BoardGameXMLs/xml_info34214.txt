			<description>3P2K, or Plain and Precious Parts 2000 is a sequel to the 1984 LDS game, Celestial Pursuit. The game is designed to be played by two teams, but it can also be played by four individual players. The goal is to be the first to get four Touchstones by answering trivia questions correctly. The game includes 2,000 trivia questions in four categories. Book of Mormon, Bible, Hymns, and Prophets/Prophecy. Categories are chosen by rolling a die (which the game refers to as the &amp;quot;perfect polyhedron.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic version of the game, players need only collect four touchstones to win. In the advanced version, players need to collect one touchstone from each category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answers to all questions are referenced to the scripture or hymn they come from so that players can study subjects they didn't know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author originally wanted to reprint Celestial Pursuit, but felt that the questions and rules were too complex for family play so he created 3P2K instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;3P2K has long been on the mind of one of Celestial Pursuit's authors. Realizing from his own family the need for Gospel-based alternatives to the modern world's fast-paced entertainments, the author created Plain &amp;amp; Precious Parts 2000, or 3P2K.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1984 version of Celestial Pursuit seemed too difficult and timebound in its adult questions and too complex in its rules to simply be reprinted. 3P2K was therefore created to best serve LDS families in the year 2000 and beyond by emphasizing gospel principles and naturally creating opportunities for doctrinal discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By focusing on four basic areas of Gospel knowledge (Bible, Book of Mormon, Hymns, Prophets &amp;amp; Prophecy), 3P2K simplifies question content and lends timelessness to referenced answers. Specific attention was given to the idea of plain &amp;amp; precious parts of doctrine as the questions were written. Many questions are based on truths learned from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and from footnote references in the LDS Scriptures. Providing both adult and child cards allows family participation from the simplest Sunbeam to the sagest scriptorian.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Related game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Celestial Pursuit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
