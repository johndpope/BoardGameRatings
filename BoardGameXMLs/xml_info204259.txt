							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume XXII</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XXII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 22 mythic spells, from undetectable alignment to zone of truth. A mythic virtue spell lasts for a full hour, and grants one of seven additional benefits, each based on a different virtue. A mythic wail of the banshee gives greater control over which creatures are affected, and can cause those it slays to rise as banshees on the following round, while a mythic weird forces creatures to save a second time on the following round in order to survive, and can permanently haunt the nightmares of creatures that die and are resurrected, and a mythic wind wall blocks creatures from being able to pass through it without making Strength or Fly checks. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
