							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Training: Leadership</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some agents do more than take orders. They give them. A good team of spies should be organized to work as a team. Often, this means developing a plan and taking control of a tactical situation. Some agents excel in this, others do not. The agency to which the players&amp;rsquo; agents belong offers an advanced leadership training program. Admins who want this added level of teamwork (and complexity) can opt to use this system by allowing one or more agents on the team to enroll in this program to learn advanced techniques in detection, interrogation, planning, and manipulation. He's the oil that makes the cogs in the team work well. He's the glue that binds them together. He's the man with the plan... he's a leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an Advanced Training option book for players and Admins to use in their games. It represents an option for agents to enroll in an advanced program offered by the agency. Enrolling increases the amount of experience points needed to go up in level, but provides the agent access to a series of leadership techniques he otherwise wouldn't have been entitled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your leader will establish a Plan or give Commands. He'll detect things that might harm his team, and build trust with dangerous people. He'll arrange for exfil when no other option remains. He'll identify and come up with ways to foil the plans of enemy leaders, or plant neurolinguistic suggestions on unsuspecting people. He'll keep his team safe while helping orchestrate the success of a mission. And when all is done, he'll light up a cigar and comment how much he loves it when a plan comes together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
