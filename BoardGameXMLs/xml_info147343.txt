							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zero Tolerance</name>
									
			<description>Zero Tolerance is a 1994 video game developed by Technopop and published by Accolade exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis video game console. It was one of the only Mega Drive/Genesis first person shooters. Due to the limitations of the hardware, the player's view of the 3D environment was restricted to a fraction of the screen, with the player's HUD, a map of the surrounding area, and the player character's ID card comprising the rest of the screen space. Still, it featured impressive visual effects for its time and especially for the Genesis, a system with hardware that lacked much of the necessary scaling and rotation technologies normally needed to create even the most rudimentary appearance of 3D environments (such as rival Super NES' built-in &amp;quot;Mode 7&amp;quot; technology and &amp;quot;Super FX Chip&amp;quot; add-on). In fact, the smoothness and speed at which Zero Tolerance ran was said to rival many of the lower-end versions of Doom available at the time, most notably the one for the Super NES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Zero Tolerance (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
