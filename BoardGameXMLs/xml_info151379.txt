			<description>Game featured in the British 1979 Charlie's Angels Annual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple roll and move game for two players. One is the good player representing a member of Charlie's Angels I assume, and the other is the evil player, representing an Enemy Agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move according to their die roll not forgetting to obey the instructions on special squares, and the first to launch the Rescue Missile (Space 38), wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules say that the game can be played alone, by 'playing fairly' for the enemy agent's die rolls. It is the first time in a Goose-type game that I have seen a square that only applies to the Charlie's Angel player, who, if she lands on it, she is knocked out of the game. There is no such square for the Enemy Agent so he has a small advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
