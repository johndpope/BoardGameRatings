			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a role playing game system, a set of rules that forms the structure of a role playing game. A game system is like the laws of nature and physics. It determines the outcome of the player's actions. What would happen if one character tried to strike another or intimidate him? What happens when a character falls off of a building? A gaming system such as this one is used to answer these questions and to do much more. This system is reasonably advanced in use. I designed it to handle any genre or scenario and to do it better than any other game. It is usually what you would refer to as an universal system like GURPSTM, FuzionTM and the like. But I try to keep the mechanics smooth and useful as any game made for a specific setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
