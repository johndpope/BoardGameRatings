			<description>Scravage is Gin Rummy, crossed with a word game, played with a Scroker deck.  The entire alphabet is represented with the citrus suits, and the scrokers are completely wild (suit and letter).  You can mix the chili pepper suit's vowels with the citrus letters in order to form your words.  The animal suit, however, is sacred, and cannot be commingled with the other suits to form words.  On the other hand, its words will be worth double points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you either acquire a card by drawing one from the deck, or by scravaging (scavenging) one from the discard or an opponent's entire four-letter word.  Then, you play a word if you scravaged, or if you want to.  Finally, you must discard if you didn't go out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add spice, there are numerous variants, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
