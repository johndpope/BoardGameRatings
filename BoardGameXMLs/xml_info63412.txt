			<description>This is NOT a race game, but played with an ordinary pack of playing cards, from which the tens have been removed. But a gameboard, with a giant, is also present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Preliminaries'&lt;br/&gt;- The Court Cards represents men or women.&lt;br/&gt;- Each Ace represents a woman.&lt;br/&gt;- Each hand deposits the following numbers of counters into the bank:&lt;br/&gt;-- 16 hands =&amp;gt; 2 counters&lt;br/&gt;-- 14 hands =&amp;gt; 3 counters,&lt;br/&gt;-- 12 hands =&amp;gt; 3 counters,&lt;br/&gt;-- 10 hands =&amp;gt; 3 counters,&lt;br/&gt;--  8 hands =&amp;gt; 4 counters,&lt;br/&gt;--  6 hands =&amp;gt; 6 counters and&lt;br/&gt;--  4 hands =&amp;gt; 8 counters. &lt;br/&gt;- Previous to the deal, partners are chosen.&lt;br/&gt;- Each lady shall have a Court Card representing a man, and each &lt;br/&gt;  gentleman shall have a Court Card or an Ace representing a woman.&lt;br/&gt;- Players without Court Cards can buy them from their neighbours.&lt;br/&gt;- If a player has such a card to spare, he delivers it to the buyer.  &lt;br/&gt;  The buyer presents three cards, from which the seller draws one and &lt;br/&gt;  receives one counter for each point from the buyer (Court Cards = &lt;br/&gt;  10 points).&lt;br/&gt;- If no player has a Court Card, or Ace, to sell, the player must ask &lt;br/&gt;  the dealer. The dealer turns up a card until the buyer gets a Court &lt;br/&gt;  Card or an Ace. For every card turned up, the buyer pays the dealer &lt;br/&gt;  one counter. But if the buyer is the dealer, he pays no fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'The Play'&lt;br/&gt;- The dealer deposits the bank at the giants head on the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;- All players show their cards, and the half of the players with the &lt;br/&gt;  lowest cards (prisoners) surrender their Court Cards or Aces.&lt;br/&gt;- The players with the highest cards (active combattants)keep the &lt;br/&gt;  Court Cards before them and throw away the rest.&lt;br/&gt;- The active combattants deposit 8 counters a head as a war-chest, to &lt;br/&gt;  defray the expenses when fighting the giant.&lt;br/&gt;- The spinning of the tetotum (numbered 1-6)three times each, is the &lt;br/&gt;  weapon to kill the giant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Lucky casts and prizes'&lt;br/&gt;- No. 4: The giant's legs - 6 counters.&lt;br/&gt;- No. 6: The shield - 4 counters.&lt;br/&gt;- No. 8: The arms - 10 counters.&lt;br/&gt;- No. 13: The sword - 6 counters.&lt;br/&gt;- No. 16: The helmet - 8 counters.&lt;br/&gt;- No. 17: The sortie of the prisoners from the citadel and the end &lt;br/&gt;   of the game.
