			<description>It`s fun to go shopping! Particularly when you`re buying colourful and healthy food! Giving children the opportunity to buy the food and pay for it themselves delevops in them an awareness of nutrition, strategic thinking and an early understanding of quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move their figures along the board and bit by bit they buy four different items of food (apples, peppers, maize and fish). They have money tokens to use to pay for them but they must make sure to get the food at the right price. The first to pay for these four food items is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 wooden playing board (appr. 370 x 370 x 10 mm) &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 4 playing figures &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 16 money tokens&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 dice with dots  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 coloured Beleduc Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
