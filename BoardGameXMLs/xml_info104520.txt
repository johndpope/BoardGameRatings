							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation: Snow Job</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What a diabolical plan! Cobra will drown us all if the GI Joe Team can't stop them in OPERATION: SNOW JOB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There's only one person who can find Cobra's snow fortress,&amp;quot; says GI Joe commander Hawk in his steely voice as he turns and points to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Compass, expert in reconnaissance and small arms, extraordinary at scouting without landmarks. No wonder Hawk and the Team rely on you - you're the only one who can navigate in murderous temperatures, near-zero visibility and treacherous terrain. While under fire, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is being held hostage. Cobra has teamed up with the maniacal Destro and fiendish Dr. Mindbender, and they're planning to raise water levels by melting the polar ice caps. Millions will drown! You've got 72 hours to lead Hawk, Roadblock, Low-Light, Lifeline, Dial-Tone, and Iceberg through a dangerous frozen maze of crack Cobra Viper Squads, polar bears, and more to stop Cobra's evil plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bleak frozen tundra looks the same everywhere. Which direction will you take, Compass? The planet is counting on you as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
