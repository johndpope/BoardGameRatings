							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trog!</name>
									
			<description>Trog plays somewhat like a Pac-Man clone. The player assumes the role of Rex, Bloop, Spike, or Gwen, small T-Rex dinosaurs (with Styracosaurus-like heads) in the land of &amp;quot;Og&amp;quot;, home to the one-eyed cavemen known as the &amp;quot;Trog&amp;quot;. Players must pick up all colored eggs lying around the map as the cavemen wander around, attempting to capture and eat them. Luckily, there are plenty of power-ups to help finish the level. Aside from a standard punch attack, these include red flowers that increase the player's speed, ice cubes that freeze all on-screen Trogs and pineapples, which turn the character into a full-grown T-Rex that can temporarily eat his enemies. The multiplayer mode consists of two to four dinos on the same screen competing to get all of his/her same-colored eggs first, and players can either attack or protect each other (though power-ups indiscriminately hurt anyone that's in the way regardless). Unlike Pac-Man, however, the dinos can attack without requiring a power-up, and the mazes are much more open. In fact, in many stages there are no walls at all, so the characters can travel off the edge of the grid-like islands and plunge into the sea if they're not careful. The Trogs can be one-hit punched, to the side of the head, as they approach the screen edge resulting in them diving into the sea, with bonus points rewarded to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different levels of difficulty: Easy, Advanced and Expert. Advanced Mode rewards a 200,000 level bonus and Expert rewards a 400,000 level bonus. As the levels progress, the cavemen become smarter and invent new ways to capture the dinosaurs. They eventually create fire pits and wheels to burn and flatten, respectively, the character and springs to bounce themselves all over the screen. Catapults and transportation chambers in latter stages help evade these attacks, however these are also usable by the Trogs resulting in some tactical gameplay options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trogs themselves are subject to all hazards the player is; they can even be taken out by their own wheels, fire and pits to comic effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Trog!,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
