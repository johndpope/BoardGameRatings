			<description>An adult trivia game that isn't too &amp;quot;Adult&amp;quot;. It's filled with double entendres and suggestive questions... but no four letter words allowed.  Consider the game a slightly more suggestive version of Trivial Pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of six booklets each containing a set of questions.  On a turn, a player is asked a question from one of the books.  If he gets the question right, he gains 10 points and the chance to answer another question.  If he gets it wrong, the player to his left has the opportunity to answer the question for 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points after 12 rounds of play is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six question categories are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bawdy Jokes&lt;br/&gt;    Hot Times in History&lt;br/&gt;    Mytholaneous&lt;br/&gt;    Sex in the Arts&lt;br/&gt;    The Famous Uncovered&lt;br/&gt;    The Facts of Life&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;suggested age on box: for those 17 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
