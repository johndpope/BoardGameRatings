							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Changing Years</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'm writing this anonymously, because I'm spilling some secrets that aren't supposed to slip out.  Just know that I'm on the side of true history - whatever TimeWatch says it is - and I've done my best to make that happen.  Ad if I screwed up a few times?  Well, no one's perfect...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 1st May 1895, an agent of TimeWatch delivered a manuscript, bound in waxed paper and string, to the offices of Pelgrane Press for publication.  Months later, the entire print run was discreetly collected and the book was never seen again.  Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hold in your hands The Book of Changing Years:  an assortment of time travellers' tales put together on the quiet by agents of TimeWatch, and passed secretly from agent to agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's also a handout for players of the TimeWatch roleplaying game in the style of the award-winning The Book of the Smoke and The Armitage Files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow these writers' leads through time and space, and discover why:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     There are too many cats in London in 1840 and no dogs at all, and how this related to the pyramids of Kush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Edward V is scouring the time lines in search of Caravaggio's St. Francis Preaching to the Birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Somebody time-pranked Alexander Graham Bell into thinking he'd heard spirit voices on his new invention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seek the answers to these questions, facing psychic beetles and sentient veociraptors on the way - and if you don't like what you find, repair the timeline and restore true history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire up your time machine, unhook your tether, and dive into the gaps between the chimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
