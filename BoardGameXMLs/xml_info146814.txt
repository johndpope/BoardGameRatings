			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellnight, known as Dark Messiah in Japan, you take the role of an average man on his way home from work who runs into a group of occultists talking about the Dark Messiah and the end of the world. Shortly after your subway crashes and everyone on board is killed except for you and a high school girl. You end up having to navigate your way through a sewer while being chased by a monster. You run into three other characters through the course of the game with their own dialogue, personality, and ability but you are only able to take one person with you. If caught once by the monster your companion is killed, if caught again it is game over. Eventually you learn what the Dark Messiah is and about the cult you ran into earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played from a first person view but does not feature combat, although certain companions may carry weapons that will stun the monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
