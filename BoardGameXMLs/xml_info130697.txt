			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Summary: The group may be at a loss, either unwilling to investigate the shrine (as it may appear to be a red herring) or otherwise stumped as to how to proceed. If they follow-up with their previous contacts, and possibly some additional information sources, they receive further clues that lead them either to the main docks district, or Bleakshore, the smugglers docks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;The group has a few decisions to make at this point. Their initial mission is to find the gem and return it to the Museum, however, their leads may have appeared to dry up. Though there may be a couple of threads, one leading to a meeting with Kief and the strange cult and another leading to the cult&amp;rsquo;s shrine in the Bleakshore district.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
