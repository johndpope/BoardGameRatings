			<description>These mini-games can be used as filler games or during a game of Dragon Valley: Rise of Corundia of 3 or 4 players while two players are waiting for the division of King's Aid. Purple cubes and/or Unit cubes from the Unit bag are used to keep track of game play aspects in Dragon Valley Tourneys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with Jousting. If finished before the other player(s) have completed the dividing in Dragon Valley: Rise of Corundia, they move on to Archery. If there is still time, they move to the Trebuchet Tourney and afterwards back again to Jousting. If the dividing is complete, finish any score checks but do not continue. If a scoring criteria was not met, no player gains score in Dragon Valley: Rise of Corundia from the current tourney. They do keep the score earned in previous tourneys during this division. Make sure to return any purple cubes to the board and units back into the cloth bag. The next division starts with the next mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players are not comfortable playing traditional Rock Parchment Swords, an alternate is to pull Blue, Red and Yellow cubes from the bag and secretly selecting one (if enough are there, otherwise use cubes from the board, but remember where they came from.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
