			<description>Disassemblin' Dice is a dice game for 2-4 players using the Nestortiles game system.  In Disassemblin' Dice, players build dice using Nestortiles, roll those dice to score points, and then disassemble and re-assemble the dice in order to create more powerful dice.  Rolling a higher score than the other players allows a player to push their opponents' dice markers towards the end of the disassembly track.  Once a player is knocked off the track, their die is disassembled, and they are out of the game.  The last player to have their die disassembled wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile that a player uses to assemble their dice changes the score that any roll yields.  Players must carefully remove and add different tiles to their dice in order to maximize their chances of scoring higher than their opponents.  Careful manipulation of the six Nestortiles and a bit of luck result in victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
