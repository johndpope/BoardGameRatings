			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the tenth title in Skirmisher Publishing&amp;rsquo;s popular and ongoing &amp;ldquo;100 Oddities&amp;rdquo; series! &amp;quot;100 Oddities for a Viking Encounter&amp;quot; is a thematic sourcebook that contains lists of 100 Items, 20 Places, and 30 People &amp;amp; Monsters that can be used separately or in conjunction with one another to add some evocative details to a Viking-themed encounter or to construct one from scratch. These elements routinely cross the line between actual mythological elements and meta-references to them, and storytellers can decide in any given case whether they are dealing with something legendary or merely reminiscent of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddities are things that stand out from the ordinary, and prompt both game masters and players to wonder about them. Oddities intrigue and awaken curiosity and creativity in player and storyteller alike, adding interest to an encounter, or even making one out of nothing. Traditional combat encounters with stock monsters in standard subterranean rooms, followed by obligatory searches and looting, tend to run together after a while and become unmemorable to players. A crippled blacksmith found trapped in a mountainside cave, however, who is repairing an oversized iron plow that he says once belonged to a goddess and which must be fixed in time for an important annual ritual, is more likely to stick with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
