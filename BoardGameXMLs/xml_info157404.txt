							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Konfusion!</name>
									
			<description>From the instruction sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Konfusion! is to &amp;quot;make it through the day.&amp;quot; We've all had one of those days...sometimes they last a week! By moving logically and with planning, one can get through a simple day with ease...Right?  Well...at least once in a while. But all days are not that simple -- as one trip around this board will show you. It will be your logic and luck that will get you through one of those KONFUSING days. The first player to reach the end of the day (the finish line space) may earn that coveted three (or five or 52) week vacation AND does win the game of Konfusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
