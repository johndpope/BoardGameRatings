							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Eldritch Knight</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fearsome warriors and spellcasters, eldritch knights are rare among magic-users in their ability to wade into battle alongside fighters, barbarians, and other martial classes. Those who must face eldritch knights in combat fear them greatly, for their versatility on the battlefield is tremendous; against heavily armed and armored opponents they may level crippling spells, while opposing spellcasters meet their ends on an eldritch knight&amp;rsquo;s blade. The eldritch knight is superficially similar to the magus, as both combine magic and arms. They differ in that the the eldritch knight is both a competent magic user and warrior, maintaining the separate strengths of each role, while the magus blends magic and swordplay into a unified fighting technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Eldritch knight.&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: Fighter, wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Eldritch knights master the abilities of both fighting and magic, hurling magic at the enemy one moment and hewing down their opponents with steel the next. They are just as comfortable in the thick of combat as they are casting spells at foes while remaining safely behind their compatriots. Their versatility makes them valuable allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
