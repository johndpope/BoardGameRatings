			<description>&amp;quot;A Rollicking Game of Skill&amp;quot; proclaims the box. And it must have been very skilful, perhaps too skilful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 6 wooden egg cups which are placed in the centre of the table. The players have a catapult device with which they lob the egg shaped pieces into an egg cup. At least, that is what they intend to do but it must have been devilishly difficult. The most successful player wins, but I suspect the only player to get it right wins automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
