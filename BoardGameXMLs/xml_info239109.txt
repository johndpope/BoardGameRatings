			<description>Meet the environmentally friendly game of the year, FOREST!  The first game from Korea to launch at The New York Toy Fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many trees can I grow?&lt;br/&gt;Protect your forest by being the best Forest Ranger.  Watch out for crafty lumberjacks, and keep the animals safe from dangerous hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take two fruit cards each, which reveal the kind of tree they are protecting. Fruit cards stay hidden. Then, players take turns to plant trees around the Mountain Board, adding lumberjacks, hunters, calamities, animals, and forest ranger cards. When the drawing pile runs out, players complete one last round. Then all players reveal fruit cards, tally up animal and tree points earned, and move pieces up the mountain on the score track. The furthest up the mountain is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
