							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quirk</name>
									
			<description>Quirk is played on a 9x9 square grid which is divided into four spirals radiating from the center. It requires eight dice with letters on the sides (the distribution is not given). Letters are written in the spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn the player rolls the dice and attempts to make a word using them. After the first word (which begins in the center), each new word must incorporate letters from previously-played words. Words are played along the spirals. However, additional words may be formed in orthogonal directions, which scores extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were published in Games &amp;amp; Puzzles #26 (July 1974).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
