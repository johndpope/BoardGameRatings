			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a courtesy to new players we are presenting a condensed version of the rules for your enjoyment free of charge. This will allow those of you new to the game to play some simple test games to evaluate if Classic BattleTech is for you. Classic BattleTech is a game of skill and luck, and we are certain that new players will find this an excellent introduction to a very rich game and universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost everything needed to play is included, the only exceptions being a couple of pencils, a pair of six-sided dice, and of course you and your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, enjoy, and thank you for supporting Classic BattleTech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
