			<description>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, known in Japan as Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce 2 (ゼルダの伝説 神々のトライフォース2 Zeruda no Densetsu Kamigami no Toraifōsu Tsū, lit. &amp;quot;The Legend of Zelda: Triforce of the Gods 2&amp;quot;), is an action-adventure game in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series for Nintendo 3DS. The game takes place in the same world as the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, taking place six generations following that game's events. The game was released on November 22, 2013 in North America and Europe, November 23, 2013 in Australia, and will be released on December 26, 2013 in Japan. It is the second retail game in the series released on the 3DS, after The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the top-down two-dimensional gameplay of various Zelda games, especially A Link to the Past, though it is now presented with stereoscopic 3D graphics when played on the Nintendo 3DS. The top screen is used as the main screen, while the bottom touch screen contains the map, gear, and items. The loading screen consists of a black screen with a Triforce in the lower right corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the overworld is largely the same as that of A Link to the Past, all the dungeons are totally new. Exploration of dungeons utilize the game's 3D effects and feature Link jumping between levels to solve puzzles and advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several items from A Link to the Past return, including arrows for shooting enemies from a long distance, the mallet which allows Link to knock down pegs in the ground, and the Fire Rod which creates a firestorm. The magic meter now refills on its own, a change from the original where it required potions to refill. The magic meter replaces previous games' ammunition system for Link's bow and bombs, as well as being used to power other items and special abilities, such as the magic hammer and spin attack. The Master Sword shoots projectiles when Link is at full health as in A Link to the Past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another new feature is the ability for Link to enter walls and become a drawing. When he does so, the camera shifts to a profile view and he is able to move along the walls to reach new areas. Drawings of hearts and rupees can be found on walls and Link can collect them when he turns into a drawing. This ability also allows Link to enter cracks in walls to move between Hyrule and Lorule. This ability causes the player's meter to deplete with time. The feature was inspired by the Phantom Ganon boss battle in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rupees are much more important in this game than in previous Zelda titles because of the necessity to buy or rent items. This, along with the ability of the player to choose the order of completing dungeons in, sets apart this Zelda game from more recent installments. The only time these two features have previously appeared in a Zelda game was, notably, the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
