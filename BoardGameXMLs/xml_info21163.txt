							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Billion Dollar Bustout</name>
									
			<description>This is a gambling game developed and produced by Rick R. Windedahl. He states in the acknowledgment that he developed the game in 1977 for personal home play and that after 5 years of private play he was urged to get a copyright and publish the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object it to become a Billionaire. Each player starts with 300 million dollars and the game continues until only one player is left with money or one player accumulates 1 billion dollars in assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 300 chips, 16 casino tiles, 6 tokens, 5 dice, 4 betting strips, a gameboard, a slots deck, a regular deck a spinner and the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll either 1 or 2 dice (their choice) and then move around the board and either play the gambling game of the casino that they land on for small profits against the bank or buy the casino (casinos are grouped, sort of like Monopoly squares, by the same color) and then own and become the bank for that particular casino making the payoffs for others who gamble in that particular casino. The games of chance in the game are SLOTS, WHEEL, DICE, BLACKJACK, ACEY-DUCEY and various forms of POKER. (There is an explanation on how to play any of the games included in the rule book..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring a set of the same colored casinos allows one to get a bonus by selling them back to the bank for double the buying price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the wording of the rules shows perhaps a lack of proper English and so are not as clear as they could be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
