			<description>Asami has experienced more pain in her relatively few years than most people are capable of enduring in a lifetime. As a child, she saw faint lights which she knew came from Beyond. To guard her from judgment, her father kept her isolated. Asami grew lonely and yearned for the day she would have a family of her own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following an attack on her family shrine, she lost not only her father but also her fertility, and with it, the hope of creating her own family. Mortally wounded, Asami let the Amanjaku inside her soul, bestowing her with the bestial power of the oni &amp;ndash; power which escalated as she let the demon even deeper within her, lured on by its promise to grant her a child. The exchange was a dark pact; the ravenous maw splitting the back of her head is both a constant reminder of her own insatiable hunger for the life she lost and the cruel mark of her oni manipulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ten Thunders have recruited Asami into their number, hoping to use her demonic strength for themselves, but whether they will be able to control her is another matter entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing six 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic, Stat Cards and Upgrade Cards. Will require some preparation and assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asami Tanaka&lt;br/&gt;    Amanjaku&lt;br/&gt;    Ohaguro Bettari&lt;br/&gt;    3 Yokai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asami Tanaka&lt;br/&gt;    Amanjaku&lt;br/&gt;    Ohaguro Bettari&lt;br/&gt;    3 Yokai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
