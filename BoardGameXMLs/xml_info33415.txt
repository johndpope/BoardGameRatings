			<description>(From the publisher's website):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supervillain University is a disturbingly fun card game from Alleged Enterprises for up to 6 players. In it, you take on the role of a senior at SVU, bent on completing a series of Secret Agendas that will be culmination of all your hard work and launch you into the world as a card-carrying Junior Supervillain In Training. The only problem? You have a bunch of classmates (read: enemies) who are hell-bent on stopping you and beating you at your own game. With elements of resource-gathering, roleplaying and fast-paced screwing over of all those who oppose you, there&amp;rsquo;s truly something for everyone. Provided, of course, that &amp;ldquo;everyone&amp;rdquo; enjoys backstabbing, conniving and The Wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main phases to the game. In the resource-gathering phase, one player (the rotating TA) reveals an Opportunity that might present itself on a typical day at Supervillain University. All other players will quickly respond, in secret, with their chosen Evil Deed. The TA collects these played actions, reveals them and determines (based on whatever utterly subjective criteria he or she deems fit) which one is the winner. The player with the winning Evil Deed for the round now collects critical resources needed to complete the all-important Secret Agenda in Phase Two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After collecting sufficient resources, a player may reveal their Secret Agenda &amp;ndash; a truly nefarious scheme guaranteed to bring the world to its knees. If the player can survive a flurry of attempts by the other players to sabotage their Secret Agenda, he or she will collect valuable &amp;quot;points.&amp;quot; After collecting an arbitrary number of &amp;quot;points,&amp;quot; the winning player may then lord his or her mastery over the other losers playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
