			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selfie Poker is a unique combination of poker and modern puzzle games. Designed specifically for one-handed offline play, it's a perfect fit for whenever you have a free minute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round you need to build 3 poker hands so that weaker poker hands are placed on top of stronger ones. With 6 cards to choose from, you have plenty of interesting options every turn. Unused cards persist between rounds so every choice matters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get lucky and score tons of points for stronger combinations on higher levels, or fight for survival with bare pairs. It wouldn't be a poker game without luck involved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was heavily inspired by Chinese Poker with its many variants (especially Open Face Chinese Poker and Pineapple) and mobile puzzle games, like Threes, 2048 and Merged&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
