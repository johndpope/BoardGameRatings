							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High School Musical 3 Prom Night Game</name>
									
			<description>Card game that uses similar mechanics to Uno and Whot but adds a slight twist with the Action Card choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature three areas, one of which must be matched to be able to play a card. The choices are numbers, suits or Action symbols. The cards have numbers and suits because you could use the deck to play traditional card games. If you cannot play a legal card, then you draw another card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action Symbols allow the player to make a special action. Most of them you get to choose who is affected rather than the traditional way of the effect being forced on the next player to your left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has used all his cards, of course after he/she has remembered to shout out &amp;quot;High School Musical&amp;quot; when they are down to just one card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
