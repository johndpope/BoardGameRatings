							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magro Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box &amp;quot;The International shipping game for 3 to 6 players. You win The Magro Game by becoming the wealthiest shipowner afloat. Which is far from easy. To prosper in this game you'll have to be successful at outbidding your opponents for the most lucrative cargoes, quick at working out the most profitable routes, and adroit at running your fleet in the most efficient way. None of which is very far removed from the real thing. But then, that's what The Magro Game is all about.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
