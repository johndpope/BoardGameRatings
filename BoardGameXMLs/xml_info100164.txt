							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Amazing State Race Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>This trivia game is an auto race across the continental U.S. by answering questions about the states. The game board poster, about 19&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot;, is a map of the U.S. with color coded paths for 4 roadsters. A correct answer advances your race car one point along the route.  An incorrect answer keeps the cars stationary until next turn.  The first race car to reach the end of the route (answering 10 state trivia questions correctly) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can develop the game further by creating your own flashcard questions about the states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 1 foldout game board, 4 game pieces, 48 state trivia cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
