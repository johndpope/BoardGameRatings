							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turbino</name>
									
			<description>Turbino is a spellbinding new blowing game. It's easy to blow the propeller into motion, but its not easy to control it to stop at a specific square. The game contains 2 picture circles with different degrees of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to blow the propeller and also stop it (You can't touch it!) so that the arrow points a picture You don't have already. Then You may put Your rubber ring next to this picture. Player who first gets his rubber rings next to&lt;br/&gt;every picture on the cirle wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
