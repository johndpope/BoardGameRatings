			<description>This expansion is included in the second edition of the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war for the crown has not yet ceased ... not even when the sun goes down. While the war rages on during the day, both princes and their armies hope to catch the other unawares under the blanket of darkness, when all is thought to be quiet on the field. However, both sides have come well prepared, going through lengths to recruit special units to surprise their enemy, including a Phantom to cloak itself in the darkness and capture the King and Heirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From our popular deck-building game, For the Crown, comes the first expansion, Cover of Night, introducing a new range of units, and an additional Sovereign, to pit against your opponent. Can you strategize your units wisely on the dark battlefield? Find out if you have what it takes to effectively conquer the kingdom under the Cover of Night!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note, the For the Crown Expansion Kit 1: Cover of Night is not a &amp;lsquo;stand alone&amp;rsquo; game. You must own a copy of For the Crown to use this expansion kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 2 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each unit represents a brave fighter on the chessboard of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    42 double-sided 3/4&amp;quot; unit counters&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    40 deck-building cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    One page full color Rules sheet (Player Aid included)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
