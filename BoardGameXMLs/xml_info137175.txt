							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Backgammon: Zombie Rush</name>
									
			<description>A zombie themed expansion for Backgammon that gives the game a hectic feel and lends it some unpredictability due to there being an AI element present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For people familiar with backgammon the game is really easy to get into due to the many similarities in the base rule set. The big difference comes when a checker is captured. Instead of just returning where they came from, they turn into zombies, roaming the board controlled by a set of rules out of the players control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save your survivors before they get turned against you by bringing them all into your safe house. But be careful, as long as there are survivors left outside no one is safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When both players have all their survivors (or what's left of them), the player with the most survivors win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
