							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dunce</name>
									
			<description>The Dunce game is similar to Jumbolino, only in reverse. In Jumbolino players roll dice to be the first to construct a figure. In &amp;quot;Dunce,&amp;quot; players spin a teetotum that has pictures of the dunce pieces as well as a lucky horseshoe pic. If a player puts together the whole dunce (stool, body, head, and cap - in that order), he/she is eliminated from the game; the winner is the last eliminated. The box also lists Rules for Teenagers and Adults, saying that they can play the old game of &amp;quot;Ghost&amp;quot; by adding letters to a word, with the player who completes the word having to add a part to his toy dunce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The die has six sides. Two stools, one body, one head, one dunce's cap, and a lucky horseshoe. You have to assemble the body in order. If you get the lucky horseshoe then you skip a turn, but all your opponents have to put on their next body part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also similar to ScareCrow, which also has players building a figure in order, except that in that game the player who finishes first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
