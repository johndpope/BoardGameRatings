			<description>From the official website (translated from Dutch)&lt;br/&gt;Visit the ports and win! &lt;br/&gt;In the game, up to six players on a star shaped board, try as first player to visit all six Dutch ports. this can be done over land or water. Along the way the players must answer questions and can save for a bigger ship or a permit. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;But that's not without a struggle. Players can encounter, severe turbulence, a license check by the water police, vehicle breakdown or they have to wait for an open bridge. After the purchase of a ship, all ports can be visited by water. The ports can also be visited overland, but that is dangerous because other players can tag you  on the ring dike. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The player who first collects all the port tokens, wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explanation for non-Dutch visitors&lt;br/&gt;In the Netherlands you must have a Sail License (Dutch: Vaarbewijs) if you want to sail a sailboat longer than 15 meter or a motorboat whose speed can exceed 20 km/h. &lt;br/&gt;There are two types of license.&lt;br/&gt;With Sail License 1 you may sail the numerous rivers, canals and small lakes of the Netherlands&lt;br/&gt;With Sail License 2 you may sail the big lakes, sea arms and inland seas.&lt;br/&gt;To get such a license you have to take an official exam, which quizzes you on traffic rules, navigation, boat handling  and the dangers  on the water. This game tries to teach some of those rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
