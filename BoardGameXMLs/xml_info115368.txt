							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spin-A-Word</name>
									
			<description>Children's game, aimed at improving their spelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, the player spins the spinner and this will indicate two letters. He writes them down and, if it is the very first turn, he spins again and notes two more letters. If he can now make a word, using the letters, he tells the other players and he scores some points. If he cannot make a word, he passes. When it is his turn again, he spins the spinner but only once now, and gets two more letters. The longer the word, the more points. The first to score 30 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
