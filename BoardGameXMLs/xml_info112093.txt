							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">National Park</name>
									
			<description>In this game, you are managing a fictional National Park in the U.S.  your goal is to build improvements into the park that attract more visitors.  Unfortunately, more visitors bring more problems and nature is always trying to reclaim the land.  Every round you will build you park and accrue visitor points, while one of your opponent's will take nature's revenge and another opponent will play the unruly visitors who will damage the park.  At the end of every year, a visitor assessment is performed for each of the improvement categories and the number of visitor points you have accumulated in each category  that will come to your park the following year are assigned.  This is also the number of improvement points that you will receive that year to improve your park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the last round, you tally up all of the visitor points you have accrued and receive bonuses for having the majority in each category.  Highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
