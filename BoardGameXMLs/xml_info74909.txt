							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gnome Race</name>
									
			<description>It is that time of year again when all the gnome villages in the big magical forest get ready to send their top team to the gnome race. It is a dangerous challenge where the gnomes have to race on their tricycles through the ancient and mysterious forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However the ancient forest is also the home of the wizards and if there is one thing they hate, it is noisy and crazy racing gnomes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will represent your village with a racing team that is composed of 1 big slow gnome and 2 fast tiny gnomes. Can you bring victory to your city by being the first to get your entire racing team to the finish?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Face the spells of the wizards and find enough gold to buy better spells. Magic is not an exact science so you will never be sure of the outcome of a spell. It might be wise to shelter under the sacred trees and use amulets to protect yourself.You can move in any direction, drive your opponents off the road or be driven off the road yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board changes as the game progresses, can you use this to your advantage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to move around the board, play spells from their hands to change the board, foil opponents plans and get more gold. The winner is the first player to get his entire team across the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
