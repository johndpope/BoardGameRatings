			<description>Let's Go To McDonald's Game is a child's game. Players race along a colorful track to be the first to reach McDonald's. The game teaches color recognition and matching, turn taking, and fair play. Each player controls a &amp;quot;Happy Meal Toy&amp;quot; character (Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, The Hamburgler, and of course, Ronald McDonald himself) and advance along the path avoiding obstacles such as a duck crossing, an open manhole, a skunk, and a broken fire hydrant. Randomly placed tiles along the way will either send you forward or backwards on the path because as the game itself states, &amp;quot;Anything can happen on the way to McDonald's!&amp;quot; The first player to reach the Golden Arches is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
