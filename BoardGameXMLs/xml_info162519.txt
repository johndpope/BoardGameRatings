			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TigerFox is a maze game in which the player tries to catch the fox while avoiding the tiger.  The fox moves slower than the player and leaves a trail behind, the player can move in the cardinal directions but must use a turn to physically change directions, and the tiger will always moves along the shortest route to the player at a similar speed as the player.  There are wraparound exits that all creatures may use as well as &amp;quot;dotted&amp;quot; doors that only the player may use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TigerFox was created in 1984 for the HP palmtop computer but was only ported to DOS in 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
