			<description>The time is: 1630 hrs., 15 June 1815...The Imperial Guard light cavalry of Lefebvre-Desnottes encountered the Nassau infantry of Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. The Duke had taken the initiative to move one of his two regiments south from the vital crossroads of Quatre-Bras, in the rolling countryside of Flanders, to delay the lead elements of the French advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The French horsemen found the village of Frasnes occupied by a regiment of 1500 Orange-Nassau infantry. The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, altering the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French. No one suspected that on such decisions hinged the last moments of glory for Napoleon and his Grande Armee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Campaign plus Ligny-Quatre Bras and Waterloo scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Based on the Six Days of Glory game system&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Introductory game&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One 22 x 34&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 280 two-sided units&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Gamers' Choice Awards Best Historical Simulation Game Nominee 2000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME SYSTEM: DAYS System = 1,600m/hex, 800-1,000 men/SP, 6 hours/turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
