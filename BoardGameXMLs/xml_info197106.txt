Several Apex cards in this species deck allow players to bring multiple cards from their discard pile into play when playing a single card from their hand or Ambush spot.  Additionally, there is a high Hunt point reward for this deck when cards are played from the Ambush spot.  There is also a unique Apex ability that will flush out more prey into the Hunt Trail to be taken down by your ferocious pack of death-lizards.  This deck also adds the long fan-awaited Stegosaurus Big Game; a large and formidable prey that will punish you if you botch an Ambush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
