			<description>An angling game, where players try to catch fish with magnetic fishing rods. On each turn, players are allowed to catch one fish only - if multiple fish &amp;quot;bite&amp;quot; on your rod, they have to be thrown back. The player who caught the most valuable fish wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Gone Fishin' (perhaps an earlier version?), but without the junk you can fish up and this has a much shallower pond to fish from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
