			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nordriki, the northern kingdom of the land of Mithgarthr, has been relatively free of dragons for hundreds of years, but recently the locals have been reporting sightings of red, white, and green dragons all throughout the Drekiberg mountains to the north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a green dragon has taken up residence in an abandoned mine that is close to the city of Valdhum. The surrounding land is rich with wildlife for the beast to feed on, and the lair it has chosen is well protected and secluded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mines of Valdhum is an exciting adventure for 6 or so PCs of levels 5-7, written for the fifth edition of the world's most famous RPG.
