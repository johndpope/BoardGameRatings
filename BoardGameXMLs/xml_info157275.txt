							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Collectors Battlefield Wargaming System: D-Day â€“ Battle of Carentan</name>
									
			<description>This is the first module of the Collector's Battlefield Wargaming System, a 'turn key' quick play set of rules with a full line of 28mm prepainted figures and vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CB: Carentan is a skirmish level miniatures wargame- that is, it represents combat at its most basic level of fighting: man to man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CB:Carentan puts the player in the role of an infantry squad or platoon leader.  Firefights break out in 'mad minutes', followed by lulls where the player exercises leadership by rallying troops, bringing in reserves, and maneuvering his troops to set up for the next firefight.  Firefights center on the machine gun- placement of your MG42's and .30cals are crucial to glorious success or ignominious defeat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: &lt;br/&gt;1 figure = 1 soldier or vehicle&lt;br/&gt;1 inch = 2 yards&lt;br/&gt;1 turn = approximately 30 seconds&lt;br/&gt;Combat Lull = 2 to 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping track of units stats is made easy with quick reference cards included with every pack, detailing the capabilities of every squad, leader, heavy weapon and vehicle.  Squad level games are fast and furious, taking about 60 minutes to an hour and half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
