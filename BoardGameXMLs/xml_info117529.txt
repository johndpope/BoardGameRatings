			<description>In Count Me In! &amp;ndash; aka, 1, 2, 3 ... ganz viele! (&amp;quot;1, 2, 3 ... lots!&amp;quot;) &amp;ndash; players work together to try to lay down cards in the right order. If they complete two rows of ten cards each, they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, shuffle the deck of fifty cards &amp;ndash; five cards each with numbers 1-10, with ten different images appearing as pips on the cards: horseshoes, mushrooms, springs, and so on &amp;ndash; and deal five cards to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player must lay down a card, if possible. Cards must be laid in numerical order, so the first card in a row must be 1, the second card 2, and so on. At the same time, the same image cannot be placed into a row twice. If a player can legally play a card, she does so, then draws a replacement from one of the two draw stacks; if she can't, she lays a card aside out of the game, then draws a new card. (The cards have color-coded icons on their backs &amp;ndash; red, blue, etc. &amp;ndash; which can aid players in deciding which card to draw.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the players create two rows of cards numbered 1-10 before both decks run out and they can't play any more cards, they win; if not, they lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A competitive variant is included in 1, 2, 3 ... ganz viele! with players taking cards numbered 1-7 from two colors (e.g., red and blue), then laying them out in two rows. On a turn, a player turns over one of the number 1 cards, then one of the number 2s, and so on. If she reveals a card that shows an image already present on a card revealed earlier, her turn ends and she flips all cards face-down again. If a player reveals cards numbered 1-7 without revealing matching images, she wins the round. The first player to win three rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
