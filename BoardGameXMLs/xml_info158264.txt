							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Man vs. Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>Man vs. Apocalypse has 2 decks, the Scrounging Deck, and the Apocalypse Deck. The scrounging deck contains all the people and items you will need to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Apocalypse deck contains the disasters and the Apocalypses themselves, at the end of the every round one of these cards will be reveled and have to be dealt with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the Man vs. Apocalypse you and your friends will draw up to a full hand(5) of cards from the Scrounging Deck. You can play as many cards as you want from your hand on your turn, but be warned, if you run out of cards in your hand you are killed and have lost the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you play these cards, each survivor have special abilities that can help you, some will provide you some defense vs. a specific disaster, other may bring a useful skill, some are only useful for a time, before they must be sacrificed for the greater good(You).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn a player will draw 2 cards,(no more then 5 in hand) and be place in play as many as he wants.  Once all players have gone you draw from the Apocalypse Deck, these cards will force you to discard your survivors in play, discard cards from your hand or create other chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all players have dealt with the Disaster that was drawn, the play starts with the first player again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to survive to the end of the Apocalypse deck, only then can you begin to rebuild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
