			<description>From the box: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Not only speed counts at the steeple-chase, it mainly demands skills. Only the one who jumps over the fences safely and manages to sidestep the other obstacles is the winner. A game of skills for 2-4 players where the horse tokens have to be flipped through the show jumping course.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A steeple-chase course is created using the 2 pieces of string supplied. 5 high obstacles, on bases, are placed at regular intervals around the course. 10 ground obstacles are arranged between these. 16 horse show tokens are placed in the middle of the course and the horse figure to the side. This is the starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes 1 small and one large coloured horse token (with horse sticker on) and placing the large token on the supplied piece of felt, uses the small token to try and flick his horse around the course, following the flicking rules laid out. As soon as you successfully complete the course you may take a horse shoe token from the middle. First player to collect 3 horse shoe tokens is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nice components. Neat, portable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
