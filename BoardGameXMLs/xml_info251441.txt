			<description>an&amp;middot;tin&amp;middot;o&amp;middot;my noun&lt;br/&gt;(A contradiction between two beliefs or conclusions that are in themselves reasonable; a paradox)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twisted time travelers are at it again! At least I think it&amp;rsquo;s happening again... It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell with all this chaos rippling throughout the timeline! They seek the power of the Paradox Crystals, but think of the consequences! No mere mortal should wield that much control over the time stream continuum!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antinomy is a head to head battle of wits as 2 competing time travelers zip through the past and future in search of powerful Paradox Crystals. Play a single card from your hand using the color or symbol to dive into the past, or use the number to fly into the future. The card you land on gets swapped with the card you played allowing you to build up a winning hand.  Wherever you go, clever card play and a set of 3-of-a-kind cause antinomies forming crystals of your own. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it will probably be fine. Or confront your opponent in a Time Clash to wrest control of their crystals. Collecting 5 of these crystals will ensure your control over space and time. Do you have what it takes to wield the power of Antinomy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
