Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystical Seed of Courage was supposed to be released several months after its prequels and would have featured Farore as its oracle, and was originally set to be centered around time travel and puzzles concerning the time of day. It was scrapped due to problems in the debugging process with how all three games interacted with one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
