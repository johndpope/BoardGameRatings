			<description>Each of the two players is a captain of a team.  The team is represented by 11 wood units with a peg on them where a wood ball may sit.  The soccer field is represented by circle spaces for movement.  The active player rolls 2d6 to determine movement allowed.  Movement allowance is spread out as desired between your players and determined by whether a player has the ball or not.  It's all very simple, but works fantastic!   Currently out of print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
