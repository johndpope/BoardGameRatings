			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landmark is an massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Landmark is being developed alongside EverQuest Next by Sony Online Entertainment. The original name of the game was EverQuest Next Landmark, but that switched to simply Landmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landmark does not have quests, or even wandering monsters, although player-characters can be &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; by falling or drowning. &amp;quot;Death&amp;quot; will return the player-character to the central hub. From there, the player can either choose to create a travel shard or can walk back to the home claim. Currently, the player's primary focus is on collecting materials and building a home or fortress. Traveling through the game landscape reveals an amazing number of creative buildings, sculptures and more. The player must collect copper to pay rent on the land, or use real money to purchase station cash to pay for the claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Landmark (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
