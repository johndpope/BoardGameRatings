			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most adventures involve getting to the absolute bottom of a dungeon, blithely swinging hammers andswords through warriors and civilians, pillaging and looting along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure inverts the traditional model: The adventurers easily run through a surprisingly unpopulated goblin warren and then get struck with amnesia at the very bottom. They know their identities, skills and class abilities but have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s happened over the past several days. Players must fight their way out of the dungeon through increasingly threatening encounters, culminating in a &amp;ldquo;boss&amp;rdquo; battle as they hit the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed to be system agnostic, but would be ideal for an old&amp;shy;school system played bv a group of players familiar with new&amp;shy; school RPG systems. The difficulty is suitable for level 1 or 2 characters and would work well as a kickoff adventure for a campaign, since you don't have to awkwardly handwaive that &amp;quot;so you're all in a room&amp;quot; thing that usually happens at the start of a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
