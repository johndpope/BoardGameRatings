			<description>The aim of Hearsay is to identify personalities, television programs, movies and songs from the &amp;quot;Hearsay&amp;quot; clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great game in which you can hear what you're saying but not necessarily say what you are hearing!&lt;br/&gt;Clues lead to answers which individually are merely words - put them together however and they take on a whole new meaning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if you solve the clues within the time limit you might still fail to put them together and give the correct solution. What is certain is that your opponents will revel in your struggle and doubtless be highly amused at you being so near but so far- particularly if they have already worked it out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example of a hearsay round is...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The category is T.V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your clues are:-&lt;br/&gt;1) Scottish word for small.&lt;br/&gt;2) Fondness or affection&lt;br/&gt;3) Castle&lt;br/&gt;4) Female Sheep&lt;br/&gt;5) Sound of the 14th letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answers to the clues are:-&lt;br/&gt;Wee - Love - Fort - &amp;quot;N&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Answer = &amp;quot;Wheel of Fortune&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 x playing board&lt;br/&gt;200 x &amp;quot;Hearsay&amp;quot; Cards (800 x Challenges)&lt;br/&gt;40 x Category Tiles&lt;br/&gt;1 x sixty-second timer&lt;br/&gt;1 x Cone&lt;br/&gt;6 x Pawns&lt;br/&gt;1 x Dice&lt;br/&gt;1 x Score Pad&lt;br/&gt;2 x Note Pads&lt;br/&gt;6 x Pencils&lt;br/&gt;1 x Rules Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was exclusively developed and designed for WH Smith by Games Talk.
