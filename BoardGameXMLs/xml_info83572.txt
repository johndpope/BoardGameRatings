			<description>From the Guide's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Eos Event Guide for our first event - Encounter at Archway. Here you will find all the necessary information in relation to the site and everything else specific to the weekend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in your booking pack should be the following items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     DVD/CD&lt;br/&gt;     Rules Guide&lt;br/&gt;     Creature Guide&lt;br/&gt;     Event Guide&lt;br/&gt;     Lore Sheets(s)&lt;br/&gt;     Ticket&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any of these items are missing then please contact us immediately and we will do our best to rectify the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter at Archway is a new adventure for all of us, as this will be the first game of the new Eos live role-playing system. I started writing Eos more than two years ago and it has undergone a lot of editing and revision in both the rules guide that you may already have seen, the creature guides and the other campaign documents we have written to add depth to the game. To me, that's the acid test of any live role-playing system; when you scratch at the surface, you hope to find hidden layers to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our aim is to offer you an entertaining role-playing experience that makes you want to come back for more. Eos is the game I have always wanted to run and that I have huge of enthusiasm for working on, I hope you enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, I have to offer some thanks to all the people who have helped me put this game together. From early rules ideas to surviving the mid summer heat on the hilltop when filming &amp;quot;The Broken Sword&amp;quot; to the proof reading and cajoling me to keep working on the rules and campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular thanks have to go to Stuart, Lisa and my partner Karen, who've put up with my hermit like existence chained to this computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
