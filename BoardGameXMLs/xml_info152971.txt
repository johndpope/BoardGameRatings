			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darth Vader is on the rise, and it's up to you to take him down along with his henchpigs! Can you send your General Grievous, Darth Maul, Count Dooku and Emperor Palpatine pig figures crashing down, along with their Darth Vader head? Send your Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker and Yoda bird figures flying at the dastardly Imperial piggies with the Lightsaber launcher! Take turns launching birds to knock off the pigs, or play solo and try to knock off all the pigs with the fewest shots. Blast those Star Wars pigs for the high-flying win in the Rise of Darth Vader game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, lock the pieces of Darth Vader's head together, slot the numbered pieces into the proper positions, then place everything in the plastic stand. Players take turns shooting the three birds figures at Darth Vader, claiming any pigs they knock down. Whoever claims the most pigs wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing alone, challenge yourself to see how many shots are needed to defeat all of the pigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
