			<description>A memory game to frazzle the mind, a cross between memory game and rummy. 60 tactile counters, in 4 bright colours, numbered from 1-13, and 8 black counters can be used as anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn the counters face down and shuffle them around, arrange in a grid of 6 rows and 10 columns for easier play, leave random for harder play, suitable for 2+ players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player turns over 3 counters of their choice, and the aim is to make a run of three consecutive numbers in the same colour, or a set of three numbers the same. If the numbers do not make a set or run, the counters are turned back over face down and the next player choices three counters to turn over, to make a set or a run. If a player turns over three counters making a set or a run, they take these from the middle and place them face up by themselves, and this gives them a score. The black counters have no numerical value, but can be used as anything to make up sets and runs with the other counters turned in a go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more counters you can rumemba which have been played, the greater your ability to make runs and sets. The counters all score for face value, and each player adds up the total number of points they have from the sets and runs they have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
