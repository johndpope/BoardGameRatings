			<description>The exciting game of Biblical knowledge. The game is similar to Trivial Pursuit in which you roll the dice and move your piece around the board acquiring &amp;quot;pieces&amp;quot; of the Armour of God. Once you have answered the Biblical questions correctly and acquired the six pieces of the Armor of God, you can move towards the center of the board to win the game by landing on the Circle of Victory and correctly answering a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are divided into 5 categories: &amp;quot;Quotations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Unbelievers &amp;amp; Believers&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Events&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Saviour&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Towns, Places &amp;amp; Objects&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you can obtain a piece of the Armor of God, you have to obtain 2 Character Points.  You get one Character Point for each correctly answered question. Each player must gain two character points before he may attempt to obtain additional pieces of the Armor of God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
