							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King Khan &amp; BBQ Game</name>
									
			<description>It probably has been many years since you could buy a 12&amp;quot; vinyl record and get a game with it, but with the 2008 reissue of rock and roll band the King Khan &amp;amp; BBQ Show's d&amp;eacute;but album, you get a free game called 'the King Khan &amp;amp; BBQ Game'. The board and rules come inside the gatefold LP, and there is a sheet with 'Diary Cards' and 'Dream Cards', that you can cut out if you're that kind of person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game states that the object of the game is 'To make all your dreams come true by collecting the most hours spent out on dates in a week'. The game is roll and move, and on the board there are spaces where you can end up on a date, stood up or get a 'Dutch Treat'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components required to play that do not come with the game: dice, playing piece, poker chips in 4 different colours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
