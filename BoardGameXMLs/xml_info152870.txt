							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ogre: Nightfall Sponsored Counter Sheets</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Ogre: Nightfall&amp;quot; consists of three exclusive counter sheets compatible with Ogre Designer's Edition and a 16-page booklet of new scenarios that form a linked campaign to determine the fate of the world. Play a desperate humanity trying to stop the Ogre uprising or the cruel unstoppable rogue Ogres themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes an entirely new rogue Ogre faction including an exclusive black Mark III, Mark IV and Mark V Ogre available nowhere else. But it also includes a black AI controlled train, black AI laser towers and turrets, black AI control center, exclusive civilian counters, blue armor reinforcements and more! These counter sheets are designed by Steve Jackson Games, printed by the same company using the same processes as the counters included in the main box set so they are 100% compatible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product will be a limited edition and no more than several thousand will ever be made. Once they are gone, they are gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of January 2015, Steve Jackson Games has resumed control of this product. Counter sheets are available directly from them, and they have stated they are working on a PDF of the rules / scenarios booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Do NOT attempt to order from Fire Mountain Games. The product was taken back by Steve Jackson Games after multiple failures on the part of FMG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
