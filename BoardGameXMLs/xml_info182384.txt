			<description>The players have to save the coloured mice from the cat.&lt;br/&gt;The mice are placed randomly on the board. After time to memorize theirs positions the mice are covered by hats. At the border of the board there are coloured holes. The players have to  move the hats with the mice under it to the hole with the same color as the mouse has. If the color fits the player gets one point, if not the cat captures this mouse.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is at most one, captured mouse. The player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
