			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quick and easy campaign game for the Crusades period in the Byzantine Empire, including map, counters, and miniatures interface for our &amp;quot;Ironbow&amp;quot; rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, the game is leader driven- good leaders get things done, while poor ones are a hindrance. Counters representing every troop type are here, including Turkish Ghulam heavy cavalry, Turkomen horse archers, light and heavy infantry, Byzantine Cataphracts, Norman and Varangian mercenaries, Petchenegs, everyone. It comes with a battle board so you don't have to stop the game for every battle if you don't want to, but the troops convert directly into &amp;quot;Ironbow&amp;quot; units for those of you who want to play miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a web-published game that is FREE to download and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
