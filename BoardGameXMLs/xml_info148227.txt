			<description>Triple Ha! is the game of cardboard credit rating agencies. Introduce yourself in the big circus involving states, rating agency and crisis phenomena!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes charge of a State and starts with a more or less average (of course, Italy is worse off than Germany to start) notation. The State card is used to record scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, one of the states plays the role of the CRA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CRA chooses a Crisis card among the first three on the top of the pile and puts the States to the test:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) CRA requests States an estimate of a real quantified data. The more a state is mistaken, the lower its rating will fall...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) CRA suggests a crazy imitation on the subject of the Crisis card. The most convincing State may increase its rating by three grades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 9 turns (about 30 minutes), the game ends and the State with the best rating will be declared &amp;quot;Survivor of the Crisis.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Triple HA!&amp;quot; is both informative and humorous and deliberately shifting between tragedy and comedy, in order to discuss the crisis without over-dramatization. This game will lighten up your evenings even when the CAC 40 is down 1.15%!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
