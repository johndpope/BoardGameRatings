			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;捕込 (Tokkome) is a facility where semi-farmed wild horses were captured and picked as military horses in Edo period of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokkome is a card game with a theme of horse-capturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card is numbered from 1 to 7, and depicts that many horses. There are two piles players can play cards on: Tokkome and Maki. Each turn, you may play one or three cards on top of either pile if the cards being played can form a sequence with the top card of the pile, or take all cards from Tokkome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After taking all cards from Tokkome, if you have three cards of the same number, you discard them and score victory points, but taking all cards is risky because it increases your cards in hand, which you have to get rid of. Afterwards, all cards in the Maki pile go to Tokkome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player gets rid of all their cards in hand, each other player loses victory points for their remaining cards in hand, and the highest scorer wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;「捕込」は野馬を捕まえつつ手札を減らすゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;ただし、野馬を捕まえる際に余計な手札も増えてしまいます。&lt;br/&gt;いかに無駄なく野馬を捕まえられるかが悩ましいゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
