			<description>In Starship Battles, each player commands a starship and seeks to destroy his opponents. The game ends after one player has completely destroyed all of his opponents&amp;rsquo; ship compartments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships are customized at the start of the game, then face off against each other. The compartments each ship has are up to the players, who must strike a balance between offense, defense, repairability, and command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game by drawing ship compartment cards from the deck. Each ship compartment can take a certain amount of damage before it is destroyed. When a ship compartment is destroyed, it is discarded. Part of the strategy of Starship Battles lies in how one chooses to manage battle damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the turns progress, players attack one another using their weapons, defend themselves using their shields, change their attacks or defends using command points, and repair damage using engineering capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
