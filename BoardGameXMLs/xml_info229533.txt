			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witches and Wyverns is a fantasy roleplaying game in the spirit of the Old School Revival movement. Based on the direct predecessor of The Original Roleplaying Game, Witches and Wyverns is meant to take you back to the olden days. Nowadays RPGs are all unicorns and faeries. In Witches and Wyverns, combat is bloody and swift and monsters are deadly and mysterious. In this homage to the days of old, you will pick up your blood-stained sword and shield and adventure in the chance that you will gain gold and fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Witches and Wyverns, all you need to play are two six-sided dice, this book, and a sense of imagination. No fancy polyhedral dice, no grid, nothing but two dice and this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
