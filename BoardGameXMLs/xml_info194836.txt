			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in the game control two personas - a doctor and a patient.  The patient is the primary character.  Characters in the game have a name, a song, and a diagnosed mental illness - the game includes a list derived from a medical dictionary.  The character's &amp;quot;song&amp;quot; is a secret five-word song, or description, of the character's self.  It obsessively runs through the character's mind.  Characters have three Attributes - Blood, Psyche, and Volcano.  Blood and Psyche are, in many ways, opposite sides of a tug-of-war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a text-based character sheet, notable for having two &amp;quot;characters&amp;quot; on the sheet.  The game also was published as a formatted PDF on the author's personal site (this does not appear currently to be available, however).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
