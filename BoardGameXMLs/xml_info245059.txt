			<description>Earworm is a party game for people who love music, and it's suited for groups of all shapes and sizes and can be played anywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have thirty seconds to vocalize a song to their team using any sound they can muster up with one rule: you can't use any lyrics! Players can play in a stress-free &amp;quot;Party Mode&amp;quot; or decide to get competitive and go &amp;quot;On Tour&amp;quot; to see who is the most worthy of rock stardom! We designed the game with two modes of play so people of all ages and skill levels would be able to join in on the fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
