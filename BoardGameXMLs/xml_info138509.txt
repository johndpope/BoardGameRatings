			<description>City of Fortune is a combination of role selection and worker placement game with a hint of map building.  Players take turns selecting roles and placing buildings to collect resources which can be used to gain points based on the roles that were selected.  Roles change every round, so the game is constantly changing.  There's very little luck involved, which makes this game a deep strategic masterpiece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
