							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Take Your Pick II</name>
									
			<description>Take Your Pick II is the third title in SimplyFun's Take Your Pick series of party games, which gets each player to challenge his knowledge of fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round one player is the subject; each other player is dealt three cards. Each card shows two words or phrases on it &amp;ndash; Fried / Grilled? Do it Yourself / Pay for Labor? &amp;ndash; with one word or phrase circled on the top half of the card, and the other word/phrase circled on the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn the cards so that the phrase you feel most matches the subject on each card is on the top, then stack the cards with the phrase you feel the subject would most likely agree feel describes herself in the front. Players take turns reading their chosen phrases to the subject. If the subject agrees that a phrase describes her, you score a point and move on the next card in hand; if not, you're through for the round. Play as many rounds as the number of players, and whoever scores the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
