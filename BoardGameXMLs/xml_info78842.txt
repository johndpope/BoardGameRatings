							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Luring Royalty</name>
									
			<description>Royalty are scattered about the provinces and you, as queen, bring them to your kingdom. Gather up resources to lure in the nobles before your rivals do the same. The kingdom with the most prestige will rule the provinces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luring Royalty is a card game, requiring 2 standard decks of playing cards, for two to four players.  The four jokers and one suit per player are used (eg. in a 3 player game, one suit of cards is removed so that you have just three suits).  The cards are split into a Resource deck (Aces and 2-10) and a Royalty deck (Jacks, Queens, Kings, Jokers).  Each player selects a suit and starts the game with a queen of that suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three royalty cards are always available and each royalty card will have up to 7 resource cards in its row.  The rightmost resource card may be added to a player's hand for free and other resource cards and royalty cards may be picked up by paying 2 resources per card to the right of the card being purchased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the royalty draw pile is expired, the game ends and players compare total prestige points.  Points are earned as follows: 1 Point per Resource card of your suit; 1 Point for the 1st Jack; 2 Points per Queen; 3 Points per King; 4 Points per Joker; 6 Points per 2nd, 3rd, ... Jack; +4 Points per Queen &amp;amp; King of same suit; +1 point per Two Jacks of the same suit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luring Royalty was designed and created for the Design Contest Entries: Traditional Card Games for Two Players run by Sean Ross (I).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 2 Rules Update (2010): Changed King/Queen bonus from +3 to +4&lt;br/&gt;Version 3 Rules Update (2012): Use 2 resource cards with the same number for a purchase value of 12&lt;br/&gt;Version 4 Rules Update (2016): Added Two Jacks of same suit bonus of +1; Allow gaining rightmost resource card for free with resource cards purchase&lt;br/&gt;Version 5 Rules Update (2017): Players start with Queens instead of Kings; Changed 2nd, 3rd, ...
