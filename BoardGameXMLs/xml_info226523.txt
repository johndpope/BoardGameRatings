			<description>z3r0d4y &amp;mdash; a.k.a. Zero Day, a.k.a. ゼロデイ &amp;mdash; is a competitive game played with one admin facing off against 1-3 hackers. The admin aims to fix vulnerabilities in a computer system before hackers steal too much information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The admin wins by acquiring a certain number of progress tokens based on the number of players, and to make progress, the admin must perform &amp;quot;operations&amp;quot; multiple times successfully while avoiding interference from hackers. To do so, the admin will rely on timing and must secure sufficient credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hacker wants to steal information before others can do so (and before the admin fixes the vulnerability, of course), and once a hacker steals a certain amount of information tokens, they win the game immediately. To do this, they need to gather information, interfere with the admin's operation, and install virus proxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
