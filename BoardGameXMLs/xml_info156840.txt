			<description>You are the rich owner of a large field near New York where health needs are more important. Your goal is to build the most efficient hospital in three dimensions in order to get the most popularity. You will manage the construction of the building from scratch as well as the installation of new services and the recruitment of the best doctors, nurses and administrative staff that align with the arrival of new patients. You will also be attentive to the well-being of patients and not forget that time is also money when competing with neighboring hospitals...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn in Clinic, players take three actions &amp;mdash; building in different modules; hosting patients; hiring doctors, nurses and staff &amp;mdash; by playing one card. Each cube that enters the clinic comes with a car that needs to be parked, leaving less space for the hospital being constructed! During the game, you'll move patients, doctors, nurses, and staff in the 3D structure as efficiently as you can in order to save time, with doctors and nurses tending to patients as long as their colors (indicating both training and illness) match. By taking care of patients you receive money, which lets you pay fees, salaries and maintenance as well as buy popularity points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During an administrative phase, uncared for patients grow sicker, new patients enter the pre-admission room, doctors become less knowledgable about the diseases they face, and new doctors and nurses become available from their schools. In the end, the player with the most popularity points and least time spent during the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
