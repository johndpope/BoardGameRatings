							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Auction</name>
									
			<description>Animal Auction includes 32 cards that show eight different animals, with four cards each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, the players each receive 10 tokens, with which they can bid for animal cards. The players bid for three cards at a time. If you win an auction, you can distribute the three cards among all players, including yourself, as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the cards have been assigned to the players, all players except the winner share equally the tokens spent for the auction, leaving any remainder to be added to the jackpot of the next auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no more cards in the deck, at which point the winner is determined on the basis of the sets of cards in their possession: a set of four cards with the same animal scores 10 points, a three-card set scores 5 points, a two-card set scores 1 point, and single cards score -3 each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also four special cards: three jokers that can replace any animal, and a minus-joker that subtracts 5 points from the total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokens count 1 point each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
