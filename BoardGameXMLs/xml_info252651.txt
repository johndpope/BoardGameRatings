							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ZomBN1: Sewage Panic</name>
									
			<description>ZomBN1 Sewage Panic is the second of Bedsit Games' bagged mini-games, designed to be quick to play, easy to set up and very portable. A co-operative game for 1-4 players, Sewage Panic takes place inside Brighton's sewer network while the action of the main game rages in the streets above. Survivors must fight, scavenge and craft their way through ever-increasing waves of zombies. Can they survive until sunrise? This fold-out A3 board comes with rulebook, plastic playing pieces, 60 cards and even a bonus game on the back. Limited to 250 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;A co-operative game, players must work together to survive the zombie hordes. Players each get 2 actions per turn, which can be spent moving around the sewer base, fighting a zombie, scavenging for scraps, or crafting those scraps into survival tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a coloured pawn, which means they can attack any like-coloured tiles (so a red pawn can attack red tiles and so on), so some tactical manoeuvring is required to make the best use of fighting, scavenging and crafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some turns, players will come across equipment which can be added to what they manage to craft. Other turns an unfortunate event will occur, which can see zombies gaining in number, or survivors being hindered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have used their actions, all zombies on the board move one space towards the base, then more spawn depending on how many turns have been taken. The more turns, the more zombies will spawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a zombie reaches the base then the players have lost. If they make it through 20 turns then mop up any remaining zombies, then they have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NB: If you have a copy of ZomBN1: A Board Game All About Brighton, then you can use the components from that game to replace the standard plastic pieces with this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
