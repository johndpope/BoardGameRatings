			<description>Utsumi, the tourist town known for its scenic beauty, has a hidden face. Transmitted since ancient times, the tradition of the cursing ceremony called &amp;bdquo;Ushi-no-Koku-Mairi&amp;rdquo; (Ox-Hour Shrine-Visit) still persists, and the sound of hammer reverberates throughout the town at night. The curse accumulated in the land is summoning further calamities, and many tourist attractions are turning into haunted spots whirling with malice. People of unusual shapes cast their eyes upon the power of this curse, planning to get it for themselves. A suspicious chase for territory is about to begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving around the map of the town, wander from one spiritual spot to another, pursuing your rivals. Collect the negative energies scattered over the different places, and use your powers. When it comes to the crunch, play your trump cards. You can use them either to escape or to stop the ones pursuing you. If you catch up with a rival, you will have a chance for a surprise attack. If you succeed, you can snatch away their powers. If you can steal the powers from everyone before daybreak, the game ends, with you as the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
