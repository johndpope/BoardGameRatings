							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lords of the Leaves: Elven Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the Best Elf You Can Be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Majestic and graceful, ageless and wise, beautiful and terrible, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that can be said about elves. They are often praised for their close bonds with the natural world, and at the same time are responsible for breathtaking and beautiful feats of engineering in their glistening, artistic cities. They are masters of sword and bow, but also great adepts at magic. It seems like there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that an elves aren&amp;rsquo;t good at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, when you choose to make your player character an elf, all that you really care about is the +2 bonus to your Dexterity and Intelligence scores (and who needs Constitution, anyway?), so why bother playing an elven shaman or bard? Even if a +2 bonus doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make that much of a difference, it just feels so wrong to knowingly combine a race and class that don&amp;rsquo;t go well together, and, as a result, many players never bother to consider it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book aims to give players who want the fact that their character is an elf to matter more a way to make that happen, while also providing support for elven characters of a variety of classes that don&amp;rsquo;t typically make much mechanical sense for elves. Included are the elven berserker, a barbarian archetype that turns elves into more primal and savage warriors, the elven lyrist, a bard archetype that allows for classically-trained elves to perform with their skill and prowess instead of their charm and good looks, the willow blade, a fighter archetype that focuses on using the famed elven curve blade, the glade guardian, a ranger archetype for elven rangers who are a bit more in touch with the natural world than most, and the spirit speaker, a shaman archetype for elves in greater communion with the spirit world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
