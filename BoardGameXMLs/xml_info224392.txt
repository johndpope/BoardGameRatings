			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bastogne or Bust is a single-map, regimental treatment of the Battle of the Bulge. This is a PLAYER'S game! Designed on purpose to be more of a warGAME than a simulation. Referred to affectionately by wargamers as BOB, but the designer prefers the moniker  &amp;ldquo;The World's Finest Bulge Game.&amp;rdquo; It addresses a number of issues common to most Bulge games. Some of these issues include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     OFF BOARD MOVEMENT CHART [what happens to all those pieces that 'exit the map?']&lt;br/&gt;     STACKING POINTS [one of the greatest mechanics of all time - why don't designers use it more often?]&lt;br/&gt;     COMMAND &amp;amp; CONTROL [divisional bonuses for unit cohesiveness]&lt;br/&gt;     SUPPLY DIFFERENCES [different effects on ALLIES vs GERMANS]&lt;br/&gt;     INITIATIVE [essentially, the 5-1 column on the CRT is gone]&lt;br/&gt;     NO OVERRUN [squads held crossroads against regiments]&lt;br/&gt;     NO WEATHER RULES [weather is reflected in air support]&lt;br/&gt;     VON DER HYDTE [ALWAYS gets on the board]&lt;br/&gt;     STREAMLINED PLAY [I don't need water allocation points] &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what can you expect to be different in this new Designer's Edition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     about 8 counters will receive Road Bonus Movement status&lt;br/&gt;     a rule addition allows all Combat Engineer units to repair/construct bridges&lt;br/&gt;     one &amp;lsquo;errata&amp;rsquo; change line within the rulebook&lt;br/&gt;     An all new DEC 10 Tournament Scenario&lt;br/&gt;     30-40 additional counters&lt;br/&gt;     new German OOA&lt;br/&gt;     new Allied OOA&lt;br/&gt;     new Off Board Movement Chart with new Turn Record Track. One aspect being explored is to incorporate much of the Off Board Movement Chart onto the sides of the game board, rather similar to Off Map Displays used in Market-Garden games such as Hell&amp;rsquo;s Highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
