			<description>&amp;quot;Measles, the ultimate stacking games, combines the elements of balance, coordination and luck with strategy of attempting to outscore an opponent, or gain a scoring advantage of at least five points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components include 1 base tile and 29 wooden playing tiles.  Each playing tile has a pattern of red spots (measles) on its surface. Every measle is scored as one &amp;quot;spotpoint&amp;quot; following completion of a round of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 29 playing pieces also has 3 randomly drilled holes in it. This gives every playing tile a unique weight and balance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;...from the rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
