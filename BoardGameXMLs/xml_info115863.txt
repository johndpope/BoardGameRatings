							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&#039;Cocub&#039; The &#039;Cococubs&#039; Game</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game published by Cadbury's. It must have been quite expensive to make because it utilised three companies. Cadbury paid for the project. Britains, the world famous maker of toy soldiers, made the playing pieces. And De La Rue printed everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player may choose their favourite Cococub playing piece. During the game you should address yourself by his name.&lt;br/&gt;2. Each player starts from Mr. Pie Porker's garden (in the centre of the board). A player throws the die and moves along the track, the number thrown.&lt;br/&gt;3. The blue and black squares are penalties. The yellow squares are rewards.&lt;br/&gt;4. You cannot land on the same square as another Cococub. If that should happen, then you don't move at all for that turn.&lt;br/&gt;5. The first player to get back to Pie Porker's garden, wins. It is necessary to roll the exact number to get back into the garden.&lt;br/&gt;6. The winner should ask mother for a bar of Cadbury's Milk Chocolate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
