			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H1Z1 is a survival sandbox massively multiplayer online game [..].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set during a zombie apocalypse in the rural United States, in which players will have to survive against the natural elements, hordes of zombies, and thousands of potentially hostile survivors through interaction, scavenging for resources, building shelters, and crafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of H1Z1 emphasizes on multiplayer cooperation, trading, and team-building. In an interview with Adam Clegg from Sony Online Entertainment, he made clear that unlike other zombie massively multiplayer online games, the main focus will be about surviving against the zombies through teamwork with other players, rather than having a player versus player (PvP) environment with zombies as a backdrop. The ability to craft items has been implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;H1Z1&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Addition &lt;br/&gt;H1Z1 also includes a Battle Royale mode; a sort of Last Man Standing game mode where dozens of people are parachuted on an island. There are no zombies. Players gather weapons and resources. After a short time, the map will shrink, forcing the surviving players closer to each other. At the top of the screen is a counter constantly showing how many players are still alive on the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
