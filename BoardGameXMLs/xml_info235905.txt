			<description>Have you ever tried to develop a plan to enslave the whole human race? Come to the command center! Here you are going to learn from true experts in this field&amp;mdash;our extraterrestrial comrades.&lt;br/&gt;For example, you can try your hand at the tabletop strategic simulator. Try on the alien captain&amp;rsquo;s uniform and send your squadron to attack the Earth to capture as many people as possible. Because, you know, those humans are the most valuable resource in the whole universe.&lt;br/&gt;Capture people, exchange them for alien warships, fight other captains to carry out missions from alien command and thus&amp;mdash;capture even more of these pathetic humans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tremble, Humans! is a highly thematic board game, where players take roles of alien generals, invading earth to fill their cargo with intergalactic currency &amp;ndash; humans. Each turn of the game some cites are available for attacks and players simultaneously choose a place to attack, splitting their fleet between cites, if necessary. But one city is too small for two generals &amp;ndash; so if there are multiple players trying to invade a city, their armies will fight and only the strongest will capture the humans! After the round, generals can buy support &amp;ndash; new ships and stations are available for purchase, as well as the amount of fuel will increase during invasion, making alien fleets larger. After 8 rounds and additional goals scoring the richest player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
