			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory's Special Abilities in ONE Book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic, Martial Arts, Mechanica, Powers, and Psionics; the things that set Characters apart and ahead!  The Victory System Core Rulebook introduced a big selection of these Special Abilities, and we've added more as time has gone along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, we've compiled all of the Special Abilities produced up to this time in one book, the Special Abilities Companion!  This book includes not only all of the Special Abilities that were included in the Victory System Core Rulebook, but all of the Abilities introduced in our Villain Gazette's, Prosthetica, Thralls of Victory, The Ministry, Disciples of the Blade, The Agency, Project Demna, the Mechanica Companion AND the Powers Companion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a set of charts for randomly selecting Special Abilities of every type for those times when you want a little Chaos thrown into the mix!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes the Toolkit from the Victory System Equipment Manual for creating and modifying Special Abilities to suit your needs; everything from Player Character researched Magic Spells to custom-designed Mechanica and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Special Abilities Compendium includes statistics for all of the NPCs that can be created or summoned by Special Abilities.  As a bonus, there are also copious warnings for Game Masters to read over Player-created Special Abilities, you know, just in case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here it is, all in one place!  What new Abilities will you find for YOUR Victory Campaign?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
