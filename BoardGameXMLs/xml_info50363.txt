							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hordes of Dragonspear</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragonspear Castle. All who live within several hundred miles have heard the name and know its import. Once home to the proud and the brave, it stands now a ruin, cloaked behind a history of murder and diabolic plots. Few go there, for the only reward to be found is death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumors abound that Dragonspear holds a portal to the sinis&amp;not;ter planes, but until now those have been unfounded. Follow&amp;not;ing a great battle-against orcs and trolls from the High Moor who had taken possession of the castle, a temple to ward against further evil was established. However, by the Time of Troubles, that temple and its clergy had disappeared. Now, a horde of fiends and monsters has amassed at Dragonspear Castle, and is terrorizing the surrounding countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The portal is active, that is for certain. The army of Daggerford needs reinforcements! Is your party made of the stuff of heroes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hordes of Dragonspear can be played using either the BATTLESYSTEM miniatures rules, or the quick combat resolu&amp;not;tion system found in DMGR2, The Castle Guide. Alternatively, a few simple changes render the entire module playable without any special rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
