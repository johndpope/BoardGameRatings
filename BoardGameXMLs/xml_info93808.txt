							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloodsucker: The Batshit (Xpress Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Subtitle: A Guide to a Laughable Mortal Enemy in games of Bloodsucker: The Angst Xpress Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Angst. You would have thought the release of Chav would mean more wonderful core books for playing the other weird and wonderful creatures of the Shadow World. Well you thought wrong. Bloodsucker will always be the flagship line of the Shadow World series just as that Certain Other Game is the flagship line of That Certain Other RPG Company. Besides there is much fun to be had looking at a whole new element of parody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Certain Other RPG Company we poke so much fun at realised that their products did not appeal to everybody. As fun as playing whiney Goths in games of inconsequential politics is it is not for everyone. Some people just want to play mass murdering psychotic monsters. The Certain Other RPG Company catered for this by presenting an antagonist faction that catered to the needs of power gamers, misfits and the just plain crazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how do we make this funny?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple we create the Batshit. The Batshit are outcasts from regular Bloodsucker society. Rather than gather in courts, playing politics and whining a lot they aspire to the B movie vampire archetypes. This involves lots of running round, causing chaos and freaking the Mundanes. They&amp;rsquo;re not quite successful at living up to their monstrous aspirations. Most of them would balk at the typical acts of the antagonist faction in that Certain Other Game. However they are vicious little buggers if somewhat more like a Terrier than an Alsatian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can rely on us to continue to populate the Shadow World with parody horror gribblies for the foreseeable future. For now enjoy this third look at the world of the Bloodsuckers. Remember the more of these books you buy the more we can be bothered to write new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
