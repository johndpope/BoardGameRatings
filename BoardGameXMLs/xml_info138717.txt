			<description>Ebenezer Scrooge's Eggnog Dash is a dice-rolling token collection game set in the world of Charles Dickens' Victorian England. The object of the game is to be the first player to collect all 6 eggnogs in your eggnog tray and retrieve the prize within the market shop (tin house).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 18 game board pieces to build their path to the eggnog. It is up to each player to arrange the tiles in whatever order they would like. Each tile has a gold or silver &lt;br/&gt;back. Flip a gold tile over to take (1) eggnog from any other player when landed on. Flip a silver tile over for a lose one-turn event when landed on. Players can have any number of &lt;br/&gt;these gold or silver game pieces on the game board to vary the player experience. The more colored pieces played the more action during the game. The stealing of eggnog from other players gives the game more drama and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a market shop (tin house) to place at the end of the game pieces. The market shopis to be placed near the last tile leading to the eggnog stash. Place one Santa hat into each market shop. Players can also have someone place candy or even money in &lt;br/&gt;one or more shops during the pregame setup, making sure no one sees which shop has the extra prizes. This leads to a fun surprise bonus if the winning player also has extra treats in their market shop.&lt;br/&gt;Players move via a dice-rolling mechanic, while play is influenced by pre-play tile placement and tile-specific actions. Players also may take opportunities to steal other players' token during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
