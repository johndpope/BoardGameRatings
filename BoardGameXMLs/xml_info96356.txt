			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1940s began and ended with war. The war that opened the decade was fought with bombs and guns, and ended with a weapon more powerful and horrific than anything the world has seen. In the meantime, the citizens of the United States rebuild their society. The war didn't touch the country directly, as it did Europe, but the losses were palpable all the same. Millions of American men went to war, and thousands upon thousands did not return. Many that did returned changed and haunted, and the music and Hollywood glamour of the rest of the decade could not drown out those nightmares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would this new Fallen World have a place for mages, or had Sleepers outgrown any chance of Awakening?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A brief historical look at America in the 1940s, from a mage's perspective.&lt;br/&gt;     Player and Storyteller advice on chronicles set in this time period.&lt;br/&gt;     A Storytelling Adventure System story set in the 1940s, complete with a pre-generated cabal.&lt;br/&gt;     A new legacy: the Quiescent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
