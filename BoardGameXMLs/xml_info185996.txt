			<description>Pot 'O' Gold is themed after playing a slot machine, but is a dexterity game where players take turns spinning gold coloured plastic chips onto the game board. On the game board, there are cherries, oranges, plums, bells, and 7's, separated by pots of gold. If the chip lands on a pot, then the chip is added to the &amp;quot;jackpot&amp;quot;. If the chip lands on one of the other symbols, players mark off that symbol on their score pad.  After marking off any of the symbols for the fifth time, a player wins the current jackpot, and then that symbol will no longer win a jackpot for any player.  The game ends when a jackpot is won for each of the five symbols, with the player with the most chips being the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a unique game board design in Pot'O'Gold, where the board is actually 5 giant jigsaw pieces.  This does not effect game play, is simply an alternative to having a game board that folds for storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1990's, Video Lottery Terminals, or VLTs, became legal in the Canadian province of Alberta, and most bars and lounges had them installed.  Different games could be played on the VLTs, including a five wheeled slot machine where you won by matching up cherries, oranges, plums, bells and 7s on a line.  Pot'O'Gold is themed after the slot machines on those VLTs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
