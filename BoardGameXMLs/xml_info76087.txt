			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTR: Crash Team Racing is a 1999 racing video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game was released in North America on September 30, 1999 and in the PAL region later the same year. It was re-released for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up on 2000 and for the Platinum Range on January 12, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crash Team Racing is the fourth installment in the Crash Bandicoot series. It is the first Crash Bandicoot game in the racing genre and the last Crash Bandicoot game to be developed by Naughty Dog. The game's story focuses on the efforts of a ragtag team of characters in the Crash Bandicoot series, who must race against the egomaniacal Nitros Oxide to save their planet from destruction. In the game, players can take control of one of fifteen Crash Bandicoot series characters, though only eight are available at first. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power ups can be used to gain an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crash Team Racing was praised by critics for its gameplay and graphics, though the audio was met with mixed opinions. Since its release, it has sold more than two million units worldwide. An indirect sequel, Crash Nitro Kart, was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance and N-Gage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
