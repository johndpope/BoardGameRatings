			<description>From the PDF Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During an age where tabletop role-playing games can be conveniently purchased in PDF, print, and print-on-demand, the question may arise of what systems and settings are available to appease one&amp;rsquo;s gaming desires. Do you like fantasy or sci-fi? How much horror do you want to add? How accessible should magic or technology be? A better question may be: What&amp;rsquo;s available for me to play? That&amp;rsquo;s where the Gamers Guide series comes in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplayers Chronicle originally released The Gamers&amp;rsquo; Guide to Tabletop Role-playing Genres in an effort to answer this last question. The first guide was quite simple and presented a listing of products and what genres those products fell under. Each product was listed with its publisher and a link to that publisher&amp;rsquo;s website was given at the back of the guide. While this may have satiated that desire to know what&amp;rsquo;s out there, it did very little to present each product in a way that gave the user an impression of what it was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new series of Gamers Guides expands on that original guide exponentially with an effort to present these game options in a more complete manner. Supplementing this list of games is a look at each genre presented in the guide as a glossary to better understand the terminology being used. When possible, information is provided directly from the publisher&amp;rsquo;s description to present the RPG in their words, not just ours. Roleplayers Chronicle is dedicated to embracing the entire industry of tabletop RPGs without giving precedence to a single system, setting, or personal interest. It is thus that the Gamers Guide series is presented without bias and in a simple reference manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
