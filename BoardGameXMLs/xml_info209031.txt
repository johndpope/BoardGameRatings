			<description>Vuelta Ciclista a Espa&amp;ntilde;a is a dice driven race game, but it has an unusual rule.&lt;br/&gt;There are five teams of five riders and a car each. The riders are numbered from 1 to 5 in each team, and  the winner is the first team with three riders crossing the finish line. &lt;br/&gt;On their turn players throw the die five times and the first throw is for rider number 1, the second for number 2, and so on...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, at any time a player can decide to move the team's car instead of the designated rider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also positive squares, marked AV (for &amp;quot;AVituallamiento&amp;quot;, that is, feeding zone). Riders falling on them have an extra throw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an intermediate sprint (&amp;quot;Meta Volante&amp;quot;) which also gives an extra throw to all the riders who pass it (regardless of whether they fall on it). If the result of this extra throw makes the rider fall on a C or P square, the throw is not valid and the rider may repeat the throw.&lt;br/&gt; After square 35 there is a parking place for the cars, which cannot help riders in the final part of the race even though there is a square marked P and one marked with a C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also provides classification sheets in case you want to play a stage race. &lt;br/&gt;All the stages are similar and the classification is a points classification, with 40 awarded to the winner of the stage, 36 points to the second and one point to the 25th rider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
