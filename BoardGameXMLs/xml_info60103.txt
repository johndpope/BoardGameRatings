			<description>Back Cover: Part Two of the epic Horned Lord and Moon Sow Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Teeth ofthe Moon Sow, the second adventure in the Horned Lord and Moon Sow campaign for the Slaine roleplaying game. In this epic adventure, the heroes will have to face the wrath of the Drune Lords, the growing tyranny of King Osdann, the desolation of the Sourlands, and much more as they search for more of the powerful weirdstones called the Teeth of the Moon Sow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for 41h level characters from the Fir Domain tribe, who have completed the first adventure in the campaign, The Invulnerable King. It would suit a party composed mostly of warriors, with perhaps one druid, witch or thief. An all-warrior party could complete the adventure so long as they have a wide variety of skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play The Teeth of the Moon Sow is this book, a copy of The Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook, and the Slaine RPG. The first Slaine supplement, Tir Nan Og, would be useful for additional background but is not essential; the same is true of the Fir Domain sourcebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for use as the second in a four-part campaign, though it can easily be adapted to stand alone. The first three Teeth can have been brought to Osdann by a group of NPCs, prompting him to send search parties in all directions to find the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
