			<description>Explore the world, build settlements, trade goods and steal in Merchant Kingdom, the real location based MMORPG. The Real world is your playing field, your iPhone is the caravan you can use to buy commodities from traders, take them with you when you move around in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXPAND YOUR EMPIRE&lt;br/&gt;Merchant Kingdom starts you off as a simple merchant. Found your first settlements to produce basic goods in places you visit often, and then begin your rise to power. Your iPhone is the caravan you can use to buy commodities from traders, take them with you when you move around in real life, and sell at a profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYRANNY OR CULTURE&lt;br/&gt;As your trading empire expands, you desire more than just wealth; it's power you are longing for. When the king awards you a knighthood, you can build a castle, recruit an army and demand allegiance from other players! Alternatively, you can build your kingdom on the cultural influence of your castle and expand it by organising events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE&lt;br/&gt;Claim locations you visit often and build settlements that produce the commodities you want to trade in. Upgrade your settlements whenever you can and choose from over 50 different buildings each with their own special abilities. Expand your caravan, as you get richer. Buy donkeys, settlers, horses, covered wagons, spies, thieves or one of the other units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SO MUCH TO DO, SO MUCH TO SEE&lt;br/&gt;Explore the world and discover over 40 different kinds of land types, from thick jungles, to deserts, to extinct volcanoes. On your travels, find rare commodities on your trips, then bring them home and sell them for a profit. Earn achievements in one of the four guilds: the Traders Guild, the Explorers Guild, the Manufacturers Guild or the Thieves Guild and cement your reputation in the virtual land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
