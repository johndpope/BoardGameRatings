							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shattered Dawn Arcmaster Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shattered Dawn is a story driven game, where players may create and play their own characters in an expansive fantasy world. Shattered Dawn is not like other games, the rules and gameplay have been carefully crafted to be simple, fast-paced and allow for new players, and veteran players, alike to fully enjoy the lore and narrative without having to constantly focus on rules. The Arcmaster Guide outlines how to run a game session, magic items, storytelling and the full game lore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tabletop role-playing game that is designed to be easy for new people, but allows for increased complexity based on play style. The gameplay system challenges the traditional archetypes of character creation and party roles. Our classless system allows for complete customization of every aspect of your character and allows characters to learn new things at any point. Shattered Dawn&amp;rsquo;s advancement system challenges the meta of party dynamics. Rogues do not have to wield daggers, mages can wear full plate armor, and berserkers can unleash a fury of spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
