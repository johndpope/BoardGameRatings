			<description>OBJECT OF THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to call out &amp;quot;HIGH&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;LOW&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;HIGH/LOW&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;ZIPPY&amp;quot; after totaling the target number(s) shown on the green dice, with the numbers shown on the black dice using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE DICE:&lt;br/&gt;There are three large green dice, two of which have the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 and one with the numbers 4,5,6,7,8,9. The die with the numbers 4-9 is used for the advanced game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six smaller black dice have the standard numbers 2-6, but the remaining side can be used either as a 1 or a 7, depending on the player's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;The 4-9 large die is set aside. All players play at the same time, taking turns as to who will be the 'roller'. The other eight dice (2 large and 6 small) are simultaneously rolled in full view of all the players, and must not be touched by ANY player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two Large Dice form a 2-digit number, which can either be high or low. For example, if the large dice show a 3 &amp;amp; 6, the low number would be 36 and the high number would be 63. Players study the dice and quickly call &amp;quot;HIGH&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;LOW&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;HIGH/LOW&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ZIPPY&amp;quot; AFTER they have found a way of totaling either of the two numbers formed by the large green dcie with the small black ones using addition, subtration, multiplication and division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to call and get a correct result gets 1 chip, unless they call HIGH/LOW and show both answers - then they get 2 chips. You lose the same amount of chips if you are incorrect. If you call ZIPPY (which means no possible way to reach the target values) you get a chip from the bank unless someone challenges you. Then, whomever is correct pays the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced version uses the 4-9 die in place of one of the other large dice for more challenging possible results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UK players will see this as a dice driven version of the numbers quiz from the TV show Countdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
