							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hungry Giraffe</name>
									
			<description>It sucks when you're hungry. Sometimes you just want to bury your face into a burger, or tear into a taco. Out on the African savannah, a Hungry Giraffe feels your pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 20 foot tall, 1200kg animal like the giraffe needs to chow down on tons of food each day, just to stay alive. But, oh no! All the tastiest leaves have been eaten, while up in the sky endless quantities of snacks, fruit and junk food hover just out of reach!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hungry Giraffe features the world's largest and hungriest even-toed ungulate. Through skilful steering of his neck, you can propel your half-starved giraffe on his twisty-turny upward journey, chomping on strawberries, fries, sandwiches and naughtier treats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware! The skies are also strewn with hazards. Poison, Anvils and non-prescription Drugs also hover up there, ready to send unwary giraffes plummeting to earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hungry Giraffe is by FAR the greatest giraffe-feeding game of all time! Dare you miss out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
