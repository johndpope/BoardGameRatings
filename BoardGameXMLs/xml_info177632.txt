							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Ideal Necklace: A Victorian Gabbing and Gifting Game</name>
									
			<description>Victorian Ladies are on the hunt for fashion and husbands, each seeking to achieve her own personal ambition in An Ideal Necklace, a quick-moving game for one to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social engineering or by-the-numbers logical deduction are equally valid strategies as is everything in-between. Cards are visible to all, who may talk and influence other players' actions. Alliances may be made, or broken. Each turn, a Lady may: (1) select an event or a necklace from the Store; (2) attend Charm School to gain Charm; (3) gift a necklace to another Lady to earn Favor; (4) teach another Lady Charm in return for a necklace; (5) use Favor to prevent another Lady from acting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events are opportunities that may be acquired in lieu of selecting a necklace and they provide special powers, like the ability to recover Discarded necklaces or to Woo a Suitor twice, acquiring him as a husband.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ladies gift necklaces to others to earn Favor, which is used, along with Charm, to Woo a Suitor, of which there are four. Once a Suitor has been Wooed twice, a Lady acquires him as a husband and if she has also achieved her Ambition, she earns bonus points and ends the game. Ambitions are goals, like acquiring the most necklaces, or gaining the most Favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are earned for: achieving an Ambition, ending the game, capturing a husband, possessing Charm, and for owning necklaces--some of which are especially valuable! The Advanced variation, also included, adds Suitor Traits, which vary Suitors' point values and which add special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout, each player gabs and gifts their way to success, wooing Lords and giving necklaces to each other, attempting to attain An Ideal Necklace and An Ideal Husband as each Lady quests for An Ideal Victorian Life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
