							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleonic Quick March</name>
									
			<description>Napoleonic Quick March is an army level command game with corps and divisions as the major maneuver elements.  Players dice for initiative order, draw command cards that act as division and corps commander interpretations of battle orders.  Each player moves divisions in an attempt to affect a combined arms attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novelty is the grid movement system where the board is divided into a point grid system.  It allows complex maneuver similar to standard &amp;quot;measure and move&amp;quot; miniature games, but needs no rulers.  Allows for more dynamic play than hexagonal grids with eight possible positions rather than six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major battles of the era can be played rather quickly, and a small number of troops are needed.  It is an excellent game for beginners to get into the era, and it has enough complexity to keep veteran gamers interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are full color, brief, well written, and easy to follow.  Rule book includes a sample scenario in the back along with scenario building guide and open gaming army development matrix.  Rules include basic and advanced rules, command cards, and quirky illustrations that bring a smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line is game is fast and entertaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
