			<description>Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir (鋼の錬金術師2〜赤きエリクシルの悪魔〜 Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Akaki Erikushiru no Akuma?, Devil of the Red Elixir in Japan) is the second role-playing video game for the PlayStation 2 based on the series of the same name. It is the prequel of sorts to Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. The game has much improved visuals than the previous title, as well as all dialog being voiced over. To help boost sales, Square Enix decided to release the game with a bonus DVD in the United States containing the second and third episodes of season two (episode 27 &amp;quot;Teacher&amp;quot; and 28 &amp;quot;One is All, All is One&amp;quot;) of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime series, since the show took a four month break in its Adult Swim broadcast. This DVD contains only English audio, with the shortened version of the second opening theme song &amp;quot;Ready Steady Go&amp;quot; by L'Arc-en-Ciel and the shortened third ending &amp;quot;Motherland&amp;quot; by Crystal Kay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with Edward and Alphonse arriving in the city of Lior to deal with Father Cornello and ask him about the Philosopher's Stone. However, just as soon as the two brothers defeat him, Father Cornello is pulled into a dark void and disappears. Edward notices a strange phantom-like woman hiding behind the statues watching the scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly afterwards, after facing off against Bald, investigating Shou Tucker's home, battling Scar, Edward and Alphonse learn upon their arrival in their hometown of a frightening phenomenon sweeping Amestris; people in many regions are vanishing without a trace, supposedly spirited away by &amp;quot;monsters&amp;quot;. In Resembool, Edward and Alphonse meet an enigmatic alchemist named Jack Crowley and an entity called the Phantom. It seems that they have some connection with both the disappearances and the strange creatures (known as Golems) appearing around the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Roy Mustang sends the brothers and Riza Hawkeye to investigate a village plagued by these monsters, they meet Arlen Glostner, an archaeologist who is studying the ancient civilization of Lebis. Edward and Alphonse soon find themselves headed for the ruins of Siam-Sid, the capital city of Lebis, to discover the truth behind the Golems and the puzzling disappearances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
