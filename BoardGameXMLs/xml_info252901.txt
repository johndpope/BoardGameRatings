			<description>Rats to Riches is a finance strategy card game. Players are sewer-dwelling rats who invest, acquire properties, pursue career paths, or even steal their way to financial superiority!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first rat to get 100 coins. To achieve this, players spend their coins on cheese, which they in turn spend on businesses, properties, and other deals that give them the return on their investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
