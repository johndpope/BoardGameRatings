							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Attack on Meeple Island</name>
									
			<description>Life was good on Meeple Island: multiracial harmony, farming, raising animeeples, building wooden roads, more farming.  Then someone discovered the Necromeeple's Cave and everything changed.  Now meeples are pitted against meeples in a battle for necromantic dominance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zombie Attack on Meeple Island you play a tribe of colored meeples forced to adapt when the dead begin to rise all over their island.  Do you cooperate with your fellow meeple tribes or don the black mantle of the necromeeple and claim power over life and death for yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game answers the age old question:  which gaming genre will reign supreme, Euro or Ameritrash?  Find out the answer over 10 rounds of simultaneous card play each followed by a bidding phase for control of the necromeeple.  The cards include many of your favorite game mechanics, zombie tactics and a few surprises.  Do you bide your time in a euro-optimization holding pattern or go for the jugular with a necromeeple power play and brain buffet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who ends the game with the most meeple survivors or the necromeeple player if zombeeples overrun the island.  Special win conditions, meeple and zombeeple upgrades, and AT superweapons ensure that whoever wins, Meeple Island will never be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got wood for brains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
