Lu Yuen, your biggest adversary and China's top agent, wants to defect to the United States. He has political secrets so valuable that the Chinese and Russians will do anything to stop him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find Lu and stay alive, you'll have to make snap decisions under pressure and use the abilities you've acquired in years of undercover work--using your body as a martial arts weapon, firing a gun with deadly accuracy, and sneaking into and out of areas with uncanny agility. The challenge will be yours as you go INTO CHINA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional User Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into China is Sniper! Adventure Gamebook #3.

The abilities of the player are preprinted in the gamebook and include Stealth, Hand-to-Hand, Firing, &amp;amp; Bomb-Throwing. The player's starting weapons and equipment are also included. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
