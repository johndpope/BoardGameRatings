			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The guide you hold now is a doorway into the world of Shadowglade, one draped in a shadow and the fog of history. After a cataclysmic event destroyed the physical world and wiped the minds of its citizenry clean, the world was set back untold ages. Through the years, however, new nations were founded on the ashes of the old, new leaders stepped to the fore, and the world found itself once more. For an assembled history of the land down through the years, see An Introduction to Shadowglade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark this history of this land well, for in its shrouded past lies the seeds of its future...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide represents the common knowledge of the common folk of the realm. Its intent is to help bring new visitors up to speed on the state of the world today: the people, their skills and abilities, the political and religious forces, movers and shakers within the realm, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
