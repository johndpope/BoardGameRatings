			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BODGERS: Basic One-Dice Gloranthan Epic Roleplaying System attempts to retain the RuneQuest tone and feel while replacing the RuneQuest mechanics with streamlined and simplified mechanics.  The rules are limited to a discussion of the replacement mechanics and assume external sources will be used to provide the setting of Glorantha.  As the replacement mechanics are themselves quite complex, the success of the effort is dubious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have several types of attributes, called &amp;quot;Statistics&amp;quot;.  They are arranged into four groups of three attributes, namely:  Graces (Appearance, Dexterity, Voice); Physical (Constitution, Size, Strength); Senses (Hearing, Sight, Taste and Smell); and Mystical (ESP, Intuition, Power).  The values for each attribute are determined by either point distribution or random rolls.  Modifiers based on race, social background, and role also are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also have several &amp;quot;Derived Statistics&amp;quot; that are created from formulas based on attributes.  These derived values include: Charisma, Evade, Melee, Missile, Damage Modifier, Hit Points, Magic Points, Encumbrance Allowance, and Movement Rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have some combination of skills, derived from a standard list of seventeen normal skills and seven magic skills.  Most skill values start at zero.  Skills and Statistics may be increased by experience, training, or research; Derived Statistics change relative to Statistics changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat allows for variable damage, parries, and damage absorption by armor.  Critical hits are allowed, as are combat fumbles.  A variety of combat options are supported, including defensive fighting, double attacks, evasion, and passive shield use.  Wounds received may be minor, major, or critical, each level with various penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spell casting involves manipulation of numerous variables, including duration, intensity, multiple casting and range.  Thirty-two magic spells are provided.  Divine magic is less developed.  Ritual magic is presented with some development, but remains fairly vague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also include a concise process for converting RuneQuest characters to the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
