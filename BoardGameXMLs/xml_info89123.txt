			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Romance of the Three Kingdoms V is the 5th installation of the successful and still ongoing Romance of the Three Kingdoms series by Koei. It is the first edition to be based on the Windows platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Romance of the Three Kingdoms V is a multiplayer game, able to take up to 8 players. Players take on roles of a ruler/warlord and manage their respective territories. This includes recruiting officers, improving agriculture and economy, drafting and training armies, maintaining diplomatic relations with other rulers and waging war. The ultimate goal of the game is to reunify China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two discerning features that depart from the past four editions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i) Whilst the game is still turn based, the number of actions each ruler can take per turn/month now depends on the ruler&amp;rsquo;s reputation parameter. This depends on the ruler&amp;rsquo;s popularity with the peasants as well as the number of territories in the ruler&amp;rsquo;s kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ii) Army formations are introduced into the wars. Players get to choose the formations for each army deployed during wars. This can make quite a big difference to the outcome of the war as the effectiveness of each formation is dependent on the terrain the war is fought on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
