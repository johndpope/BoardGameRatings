			<description>This game teaches children to look at a set of cards with pictures, to select corresponding properties in three special dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Preschoolers from 3 to 4 years play with the blue set and search for: a card with a certain background color (red, green or blue), a sun, moon or star-like shape on the figurine and a pattern (dashes, dots or squares) on the clothing.&lt;br/&gt;- Infants from 4 to 5 years throw with the dice and red set. They search for a given position of the eyes (open, closed or wink), the site of an accessory (for clothing, wall or background) and the shape of the corners of the card (rounded, straight or angled).&lt;br/&gt;- Children from 5 to 6 years play with the blue set of dice and find a map with some fingers in (1-2-3), the letters p-b-d on clothing and the direction of the nose (left, right or down).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two variants to play the game:&lt;br/&gt;1)Either each child receives equal cards and places it in front of him. If the dice combination matches one of his cards, he turns it around. &lt;br/&gt;2) All open tickets are in the middle of the table and all children search simultaneously to the matching card. The player who's the first to have three cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
