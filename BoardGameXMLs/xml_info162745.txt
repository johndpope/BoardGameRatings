			<description>This is a symmetric two player abstract which is played with (initially) 8 pieces per side on an 8x8 board. There are initially 3 types of piece: CROIX, which can move any distance orthogonally, IXI which can move any distance diagonally and ETOILE which can move any distance orthogonally or diagonally. All these pieces have a STOP piece of the opposing colour on their reverse side.&lt;br/&gt; Pieces capture by either: &lt;br/&gt;1). Moving such that enemy pieces are immediately (no gaps) orthogonally between them and friendly piece(s) or &lt;br/&gt;2). Moving into a space immediately between two or more orthoganally seperated ememy pieces.&lt;br/&gt; The captured piece(s) are turned over and become immobile STOP pieces for the capturer that in turn may be used in future captures. If recaptured the STOP pieces revert to their original piece. &lt;br/&gt; The winner is the player who captures all the opponent's pieces or immobilizes all opponent's remaining pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
