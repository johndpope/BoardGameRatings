			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chronies have gathered at Styx for a friendly barbeque. There are burgers, hot dogs, ziti, potato chips, soda, cake, ice-cream, and whatever else the chronies want. Play out this scene for a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone will discover (the hard way) that what looks like a whipped cream topping on the cake is actually shaving cream!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunter, the spanners&amp;rsquo; mentor, is a bit put off by this, but she knew something strange was going to happen today (she knows from a dossier that Tommy arrives today and that the novices meet Helmut at the same time, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about each of Helmut&amp;rsquo;s pranks specifically; she guesses that this is Helmut&amp;rsquo;s doing, but holds that information unavailable until the PCs meet him). She asks the corner to find out who put the shaving cream on the cake. She also says she&amp;rsquo;s going to make another cake, and asks someone to get some real whipped cream (she specifies Cool Whip).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunter declares a rendezvous one minute Up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
