			<description>The BIA is a game of two teams. One team are the loyal agents with the yellow agent tokens and the other team is the double agent with the blue agent chip. Players are not allowed to ever reveal their agent chips to the other players unless they are killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a player's turn, the player can choose one of the available action cards to perform. Once all action cards have been used they are flipped back over and can be used again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loyal agents are trying to defuse danger zones while double agents want to make them happen more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the following conditions are met:&lt;br/&gt;1.) Three disasters have taken place.&lt;br/&gt;2.) All danger zones are gone from the board.&lt;br/&gt;3.) If an agent has been killed and there are no more agent chips left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
