			<description>Played with a standard deck of cards, published in Reiner Knizia's book Blazing Aces! A Fistful of Family Card Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over multiple rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt one card. The rest of the cards are placed in the middle of the table in a face down stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player draws either the top card from the deck or a card from the centre (if there are any). If they drew a card from the deck, they may discard it to the centre and draw another from the deck (which they must keep).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This occurs until everyone has seven cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From those seven cards, each player builds their best five card poker hand and is awarded points based on the strength of that poker hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most points, after all the rounds are played out, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
