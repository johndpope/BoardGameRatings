							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Temple of the Death Goddess</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A terrible tragedy struck the tiny village of Erburg, and the people there have just begun to put their lives in order. However, a new evil is rising that intends to destroy them all. When a veritable army of shuffling undead horrors spills into their streets, the locals know that this is the beginning of the end...unless a band of heroes can find the source of this new threat and put a stop to it. Should they falter, should they fail, it will mean not only the doom of Erburg, but also all the surrounding lands. Temple of the Death Goddess is fifth in Green Ronin's Bleeding Edge Adventures. Used as a sequel to the engaging A Dreadful Dawn or on its own as a stand alone scenario, this adventure promises a chilling experience as the heroes must confront a new form of wickedness in the bowels of a rotting temple dedicated to the fearsome Goddess of Death. As with all of the adventures in this series, Temple of the Death Goddess combines thrilling action, immersive roleplaying, and terrifying environments guaranteed to push your games to the bleeding edge of adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initative Cards: Temple of the Death Goddess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping track of initiative in 3rd Era games can get complicated. Every GM has a method that he or she favors, but which sometimes lacks versatility or utility. Initiative Cards provide GMs with an easy way to keep track of initiative and a handy reference for all the sorts of information a GM sometimes needs during a game session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different types of Initiative Cards: character cards and monster cards. Character cards contain information about the player characters and the occasional non-player character. You can use these cards for familiars as well. Monster cards contain information about monsters (though it's best to use character cards for monsters that have class levels). You can use these cards for most animal companions as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster cards in this publication provide GMs with preprinted monster cards for Bleeding Edge Adventure #5: Temple of the Death Goddess. All of the necessary information has already been filled in&amp;mdash;all the GM needs to do is print and cut the cards he or she needs, and perhaps complete blank character cards if the players are not using the pre-generated PCs from the adventure. And, they're provided free with the purchase of Temple of the Death Goddess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
