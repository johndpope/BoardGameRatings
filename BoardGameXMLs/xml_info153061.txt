			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ragged Man is the first stand-alone adventure for the Laughing Moon tabletop role-playing game, and is designed to be both a supplement and an expansion. The adventure is written with all player types in mind. Whether this be a first-time player, or an experienced veteran gamer, there is something for everyone to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure opens with the player characters trapped in a gypsy camp, surrounded by a mysterious bank of fog. During the night they hear the legend of the ragged man, as told by one of the gypsies and discover the tragic origins of this tale. For centuries the Ragged Man, a vengeful spirit that appears in scarecrow form, has haunted these lands in a mindless search for his lost children. The adventure takes players on a chase to save the gypsy camp by battling hideous creatures that are part man, part raven, a coven of vampires known as the Sullen Ones, a treacherous enemy masquerading as a friend, minions of the powerful and mysterious Raven Duchess, and the Ragged Man himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2-6 players, The Ragged Man adventure takes players deep into the world under the Laughing Moon where a desperate rescue mission pits them against nightmare creatures in a race against time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stand-alone expansion to accompany the Adventures Under the Laughing Moon tabletop role-playing game, The Ragged Man is a blend of fantasy and horror that allows the players to determine the outcome of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SPECIAL EDITION includes 6 fully equipped unique player characters packed with skills, abilities, and items to take on the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
