			<description>Players roll and move on a board, answering spelling and word-definition questions to advance. The player that reaches one of the final spaces and correctly answers that final challenge is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three colors on the board corresponding to &amp;quot;cowardly&amp;quot; (yellow), &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot; (blue), and &amp;quot;superhuman&amp;quot; (red) levels of word difficulty (plus black spaces, which end a player's turn immediately).  A player landing on a colored space must correctly spell AND define a word from a card corresponding to that color.  If a player does both, they may roll (2 dice) and advance again to answer another challenge.  If they get one part wrong, they must roll 1 die and move backward that amount (and their turn ends).  If they get both wrong, they must roll 2 dice and move backward that amount (and their turn ends).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
