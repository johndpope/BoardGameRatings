			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the years following the Great Insurrection the Mutan of the Clavern'sigh set about the task of demolishing everything left by their Fallen Masters. Great temples and vast cities were systematically destroyed, their broken stones scattered until nothing remained. It was in the prosecution of this mission that the Sigh discovered records of a Beast, one created by the Trell'sara and subsequently locked away and forgotten. Such was the elemental malice of this spectral creature that it had proved uncontrollable and had been separated into eleven parts, each part exiled to the ends of the world and secured within a grel'nimir, a Lock Room, bound by eleven locks. With this discovery warriors were sent to find these grel'nimir, though none were ever found. Except one. This is the story of the Hresh who uncovered the prison of the Gaelwch (pronounced gael-wek) and came face to face with the power of EarthMagic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
