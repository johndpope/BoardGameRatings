			<description>Kaboom! is a card game for two to five players. The objective of this game is to, well&amp;hellip;blow stuff up. You are under attack by well-armed and not-so-polite enemies. You can erect walls to protect yourself, and lob all kinds of incendiary devices at your enemies. But they will be doing the same to you. If they destroy all of your walls and take you out, then it&amp;rsquo;s Kaboom! You get the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is very simple. Players have a hand of cards that are made up of four different types that can be used to attack their opponents and defend against incoming attacks. As the game progresses, the players will have their protective walls slowly whittled down to nothing. This leaves them exposed and the next attack from any opponent that cannot be blocked immediately eliminates the player from winning the game, but does not remove them from the game. As soon as this happens, the endgame is triggered and the Endgame cards come into play. The Endgame cards are special cards that keep eliminated players in the game to hinder all those who are still in the running to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is only one player left who has not been eliminated. This player, being the only one to survive the battle, is automatically the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
