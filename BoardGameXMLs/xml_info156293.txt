							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Werewolf: Character Meeples</name>
									
			<description>These character meeples (7 villagers, 1 seer, 2 werewolves) allow you the most compact Ultimate Werewolf game experience yet. Now you can literally take the game with you wherever you go. The meeples replace some of the cards which come with Ultimate Werewolf. While the game itself comes with many more options and variants, these meeples can give you the basic Ultimate Werewolf experience (for up to 10 players) in a tiny format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are not included. You still need to own a copy of the rules and have access to a moderator, as usual, when using these meeples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
