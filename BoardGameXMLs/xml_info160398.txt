			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hallucinor: An unexplored planet only recently discovered in the Spectralia Star System. Probe investigation records massive life readings and earth normal gravitational and atmospheric conditions. The planet has been marked for immediate priority colonization subject to clearance by robot team Prelim-0484. A simple job they said, exciting but not at all dangerous they said. I mean things were O.K. for the first couple of months. There certainly wasn't much guarding to do. If a native did appear, a quick warning blast from my laser blast would send it scurrying away, but then ...... As soon as the whole of the Tele-Portal network was powered up, they attacked, we guards tried to stop them but there were just too many of them ... and now there's only me left, my control circuitry is damaged, I can't switch my motors off, so the only thing I can do to slow down is slam the brake units on, but that doesn't do much good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I must pick up the fuel cells and go through the Tele-Portal to soak up some more energy, it's running so low, so tired ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OH NO!!!! Here they come again.... H-E-L-P!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The user controls a robot which is constantly moving forward. The player can rotate left and right. The robot can also brake, which means it both moves more slowly and has a tighter turning circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each level, the robot needs to pick up four fuel cells, which immediately then move to surround the Tele-Portal. When all are collected, the Robot can go through the Tele-Portal to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress is hindered by aliens on screen, which can be shot. The robot starts with full batteries. Energy is lost through collisions with aliens, or using the brake. A bonus counts down while playing the level. This is added to the energy reserve when you complete the level. If all energy is lost, it's Game Over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Ian Weatherburn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
