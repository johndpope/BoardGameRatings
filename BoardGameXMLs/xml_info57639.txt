							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Locations: The Tower of Octavius</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Tower of Octavius -- is this mysterious fortress a foreboding place of knowledge, a place of dread requiring brave heroes to cleanse, or a base of operations for a band of adventurers and their unusual patron?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;That's up to you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Locations: The Tower of Octavius is a complete kit for incorporating this mighty stronghold and its occupants into your GURPS fantasy campaign, including suggestions for setting it on Yrth. Along with 10 pages of maps, the book features a detailed description of the six-level tower, plus its basement, dungeon, and crypt, and the region around the wizard's tower. It provides full GURPS information on its powerful, eccentric occupant -- Octavius of Tyrvo, the Wizard-Baron -- and his minions and allies. You'll also find plenty of ideas for how to add this ominous abode to your campaign, as a one-shot place to visit and perhaps overcome, a recurring point of interest, or the basis of an adventure series.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All these secrets are revealed in GURPS Locations: The Tower of Octavius; whether those secrets will be uncovered in your game is another mystery.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
