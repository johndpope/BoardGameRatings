			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once We Were Heroes: The Summer Children is an RPG for a GM and up to 5 players. It's set in a world of faeries and boglins, and borrows heavily from European folklore, Celtic fairy tales in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players have memories of a previous life, when they were brave heroes who stopped a war between man and faerie, and then vanished. Now that there are signs of a new invasion, they are called upon to be heroes in this life. During their travels to the Otherworld, the realm of the fae, they will remember more and more of their previous heroic life, and grow more powerful. Or they might die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death is not the end, however. In the Otherworld, the players' spirits have no problem finding a new body, similar to the old one. But dying is not without a cost. The more the players reincarnate, the more they lose their humanity and the more fae-like they become. When they reach the faerie court, will they remember enough of their human past to save their kin?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once We Were Heroes: The Summer Children gives an outline for a story, but you'll never play the same game twice. It uses only a few d6, and you won't ever have to sum dice or modifiers; you can see the result of a die roll at a glance. Shared narrative control is built into the game. Combat is fast, simple and deadly. Players have the tools and abilities to overcome challenges in many different ways (without fear of failure or death) and the GM doesn't have to pull punches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
