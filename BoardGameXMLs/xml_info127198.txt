							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vermont Horror Expansion (fan expansion for Arkham Horror)</name>
									
			<description>I think I am going crazy. It may be that all I have ever written you is a dream or madness. It was bad enough before, but this time it is too much. They talked to me last night - talked in that cursed buzzing voice and told me things that I dare not repeat to you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vermont Horror is an unofficial fan-created expansion to Arkham Horror, based on the H.P. Lovecraft story 'The Whisperer in Darkness'. It introduces several new game concepts to the Arkham Horror Series, including a Prequel stage of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vermont is home to the Mi-go, a race of aliens from Yuggoth intent on plundering the earth of its natural resources, extracting valuable minerals from parallel planes underneath the earth. Whilst digging down to these inter-dimensional portals the Mi-go are inadvertently disturbing ancient seals buried deep in the ground. These eons old seals are holding the Ancient Ones at bay and as they become disturbed it increases the chances of the Old One stirring from its slumber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vermont Horror also adds one new Herald, a unique deck of Prequel events, over 30 new monster markers, plenty of new encounters from Townshend to the Dark Mountains, a deck of unique Mi-go technology to be harnessed and an expansion board featuring the locality of Vermont.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
