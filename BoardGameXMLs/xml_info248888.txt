			<description>A free Print and Play game for 2-4 players. Based on inductive logical reasoning, hidden goals and basic mathematical calculations. &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing numbered tokens onto bases. At the end of each round tokens are totaled up. In the Induction version of the game players score points for each of their tokens in a total that other players' hidden rules refer to. In the Deduction version of the game players score points for each of their tokens in a total that their own hidden rule refers to. In Induction players win by scoring a certain number of points, in Deduction they win by forcing other players to score a certain number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
