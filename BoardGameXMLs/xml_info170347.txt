			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For decades, the Ragnarok group has sought to destabilize the current government and large corporations. They have felt the increase in power by these groups to be a direct threat to the survival of humanity and have been fighting in the shadows to bring these organizations down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labeled as terrorists by the people they fight against, they have slowly gathered support in their struggle. Due to being vastly outnumbered and financially insignificant, they have only had luck with small scale operations such as destruction of remote facilities (fuel sources, research buildings, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the last couple of years, the organization has seen a drastic increase in violent activity. This is due to two things: the recent promotion of a much less tolerant council chair, and the recruitment of many brilliant scientists and programmers. Among the recent recruits is an incredibly violent programmer who goes by the name of NeoSet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NeoSet has no concern for life and is determined to bring the entire economic and political system crashing to its knees. He is fully aware that such an aggressive action risks exposing the Ragnarok group and any failure would not be tolerated by the new chair. Therefore, NeoSet has found a small time expendable criminal to release his AI upon the world:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ph4nD0m.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you stop him in time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
