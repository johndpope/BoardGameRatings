			<description>The Intrepid&amp;ndash;class ships were designed for the Royal Navy by Sir John Williams. These ships were armed with 26 24&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the gundeck, 26 18&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the upperdeck, 10 4&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the quarterdeck, and 2 9&amp;ndash;Pounder guns in the forecastle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HMS Polyphemus was laid down at Sheerness in 1782 and commissioned in 1799 under the command of Captain G. Lumsdaine. She sailed in the North Sea Fleet on the Baltic Sea until 1802. In 1805, Capt. Robert Redmill commanded her in the Battle of Trafalgar, where she engaged the French ships Neptune and Achille and captured the Spanish ship Argonauta. She was later in service along the French coast and in the Americas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the British Intrepid class ship of the line &amp;ldquo;HMS America 1777&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
