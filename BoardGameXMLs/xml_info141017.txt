			<description>Tajemnice Krainy Ducha G&amp;oacute;r is an educational game about places of touristic interest around Jelenia G&amp;oacute;ra. Players are tourist guides competing to take their groups to most interesting places, while their actions are limited by cards in hand and time tokens they are given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game deck consists of two types of cards: sightseeing places and interesting facts. Places make up the trip each player's group takes and are a basis for scoring, while facts can add to the score or even (when played at a correct place) can multiply it. Playing places costs time tokens and playing facts costs cards in hand, so finally all players are left with nothing to do and the game ends. The winner is the player with most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
