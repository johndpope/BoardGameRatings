			<description>Aggressive worker placement. Control a tribe of stone creatures fighting, mining &amp;amp; building in the heart of an asteroid. 1 to 4 players. Caverns &amp;amp; Crystals is a worker placement game that relies on direct conflict between players as each tries to gather the most resources and build their tribe of Stone Imps to its maximum potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of six hexagonal cards in a circle representing an asteroid drifting through space. As the game progresses (depending upon the turn cards that are placed in the center)three resources are placed upon the cards: Stone, used for spawning more members of your tribe, Metal, used to beat your opponent into submission and precious power crystals which will win you the game! By tactically placing your Stone Imps onto different Cavern Cards on the board you can dominate an area and ensure it is your imps who bring the crystals home. Be careful however, as somewhere in that asteroid there is a very hungry space squid placed secretly by another player that will devour your tribe and a vacuum that will eject them into space!&lt;br/&gt;Most importantly you have an Imp king leading your tribe who will give your imps a dramatic boost when used with forethought. At the beginning of the turn a set of six cards is passed around to each player who takes one secretly. Each card gives your king a power to use for that turn whether it is sneaking into an opponents home to take their resources or surprising your opponents by teleporting your tribe at the last minute. You will have to think very carefully as you select your card and ponder what your opponents have chosen.       &lt;br/&gt;Caverns &amp;amp; Crystals can even be played Solo where it ceases to be a game of deducing your opponents' actions and becomes an intense puzzle where a player must be as efficient as possible to succeed. The Game Itself comes in a small tin ensuring it remains safe and undamaged between plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So do you have what it takes to build your tribe and Rule the Rock!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
