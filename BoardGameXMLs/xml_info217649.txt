			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vigilantes of Horror- Fated to be a Monstrous Vigilante!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Frankenstein, Chapter 16, by Mary Shelley (Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s Monster)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the exciting new horror and intrigue supplements, adventure gamers can experience a whole new type of gaming- but why not take it further? Why not adventure as&amp;hellip; a monstrous vigilante?  Vigilantes of Horror by Aaron Hollingsworth and published by Purple Duck Games brings you great new options for vigilante play in horror settings!  In this new product, check out 7 new vigilante archetypes, including; the electrifying Corpseborne (Frankenstein), the savage Loup Garou (Wolfman), the terrifying Mummified (the Mummy), the sinister Podthing (Body Snatchers), aquatic Reefling (Creature from the Black Lagoon), bloodsucking Vampiryst (Dracula) and steadily unstable Vanished (the Invisible Man).
