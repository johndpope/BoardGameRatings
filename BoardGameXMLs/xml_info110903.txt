			<description>Rocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game released in the United States in 1994 and in 1997 in Canada, and is based on Joe Murray's Rocko's Modern Life television series on Nickelodeon. It was developed by Viacom New Media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spunky's Dangerous is played as a two-dimensional side-scrolling platform game, and the player controls Rocko.  There are four sets of stages in which Rocko's dog Spunky has wandered off in search of an object that catches his attention: Sand in Your Navel (set at the beach), Trash-O-Madness (set at the dump), Ice Scream (set in O-Town itself), and Unbalanced Load (set in the laundromat), and each individual stage consists of four different levels.   Except for Ice Scream all of the levels were based on episodes of the show. Rocko's goal in every level is to keep Spunky safe from danger.  This means activating platforms and switches at specific times, as well as feeding Spunky certain items and defeating enemies in the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a beach, where Rocko is playing with his pet Spunky. Rocko throws the frisbee, but flies very far away which Spunky goes after it. Rocko must protect him at Rock-O-Whey Beach, the Hill-O-Stench garbage dump, and Laundryland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
