			<description>It's time to decorate! With the Fresh Color expansion players decorate their buildings with ornaments, mosaics and fresh colors to gain even more victory points for their buildings during scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player gets a decoration board that holds the decorations for each of the 6 building types. Additionally a common task board is placed next to the building market. On it the different decoration tiles are placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a player overpays for a building he can either claim a decoration tile from the board and place it on their decoration board, or get colors. Which colors the player gets is determined by the board and with what money type he paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each decoration tile shows what kind and how much of certain colors is needed in order to build it. Once a player has all the colors needed for one of his decorations he can, as an alternate action in his turn, build it. Each finished decoration awards 2 extra victory points for each corresponding building in the players Alhambra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 6 player task boards, 1 common task board, 18 task tiles, and 36 color tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
