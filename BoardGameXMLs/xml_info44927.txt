							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Klick Clack</name>
									
			<description>For the past decade, klicks have struck at the humans of the Hammer's Star system and then vanished into the depths of space. All we've been able to do is react to their attacks. Striking back hasn't been an option--but that's about to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few weeks ago, a Concord cutter found a gutted ship drifting in space, her crew dead. The officer commanding the cutter ordered his crew to recover the computer core. They found that it contained the location of what could only be a klick base. The Concord has seized this opportunity to take the war to the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klick Clack sends heroes into the very jaws of the lion. It is modular in design, allowing Gamemasters to reuse the base in future adventures. Included in the product is a map of the base itself, and--for the first time--schematics of a klick attack ship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the STAR*DRIVE setting, Klick Clack is also usable with any other campaign based on the ALTERNITY game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
