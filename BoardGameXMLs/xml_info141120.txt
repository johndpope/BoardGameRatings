							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Library of Ezz</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient Library of Ezz is considered lost to this day. During the Breaking of Anhelm, many wizards gave up hope of discovering the treasured resource. The wanton destruction would have wiped out any remaining worth from the library, as the texts, scrolls, and tomes within were already thousands of years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great wizard, Ezz, carved the library deep beneath a nameless mountain. There, he painstakingly stored tomes of knowledge, wisdom, lore, and power, foreseeing a time when such resources might be rare. A handful of wizards even had the opportunity to study at the library, although Ezz guarded his trove quite jealously. The location remained a mystery, for Ezz was bound by his maniacal devotion to preserve, not share, the knowledge he amassed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, the library survived, due to Ezz&amp;rsquo;s magickal prowess. Unfortunately, it is now scattered in four wings, so a wizard who discovers one must still search for the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
