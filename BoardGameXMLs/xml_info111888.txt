							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intrepid Expeditions: The Island of Life</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destination: Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend, myth, and rumor tell of a mysterious and secluded tropical island by the name of Kawa&amp;rsquo;lea. This lush paradise is said to be home to an amazing variety of plants and animals not found anywhere else in the world. Far more exciting, though, it&amp;rsquo;s said that the island is steeped in powerful life magic, and that it can have curious effects on those who land upon its shores. Some say that it is the location of the mythical fountain of eternal youth. Others say that the island&amp;rsquo;s powers return the dead to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are darker ruins about this mythical island of life. Some say that it twists and corrupts all who travel there, transforming them into feral and misshapen monsters. Others say that its jungles hold ancient and terrible creatures, great predators whose footsteps cause the very ground to quake. Still other rumors hint at a dark secret somewhere in the heart of the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrepid Expeditions: The Island of Life provides a GM with background information on the island of Kawa&amp;rsquo;lea. It gives general descriptions of the island as a whole, including its curious and unique magical effects. It also provides more in-depth descriptions of each of the island&amp;rsquo;s five regions, detailing various items of interest, such as magical landmarks, ancient ruins, potential allies and deadly enemies. The book also details a number of new creatures native to the island. A separate player&amp;rsquo;s guide provides background information on the island to whet players&amp;rsquo; appetites for adventure, as well as a prestige class that taps into Kawa&amp;rsquo;lea&amp;rsquo;s unique magical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a fun place for your players to explore, and ideas to spark your own adventure through a fantastic terrain like nowhere your party has ever gone before, this is the book for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
