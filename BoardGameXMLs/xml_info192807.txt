			<description>Reo is a dice game for 2+ players based on the classic dice game Liar's Dice and the goal remains the same--be the last player standing!  Reo introduces a set of community dice used by all players to change the dynamic and allow customization of luck versus skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all variants, players begin with five 8-sided dice each and a cup to keep their roll hidden from the other players. Players then take turns bidding according to the rules, until one player's bid is challenged.  The key to the game is using the results of your roll, probability, and your ability to read others to figure out what the best possible bid for that round is (the most number of dice with the highest number on them), and bid it first.  Challenges are resolved by revealing all the dice, as well as the community roll of 3 additional 8-sided dice that Reo adds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most popular version rolls the community dice after a bid is challenged.  This version emphasizes luck a little more, as a player can roll themselves out of a bid gone wrong jam.  The other popular variant rolls the community dice before the bidding, where all players can see the community dice for the &amp;quot;Texas Hold' Em&amp;quot; version.  Your bidding must be more precise when played this way, emphasizing skill versus luck. Any way you play, Reo is a fast-paced, fun game that is quick to pick up, and hard to put down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
