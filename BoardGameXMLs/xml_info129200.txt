							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloodstone: An Epic Dwarven Tale</name>
									
			<description>Bloodstone is a 1993 high fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Mindcraft Software. The game is a prequel to The Magic Candle series and uses the Magic Candle III engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with the main character's clan (default name &amp;quot;Danat&amp;quot; if male, or &amp;quot;Danta&amp;quot; if female) being attacked by the vicious Taldor. The Taldor are goblin-like creatures who seem to be cursed with violent bloodlust. The main objective of the game is to retrieve Khamalkhad and join the warring tribes of the North and South.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game employs an interesting religion where the player can go to the resting points of certain gods and receive a permanent skill increase by uttering the word to speak with them. The game employs creatures like the Tlengle (Lizardfolk) Humans, Dwarves, Talador, Wizards, and Amazons. Magic is done in an odd way; the amount of a specific spell numbers one to ninety-nine. As the player casts a spell they use up one &amp;quot;use&amp;quot; when they run out of uses they either forget the spell or buy a totem, to learn the specific spell by assigning the character to study the magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bloodstone: An Epic Dwarven Tale&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you save the dwarves from self destruction?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the dwarves of eastern Tarq squabble among themselves, the savage Taldors from the mountains ravage the dwarves' newly built towns and newly planted fields! Ages before the time of the &amp;quot;The Magic Candle,&amp;quot; the first civilization of the west are in dire peril! Among savages and barbarians, tyrants and warlords, is there anyone with the wisdom and vision to bring peace to the lands of Tarq?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the role of a young dwarf, orphaned in battle, searching for magical treasures from the days of legend, when the gods walked in the world with their children. With trusted companions you wander Tarq and its islands, gaining prowess, gaining knowledge, seeking wisdom and Khamalkhad, the axe of power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarven civilization is dying. You may be its only hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
