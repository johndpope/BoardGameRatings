			<description>This is one of the Jamie Swise murder-mystery role-playing games published by Just Games. It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &amp;quot;Life of the Pary&amp;quot; line beginning in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode: Who Killed Roger Ellington?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Plot: Post-war America was thriving in 1948, as was murder in a small Massachusetts town. Industrialist Roger Ellington was cut-down in the prime of his sordid life. After eating a plate of snails, he succumbed to what appeared to be a most deadly strain of indigestion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Time: Aug. 9, 1948&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Place: Washington Station, Massachusetts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cast:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major Deegan: Lifetime resident of Washington Station. Deegan was Roger's chief competitor for women, status &amp;ndash; everything for as long as anyone could remember. A well-trained mercenary, Deegan returned to town shortly after the war, satisfied that he and a few others had saved theWestern world from evil. He couldn't remember where he was the night of Roger's death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derrick Ellington: Stepbrother of the deceased, had been away in the Merchant Marines for ten years, returning to town a year ago. Derrick became engaged to Sara Admunson after his return. She died shortly after in an auto accident. A drunken Roger was driving her home from a party when he lost control of the car. Derrick crawled into a bottle shortly after the funeral and never came out. Always looked down upon by his brother, Derrick never &amp;quot;lived up&amp;quot; to the Ellington name. Perhaps that is why he sought refuge in the Merchant Marines for all those years. He couldn't remember where he was the evening of the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cybil Admunson: Sister of the late Sara. It was common knowledge that Cybil loved Roger. A social climber, Cybil was not liked by many. At her sister's funeral she exchanged some pretty harsh words with Roger. While deciding on which college to attend next, she worked as hostess at L'Escargot. She was on duty that night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arnold Green: Boston College student working at L'Escargot for the summer. Green was not a born waiter, and was publicly humiliated by Roger on several occasions. Green served that evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yvonne Drake: Master pastry chef at L'Escargot, she came from Paris shortly after the war. A cold &amp;quot;foreigner&amp;quot;, she did not mix easily with the locals. However, she was having a rather obvious affair with Steve Watson. Yvonne was in and out of the kitchen all evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steve Watson: Young, energetic man who come from Boston in 1946. Steve was well liked and was Roger's business partner in many deals. He was president of the local Chamber of Commerce. He dined with Roger and Gastonne that evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gastonne Schmidt: Owner and head chef of L'Escargot. Since his arrival from Paris a year and a half ago, Schmidt had become known as an arrogant yet likable eccentric. He gave the town a bit of European class, and his gruffness only added atmosphere to his establishment in the eyes of the townspeople. He dined with Roger that evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Katie LaFemme: Local party girl with the proverbial heart of gold. Having had a painful on-again-off-again affair with Roger, Katie knew of his dark disposition. She once bellowed from her roost in Jerry's Bar, &amp;quot;Someone ought to put him out of my misery!&amp;quot; She also couldn't remember where she was that evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Includes:&lt;br/&gt;Full Plot Scenario &lt;br/&gt;Character Biographies&lt;br/&gt;Recorded Introduction&lt;br/&gt;24 Clues &lt;br/&gt;Solution&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
