			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s eating you? You seem a little blue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Most would look around in a busy market square and simply hear the prices of today&amp;rsquo;s produce being called out by an old farmer or the fervent haggling of a shady dealer in a back alley. They would see a mix of indistinguishable faces amid the crowd, each trying to get to where they&amp;rsquo;re going as quickly as possible. You, however, see the truth. That old farmer has a tinge of grey in his aura, he is nearing the end of his life and he knows it. The shady dealer is not green with envy or greed but instead purple with compassion: you know they are selling contraband just to get enough money for their wife and kids to scrape by. Each face in the crowd has a color, an emotion, a purpose, and you can sense them all. You, Auramancer, you have the power of the human heart. The ebb and flow of thoughts and feelings, those are your true calling. To help the sick recover both physically and mentally, or perhaps to manipulate those around you to feel how you will them to, that is your vow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 16 page playbook containing over 20 moves and some magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
