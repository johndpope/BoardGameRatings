							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nil-Gotten Gains</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time has come to decide the fate of Dangoro, now more provincially known as Nil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To that end, the Shinto have pulled from their vast network of resources to stage an event that has not been seen in the known realms since the early days of the Empire: the Trials of Merit, once used to resolve the most intractable of conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have sent the call out across all lands, asking for any who deem themselves potentially worthy of Dangoro&amp;rsquo;s throne. And they do mean anyone. Forget wealth. Forget birth. Forget status. If you can pass the trials, you can rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To back this up, they have elicited the heads of all nations to sign a treaty, recognizing the authority and autonomy of whomever may prove victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the most prominent figures in the Ruined Empire converge on Nil, on the trial grounds the Shinto have set up near Dangoro&amp;rsquo;s old capital city. Anyone who has ever had a secret, an injustice, or a grudge follows along, seeking the one bright moment when they can ignore or defy the rules of society that have kept them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shinto call for a civil end to Dangoro&amp;rsquo;s troubled fate. But the soil of Nil thirsts for blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playset is set in The Ruined Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
