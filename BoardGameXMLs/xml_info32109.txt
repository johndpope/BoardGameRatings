							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Electronic Catch Phrase: Music Edition</name>
									
			<description>An electronic music version of the trivia board game.  Two teams sit in such a way that they are in between two of their opponents and facing everyone.  The game is much like Hot Potato; a song and artist appears on the screen of the handheld device.  The player currently holding it must get one of their teammates to correctly guess the name of the song.  They must do this without saying any part of a word on the screen, rhyming any parts of those words, or saying the first letter of any of those words.  When a teammate guesses correctly, the device is passed to the left for the other team to do the same.  The round ends when an internal timer runs out and a buzzer sounds.  The team not holding the device at that time scores a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play, and scoring is different in each.  The first is similar to classic Catch Phrase.  However, if you wish to incorporate singing into the game, the other version adds an extra point for any clue that is sung, if the team guesses correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 9 categories to choose from each round: Pop Mix, 70s, 80s 90s, 2000s, Classic Rock, Hip Hop/R&amp;amp;B, Country, Oldies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires 3 AAA batteries, not included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
