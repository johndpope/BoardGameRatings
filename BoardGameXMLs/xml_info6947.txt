			<description>A dice game in which the player draws the top card and then takes any number of dice with which he attempts to roll the number on the card exactly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIT: If he rolls the number exactly, he scores that many the points and it is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHIT: If he rolls over the target number, all points the over the target number count as negative and are subtracted from his score, which can become negative. His turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not yet decided: If the player does not hit the number on the card, but rolls under the number, the card stays in the game. The following player may then attempt to roll the difference between the first player's roll and the target number, where he also chooses a number of dice from those that remain. He adds his result to the previous one and proceeds as given under HIT or SHIT as appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player's TOTAL roll is over the target number his roll is ignored for progress this round. He loses points. The dice he rolled are returned to the available stock. Each Player has only one attempt per round. If the target number (or the target difference) is exactly achieved by a player then the round ends immediately and the new round begins with the player to the left of the previous starting player. If no more dice are available, or all players have been once, the round ends and the Player closest to the target number (the player with the last valid roll) scores the sum of all valid dice showing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different special cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
