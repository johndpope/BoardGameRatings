							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turnablock</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Turnablock combines the flavor of Othello and the winning strategy of Nim.  It was described in Martin Gardner's column in the February 1979 issue of Scientific American and its winning strategy was later revealed in the following issue.  The game described here differs slightly from the one in the article in the way moves are made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turnablock is played on a board (in this case, 3 x 3 board) with Othello pieces.  Initially the board is filled with the pieces in a checkerboard pattern...Players take turns flipping the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turnablock was written by Manny Juan and published as type-in source code in Creative Computing Vol. 6, No. 8, August 1980.  The source code is presented in BASIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
