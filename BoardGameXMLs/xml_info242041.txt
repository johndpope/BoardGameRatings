							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Early Books on Egyptology to Find on a Bookshelf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 genuine books on Egyptology that could be found on a bookshelf. Each book comes with its name, author and date of publication, and may have additional details, such as original language, translation date and a brief summary of the topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books cover a range of topics, from hieroglyphs and language to histories to lists of kings to culture and religious customs, as well as descriptions and reports of excavations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the books are published prior to 1940, and the vast majority are published before 1930. This makes them most suited to a campaign set in the 1920s or 1930s, although the books can also be used to flesh out bookshelves in more modern eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22. Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs by Alan Gardiner (1927, fully revised in 1950 and again in 1957, overview of the language and writing system of Ancient Egypt)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
