			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a gloomy autumn day. As you are driving innocently up a hill, you suddenly see a car completely blocking the road up ahead, as it is stopped sideways. After desperately hitting the brakes, you witness....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stage is set for what seems to be a tense, edge of your seat race against time. An unprecedented interactive movie in which you have to act in a speedy way and decide correctly in order to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
