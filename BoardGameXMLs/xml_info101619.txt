							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rule of the Zombies</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the peaceful country of Agron where fairness ruled the land and the King was good, strife began to enter. For Galadain the Evil, King of Fernstrana was preparing to invade. Luckily the king's general Daniel thwarted Galadain and killed the Dark Soldier sent from hell by Zeno ruler of Hades. The King with the marriage of his daughter awarded him. Galadain was nowhere to be found, and a price was put on his head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little did people know that Galadain had been to Hades to beg Zeno to open the lost portal to the Other World? Giving in to the request, Zeno opens the sealed portal with the black magic of all the evil gods. Coming from the portal were zombies in the millions. Galadain then found another minor portal and appointed a Zombie King as Guardian of the Portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zombies from the Other World were massed and on the next day that the portal was opened they invaded Agron. As the zombies were invading the local prophet made a prophecy... &amp;quot;Galadain has taken these zombies from the portal that was sealed a century ago. But he has found another one, for there are 2 portals to the Other World. By opening this portal he has doomed this world. Yet there is a chance that this world can survive. But that chance is so small, it is like balancing a pint of water on your sword with no container. But if Nicholas the jester can do that, this world may stand a chance. If the main portal is destroyed first the smaller portal will never be sealed and zombies will rule this world. However if the smaller portal is closed first we may stand a chance against the zombies. The small portal is on the hills of Gold. Keep your swords sharp!&amp;quot; he says. But as he said this a swell of zombies swept over him and killed the old man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witnessing this prophecy you swear to avenge the old man and you think of revenge as you parry the blows of the zombies. You see your elven friend Prismlord and run towards him. &amp;quot;My friend, we must flee and obey the old man.&amp;quot; Prismlord tells you. &amp;quot;OK!&amp;quot; you reply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of you slay at least 50 zombies and finally get out of the country. You head towards the hills where gold was found so few years ago. It was lucky that no gold prospector encountered the portal. Somebody must save Agron and the world. That somebody is you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
