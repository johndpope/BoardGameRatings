							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sunship: A Game of Celestial Creation and Conquest</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunship is a game designed for 2-4 players. The board is divided into 8 orbits and an impenetrable asteroid belt. The orbits are further divided into regions of varying economic and strategic value. Additionally, there are 5 transit hubs which facilitate jumping between orbits. The  object of the game is to eliminate the other players through conquest or, alternatively, to successfully monopolize all transit hubs for an economic victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holding regions of space are the source of income in the game. The value of regions can be increased by constructing and upgrading space stations. To protect valuable regions, force fields may be constructed. Isolating regions behind force fields, however, diminishes their economic output. A player must, therefore, strike a careful balance between security and trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may attack adjacent regions with their fleets of space ships. There are three types of space ships in Sunship. Combat is played out on special cards on which the placement of space ships is significant. Depending on the type of ship, the player may select difficult to hit positions, cloak their attack, or attack from the rear. The combat system is elegant, versatile, and based on basic bit math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
