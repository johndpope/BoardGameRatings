			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fury Triumphant introduces the actors as a direct influence in the outcome of the war both through the simple game mechanics presented here and in our first two adventures, The Madrid Run and For King and Country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the greatest influence the actors can have is upon the fate of the King. In Rocketship Empires the King of Spain is an individual worth saving both symbolically and personally. While the manipulations of his enemies has thrown mud over his reputation he truly has the most noble vision and intentions for his people and for the future of Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the actor&amp;rsquo;s intervention it is possible that the King might be rescued from the present debacle. While the characters work to bring the King and his supporters out of the war with their lives intact they also have the opportunity to have a direct hand in forging the Kingdom in Exile. The Kingdom in Exile is not a defeat in the sense that it does not spell the end of the Kingdom. This newly carved territory can serve as a refuge both for the King and his noble supporters and those colonists loyal to him. It also makes for an incredible future base out of which the characters may launch their adventuring careers, but lets not get ahead of ourselves. The actors first need to survive a string of hair raising, balls to the wall encounters with everything from Mennonites turned cannibal to a half mad&lt;br/&gt;charging Decaceratops to Nazi zombies and worse... much, much worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
