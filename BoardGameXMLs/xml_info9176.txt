			<description>A gameboard is divided into 105 squares, the 49 center squares printed in grey. These are called the Field Squares. The 28 white squares immediately adjoining the field squares are called Entrance Squares or Corridors, 7 on each side of the board. The 28 outside squares are called Home Squares or Lodges, and are colored alternately to match the colors of the Players' Tokens. There are 28 Tokens, 14 of each color chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of each player is to reduce the number of his/her own Tokens to 2. This is done by forming rows of tokens, upon which all but the end tokens may be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
