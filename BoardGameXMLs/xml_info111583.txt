			<description>Sailor Moon (美少女戦士セーラームーン, Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon) is a beat 'em up arcade game developed by Angel in 1993, and ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was translated into French in 1994. The Sega Mega Drive version was developed and published by Ma-Ba, although certain elements were recycled from the Super Famicom version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the first series of Sailor Moon, and the player takes control of one or two of the five heroines (Guardian Senshi). Each Senshi has some sequences of blows , three aerial attacks (neutral, moving forward/backward, downward) and a special charge-up projectile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into five stages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latin Quarter (boss: Bakene)&lt;br/&gt;    Amusement Park (boss: Muurido)&lt;br/&gt;    Secret Machine (boss: Zoisite disguised as Sailor Moon)&lt;br/&gt;    North Pole (boss: Kunzite)&lt;br/&gt;    Dark Kingdom (boss: Prince Endymion and Queen Beryl)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the game is played on Easy Mode, only the first two stages are playable, and the ending only shows a stationary image of the Inner Senshi with Usagi as Princess Serenity from the ending scene although the music does not play at that point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;List of Sailor Moon video games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
