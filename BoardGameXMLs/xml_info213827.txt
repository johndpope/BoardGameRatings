							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planet Corp</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game: &amp;quot;Planet Corp has announced a revolutionary new approach to solve the world's resource problems. Thanks to their latest invention in spacecraft mining, they have discovered a method to extract valuable resources from beneath a planet's surface. Take control of the Planet Corp mining vessel and start extracting for mankind and a better future! But please, don't blow up too many planets in the process.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the arrow keys, control your ship circling the planet and use the space bar to fire torpedoes to mine for resources underneath each planet's crust. Blowing holes in the planet disrupts its stability, but that is the only way to reach the resources. Mine enough resources from each planet before it completely destabilizes to advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
