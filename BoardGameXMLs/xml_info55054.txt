							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Roc Inn</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;An Adventure set in the Arduin Mythos&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the annals of Arduin, the White Roc Inn was the deception of deceptions: a crucible of deadly subterfuge that sucked in the alert and the unwary alike. Who knows what brought on its dark past. Perhaps once it was true and steadfast and fell upon dark times; or, maybe it was always a hidden hand of deception. Either way, evil lurked within to snare the unwitting and unwatchful until brave souls rose up to cleanse it. Soon, it was forgotten in the mist of the past, little thought of except in an occasional tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now it has risen again. Some say it stands as a bastion of sanity in the midst of madness that is the Whisper Trees. While others wonder as the old tales circulate about its unwholesome past, that maybe, not all is as true as its seems...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The White Roc Inn is an adventure suitable for 5 to 8 players of EL 4 to 9, though it can easily scale to include more players or those of lesser level. Even a single or small group of players will find this challenging. The environment allows for easy introduction of the players into game play, with gradual or immediate involvement in the multitude of plots.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
