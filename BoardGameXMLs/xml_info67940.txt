			<description>This game is a &amp;quot;War-Peace&amp;quot; strategy game.  Each player starts the game with a unique &amp;quot;Sealed Orders&amp;quot; sheet which assigns that player a specific color of units, and a list of 4-6 &amp;quot;Peaceful&amp;quot; objectives or 4-6 &amp;quot;War / Agressor&amp;quot; objectives.  Each player selects a secret objective from their list.  Players then take turns placing their units, trying to capture opponents units or to reach their objective.  When a player reaches their objective the game ends and all players add up their victory points to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
