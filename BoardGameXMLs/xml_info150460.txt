							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ice Base Nivayohce</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 40 inch Floor Plan of an Ice Base, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Power's down. Not again. When is that blasted new team arriving with the new generators? Well there are the backups at least. Gear up and get ready to go outside.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Base Nivayohce is a single map of an outside view of a base in an arctic climate. This product includes image files for your virtual tabletop (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Base Nivayohce can be used in modern or science fiction games. Its technology indicates near science fiction game use, but could also be an old abandoned base in a far future science fiction game. It could be used as an arctic or Antarctic base on Earth, a base on Pluto, or any other ice rock or planet in the universe. This base could be a research station or even a small colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ice base relies almost completely on its underground power for both electricity and heat. The power suddenly fails. Backup generators spring to life and restore minimal electricity to the base as temperatures begin to drop. The crew living in the base rush to grab flashlights and grab enough layers of winter clothes to risk going outside in the extreme subzero temperatures. As soon as they are done, the power completely fails, and now they must rely on their flashlights to see. They wander around in the underground part of the base until they find the exit to the surface. They need to get the power back online by heading to the transformers and underground power generators. They also need to be on the lookout for creatures or aliens that took down the power and the backup generators. They may need to kill these creatures or aliens while attempting to restore the power. Meanwhile, they may be only to take exposure to the outside temperatures for a limited amount of time before hypothermia kills them. Can they restore the power in time, while fending off the threats and the cold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another similar idea is that the scenario above already occurred. The group could be the ones rotating in to replace the last crew and need to investigate what happened to the powerless base and the previous missing crew. Or they could find this base on an ice world they are surveying that came up positive for life signs on a bio scanner. Now they need to find out what kind of life lives there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
