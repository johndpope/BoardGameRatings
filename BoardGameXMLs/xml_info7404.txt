			<description>This game recreates a complete battle during the late Colonial period. The basic game covers the second Zulu War, with a Zulu army of six Impis against a smaller, predominately British force. This is the period of the introduction of breech loading rifles and machine guns, wherein small regular forces were thrown against huge native armies with a usual outcome in favor of the regulars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Micro Warfare Series from Tabletop Games. The games in the series were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a mapboard) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used un-cut cardstock counters for the game units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonial&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-C01 British / Egyptian (Sudan)&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-C02 Dervish (Sudan)&lt;br/&gt; TTG-MA-C03 Rorkes Drift Set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
