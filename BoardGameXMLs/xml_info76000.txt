							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zork: Grand Inquisitor</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zork: Grand Inquisitor is a graphical adventure game, developed by Activision  and released in 1997 for the IBM compatible PC and Macintosh  (by MacPlay). It builds upon the Zork and Enchanter series of interactive fiction computer games originally released by Infocom. The cast includes Erick Avari, Dirk Benedict, and Rip Taylor. It is a 'point-and-click' game on 2 CD-ROMs (or one DVD that also includes Zork Nemesis) that allows the player to look around in a full circle of 360 degrees at each pre-rendered location (called 'Z-vision'). This visual freedom applies to the horizontal axis only; looking up and down is restricted, although possible in some locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zork Grand Inquisitor was one of the first computer games to include true closed captioning so that the hearing impaired could play without missing any of the sound effects and spoken dialog in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player character joins forces with the Dungeon Master Dalboz (voiced by Michael McKean), who was imprisoned in a lantern by the Grand Inquisitor, Yannick. Dalboz calls the player &amp;quot;AFGNCAAP&amp;quot;, a satirical, politically-correct initialism for &amp;quot;Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;a joking reference to many adventure games, such as Infocom's original Zork  games, in which the player's character has no identity, name, or background. AFGNCAAP and Dalboz attempt to find three legendary objects that will restore all magic to the realm and bring about the fall of the Inquisitor. The three artifacts are: one of the Cubes of Foundation, the Coconut of Quendor and the Skull of Yoruk. Zork Grand Inquisitor  is set after the events of Zork: Nemesis and before Return to Zork. Zork: The Undiscovered Underground was written and released as a promotional prequel to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
