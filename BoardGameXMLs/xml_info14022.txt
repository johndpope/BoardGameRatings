			<description>The game consists of four different, but similar, 40-piece puzzles, four stand-up partitions to isolate and hide each player's puzzle area, and a picture card for each of the four puzzles. The puzzles are paintings of four different horses, with each in a similar setting, but in a different season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puzzle pieces are mixed and distributed facedown, with 40 pieces to each player. Each player sets up a partition to hide his pieces. The horse pictures are mixed facedown and one is dealt to each player. Each player places his picture in the holder slots of his partition; this is the puzzle that player must assemble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, players turn over their pieces and begin assembling their puzzles. At any time and throughout the game, any player may offer to trade one to four puzzle pieces. When another player agrees to trade that number, they immediately trade those pieces facedown. At any time, a player may call out &amp;ldquo;Hold Your Horses,&amp;rdquo; and designate right, left, or across. All players must immediately pass one puzzle piece in the direction specified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trading continues until one player completes his puzzle. The game may be played by three players by removing one complete puzzle before beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This game was produced by the Springbok puzzle division of the Hallmark Card company. There is no date on either the box or the instruction sheet, so the production year is approximate. Naturally, there is no information regarding who designed the game. It was sold only through Hallmark Card dealers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
