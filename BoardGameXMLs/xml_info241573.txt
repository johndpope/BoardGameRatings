			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hop into the mystery machine and uncover DOUBTFUL TRUTHS in this true conspiracy Deniable Treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's go and check it out, they said. It'll be fun, they said...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now, you've seen things. Things you never should've seen in the first place. Things that caused you to have more questions than answers. And with each question, you fall deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tradition of Twin Peaks and X-Files, Doubtful Truths take you and the gang into the heart of conspiracy county as you try to uncover the truth about the suspicious activities of the past few days. The authorities don't seem to be taking it seriously and the townsfolk are conveniently ignoring the weird events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whys isn't anyone bothered? Do people here know something you don't?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you uncover the truth, will anyone believe you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
