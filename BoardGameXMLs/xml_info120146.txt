			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game's objective is to become mayor and keep the post of mayor, which obviously gives certain advantages during the game. This is done by collecting votes throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the mayor title, it is also to acquire the city's businesses and create jobs for the city. This allows power and affects on each player's ability to gather votes. Money means a lot in the game, but is certainly not the decisive element. It's about playing the game tactically and be part of an alliance at the right time. The player can sit on power at one moment and sit with almost nothing the next minute. It is therefore important to constantly be alert and keep up with what opponents are doing. 2-6 participants. From approx. 9 years. Younger children may have practical roles. The game duration is about 100 min...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial Concept: The concept of Bormesterspillet is very simple. The city's enterprises and businesses buy advertising space on the local board. The prices for advertising slots vary by size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.borgmesterspil.dk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.borgmesterspil.dk&lt;/a&gt; The Game Website].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
