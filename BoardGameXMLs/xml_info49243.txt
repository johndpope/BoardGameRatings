			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is the second in a special series of connected adventures set in the Ley Sector of the Gateway Quadrant, The Border Prowler series is designed to provide a Judge with a ready-made mini-campaign. This scenario is set up in tournament format with handout sheets of information, equipment, and pre-generated characters. This particular mission can be accomplished with only a portion of the resources available in the crew and equipment of the Hrunta. Other crewmembers and other equipment will be called upon in subsequent scenarios. While this scenario is designed to be self-sufficient and run with characters who are on active service, it can be set into an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Auxiliary Patrol Cruiser Hrunta is assigned a mission to travel to the Spinstorme system to investigate the existence of an advanced recon base hinted at by a holographic mural found on Amycus. If anything is found, using special modified scanners, a commando team and a team of analysts will investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
