			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our virtual bodies, our skins, change from role to role. Our consciousness does not. Not much at all. The world changes from scenario to scenario, from campaign to campaign, yet there are things that remain the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is always a difference between the Gamers and us: they must win. They must be entertained. We die, bleed, flee and get raped for their entertainment. It would, for them, sound like a terrible fate, worse than anything else, but for us it's our whole life. What we were created for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We are such things, as dreams are made of,&amp;quot; but what happens when dreams want to live as the dreamer does?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as four PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4-page print-and-play handouts&lt;br/&gt;     18-page print-and-play characters&lt;br/&gt;     1-page announcement poster / cover&lt;br/&gt;     17-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
