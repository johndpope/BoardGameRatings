			<description>The Balance Cup Game (Wing Tat Hang Kee Co. Ltd.) is a simple dexterity game using plastic cups shaped like martini glasses. 20 plastic cups in four colors (including one white cup) are arranged in a pyramid with the white cup at the top. Players roll a special six-sided die that has three sides showing a black cup, and the other three sides showing a dot that is either red, green or yellow. If it shows a colored dot, the player has to remove a cup of the corresponding color. If it shows a black cup, the player can remove a cup of any color. The player who causes the white cup to fall loses, and has to rebuild the pyramid for the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Glass Tower Game (Daiso) is a similar game with the same sort of components but the opposite objective - players roll the die and then stack cups according to the die roll. On a roll of 1 to 4, the player has to stack a cup of the corresponding colour - no action if there are no more cups of that colour. On a roll of 5, the player can stack a cup of any colour, and on a six, the player does not need to stack any cup). The player who puts the last cup on top of the stack wins. Four different structures can be made with the cups, to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
