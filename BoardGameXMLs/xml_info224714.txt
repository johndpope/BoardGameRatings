			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Troll Bridge you play an intrepid messenger competing against other messengers to deliver their messages across a very unstable, Troll-infested bridge. But these aren't your normal Trolls, that would be boring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of Trolls, Ug Trolls which aren't all that smart and would rather smash the bridge and create holes to avoid than get into any kind of friendly small talk. Then there are their smarter counterparts, the Tollosophers which want to chit chat and you have to answer their questions to pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way you can collect Treasure that can help you fight Ug Trolls, hinder your opponents, patch the bridge, and even swap Ug Trolls for Trollosophers and many other interesting and sometimes useful things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just make sure not to die along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their messengers along the bridge one space at a time. Each space reveals a tile that indicates if they fight an Ug Troll, a Trollosopher, or if they have found some treasure and possibly nothing, which grants an extra move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must navigate around holes in the bridge created by Ug Trolls. They can risk death by jumping over a hole and hoping they don't fall through the rickety bridge on the other side. In some cases this may make sections unpassable and players will have to go around those sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeating the Ug Trolls is determined by dice roll to damage the Ug Trolls.  Each turn the Ug Troll remains, the player cannot advance and he knocks out sections of bridge. Defeating a Trollosopher is done by successfully answering their trivia questions. While they remain, they just keep a player from advancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player successfully reaches the end of the bridge. Once that happens, the game is over and the winner is determined by score. Players score points for finishing first, and for each Troll defeated as well as any treasure they have remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
