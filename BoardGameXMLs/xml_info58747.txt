							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soldier&#039;s Companion</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;One Step At A Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rules supplement is a comprehensive collection of options, rules and background for infantry, special forces and intelligence operatives in the Armageddon 2089 Roleplaying Game. While their methods and focus may differ, they have one thing in common: They meet combat face to face, unprotected by tons of armour and weaponry. Whether working for a nation state, a coporation or as part of a mercenary company, foot soldiers in 2089 define versatility, choosing their careers in different fields of warfare, with covert operations and military intelligence as much a part as special forces and demolitions training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soldier's companion opens the way to playing campaigns focusing on the subtler aspects of war, far from the deafening roar of WarMek weapons. The first chapter offers an insight into the meaning of being a soldier in a world where wars are fought between metal titans; who the soldiers are and what they do to stay alive. The Advanced Operative presents prestige classes for soldier and officer characters, broadening their fields of expertise while specialising their talents in a certain area of personal combat and general warfare. new feats follow, with options for honing an operative's skills. Cover missions explores the shady world of espionage and inflitration, while Unconventional Warfare provides a look at the dirty side of war: black ops and irregular warfare. Personal Equiptment provides soldiers with new tools to improve their performance, while Power Armour describes the highly experimental miniature Meks, the fighting change of infantry against WarMeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find everything you need to get down and dirty with the infantry. Lock and load!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
