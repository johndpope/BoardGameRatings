							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HârnMaster Gold: The Shèk-Pvâr</name>
									
			<description>The eagerly anticipated (authorised) K&amp;eacute;thiran magic system is here with all the environment, rules and spells in one volume for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancient, Esoteric Orders of the Sh&amp;egrave;k-Pv&amp;acirc;r have existed for millennia. Their subtle machinations and activities reach throughout the K&amp;eacute;thrian Family of Worlds. No one knows the true extent of the Sh&amp;egrave;k-Pv&amp;acirc;r, but it is hard to imagine K&amp;egrave;th&amp;icirc;ra without them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sh&amp;egrave;k-Pv&amp;acirc;r includes rules and environment (greatly revised and expanded from the Second Edition), more than 200 spells with over 500 bonus effects. There are new articles on Artefacts (including a step by step process for their creation) and on Arcanists (about western L&amp;yacute;thia&amp;rsquo;s most notable scholars). The module includes sections on research (creating new spells), the nature of magic and how it affects the world, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enriched Magick is an extensive set of optional rules which GMs can use to finely tune the very nature of magic in their worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
