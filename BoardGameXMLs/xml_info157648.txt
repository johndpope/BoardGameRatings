			<description>from the Preface:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;written for 5 characters and has a total run-time of 3 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Game Pitch:&lt;br/&gt;It's 1887, you've ridden off the dead lands below into Refuge Colorado. You've come to town for one reason: to kill a demon. You have been told what to do, you have been trained on how to do it, you have the resolve. You even have a secret weapon, that hates the demon more than even you do, that lives only to revenge the demon's rape of Gaia: the so-called &amp;quot;Garou&amp;quot;, a Werewolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Refuge is about to be liberated from its demonic yoke, it is to be washed clean. Washed in your life's blood if need be. But the price may be higher, a price you may be paying for eternity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;The designer's notes say that it would be possible for a GM to run the scenario with the rules from Savage Worlds: Test Drive V6!, but additional work would be required to provide statistics found in Deadlands: Reloaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer also states it would be possible to run this scenario using New World of Darkness or Nemesis rules, but statistics for the pre-generated characters are given in Savage Worlds system terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
