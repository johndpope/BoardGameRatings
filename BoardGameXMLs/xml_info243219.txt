			<description>With this game of skill one block of ice is knocked away around the polar bear. Take care: when the polar bear loses its balance and falls down, you will have lost the game. Slowly and surely the polar bear is standing on extremely shaky ground. By carefully selecting the ice blocks, you can get your opponent's polar bear to fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
