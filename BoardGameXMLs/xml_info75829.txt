			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Guignol is set in a place called Dragontown. Dragontown is halfway to hell on the road that everyone talks about being paved with good intentions. It is ruled over by an organization called The Asylum. The agents of The Asylum will collect you if you deviate too much from the norm. The norm is sin. It's a no win situation, since we know where sinners go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other power of Dragontown is an entity called The Showman. Some have connected him to The Dark Prince of Hell, but no one really knows what his real intentions or origins are. He will encourage you to sin. After all, that's what the people of Dragontown are made of. Here comes The Showman now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
