He struggles with everyday life, until he arrives at his new high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hideaki moves to Okutama on his mother&amp;rsquo;s whim. He never cared much for the old town, mainly because he never remembered much about his childhood, and his everyday life was gloomy and boring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When he first arrives he meets a sweet girl by the name of Chinatsu at an old bridge which seems to have been abandoned long ago. He quickly becomes friends with her and begins to meet with her from time to time on his way to school. He also meets many others, quickly becoming friends with them all.
