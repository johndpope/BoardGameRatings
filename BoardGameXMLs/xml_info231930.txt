			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no longer safe out there! Zombies have overrun the entire city, eating everyone in their path. You have led a small group of survivors to safety, but you notice that you are dangerously low on supplies. To make matters worse, the military has informed you that a rescue team has been dispatched to your location but they are not expected to arrive for another eight weeks. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to survive this, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to send survivors out to find more supplies, barricade your refuge, and kill as many zombies that you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refuge is a resource-management board game of pure survival. As players wait to be rescued by the military, they must recruit survivors to gather supplies and fight off the zombies and the biker gangs. Players will be forced to trade valuable resources with each other and decrease the zombie population to ensure that everyone lives through this nightmare. However, the zombies and the biker gangs are not your only concern. You will have to find food and water, so that you won&amp;rsquo;t starve or die of thirst. Also, certain survivors in your refuge demand a little extra in exchange for offering their services, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t deliver, you and your fellow survivors might not live very long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
