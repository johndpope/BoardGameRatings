			<description>WHAT KIND OF A SOCIETY DO YOU WANT?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy a friendly board game while having stimulating conversation on the most relevant issues of the day. The game may be played with individual competitors or as two competing teams (2 or 3 players per team). Players or teams roll the dice to move around the board to try to secure a set of social policies with assigned values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Each player starts with 100 political chits and earns more when they visit the White House. They may also use their political chits by placing a deposit on those policies they wish to prevent others from securing. The team format is set up as Democratic versus Republican policies, with each team having to secure the requisite value of their party&amp;rsquo;s policies (blue versus red squares) in order to win the game. As players move around the board they may draw Twitter cards which may adjust their political chit totals or send them to different policy squares or to the media scrum or senate hearings squares which might impede their progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The first player or team to secure the requisite value of policies wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare to play this game with your family and friends and find out what they really think!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
