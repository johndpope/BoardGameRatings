			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like stories with twists in them, then you&amp;rsquo;ll love The Twister, a story game of shocks and surprises. The mechanics are designed to make any shocking revelation in your stories have a real impact on play, by changing the rules of the game! Whenever a Twist occurs, things that were easy to do become harder and vice versa, so players have to adapt to a new way of doing things; Twists can either be Major, which affects everybody, or Minor, which only affects one character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play, you&amp;rsquo;ll need the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Players: it&amp;rsquo;s not a game if nobody joins in.&lt;br/&gt;     A GM: someone has to be in charge.&lt;br/&gt;     A plot: the GM needs to know where the story begins and where the Major Twists occur.&lt;br/&gt;     Characters: each player takes on the role of someone important to the plot; sometimes the GM creates these and hands them out, sometimes players make up their own with guidance from the GM.&lt;br/&gt;     Dice: the kind with six-sides; the best kind to use are those that have a symbol in place of the 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
