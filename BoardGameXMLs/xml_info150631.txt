			<description>Each player's force consists of ten pieces. The object of the game is for each player to try to get two of his pieces on to the squares of his opponent. That is, if he starts from the Starred squares, his object is to get two of his pieces on any two of the Crescent squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when one of the players succeeds in getting any Two of his pieces upon the squares from which his opponent's pieces started, or it is won if one of the players entirely destroys the other player's forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
