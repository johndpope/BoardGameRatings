							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dodge Racer</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slip behind the wheel of your racer. You are looking at six full lanes of glowing white dots, and all you have to do is scoop them up! As you move your joystick, the engine revs and the action begins. You speed around the track, picking up points, while the computer jam car hops lanes trying to crash, head-on, into your racer. Lightning reflexes and skill are the only way to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you keep jumping lanes, barely avoiding your foe, suddenly, the jam car doubles its speed and rockets towards you at an insane pace... Sound tough? It is... And if you clear the whole track...you get to try again for more points with a more aggressive jam car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dodge Racer is an arcade-style game with real-time machine language, graphics and sound. The computer controls one or two jam cars, bent on one thing--destroying your racer! The 16 game options, for up to four players, let you and your friends spend hours challenging the computer or playing against each other in this split second race for your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
