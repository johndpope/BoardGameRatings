			<description>A three-dimensional seek-and-find game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To find your opponent's treasure chest and return to your home base without getting blown up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on game sheets that represent a three-dimensional playing area. Each player has his own sheet, while a third sheet is placed face-up on the table. This is the common map. You have one treasure chest and eight bombs to place on the playing field. Secretly choose an unoccupied square that that is on the same level as your home base for your treasure chest. Once you've placed your treasure chest, secretly place eight bombs by marking their locations on your private map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you have three choices of what you can do: step, scan, or defuse. Using these actions, you attempt to find your opponent's home base (where his treasure chest is.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you end your turn in your home square while carrying your opponent's treasure chest, then you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules and the game sheets are available here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/306/Cube%20Digger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/306/Cube%20Digger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
