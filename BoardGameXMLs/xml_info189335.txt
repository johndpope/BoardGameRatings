			<description>The game consists of a board showing an 18 hole golf course which lists the par for each hole, 5 special 6 sided dice, one four sided die, four player tokens and four packs of 100 cards, one pack for each player.&lt;br/&gt; Holes are either par 3, 4 or 5 and there is a unique die for each par which the player rolls first on a hole. Depending on their roll result they will then have to roll a second time/die and depending on this result, may have to roll yet another die.&lt;br/&gt; Depending on the roll results players will select cards from their deck which record their scores. &lt;br/&gt; After an agreed number of holes players add up their selected cards to determine their final score and the lowest wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
