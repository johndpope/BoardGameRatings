			<description>Minion Master is the premier title from BitFlip Games that seamlessly combines elements of tabletop gaming, turn based and real-time strategy, and collectible card building games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minion Master is a Digital Board game that brings together the moment-to-moment tactics of collectible card games with the long-term strategy of miniature war gaming. Players control armies of figurines on a hex-based board and summon their Minions using a custom built deck of cards. Minion Master will boast a Deck Builder, 6 player co-op and versus multiplayer, a Level Editor, and a constantly expanding universe of Minions to control. Players who pre-order get instant access to the game's Alpha and Beta phases.
