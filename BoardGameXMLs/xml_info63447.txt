							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Run of the River</name>
									
			<description>Run of the River is an interactive board game designed to promote discussion and understanding of environmental flow issues in relation to river health. It was conceived as an educational tool in secondary schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run of the River is played in two levels with the possibility of a different winner for each level.&lt;br/&gt;The winner of level one is the player who has collected the most water discs by the time each remaining player has reached the the mouth of the river (marked finish). Water discs are collected and discarded according to 'People Power' cards which are drawn when 'Water Ways' cards, containing river trivia (or 'rivia'), are played according to spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;The winner of level two is the player who has the highest combined value of water discs, water licenses and money by the time each remaining player has reached the mouth of the river. Water licenses, which hold a high value in the game, may be bought and/or traded.&lt;br/&gt;If a player runs out of water discs or money, they are out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
