			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a place on the world of Porphyra called the Theater of Arrival, though no plays are found there. What is found there is a ring of twenty-seven stones, all an odd maroon color. The stones lie pm a field of glass, as if some great heat, light or pressure had been brought to bear on it. Though no play is performed here, there is art, of a sort. Each of the stones bears several images, three, in fact, two of which are the same on every stone, and one different. The similar images bookend the different on each stone, and appear as the engraving of a tall, thin humanoid with pointed ears, and a muscular humanoid with tusk-like fangs and fierce demeanor. It is said that if you look at the images long enough, in that wind-swept place, they start to look more and more like each other. The central image of each stone is unique. It is here that the elven runecasters and orcish runereapers triggered The Calling and irrevocably changed the face of Porphyra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This third release in the Legendary Classes lines presents two alternate classes for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Runecaster (alternate alchemist)&lt;br/&gt;     Runereaper (alternate barbarian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The runecaster is a voiceless spellcaster who is able to shape the fundamental aspects of magical power, leave behind invisible explosive runes, and unlock the powers of legendary treasures quicker than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The runereaper is an arcane-fuelled warrior that is first into battle. Using the runes carved into his flesh he is able to activate many additional combat powers multiple times per day. The more he defeats enemies in combat, the more he can access his runes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, favored class bonuses are listed for all the Porphyran playable races just like we showcased in Legendary Classes:Covenant Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The runecaster class uses the Word of Power mechanic from Ultimate Magic by Paizo Publishing, you will need access to that book or one of the many Pathfinder SRD sites to access the additional material needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
