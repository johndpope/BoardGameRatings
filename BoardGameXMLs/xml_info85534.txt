			<description>Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu is an action platform video game produced by Hudson Soft. It was first released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 and for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot revolves around Jackie Chan with his sister Josephine being supreme kung fu champs, guarding the country against evil until the Prince of Sorcerers, a green-skinned villain with magical powers attacks Jackie and kidnaps his sister. Jackie embarks on an adventure to stop the Prince of Sorcerers and his minions and save his sister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Jackie Chan, the well-known martial arts  stunt master, and brawls against many enemies during his quest to save his sister. The game is played through five levels (each with a boss at the end).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, The player would encounter frogs that carry power-ups or bowls, (which are items in the game that restore health), but the frogs would have to be hit in order for the item to be obtained. Power-ups can allow the player to do a special type of attack over a limited amount of times (although the player is only able to carry one power-up). The player is also able to charge a special beam-like attack, although it can only be used up to five times. Most of the enemies that the player defeats will drop green orbs. If the player collects 30 orbs, life will be replenished (as well as the 5 charged shots).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player dies, all of the orbs and power-ups are lost and must be gained again. The player only has 1 life in the game, but may continue up to five times initially. Extra continues may be earned through the bonus stages throughout the game, which are levels triggered by bells in the levels which transport Jackie to the bonus stages, each of which have a 30-second time limit and usually involve jumping on clouds or hitting statues to earn points. At the end of 30 seconds, those points are tallied and may also be used to buy extra lives and special attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version Differences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In NES version, collecting 30 orbs will replenish health and charged shots. In TurboGrafx-16 version, 100 orbs are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In TurboGrafx-16 version, some enemies don't drop orbs at all while other enemies drop one to several orbs, when killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In TurboGrafx-16 version, there are more enemies and many enemies take more hits to kill than in NES version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TurboGrafx-16 version has 2 extra mid-bosses who appear at 4th and 5th stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are major differences in level layout and boss behavior between the two versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the enemies and their attacks are different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
