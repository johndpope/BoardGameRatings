			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn-based strategy game played between your ship and enemy ships.  Both have shields and hull capacities before being destroyed and several types of weapons with different ranges  that inflict damage.  You can eliminate the enemy or find the jump gate to defeat each level.   There is a plot-line about being lost in space and searching to find trading posts and allies, but the main attraction is the board-game style of play.  Graphics are basic and the music minimal, mostly to warn about enemies or shield elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
