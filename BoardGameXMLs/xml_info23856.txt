			<description>Armed with the beverage of their choice, players of BULYAH take turns rolling dice and moving around the board, trying to collect enough Letter Cards to spell the word, &amp;quot;BULYAH.&amp;quot;  In true board game fashion, there are stops along the way that try to prevent players from reaching their goal.  These stops are what make the game interesting  and bring the drinking into the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before play begins, a 4-ounce glass is filled to the brim with the beverage of everyone&amp;rsquo;s choice and is placed in the middle of the board. The &amp;quot;Grave&amp;quot; will be consumed many times throughout the game, as players either land on a &amp;quot;Grave Stone&amp;quot; space on the board or are instructed to do so by one of the 100 Action Cards.  When an Action Card is drawn, the player must follow the command designated.  These can range from announcing, &amp;quot;I am stupid&amp;quot; before taking a drink, to revealing one of your most embarrassing moments, to acting as servant to all of the other players by refilling their drinks, and even making up your own rule as the &amp;quot;Rule Master.&amp;quot; Oh yeah, be weary of the Prison and Hospital spaces, however, you can gain relief by hiding out in the &amp;quot;Safety Zone&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: One party board, 100 Action cards, 60 Letter cards, two die, and six tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
