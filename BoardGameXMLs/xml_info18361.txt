							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman &amp; Robin: Put Mr. Freeze on Ice Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To earn the most points as you try to be first to build a 3-by-3 grid showing only Heroes and Batmobiles. How? Match the colored edges on the cards. Easy...until the bad guys show up! When they do, you must cover them up with a Hero, because you can't finish your grid until every Villain is buried!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
