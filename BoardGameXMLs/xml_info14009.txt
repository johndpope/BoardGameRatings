			<description>In this matching game, players try to find matching special objects on cards. The special objects are: a boy, girl, moon, tree, ball, boat, car, cat and hat. Each card has a picture of a dog and two special objects (for example a dog playing with a ball next to a tree, or a dog next to a tree with a boat on a lake in the background). The board has a 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid with each square containing a special object picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, the top card of the deck is turned over for all players to see. Then a second card is turned over on top of the first. The first player to call out the matching special object on both cards places a chip on the game board space whose picture depicts the object called. If a player calls an incorrect match, the player must remove a chip. If no objects on the cards match, another card is played on top of the pile and players look for matches on it and the card just below it. The first player to get 3 chips in a row on the game board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
