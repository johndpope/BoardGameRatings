							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolling Freight: Natural Disaster Cards</name>
									
			<description>The Natural Disaster Cards are a set of promotional cards for the Rolling Freight game.  Natural Disasters are shuffled into the contract deck during setup - one into the &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo; phase and two into the &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; deck. During the game, when a natural disaster card is drawn from the contract deck, draw a completed contract card at random and remove that link from the game board, along with all saturation markers at both ends of the link. Finish filling the contract track. Finally, place the destroyed contract face-down on top of.its deck. If multiple disasters are drawn while filling the track, destroy additional completed contracts and place them face down on top of the deck, in the order they were drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
