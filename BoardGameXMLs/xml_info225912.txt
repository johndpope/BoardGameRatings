			<description>This mid-19th century game is quite different from the asymmetric movement game of the same name. This is strictly a die-rolling game, albeit also asymmetrical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a rectangular sheet of paper showing six artillery pieces behind earthworks firing at a multi-turreted castle. The castle walls are marked with 28 combinations of 2D6, some duplicated, while four piles of rocks in front of the castle are marked with doubles 1 through 4. (The main gates are marked with doubles 5 and 6.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above the castle are six spaces decorated with artillery pieces, each with a single 2D6 combination, and empty squares covering the rest of the possibilities. Players roll 2D6 alternately, and to win, the attacking player must destroy all the segments of the castle before the defending player rolls the six combinations needed to destroy his guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game name and publication date of 1840 are handwritten on the reverse of the game sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
