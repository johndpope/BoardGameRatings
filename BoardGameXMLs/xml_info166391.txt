			<description>Meazy N More! is essentially a game system, comprising 144 dice &amp;mdash; 36 for each player, 6 each in 6 colors.  You can play with two copies of the game to allow 5&amp;ndash;8 players.  An unusual feature of this game system is that there are core rules that all the games use.  The core rules instruct players to roll their dice, form legal combinations for the game they're playing, then put their unused dice back in their &amp;quot;rolling bins&amp;quot;, and pass them to the left.  Each such round of veritable drafting is called a &amp;quot;shake&amp;quot;.  Shakes continue until someone wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meazy N More! comes with rules for four games built upon those core rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In Eazy Meazy (30 minutes, ages 5+), you must build a &amp;quot;pyramid&amp;quot; of dice: 1&amp;times;1 though 6&amp;times;6; however, each &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; of one number must be a different color, and once a die is assigned to a level, that level's color is locked.&lt;br/&gt;     Not So Eazy Meazy (30 minutes, ages 5+) differs from Eazy Meazy by allowing the player to choose on the fly which number goes in each level; rearranging is completely legal.&lt;br/&gt;     Meazy Street (90 minutes, ages 8+) is the featured game (ages 8+). In addition to forming a pyramid, you must form a &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;rainbow&amp;quot;, but these things must be done in a particular sequence. Unlike the previous two games, you calculate your score for the round based on the combinations you form.&lt;br/&gt;     Splitting Headache (90 minutes, ages 8+) is billed as a bonus game. In this game, you try to form the four different types of &amp;quot;splits&amp;quot;, after which you may work to form the &amp;quot;banana split&amp;quot; out of the remaining dice. You calculate your score for the round based on the splits you formed by the time the round ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further games for the system will be released as expansion packs and/or downloads from the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
