			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bekunn hails from a planet where the government was greatly alarmed by humanity's ability to mutate into wildly unpredictable and sometimes suprisingly destructive forms. His scientific mission to Earth was to analyze the human genome, isolate the genetics that could cause such transformations, and develop a method to retard or remove it from the humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His unique technology, however, drew unwanted attention from the local villains resulting in disaster. Now he was trapped in one possible genetic lineage of humanity, able to metamorphosize into a primitive beast or an advanced psion. Cut off from his people, he seeks to rebuild his machines and re-establish communication with his world. As the criminal EVOLVO, he has the means to do so and complete his mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
