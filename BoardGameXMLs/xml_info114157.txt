							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Tiamat</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Unique&amp;quot; is the best way to describe Tiamat, the youngest of the four 7th Heaven Knights that serves Elisabetta Bardados. A lazy womanizer, but with a god like talent for fighting is also another way. Making him sit up and take things seriously is the last thing his enemies would ever want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Empire Optional Leader Warrior/Prowler - Lv. 60&lt;br/&gt; At 6 | Dm 4 | Df 10 | Ar 2 | LP 15 | Re 10 | Mo 12/16 | AP 3/5&lt;br/&gt; Innate Abilities: Initiative&lt;br/&gt; Cancer: Tiamat can make melee Attacks on targets within 4 inches of himself. Charges are not affected by this ability.&lt;br/&gt; ooo - Awe of the Forgotten (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt; This attack rolls 2 dice and keeps the highest. If this Attack causes damage, its target suffers Seal Lv. 1. Effect 16.&lt;br/&gt; oo - World of Wires (Ki, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; Move an enemy unit within Tiamat&amp;rsquo;s Control Zone 4 inches in the direction of your choice. This ability can be used to move Characters Engaged in Combat. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt; o - Wires of Destiny (Ki, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; Tiamat gains Haste Lv. 3. Limit: Once per game.&lt;br/&gt; His true power&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt; Optional Leader: You may choose to use this skill card when you include Tiamat in your group. If you do, Tiamat gets +5 Levels, has the abilities on this card, and is a Leader.&lt;br/&gt; Perfect Defense: While Tiamat hasn&amp;rsquo;t moved during a turn, all Ranged Attacks that target him automatically miss and no roll is made for them. Once Tiamat has moved during a turn, this ability won&amp;rsquo;t have any affect until the beginning of the next turn.&lt;br/&gt; ooo - Starlight Romance (Ki, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; All enemy units within Tiamat&amp;rsquo;s Control Zone suffer Paralyze Lv. 1. Effect: 15.&lt;br/&gt; Limit: Once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
