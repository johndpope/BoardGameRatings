			<description>This is a simple game designed to teach children the difference between right and left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by rolling a die and moving one of two pieces on a board, trying to collect stamps from a stamp pad on a sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two shared pieces: Lisa the cat, who always travels to the left (clockwise); and Rex the dog, who always travels to the right (counter-clockwise). There are corresponding stamps for each animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a circular track on the board with three types of space: dog, cat, and &amp;quot;restless bear.&amp;quot; Players roll a die that moves either Lisa or Rex 1 to 3 spaces, being sure to announce which direction they are going (&amp;quot;Lisa is moving to the left.&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the moving animal lands on its own type of space, the player collects a stamp of that animal on their sheet. Four stamps of any one animal (either Lisa or Rex) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the animal lands on the opposite animal space, nothing happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the animal lands on a restless bear space, the player may still collect a stamp, but only if they do something with the correct side of the body.  For example, if Lisa lands on a bear space, a player might say &amp;quot;Lisa is waving her left paw.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on the other animal, they get a stamp from both; if this is on a restless bear space, however, they must first do something with both sides of their body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
