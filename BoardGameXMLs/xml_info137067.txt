			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Fantasy: All the Bravest is a 2D touch-action RPG featuring large groups of former Final Fantasy characters.  The player initially controls only characters representing different jobs (Black Mage, Thief, Knight, and so on) from former Final Fantasy games, but unique characters (Cloud from Final Fantasy VII, or Setzer from Final Fantasy VI, for example) can be purchased.  Purchased characters are chosen at random from a set of 35 characters.  Each controlled character can attack when a timing bar fills up (similar to the ATB system of earlier Final Fantasies, such as IV and VI).  Each character only does one action (an attack of some kind), and performs that action when the screen area they occupy is swiped or tapped.  Characters hit are out of the fight for three minutes, but can be brought back into the battle through the use of a purchasable item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
