							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How to Play Roleplaying Games</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction to the document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past ten-plus years of my life, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing roleplaying games. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing them for much longer. Back when I started, you could abbreviate &amp;ldquo;roleplaying game&amp;rdquo; to RPG without people immediately thinking about &amp;ldquo;rocket propelled&lt;br/&gt;grenades&amp;rdquo; and the acronym is still around causing&lt;br/&gt;trouble today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve watched the market bulge, shrink, grow, recede and, constantly, change. The consensus as I write this is that the hobby is shrinking. To counteract that, of course, we need to recruit new players.  Hopefully, that&amp;rsquo;s you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;This is Greg Stolze's advice on being a non-GM player in a roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
