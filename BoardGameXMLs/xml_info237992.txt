							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Human Shields</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemy have taken over a small university campus, fortified it as a base, and appear (from satellite photos) to be keeping human shields (POWs and civilians) scattered around the place to discourage your side from shelling the crap out of it. They also might &amp;ndash; without realising it &amp;ndash; have got their hands on a prisoner with huge propaganda value. The PCs&amp;rsquo; mission is to sneak to where they can recce the situation, get eyes on the POWs and see if this Person of Interest is there. Then &amp;ndash; if possible &amp;ndash; mount a rescue and/or act as forward observers to direct fire onto the bits of the base not draped in your own guys. Options (from realistic to cinematic) are given for player groups to liberate some or all of the prisoners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human Shields is a system agnostic (i.e. systemless) military science fiction scenario. Resources for the GM include: maps; enemy tactics and objectives; bios for a few NPCs with whom the PCs can utilise on this mission; and data on the planet and the regional fauna. Nothing is statted up &amp;ndash; the idea is you use your favourite system and/or slot it into a campaign in whatever setting you fancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
