			<description>A game whose aim is to improve your mastery of the Gaelic language. The game focuses on increasing players' exposure to 12 frequently-used, improper Gaelic verbs. An audio cassette is included so that players can hear native speakers pronouncing Gaelic words and phrases. Players roll a D6, land on a numbered square of the colorful board, and refer to one of six laminated lists to find the corresponding instructions for that space. The instructions are written in Gaelic, and the current player must respond to the instructions correctly. The winner is the first player to get his token to the end of the board. Players are to speak entirely in Gaelic while playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
