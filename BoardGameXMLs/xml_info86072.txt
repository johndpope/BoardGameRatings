			<description>A long time ago, the Patapon Ancients fearlessly traveled in search of a land called Earthend, home to a mysterious object known as IT. Led by their god, the Mighty One, no foe or creature could stand in their way. Their adventures grew to be a legend spoken for generations. But that was the past. Now the descendants of the Patapon Ancients live in the desolate frontier, driven from their home by the evil Zigoton army. To return to their home and vanquish their enemies, they need their god to return and beat mystic drums to lead them to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are their god. You led them through the first Patapon&amp;reg; world, mastering six different drumbeats to command the Patapon troops to march, attack, defend, power up, retreat, and use magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You beat the drums of victory in Patapon&amp;reg; 2 with new Heroes and warriors, building an army to uncover Patapolis, an ancient place long spoken of by the Patapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now they need your drums once again in Patapon&amp;reg; 3. Don&amp;rsquo;t let them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devastate your opponents with attacks as Superhero Patapon in the third iteration of the critically acclaimed rhythm-based action adventure. Play campaign with friends, go head-to-head, or even take on a clan of other Patapon gamers with network play allowing up to eight people. Customize your tribe with different weapons and abilities in the greatest portable adventure of rhythm and war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
