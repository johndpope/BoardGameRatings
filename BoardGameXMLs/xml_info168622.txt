			<description>&amp;gt;&amp;hellip;incoming transmission&amp;hellip;receiving PCX1g82&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;hellip;engaging PCX1g82 [auto-msg]&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;hellip;engaged&amp;hellip;[auto-msg: The leader in intergalactic Space Bean cultivation, trade and shipment, Space Coffee is here. To make your first cup our first priority&amp;hellip;[end].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Space Coffee is a morning-time space race for 1-4 'rising' coffeenauts, and takes about 15-30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Requires one cup/pot/french press/espresso machine/device of coffee (or other beverage), Space Coffee Star Map, 2d6, 7x Space Beans/tokens, 12x Ships/tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Players roll 2d6 and add the values together to generate energy (e). Energy is used to ready or move Ships, avoid black holes, engage in Space Battle, and to harvest or deliver Space Beans to Morning Star - &amp;ldquo;the premium intergalactic coffee roasting non-stop shop&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy Guage&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 8e - You may not ready a Ship. &lt;br/&gt;- Use only the highest die as Energy points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;le; 8e - You may ready one Ship or dock at the Outpost.&lt;br/&gt;- Use only the lowest die as Energy points.&lt;br/&gt;Always remember the age-old adage: &amp;ldquo;If you ready a Ship, take a sip!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Ships are readied at a player's home Outpost and sent out for Space Bean collection and delivery. But space is weird and movement can be difficult in certain areologies. A simple areology index shows how much more energy is required when entering a hex of different types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Areology Index&lt;br/&gt;Black Space &amp;mdash; 1e to enter; sip at will&lt;br/&gt;Planet - 1e to enter&lt;br/&gt;Space Haze &amp;mdash; 2e to enter; a sip of coffee upon exit&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids &amp;mdash; 3e to enter; a sip of coffee upon exit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;But beware of black holes! At the start of every turn, any Ships within a 2-hex (or 3-hex for increased difficulty) radius are 'pulled' 1-hex towards that black hole! 'Pulled' in? Gone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Made it to a planet with a Space Bean on it? Gotta harvest that puppy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvest a Space Bean from a Planet - 1e&lt;br/&gt;-Ships carrying Space Beans may only move up to 2 hexes per turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Deliver Space Beans to Morning Star by moving through its hi-tech non-stop-drop trackway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter an adjacent Black Space hex with an open opposite Black Space hex and successfully move to the opposite hex.&lt;br/&gt;Delivery &amp;mdash; 2e; a sip of coffee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Docking a Ship at an Outpost lets you move any one of your Ships 1-hex in any direction at the start of your turn. And some of the old outposts have copper-coil showers, and a shower is a good thing out in deep space. But bear in mind, it only takes entering a docked Outpost hex with +3e to return a docked Ship to that player's supply!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;Thought you were safe anywhere else in space? Think again! Engage in Space Battle by moving into an occupied hex with +2e remaining! Steal a Space Bean by rolling &amp;gt;3 with the unused die! Force an opponent into an occupied hex, destroy him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;The game is over when all Ships have returned to a player&amp;rsquo;s outpost (total win), or when a player&amp;rsquo;s Black Hole has devoured all of the coffee in the cup/coffee pot/french press/espresso machine/device that started the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
