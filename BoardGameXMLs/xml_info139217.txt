							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red October</name>
									
			<description>Red October was published in Combat! #5. It is a highly abstracted political conflict game about the situation in Russia from February-October 1917.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four players represent the Provisional Government, the General Staff, the Bolsheviks, and the Anarchists. They all can place political factors in the boxes in the various areas on the board and attack other player's factors (using a standard wargame CRT). Some players have other options: the Provisional Government can announce an offensive against the Central Powers, the General Staff can try for a coup in a given area, and the Bolsheviks can try to seize power, which may result in their getting control of some areas (and ends the game regardless).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a different set of moderate and decisive victory conditions. It is possible for more than one player to achieve a victory condition. Negotiations are encouraged by the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
