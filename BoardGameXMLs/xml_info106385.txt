							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black &amp; White: Creature Isle</name>
									
			<description>Black &amp;amp; White: Creature Isle is an expansion pack for the PC game Black &amp;amp; White by Lionhead Studios. This expansion pack focuses on the creature and there are no levels as there were in the original game. It is played as a separate game, and presents several main differences from the original Black &amp;amp; White game.&lt;br/&gt;The story of this game involves the player controlling his or her creature (either a new one or the creature they used in Black &amp;amp; White) and completing missions, which are given to the player by members of a Brotherhood. The members are all creatures that are not controlled by a god, and they all wear bracelets to show their membership in this Brotherhood. Once the player completes a mission, they can then fight the creature that gave them the mission or choose to fight that creature again or use that creature at will. Once the player has successfully completed all the missions and won all the fights, they will be able to see Eve and have a baby pet for their creature. The player's pet will then have a pet, which can help both the creature and the player. Also, there is the speed miracle, though no skirmishes included in the game carry it. It can be used to get past various trials more easily. If the player does not have a creature of certain height, the creature will be enlarged. It will also automatically know the three basic spells (food, water, and wood). The default creature for newly created profiles in Creature Isle is the Ape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Black &amp;amp; White: Creature Isle&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
