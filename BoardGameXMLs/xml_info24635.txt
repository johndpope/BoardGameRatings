			<description>Description from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MYSTERY HISTORY GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carmen is hiding somewhere in time - your mission is to check each century on the game board until you find her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, you'll race to put historical events in their correct order. Then, match stolen loot to its correct century. Is Paul Revere's horse from the 18th century or the 17th? Did it appear before or after Pocahontas saved Captain John Smith? You'll find out as you track Carmen in this exciting game that brings history to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
