			<description>Welcome to the Colortopia, a realm of happiness filled with colors where people like to put all kinds of colors on themselves and in their life, too. It's time for the Color Festival to come around! The Color Contest is one of the biggest days of the year; everyone is ready for it. Let's see who will win the title of the Color Master?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colortopia is a real-time game of good sighting and some logical reasoning in which players rotate and flip their color cards to complete different color patterns based on color mixing and color contrast to earn color chips. The color chips can even be mixed to become a new color and get you more points! Whoever has the most points at the end is crowned the Color Master and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
