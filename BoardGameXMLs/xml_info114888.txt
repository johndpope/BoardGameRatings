			<description>Save Max the robot from the recycling plant in Back Home, a free online platform adventure for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max worked in a restaurant as a waiter but the time came when he was too old to do much, so his boss bought a new robot to replace him. Max was then shipped off to the recycling plant and prepared to be turned into spare parts, when he decided he didn't want any part of that. Now, Max is on a mission to escape and find his way back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Max on this fun journey to break out of the recycling plant. Travel through 15 maze-like levels battling harvesters, finding keys, and locating the exit. Collect to upgrade Max, locate batteries for extra energy, and use portals as shortcuts. Can you make your way out of this tricky dilemma?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
