							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CRMA: The Battle for Colony ZXC123</name>
									
			<description>The futuristic colony ZXC123 is under attack by an enemy group known as the Boss Squad. Four members of the colony have been given CRMA (Combat-Ready Mechanized Armor), highly upgradeable equipment that they'll use to protect their colony and fight off the Boss Squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this solo roguelike game, players work through the card deck, fighting enemies and dealing with events around the colony. The order of these is randomized through shuffling, and each encounter is removed from the deck after resolution. Cards also act as items that the player can attach to their CRMA to increase their effectiveness, trade at caravans for other items, or break down during combat to influence dice rolls. Card backs are used as vital stats indicators, and two of these are removed from each game for the player character, further randomizing each game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to build up your CRMA's strength to the point where you can defeat three Boss characters in combat. If you run from three Bosses, you lose. If you only defeat two bosses and the deck runs out, you still win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
