			<description>Schmetterling (=butterfly) contains 44 flower tiles, 20 butterfly tiles and 4 tokens for each player. The flower tiles are diagonally separated into 2 halves showing two parts of a flower. Both halves have also a number on it (0-4). The butterfly tiles have numbers from 4 - 24.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles are laid on the table like in dominoes: flower parts must have the same colors are adjacent flower parts. Every time, when a player lays the 4th flower part, a whole flower is completed and that player gets a butterfly card and puts a token on the flower to mark it as his flower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the first player has put all his 4 tokens on the table, the tile laying phase ends and the final calculation is done. The numbers on all 4 parts of completed flowers are summarized and if the player possessing it has a butterfly tile with that number, he scores these points. Winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
