			<description>Inquisitor is a role playing game which means that the main character will travel the game world, communicate with other characters and, of course, fight. The story of the game revolves around an investigation of crimes against God and King. With your main character you will search for clues of dangerous as well as cunning criminals, gather evidence against them and convict them. Accomplishment of most tasks is therefore bound to obtaining a sufficient number of convincing evidences that will allow you to exhibit a charge against a certain character and arrest him or her subsequently. According to the Inquisitorial Codex, anything that can prove the guilt of the suspect may be used as an evidence. Most often it will be testimonies of witnesses and corpus delicti but it can also be for example logical deductions of the main character implied from other, seemingly unrelated information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
