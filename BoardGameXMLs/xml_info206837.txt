			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A hilarious party game in which players go head-to-head in debates about totally different topics.&lt;br/&gt;    Challenges like &amp;quot;Speak Like a Pirate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Do Yoga Poses&amp;quot; add to the fun.&lt;br/&gt;    Compact and easily portable, small enough to fit in a medium-sized purse or hold in one hand.&lt;br/&gt;    Includes 500 Topics, 75 Challenges, 1 Alternate Case card, a spinner and a 30-second timer.&lt;br/&gt;    All game elements feature original drawings by Sam Birchman, a Seattle-based artist (except timer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sway is a hilarious, positive party game in which players go head-to-head in &amp;quot;debates&amp;quot; about totally different topics - the catch is they can only discuss the POSITIVES of those topics, even when the topic seems negative on the surface (e.g. &amp;quot;Locking Your Keys in Your Car.&amp;quot; To add to the fun, both players complete the same challenge while making their case; things like &amp;quot;Speak in a Southern Accent&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dance the Robot.&amp;quot; A judge is decided at the end of the round and awards cards as they see fit for the topic, challenge or both. Sway is a simple game that brings people together, induces laughter, and helps show the good in all things. It exposes sides of your friends, family or co-workers you've never seen before. Imagine hearing your grandma discuss the positive aspects of a getting fired in her best (or worst) Scottish accent - that's what Sway is like. It&amp;rsquo;s fun and funny, but not anyone else's expense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
