			<description>A game of inner city crime, drug dealing, and gang violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hoodrats is a hybrid Euro-Trash game containing 44 meeples, 15 dice, 88 tokens, 36 cards, a fat wad of paper money, and a bag of oregano (fake weed) which is the first player marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with 5 &amp;quot;Hustlers&amp;quot; and a special gang ability available only to their gang, and place them on the 4 locations to buy drugs of 4 different kinds, 14 spaces to sell drugs on, the Funeral Home, where they can recruit the family members of killed gang members, the bail bondsman where they can purchase a bond to release incarcerated gang members, the gun store where they buy guns, or their 'Hood, where they can initiate drive-by shootings against enemy Hustlers who are on corners to sell drugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hustlers are placed in turn, where players may place up to three Hustlers at once on most locations. Once all of the players' Hustlers are placed, each player, in turn, then activates one space and performs the actions which that space allows. Each corner allows players to sell one drug based on the icon shown, and may roll the Dope Dice (3 custom dice) in which depict a different drug on 4 faces (Weed, Meth, Coke, Heroin), a wild card on the fifth face, and finally, an arrest warrant on the sixth. For each face rolled players may sell one matching drug token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If 2 gangs occupy a corner, the person who activates the corner initiates a robbery. No matter who wins, someone's going to the Emergency room, with one Beat Down token for each opposing Hustler that robbed him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, a card is drawn and has either a persistent effect which lasts the entire round or a one time effect, as well as that night's prices to buy and sell drugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a set amount of rounds, the richest gang wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
