			<description>A mighty, evil Knight has occupied the castle and taken the princess prisoner. Now, the most courageous knight in the whole country try to cross the moat as quickly as possible in order to free the poor princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a separate track for each player that leads to the castle. if a player rolls a 1-3 he can lay the corresponding number of bridge-cards along his track or move his knight. You can only move your knight on squares on which there is already a bridge card. If the player rolls the symbol &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot;, he may steal any bridge-card from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player succeeds in moving his knight onto the last square on his track he has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a promotional playmobil(R)-figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
