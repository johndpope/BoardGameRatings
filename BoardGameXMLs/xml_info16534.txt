							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grolsch Master Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is the film buff and who knows most about beer? Who is the sports freak of the party and who is Mr(s). Know-it-all? Maybe there's a talented sketch-artist or actor in the room. If you are blessed with all these talents, or you are just plain lucky, you stand a high chance to become 'Master of the Game'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the Grolsch Master Game and test yourself. Play, roll the dice and become 'Master of the Game'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;Try to reach the finish first with your swing-top bottle, pay the bill and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay synopsis With your swing-top bottle you travel from start to finish. Along the way you need to answer various questions or fulfill assignments. But watch out! Every ring brings you closer to the finish, but the questions and assignments become more difficult too. You go from one ring to the next via the doorman ar an open door. But... you don't reach the finish that easily. First you will need to make sure that you have paid your bill. With the beer voucher you won, you can pay the innkeeper. You win these vouchers by correctly answering the questions or fulfilling the assignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grolsch Master game is a promotional game from the Dutch brewery Grolsch, world famous (in the Netherlands) for it's swing-top bottles. The game is a party game that combines aspects of Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary, Charades etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trivia questions are divided into the categories Film, Beer, Sports and Various, each category containing 50 cards of 4 questions with increasing difficulty. The question you are asked depends on the ring you are in, the closer to the center, the more difficult the question should be. There are also 150 'the Pub' cards with 4 assignments that require you to draw, impersonate, act out or imitate persons, animals situations or even your thoughts on a particular matter (that you have written down beforehand). A sixth set of cards (30 brewery cards) are comparable to the 'Chance' cards of Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You roll the die to determine the number of steps you have to take (you can decide whether you travel clockwise or counter clockwise), and depending on the square you land upon, you need to answer a question or carry out an assignment, you can get to the next ring or you get to draw a 'Brewery' (Chance) card. If you answer a question correctly, you get a beer voucher, otherwise you have to pay a beer voucher. If one of the other players guesses your assignment correctly, both get a beer voucher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There a two possibilities to get to the next ring: via an open door, or via a doorman. The doorman requires payment in the form of beer vouchers. When you reach the final ring, you need to have enough beer vouchers to pay your bill. The first player reaching the inner circle wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
