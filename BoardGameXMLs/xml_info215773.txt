			<description>Plan 1919 is a two-player game exploring the most influential campaign that never was: J.F.C. Fuller's revolutionary plan to use new tank technology to penetrate past the frontlines, forgoing the brutal stalemate of &amp;quot;body warfare&amp;quot; to take out German lines of communication via a &amp;quot;shot through the brain&amp;quot;. The 1918 armistice rendered the plan moot, and it was derided by the more traditionalist elements of the British Army. But others were paying attention, and the Second World War saw Fuller's vision realized with terrifying effect by Nazi Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allied Player is on the attack, with many tank brigades at his disposal - but will they be enough?  The Germans of this era have few armor units, but can utilize anti-tank units and aircraft to mount a stubborn defense. It's in their interest to prevent and minimize Allied advances while maintaining their tenuous lines of supply and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units represent corps, divisions, and brigades, moving across hexes that are about seven miles across. The time scale of individual turns is fungible and dependent on tempo, but the entire twenty-turn campaign represents about two months of real-world fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer John Gorkowski is no stranger to the Great War, having designed a number of games on the topic at tactical, operational, and strategic scales. When Hollandspiele decided it wanted to publish a game on the subject, Mr. Gorkowski was the first and only designer we had in mind, and his experience with gaming the era results in a plausible, believable, playable version of Fuller's what-if.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
