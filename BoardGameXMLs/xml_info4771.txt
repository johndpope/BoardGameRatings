			<description>This is a fishing game. The winner is the player who first casts for a pike and 4 other different fish from a total of 5 kinds. Previous to the actual casting you need to collect the appropriate cards featuring:&lt;br/&gt;BAIT, PERMIT (for 5 different fish), TACKLE.&lt;br/&gt;Basically you need to collect the matching permits and bait for a certain type of fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are ready with your cards, you go fishing around the lake (is a big board, colorful). Some fish can only be cast on certain parts of the lake while others can be cast from any edge of the lake.&lt;br/&gt;Casting involves:&lt;br/&gt;a)to role the fishing rod, this is type of dice similar to a pencil with the names of the different fish. If the right fish is baiting, then b)&lt;br/&gt;b)striking, rolling a normal die. If you are successful then&lt;br/&gt;c) weigh-in, rolling the die again not to get a 6!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;if you successfully complete a, b and c, the fish is yours.. ..but watch out for the opportunity cards of your opponents, they could steal one of your fish!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
