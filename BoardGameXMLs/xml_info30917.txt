			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xemorpheum (pronounced Zemorpheum) was specifically designed to teach Third World business concepts to students and business people.  The game models a Third World Business environment in an ancient coliseum setting in a far off country called Richmania.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xemorpheum is played by two to seven players who compete against each other by rolling dice, moving around a coliseum track, drawing cards and paying crossing fees to other players or to the treasury.  Players increase their chance of winning by amassing cash, building factories and training arenas, and assembling armies. To win, one player must avoid sudden death bankruptcy and gather more wealth and power than other players while surviving the myriad of hazards, traps and pitfalls inherent in the game's unique playing environment.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
