			<description>Mystique Circle is a trick-taking game for The Mystique Deck, in which the suits are ranked in a rock-paper-scissors-esque cycle: Suns &amp;gt; Moons &amp;gt; Crowns &amp;gt; Arms &amp;gt; Suns, and face value (1&amp;ndash;5) breaks ties; all colors are equal, but you must follow the color led when playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hand, you set aside three cards face-down as a bid for how many tricks you think you will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick winner is reevaluated with each card played into the trick, which means that in a five-player game, it's possible to go full-circle through the entire suit cycle, such that the fifth player wins the trick with a lower number of the same suit that was led.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the hand, earn 1 point for each trick you took + 20 points if that number equals your bid. Once a player reaches 60 points, the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
