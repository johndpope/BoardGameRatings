			<description>The game contains 36 fishes in mixed colours and two dice. From the beginning, all but three of these are upside down. On your turn, one die is rolled and show your action. Either you are allowed to fish, everyone are allowed to fish, you can turn one fish around or you miss your turn. If you are allowed to fish, the second die is used showing which colour you are allowed to take. The same goes when everyone are allowed to fish. The players then compete to grab the fishes with the correct colour. The game ends when all fishes are taken and the player with the most fishes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
