			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, the unicorns and the pegasi.  The words bring up images of beautiful equines prancing among the wild flowers or soaring through the skies.  Good, gorgeous, and gory!  Wait, what, gory?  Oh, you mean the way that pegasi just swooped down and double kicked the unicorn in the head?  Or the way that unicorn jumped up and managed to disembowel one of the pegasi?  Well, during the dry season when there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough food to feed both the unicorn and the pegasi herds, they go to war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you running a perfectly stereo-typical game world or are you modifying the old legends to fit your world?  That&amp;rsquo;s the type of thing we&amp;rsquo;re doing here in Small Bites, giving you the ideas and the encouragement to think through your game world and how you really want it to work.  And if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a game world or don&amp;rsquo;t want to, we&amp;rsquo;ll give you the one we use as an example, and you can take it or modify it into what you&amp;rsquo;re really looking for.  This is going to help all you GMs and world builders out there create that extra level of fun and make your games more enjoyable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Player and Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 17 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 37 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
