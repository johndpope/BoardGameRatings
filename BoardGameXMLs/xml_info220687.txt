							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Temple of the Demon&#039;s Heart</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in a cavern, far from prying eyes, acolytes carry out dark and evil rituals as they appease the still-beating heart of their deity. Though long since defeated in the Demon Wars, the heart of this unnamed Demon prince continued to beat as the flesh rotted away. Discovered centuries later, a temple and shrine was built around it and now cultists serve and administer the heart, dripping the blood of sacrifices onto it daily, in the hope that one day the demon will be reborn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need a quick map for an encounter?&lt;br/&gt; A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 30 map depiciting an evil temple within a cave. Reached by a set of steps, the temple features a small shrine and altar, and a huge hall where a massive demonic heart still beats in a pit. A small bridge is built across it where the blood of sacrfices can be poured onto the heart. The room adjoins a small hall where acolytes prepare for the sinister rituals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
