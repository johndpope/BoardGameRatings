			<description>While on vacation in Romania, Josh and his wife, Kate are on a train with several other tourists. During the train ride, Kate is about to tell Josh something when she discovers he was hiding a bottle of alcohol, hinting at a drinking problem. Angry, she walks out and heads to the dining car. Josh comes across a Romanian man who tells him that his wife left a letter for him, and then Josh reads it. Feeling guilty, Josh heads to the dining car to apologize. On his way, he encounters many travellers, such as a student,two ballerinas called Sacha and Tasha, four teenagers Monica, Max, Aaron and Katja, are going to a rave, an English pysciatrist called Jane, two Romanian generals, a Romanian ticket collector, a German businessman and Yeli, a fortune-teller who gives Josh a grim prediction. He then proceeds further only to find the car covered in blood. Bursting into the car, he find his wife being carried out by a large man with an odd-looking mechanism on his face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_Nightmares,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_Nightmares,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
