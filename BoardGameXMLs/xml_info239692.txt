			<description>Meet Keiji Osaki: a young man who hates dealing with machines, despite being very skilled at working with them. Tht's just the kind of guy he is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After failing his college entrance exams, he begins helping out at his grandfather's workshop, which specializes in repairing VORKS, heavy-duty industrial robots. For a while, he enjoyed a quiet life in the countryside, doted on by the workshop's regular patrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, however, his life suddenly takes a turn for the strange, when he encounters a metallic lifeform attached to a meteorite that fell from the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make things even more complicated, the organism he rescues takes the form of a forgotten girl from his past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is how his life with the metallic organism known as R-ne begins. But after a while, R-ne learns how to speak, and tells Keiji that she wants to go back to her home planet. Moved by her words, he sets his mind on sending her back into space, no matter what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
