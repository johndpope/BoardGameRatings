			<description>Creatures from another planet are lost in space. We have to take them home, using observation and grid references. An excellent introduction to using maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From inside the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost in Space: A map reference game for any number of players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six collecting boards form the plan of Fantasia. Each board is divided into nine grid squares, so that there are 54 grid squares in all. Each of the 54 picture cards shows, larger and more clearly, a creature from one of the grid squares, and on the back of the card the appropriate grid reference is shown. &lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to match the creatures to the grid squares, either through observation or by using the grid references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attractive design of this game belies the degree of observational skill required. It reflects the difficulty of reading real maps and quickly teaches the value and simplicity of grid references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
