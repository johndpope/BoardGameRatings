			<description>A Naval Game, British made with Prov Pat No 2649. &amp;quot;River Platte&amp;quot;. produced by Victory Games during World War II. Features a large scaled down model of a ship along with some miniature ships in different colors used by the players as player pieces. Also is sort of a search board numbered from 1-100 where different spaces might produce attacks by the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Ebayer daviddunne who I have contacted for more info about the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
