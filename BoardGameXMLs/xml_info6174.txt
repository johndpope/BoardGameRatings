							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Maker: Dungeon Wars 2</name>
									
			<description>Based off the Monster Maker card game, this is a all-out dungeon crawl. It has two completely different games. The first is a solitaire dungeon crawl. There are 3 decks of cards. The first basically details the rooms, with each card having lots of information on it to randomize what is in the rooms, how much treasure is found, what kind of monsters you meet, what kind of traps you set off, and so on. There are also a deck of monster cards and treasure cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It looks as if the game was intended as a solitaire game, as the multiplayer game is more of a dungeon maze race, without all the combat, traps, or such. To illustrate, the multiplayer game is called the 'basic game' and only takes up 3 pages of the rulebook. The &amp;quot;RPG-type solo play' game takes up 11 pages of the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
