							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snowy: Space Trip</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Snowy: Space Trip, our courageous bear leaves the comfort of his arctic home and travels across space to rescue his alien friends from an army of nefarious robots. Your task is to guide Snowy as he runs and jumps his way across beautifully detailed levels, kicking robots in their metallic teeth and gathering his little green pals into a rocket ship for the trip home.&lt;br/&gt;The more aliens you can collect and return to the rocket ship at once, the more points you'll earn. This isn't easy, as an assortment of mechanical monstrosities will do their best to stop you in your tracks. Luckily, you can use a variety of bonuses to help clear the way, including a pickup that makes Snowy invulnerable and another that clears all enemies from the screen.&lt;br/&gt;Featuring 80 levels set in four unique worlds, awesome animation, the best music you can imagine and an easy setting for less experienced players, Snowy: Space Trip is an out-of-this-world adventure you won't want to miss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Game Features:&lt;br/&gt; - 80 levels of non-stop fun &lt;br/&gt;- Four game worlds with unique bonuses and monsters &lt;br/&gt;- Cartoon-style graphics and smooth animation &lt;br/&gt;- Dynamic lighting and spectacular special effects &lt;br/&gt;- Special Kids Mode with easy gameplay &lt;br/&gt;- Finger-snapping music and explosive sound effects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
