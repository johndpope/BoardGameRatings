			<description>This could as well be an unknown prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many handmade components with the game, but also many professional produced, such as the game board or the play money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player moves his token around the board, to his choice by the throw on one die or two dice.&lt;br/&gt;There are switches where to decide which way to follow.&lt;br/&gt;Moving along players discover stars and songs and combine them to make a hit (&amp;quot;MAKAHIT&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;With these they challenge for a place in the top ten in order to make money.&lt;br/&gt;The money enables a player to buy gold discs, and the first to buy 5 gold discs is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the time intended to be released, the game could have been a hit. But as the author mentions in the professional produced rules: &amp;quot;Owing to legal difficulties it is not possible to print the actual names of stars and songs on the cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
