			<description>From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponents are in a dangerous race through the jungle.  Quickly move your Tarzan pawn along the path by spinner count but watch your step or you might get caught in treacherous quicksand or fall into a native pit trap.  Beware of the fierce beasts deep in the jungle.  You'll be stalked by man-eating lions, panthers and crocodiles and hunted by rampaging rhinos that can stop you in your tracks and force you backward on the path.  Be on the lookout for vines that allow you to swing out of danger and shortcuts to speed you on your way toward the finish space.  Be the first player to complete the action packed race and you'll win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
