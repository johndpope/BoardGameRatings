			<description>In the playground, on the building site, on the farm, at the fire station, important things suddenly go missing.  Help Pete put things back where they belong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pit, such mit! is a children's game teaching the matching of items with their correct environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player receives tokens representing various items that match one of the four board sections.  On a player's turn, he rolls a die and moves Pete around the board that many spaces.  He then checks to see if any of his items match the section he lands on, such as a fire hose at the fire station, or a shovel at the building site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to place all of his items wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
