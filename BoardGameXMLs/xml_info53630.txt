							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Puzzling Pyramid</name>
									
			<description>In The Puzzling Pyramid, each player builds a maze on the side of a pyramid for another to navigate, sight unseen. They then race each other to the top, turn by turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four triangular pyramid faces sit atop a base. On the reverse of a player's pyramid face, you build a maze by placing a number of baffles between posts (at least one route must be provided, and handicapping can be achieved by limiting a player's number of baffles). The pyramid is then rotated a quarter turn so that each player faces a different side of the pyramid. On a player's turn, you use a magnetic wand on the surface to move a steel ball up through the maze on the back, toward the top of the pyramid. If the ball encounters a baffle, it's separated from the wand and drops to the bottom of the base. If a player is unsuccessful, the turn passes until on a subsequent turn someone successfully navigates to the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
