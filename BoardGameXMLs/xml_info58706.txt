			<description>A children's game. There are three levels to play this game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginner:&lt;br/&gt;Place the spinner and the ingredients at the center of the play area. Hand out 2 slices of bread to each player.&lt;br/&gt;Youngest player spins first. The first player will choose an ingredient the spinner lands on. Play continues to the&lt;br/&gt;left until all the ingredients are gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intermediate:&lt;br/&gt;Place the spinner and the ingredients at the center of the play area. Hand out 2 slices of bread to each player. Each player will choose a recipe card. This will be the sandwich that must be made. Youngest player spins first. If the spinner lands on an ingredient that matches any player&amp;rsquo;s recipe card, pick the ingredient from the center of the play area and place it on the bread. The player to the left will take a turn to spin. The first player to collect all 3 ingredients on their recipe card wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced:&lt;br/&gt;Youngest player goes first. Spin the sandwich spinner. See if the spinner is pointing at the same ingredient on the recipe card. If it matches, pick the ingredient from the center of the play area and place it on the bread. If it does not match, the next player to the left gets a turn to&lt;br/&gt;spin. The first player to collect all 3 ingredients on their recipe card wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
