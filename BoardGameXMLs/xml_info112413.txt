			<description>Cruis'n was released for the Wii in 2007. This game is developed by Just Games Interactive, and published by Midway Games. The race starts in New York's Times Square, and ends in Los Angeles's Muholland Drive. The objective of this game is to outrun seven different cars by cruising through twelve different courses, doing different kind of stunts, and using the new nitrous system. This game introduces the money system which you gain money to unlock new cars. When you start the game only four tracks and four cars where unlocked. Along the way you unlock different stages and cars by gaining money or racing in the Circuit Challenge. This game allows up to two players on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in 2001, another Cruis'n game was planned to be in for works for the Nintendo Gamecube as a console conversion of Cruis'n Velocity, but the idea was scrapped. But in 2006, Midway was planning to bring The Fast and the Furious to home consoles, but lost the license during the game's production cycle. Midway then changed the name of the game to Cruis'n and hired game developers Just Games Interactive to develop the game for the Nintendo Gamecube, but then the project was moved to the Wii shortly after the development has started. The game was announced in the summer of 2007 and was planned for release on the Wii exclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the summer of 2007, Midway released three screenshots demonstrating somewhat dated graphics. Later, Midway released additional screenshots and announced a two-player mode as well as a car customization feature for the game like its original arcade counterpart The Fast and the Furious. A few months later, Midway released the game, despite experiencing some manufacturing difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cruis'n fared poorly in reviews by both gamers and critics. Many thought it was a slapped-together version of The Fast and the Furious arcade game with few new features. The main areas of criticism were its outdated gameplay, poor sound, lack of extra features (the title is a straight port), and lack of depth; the game can be beaten in less than an hour. Its loading times were considered problematic as it takes up to a minute to load and start a race. The game's graphics were also heavily criticized for resembling a game from the Nintendo 64 era. The game was often praised for its responsive controls, but the overall experience of the game was hampered by its other flaws. Some reviews expressed the belief that Cruis'n was a quick cash-out for Midway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cruis'n&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
