			<description>The players are the owners of competing advertising agencies, producing TV spots, printed ads etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board and part of the game mechanics are closely related to monopoly (Dice, Movement, Income on start field, chance/community-like cards). The players buy resources like a film production company or a gourmet restaurant, which they and the other players need for their campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a player has to obtain three different prizes. (1) Young Businessman Award: Obtained by having 250k money. (2) Ad Award: Obtained by reaching one of three fields on the game board. (3) Pitch Award: Obtained by winning three pitches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a pitch, two players draw storyboards for an ad campaign about a given topic and then do a presentation of their idea. Then the other players decide who wins the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box shows the ORF (Austrian national public service broadcaster) Logo.
