							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Book of Baddies</name>
									
			<description>Author's Description on Lulu:&lt;br/&gt;The Big Book of Baddies is the first book of monsters for the Red Box Fantasy roleplaying game. Inside you will find over 300 monsters. In fact this book contains all the monsters you will ever need for countless game sessions of Red Box Fantasy (this book will also work with many other fantasy games with little modification). Learn about old favorites like rust monsters and goblins, or challenge brand new monsters like the fearsome Mage Worm, the beautiful but deadly Vampiric Sylph or the mysterious Tiger of Happiness. Gone are the legions of good aligned monsters, or the unimaginable hoards of worthless undersea creatures, this book is filled with actual opponents that can actually be used. The good aligned monsters are few and far between, and even unicorns are valid enemies now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
