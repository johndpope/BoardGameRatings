							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager</name>
									
			<description>Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager (also known as Kenny Dalglish's Soccer Manager) is a football computer game that involves taking the role of Kenny Dalglish as he manages an English football team from the Football League Fourth Division right to the Football League First Division. By 1989, Dalglish was hardly playing for Liverpool F.C. anymore so a computer game had to be made in order to adapt to his new role as a manager. Dalglish eventually would retire from the athletic aspect of professional football after the May 9, 1990 game between Liverpool and Derby County F.C.. As of May 12, 2011, Dalglish is again permanent manager for the same Liverpool team that he became famous for playing with.&lt;br/&gt;The game is a spiritual successor to the original computer game Football Manager (referring to the original 1982 series; not the revised 2005 series).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is powered mainly by icons and menus; dragging the &amp;quot;managerial football&amp;quot; genre into the 1990s. A chairman can be consulted if players made the right decision while a physiotherapist can check for player injuries and the football scout can find players that can be recruited into the team.  Match highlights can be either enable or disabled; but the results tell the identical story as the highlights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
