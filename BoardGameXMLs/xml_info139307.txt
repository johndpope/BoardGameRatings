			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I don't fear dying, I fear being cursed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many times have player characters selfishly plundered the ancient tombs of long lost civilizations with impunity? How many evil cults of dark gods have they smashed and looted? We all know that player character&amp;rsquo;s love their treasure, but what happens when there are consequences for taking that golden torque off the ancient dead? What happens when a deity swears vengeance when the PCs eradicate his cultists? Or perhaps that dragon who sat upon that treasure for a thousand years imparted it with part of his foul essence. #30 Cursed Treasures provides an answer to those questions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product offers you 30 flavorful treasures that carry curses for adventurers who always seem to be defying some ancient cultural moral or prevailing taboo. Each curse has a specific way of eliminating it effects beyond a simple remove curse spell, have a detailed history, and only by discovering this history can the cure be found. These cursed treasures are not merely a collection of stats but the impetus for adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
