			<description>Felithian Finance is a game of stock accumulation, coupled with a 6 by 6 grid upon which corporate markers are played. Players are dealt 4 cards from a deck of 110 cards. There are 10 shares each of 10 corporations. Each player's turn consists of buying a new share and playing a corporate tile on the 6 by 6 board. Tiles on the board increase the value of shares held. By judiciously playing tiles, players can augment the value of the corporations they control and thwart the growth of the holdings of others. Dice are rolled to determine if dividends are played. Eventually the game comes to an end and the player with the most galactic credits (money) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
