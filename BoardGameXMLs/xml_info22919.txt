			<description>This game contains four pieces representing men and four pieces representing women.  Either up to four men chase one ideal woman in hopes of getting dates or four women chase one ideal man.  Players simultaneously set their love-o-meters to indicate movement for either themselves or (by paying a gift chip) the ideal member of the appropriate sex.  Dates lead to heart chips, which can be lost for various reasons.  Landing on the spot with another figure, a die is rolled for a random consequence (losing a turn, losing a heart chip, gaining a heart chip).  When all heart chips are distributed, the player with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illustrations by Mordillo.  Ages 14+.  L-Series of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
