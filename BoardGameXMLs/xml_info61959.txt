							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of the Samurai: The Escape from the Haunted Lands</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To ignore tradition is foolhardy; to anger the dead by not providing for them tempts fate; to be in a place where others have died subjects you to forces beyond your control. Avoidance, care, ritual, respect, tradition. These are your bywords.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The Rule of the Dead&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to legendary Japan, a land of unhappy ghosts and mischievous spirits, of cannibal demons and merciful kami. A place where honor is more important than gold and where one's skill with sword and etiquette is the only thing that stands between glorious victory and shameful defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Escape from the Haunted Lands&amp;quot; is the first chapter in the &amp;quot;Haunted Lands&amp;quot; Adventure Path, a 10-installment campaign designed to lead the characters on a wonderful journey through the fabled lands of ancient Japan and latter Koryo in a quest to avenge their master's death and restore his son and heir to his rightful place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended to serve as a tutorial to Japanese adventuring in general and as such contains many iconic encounters taken straight from traditional Japanese folktales and kaidans (ghost stories). Also, the &amp;quot;Seven Tales of Old Japan&amp;quot; at the end of this adventure is designed to give both the DM and the players a glimpse into Japan's rich and fascinating folklore by retelling some of Japan's best-known and loved stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
