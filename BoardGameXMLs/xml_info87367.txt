			<description>What is G-Core?&lt;br/&gt;G-Core is a simple set of rules for use in any genre. Spawned and updated for the modern gamer, G-Core roots come from the original Marvel Superheroes Role-Playing Game or more famously known as FASERIP. This ISN'T the original FASERIP nor is it a product of Marvel Comics, but it is 99% compatible with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things we've updated:&lt;br/&gt;-Talents have now become Special Focus&lt;br/&gt;-Special Focus makes more out of a character's specialities&lt;br/&gt;-Instead of Fighting, Agility, Strength, Endurance, Reason, Intuition, and Psyche we now have: Rumble, Agility, Might, Moxie, Smarts, Perception and Spirit.&lt;br/&gt;-The tables are gone! After play testing using a simple ten-sided die, we found a better way to make resolutions! By doing this it became MUCH more comic book than the previous incarnation.   &lt;br/&gt;-Character Generation has moved into a Point Based creation. It is mapped out to avoid confusion. Creation takes around 10 to 15 minutes for adults. 15 to 30 minutes for younger children. The process, however, is always kept exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worried about real compatibility?&lt;br/&gt;We took a character from the old FASERIP game and changed it to G-Core in less than 20 seconds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
