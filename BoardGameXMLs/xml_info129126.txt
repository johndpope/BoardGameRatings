			<description>Temporum is a strategy game about the seasons. Each players embody one of the seasons and try to spread his territory the biggest he can, but the entire concept of the game is based on the succession of seasons, in this game you have to accept that your territory will be taken by the season that follow you and you'll do the same to the season that precede you. So your territories are always changing. The deal about this game is to calculate when you have to spread wide and when you have to spread wise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game take place over 12 years (12 turns), by using limited action points players place pawn on the board to expand their season on this particular territory (island). They can also spread from existing controlled island to expand more their territory, but they can grow only on the season that preceed them (eg. winter spread on fall). Each player also have a mega-bonus that they will use over the game. It's important to calculate when it's the moment to use a lot of APs and when it's important to stay low profile. Players score at the beginning of each year, their score egal the number of island they control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a fast poetic semi-competitve strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
