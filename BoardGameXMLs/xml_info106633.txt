			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Dares Wins II is another Commando like top/down shooter where you operate a lone soldier shooting dozens of enemies. It looks and plays like it's predecessor, obviously using the same engine but introducing a whole new set of play levels.&lt;br/&gt;Also in this game, as soon as the player starts moving upwards, the screen scrolls along, but it won&amp;acute;t scroll down with the player, so it&amp;acute;s always forward &amp;amp; advance.&lt;br/&gt;Rifle ammo is unlimited. However, the player starts with 5 handgrenades and can get extra, laying around in small chests, along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme &lt;br/&gt;As in WDW-I it's still impossible to tell if this game portrays either WW-2 or post WW-2 fighting. According to the back of the box, you're equipped with an AR-15 assault rifle, making this a post 1957 conflict. However, any of the more modern equipment (laser, night vision) is absent, so it's safe to say you're fighting a fictional battle between 1960 and 1975.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal &lt;br/&gt;The goal is a lot clearer, run forward and kill as much along the way as possible. Once the player can't go further, he'll be swarmed with a last outburst of enemies, after which he gets a 'stage cleared' message and proceeds to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus points are earned for shooting vehicles and for freeing comrades, which are occasionally transported away by an enemy soldier, or while tied to a tree, at the verge of being executed. Shooting the enemy soldier is all that's needed to free the fellow soldier, who runs merrily off the screen. But that does take some practice, timing and knowledge of the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
