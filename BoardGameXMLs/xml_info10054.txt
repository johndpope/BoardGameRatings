			<description>This is a Roll and Move game inspired by Chutes and Ladders and played on a 3D board. When players fall on ladder spaces, they move up on the board but when they hit a tube, they slide way back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first fireman to rescue the kitten in the top window of the firehouse wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;A firehouse game with over two towering feet of fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funny firemen climb up crazy ladders, and make silly sounds sliding down the poles.  It's fun from the top to the bottom because you never know who's going to win. Just when you think you've made it to the top, you may slide to the bottom again! It's the game where it's just as much fun to start over as it is to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with four funny firefighters that make their own silly sounds as they slide down the pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
