			<description>Spirit Racing and Entertainments were a small UK publisher in the seventies and early eighties based in Croydon, Surrey which transformed into the Spirit Games shops in Burton-on-Trent (they have three shops on one street!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strat-Ops is a combination of a roll-and-move monopoly-like outer track where types of actions are determined, and an abstract wargame between two sets of opposing allies played in the centre of the board where the actions are applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have factories to produce Heavy Bombers, Medium Bombers, Day Fighters, Fuel and Munitions, Tanks and Air Defence - and these are used to attack the enemy's armies, factories and convoys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game by having all your enemy players in one of the following states:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Capital city is captured&lt;br/&gt;(b) All factories are destroyed&lt;br/&gt;(c) All Fuel and Munitions factories are destroyed and no reserves are left&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the 24-page rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;Strat-ops is an ingenious and exciting game originally devised by a British airman during the Second World War. It is played with 2, 4, or 6 players and is suitable for anyone aged ten upwards. players need luck as well as skill, so the game can be a challenge for the enthusiast or simply an absorbing evening's fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
