			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU are the Doctor's only assistant as you face an entire race of mutant warlike beings in INVASION OF THE ORMAZOIDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the twenty-fifth century. The Doctor has set your coordinates for the rim worlds - a turbulent, primitive, and strange region. There, at the edge of the universe, you are fated to meet Darval, an evil ruler with a fascinating history and bizarre energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But of more immediate danger: Darval's Ormazoids, a race of beings originally created to assist him in space exploration but now bred by Darval to be fearless and unstoppable - and to carry out his commands for domination of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU and the Doctor must seize control of Darval's Master Genetic Code Signifier - the device that controls the Ormazoids. Otherwise, Earth and her empire will fall prey to his ruthless plans. Outnumbered and outmuscled, YOU must rely on your intellect as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other gamebooks in the Find Your Fate series, the Doctor Who series uses dice, and visual puzzles in addition to the reader making the decisions in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
