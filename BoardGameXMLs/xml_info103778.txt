			<description>Adorable little Twitties of different colors are lost in the middle of nowhere and they don&amp;rsquo;t know where to go.

But it&amp;rsquo;s not easy as you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twitty has crazily tricky and challenging game play. You have to move the Twitties either vertically or horizontally and place the movable blocks at the right positions to direct them on right path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twitty is an exhilarating strategy game that you can pick up in seconds.
