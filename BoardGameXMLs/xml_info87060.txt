			<description>Elephant Checkers is basically Turkish Checkers played on an Xiangqi Board with a extra rules and additional pieces. &lt;br/&gt; Each player starts with 24 pieces (soldiers). The goal of the game is to leave your opponent with no moves (capturing all of their pieces does this nicely), or to promote an Elephant (a promoted Soldier) to King on the point in the center of your opponent's fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in many checker games captures are obligatory, and a player must choose the move with the most possible captures. &lt;br/&gt; Soldiers move one square forward or horizontally. They may also capture an enemy piece (or a series of them) by jumping over it to a vacant junction beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once across the river a Soldier may move two squares or capture pieces two squares ahead or to the side, or capture a piece an adjacent piece and land two squares past it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Soldier reaches the far side it promotes to an Elephant (the name source).  &lt;br/&gt; Elephants may move to any vacant junction (since Xiangqi is played on the points, not sqaures) vertically or horizontally. They capture by jumping over an enemy piece, and can continue to any empty square beyond the capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They may promote to King and win the game if on the Throne point in the center of the opposing fortress, but that move counts as a non-capturing move, and can not be made when there is a capture available.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
