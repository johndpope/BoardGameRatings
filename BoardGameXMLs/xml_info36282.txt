			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Two Rival Gangs of Giant Japanese Monsters Face-off. Each figure represents a single Monster. Victory: Kill all opposing Monsters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Action figures, toys, miniatures, or counters are used to represent the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each have forty points to spend on monsters. The game describes thirty giant monsters who are rated for cost, hit points, flight capability, and special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game.
