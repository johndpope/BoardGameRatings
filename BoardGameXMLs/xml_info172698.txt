			<description>In Moly Diggins, players try to explore winding tunnels to collect earthworms. The game consists solely of ten tunnel cards that each bear earthworms in their paths, and players take turns placing these in order to get their mole to the worms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning of the game, two cards are placed and one worm is attached to every worm-sign. The active player places a new card &amp;mdash; every card is printed on front and back with different tunnels &amp;mdash; and attaches a worm again. Then he moves his mole as far as possible, taking every worm on the way, but sometimes it's better to move not so far in order to have an advantage for his next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all ten cards have been placed, the second phase of the game starts. Now the active player takes one already-placed card without a mole, removes all remaining worms to the storage, then places it again, attaching worms again, too. In the second phase, players have the opportunity to enter the connecting tunnels of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has found the most worms at the end of the day is hailed as the greatest earthworm hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
