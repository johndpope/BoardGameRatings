			<description>Players roll a die and move that many spaces along a track.  Spaces indicate that a player either collect or pay a certain number of chips, or draw and execute an action from a deck of cards.  The twist is that you can move any pawn, not just your own, and if a player goes over 10 chips he loses all but 4 of them.  Winner is the player with the most chips after all pawns complete the track.  And just because you've reached the goal, do not assume your chips or pawns are safe from the random action cards!  A very quick game, short on tactics, but long on being mean to your fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
