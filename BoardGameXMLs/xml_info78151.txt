							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tonic Trouble</name>
									
			<description>Tonic Trouble is a video game by Ubisoft Montreal, based on the Rayman series. It is a traditional 3D platformer, in which a magic potion spills on the Earth and causes vegetables to become living killers. Due to poor controls, sloppy graphics (on the N64 version), and not being quite as eventful or environmentally interesting, the game did very poorly.  The N64 one had many noticeable differences, like a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes and different music in certain places. The game was going to be released before Rayman 2: The Great Escape but eventually was released months after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Tonic Trouble , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
