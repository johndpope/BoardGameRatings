			<description>Skyjet is a video game published by Mastertronic in 1985 for Commodore 64 , in which you control a helicopter in action and combat both of transport. He left directly in paperback and trade magazines judged him with average valuations to very good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The scene is two dimensional, with side view of a horizontal-down environment in both directions, off a total of about four screens. The landscape is composed of areas of land and sea-sectional views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The helicopter can move in four directions, with a partial effect of gravity, that you lose constantly share when you do not push the controls in any direction. It can shoot horizontally and release depth charges. The helicopter can withstand more hits before losing a life, but there is a power indicator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main enemies are ships or tanks, indestructible, patrolling the sea and the islands by firing anti-aircraft projectiles causing large explosions in the sky. But later hunting and futuristic aircraft that cross the horizontal area and may be affected. In addition, the submarine refueling through one at a time across the playing area; in themselves they are harmless, but if they can go is intensified the strength of the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One at a time, in different parts of the mainland, appear parcel of supplies that the helicopter has to collect and release on a special construction area. Packet delivered installation takes more shape, and to complete a level you have to end it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyjet Skyjet]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
