			<description>Description of the game from Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metropolen (Metropolises) is also by Jorg Miethe. Here, the goal is to place the location of various metropolises on a blank map. The closer your X comes to the correct location, the more points you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was invented during a car ride from Stuttgart to Leipzig. There was a lot of traffic and therefore lots of traffic jams mentioned on the news. The inventor pictured a map of Germany during these announcements and tried to arrange the towns mentioned. From this situation arose the first prototype &amp;quot;Highway Guessing&amp;quot;. This very quickly turned into the playable &amp;quot;Metropolen&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be used by school classes as a geography learning game (for example in two groups playing against each other) or as an educational game for traveling groups or other parties. The game was tested in a casual group and was a real conversation starter (&amp;quot;I know where that is, I had the most unbelievable experience there...&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
