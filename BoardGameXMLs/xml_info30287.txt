			<description>Buying castles in Scotland can turn out to be excellent business. Even more so when, at the same time, you can provide tourists with these lands attractions: natural beauties? Oh no, no, rather offering them scary ghost infestations!!! Some eccentric characters fight in an auction to be assigned castles and manors. This, in the hope that presences will not be too numerous! Even if a castle without ghosts may be found useless, on the contrary one which is too &amp;ldquo;populated&amp;rdquo; will end up terrorizing tourists and being valueless...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player, after having seen the various castles, can declare what was seen, by showing his signs &amp;ldquo;picture&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ghost&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Were there gloomy presences or only old and powdery family portraits? But beware, not all declarations are reliable: many players could lie... or perhaps all of them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase players must decide whether in that very turn they will lie or tell always the truth.&lt;br/&gt;Mrs Truelight could help everyone to find out actual results of such decisions, but she is greedy and therefore she will reveal precious indications only to best bidders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caution is vital: the ones who pay more money too early will turn out having less funds to offer in the second phase auction for castles. Shall we have enough money to steal best ones to our competitors? Every castle has a score according to the number of ghosts by whom it is haunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who succeeds in guessing where ghosts are and their exact number will achieve optimum business, becoming able to buy what he/she wants in a fairly relaxed mode and allowing himself/herself even the luxury to mislead adversaries with fake offers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost for sale is a clever deductive game, with a subtle bluffing component, for 3 to 5 players, suitable for all the families, but with a strategy component that will not leave indifferent even most experienced gamers. In the box there are 8 special cards to be used for &amp;ldquo;special auctions&amp;rdquo;, which constitute a set for playing advanced rules games and which, randomly combined to the various castles and manors, guarantee rounds which are always exciting and different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English, German and Italian Rules available for download here&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
