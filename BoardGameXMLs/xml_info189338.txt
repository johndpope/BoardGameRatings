							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flip 22</name>
									
			<description>A dice rolling and flipping game with Flip Dice in which players try to make 22 (the total of the high sides of the set of four Flip Dice).  In attempting to do so, players must choose to press their luck and play (at the risk of having to double the pot of chips if they roll all the low sides of the Flip Dice) or play it safe, pass their turn, and hope someone else loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once one player loses all their chips at the end of a turn, the other players with chips remaining record their number of chips left (as points).  Then a new round is started and play continues until someone reaches 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
