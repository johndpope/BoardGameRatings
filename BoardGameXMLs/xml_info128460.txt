			<description>A magnetic game for children with a die from 1 to 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dwarfs are lucky! Gold can be found on the road. Huge golden coins are just waiting to be collected. If luck is on your side, you can even carry home a whole stack of coins...unless one of the other players takes them away first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Players take turns rolling the die. They then move their dwarf pawn the corresponding number of spaces on the circular track. If they land on a gold coin (a wooden disc is placed on every third space during set-up), the dwarf is put on the coin, which sticks to the dwarf's base magnetically. On the next turn, the dwarf moves on with the coin attached. He tries to reach home (every dwarf has his home section in one corner of the board), continuing to collect more coins if possible. If one dwarf lands on a space occupied by another dwarf, the newcomer steals the other's gold and sends him home. The game ends when all coins have been brought home. The player who collected the most coins wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
