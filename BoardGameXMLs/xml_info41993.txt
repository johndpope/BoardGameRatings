							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stonehenge Hippie Festival</name>
									
			<description>Stonehenge Hippie Festival is a party game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and its Nocturne Expansion.  Each player has a secret card, which if it is a trilithon, dictates her goal, and otherwise gives her a choice between hoarding one type of snack or collecting a well-rounded selection of snacks to take to a rendezvous point.  In either case, the goal is mutable, because you can choose on any and every turn to make your goal card into the action card for the turn, drawing a new random goal card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the festival, there will be shopping, jumping, sliding, dancing, theft, and even some decoration of the trilithons.  The randomly drawn action card (or your former goal card, should you choose to override the drawn action card) and your situation determine the exact nature of the options available to you on your turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You can get a snack sold at your current space, then amble onward.&lt;br/&gt;     You can jump on a deal at the space whose number is on the action card.&lt;br/&gt;     You can slide to a location bound by the color indicated on the action card.&lt;br/&gt;     You can dance with someone in your space, which gets everyone else dancing (and hungry).&lt;br/&gt;     You can be a buzzkill and steal from someone in your space.&lt;br/&gt;     You can hang a flag on a trilithon if you're close to one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stonehenge Hippie Festival is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
