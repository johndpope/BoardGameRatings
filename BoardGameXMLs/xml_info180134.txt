							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Sendung mit der Maus: Was passt dazu?</name>
									
			<description>The game persists of 7 panels in different colors, which show the  'Maus' in different situations and 7 cards  of each color with suitable items . One card of each color is put on the   corresponding  panel, the others cards are shuffled and build a stock. The players have time to memory the items on the panels, then the cards are turned facedown.&lt;br/&gt;The topmost card of the stock is taken and shown to all players. The first player, who says which hidden item is laying on the panel of the same color as the card drawn, gets the memorized card and the new card is put on the panel facedown.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends if the stock is empty, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
