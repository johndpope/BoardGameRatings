			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My name is Walther Evid, High Priest of Mortent. As I write these words, I am transported back to a time when I was a simple farmer's son, whose most lofty goal was to eventually take responsibility for the communal funeral plot. How long ago those times seem now, as I look out the stained window into the temple courtyard upon the new novices practicing the sacred rites in the lightly falling snow. Perhaps it is for them, and for the trainee&amp;rsquo;s at Ulfgar and Damian&amp;rsquo;s battle school, and for every foolish youth with delusions of grandeur and a thirst for adventure that I have bound these disparate memories together. It is my hope that this collection will provide future adventurers with enough knowledge to have an edge against at least a few of the lurking horrors in the dark of our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presents eight monsters and eight magic items related to the monsters.  Each monster-item pair has a narrative introduction followed by traditional &amp;quot;stat block&amp;quot; presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
