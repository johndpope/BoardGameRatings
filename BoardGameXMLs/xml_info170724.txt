							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Suburbia: Acrylic Tokens</name>
									
			<description>Offiically licensed tokens featuring the original iconography from Bezier Games' Suburbia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of 81 tokens, laser engraved and laser cut from 11 different colors of acrylic sheet. A token is placed on every tile that has an ongoing effect not related to adjacent tiles to remind you to score that effect when a corresponding tile is place. Also, all tiles with a white interactive icon receive a token with a matching white icon, so it is easy to see how many tiles of a particular type are in play when a new tile affected by that type is placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tokens make it easy to see at a glance what tiles are effected by a tile you place, and which might affect the new tile. They greatly simplify the bookkeeping that many people find difficult in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokens are included for all relevant tiles in the Suburbia base game and the Suburbia Inc. expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
