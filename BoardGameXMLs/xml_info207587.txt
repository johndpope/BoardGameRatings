			<description>Band of Brothers: Old Breed South Pacific is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII. It covers the exploits of the U.S. First Marine Division in the battles for Guadalcanal. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic. There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression. This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something. You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play. In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Breed South Pacific is a STAND ALONE GAME, but is also part of a growing series of tactical games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles is the first in the series and follows the U.S. 101st Airborne Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is the second in the series and follows the German 11th Panzer Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Band of Brothers: Texas Arrows is a dependant expansion that follows the U.S. 36th Infantry Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
