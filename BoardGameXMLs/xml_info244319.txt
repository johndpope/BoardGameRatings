			<description>You are a Prime Mage.  Unfortunately, so is your opponent.  Your opposing wills for the fate of the world will have to be resolved as they always are, where kings are pawns, on the board populated by the Souls of millions, in this broad land under the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control was designed with the idea that the best part about playing card games is playing cards.  You and your opponent each bring a 14 card deck to the table.  There are a total of eight possible colors of cards to make your deck from.  On your turns, you can play as many cards of two colors as you want, and once per game you may switch you hand and your deck.  This means that you could play all of your cards on your first turn (if you made a two color deck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, you would lose the game.  To win, you must cause your opponent to have zero cards in her deck.  This means that you have to strike the right balance in how many cards you play and when you play them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has full color cards for print and play, printer friendly cards, and a Tabletop Simulator module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
