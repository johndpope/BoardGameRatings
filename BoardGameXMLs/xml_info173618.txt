							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">If Wishes Were Fishes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in the mystical land of Tengoku, the party finds themselves called on a quest by a not so coy Koi named Coy. With the island in danger, a walking and talking fish running the risk of gill cancer thanks to his new cigar habit, and a missing enchanted gem, the land Far East of Brattleburg may soon find itself going south! Can the heroes restore the balance, solve the mystery of the world fish, and eat their takeout noodles before they go cold? Find the answer in &amp;quot;If Wishes were Fishes!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Episode 31 - If Wishes were Fishes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a new year comes new GagMen and we start off this year with a big fish story. Taking it back to our Asian story &amp;ldquo;The Tao of Ato&amp;rdquo;, we journey back to the mystical island of Tengoku to chase down a magical gem and fight the worlds biggest goldfish. With nothing more than an incoherent plot and a bottle full of Mountain Dew the GagMen will take on this deadly fish and this time they aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be floundering around. Though we have a few laughs for the halibut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
