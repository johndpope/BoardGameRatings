			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weighing in at 112-pages, Legendary Adventures: Harrowing Heights offers game masters a thrilling 46-page adventure, complete with 25-pages of introductory materials and 40-jam-packed-pages of appendices. The adventure is suitable for 3-5 players of 1st to 5th-level and should easily last a group 6-12 sessions, depending on the duration of each. In addition to this, the introductory materials provide key information on the adventure's background, as well as adding geographical context, lore, and other flourishes which help set the scene for the action that follows and grounds the players in the narrative. Meanwhile, the appendices add 26 new varieties of kobolds and drakes, 17 bespoke, adventure-specific NPCs, and 24 fun, original magic items. Best of all, Harrowing Heights has been lovingly illustrated with full-colour artwork and mapping throughout. And, for your convenience and ease of use, the module's digital files are provided in a multitude of formats including several that are reformatted for ease and affordability of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story...&lt;br/&gt;An unspoken truce of peace has reigned between the Holgathi people and the kobolds of Jinzirga for decades. But, when Jarl Orm Holmgavtsson's only daughter, Dalla, is inexplicably kidnapped, it could change everything. With few choices at his disposal, the lord of Skalaholt turns to his trusted housecarls to save her - setting them off on a perilous journey that takes them high into the mountains. If they are to succeed, Orm's would-be-heroes will have to win over a diverse cast of unusual characters, settle grudges long-forgotten, and overcome tremendous challenges. And, though they might not realise it initially, far more than just the fate of Dalla Holmgavtsson is at stake. Will the PCs discover the truth in time to save her and avert a brewing war, or will Orm's faith in them prove misguided?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a Glance...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A level 1-5 adventure module for 3-5 players and a game master that pitches the PCs against kobolds and drakes, with strong nordic-themes and a focus on overland travel.&lt;br/&gt;    40-pages of appendices containing 26 new monsters, 17 NPCs, and 24 magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure-specific hooks to help players ground their characters in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;    Regional information on the Holgathi Highlands, including descriptions of more than 20 additional settlements and Points-of-Interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
