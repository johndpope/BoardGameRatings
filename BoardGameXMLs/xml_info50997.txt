							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hekatoteratos</name>
									
			<description>From the foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Mazes &amp;amp; Minotaurs roleplaying game first came up in 1972 (gee ! Is that ten years already ?), it included a selection of 92 folks, monsters, beasts, spirits and animates&amp;hellip; then came Men &amp;amp; Monsters, which added 21 new beings (including the Tragic Floating Head, my all-time personal favorite) to the Maziverse. Then, over the years, dozens &amp;ndash; no, myriads - of new creatures appeared in various adventure modules as well as in the ever-popular Creatures Compendium column of Griffin magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book you are holding in your hands compiles the very best of these contributions, along with a hefty dose of never-published-before material, for a grand total of exactly 100 creatures, hence the title. Hekatowhat, you ask ? Well, for those who (like me) never really got into Ancient Greek, Hekatoteratos apparently means something like &amp;laquo; the book of 100 monsters &amp;raquo; - and it was definitely a more stylish than our other ideas for a title, such as the very dull &amp;laquo; Manual of Monsters &amp;raquo; (my own suggestion), the somewhat pompous &amp;laquo; Mythic Bestiary &amp;raquo; or the improbable &amp;laquo; Monstropaedia &amp;raquo; (yes, Dave, that was your idea).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than being presented as an A-Z list of 100 creatures, this astonishing assembly of dreadful denizens and bizarre beings has been divided into ten sections, with ten entries in each section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
