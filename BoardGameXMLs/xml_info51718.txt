			<description>Blurb from back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Shadowrun is a unique fusion of science fiction and fantasy - a near future world where dragons run megacorporations and cybernetically enhanced trolls walk the streets. It is a world where magic and science intertwine and the cultural traditions of the past collide with the technological innovations of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The art of Shadowrun is a reflection of this rich environment - a blend of the ultramodern, near-future imagery of cyberpunk and the more traditional characters and creatures of fantasy. Since the release of the Shadowrun roleplaying game in 1989, thousands of illustrations have been produced for the game and this volume brings together the finest of those images. High Tech and Low Life: The Art of Shadowrun features work by some of the most gifted and imaginative artists working today. This volume should make a welcome addition to the collections of art enthusiasts and science fiction fans alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Tech and Low Life is an artbook that was released simultaneously in the US, Germany and France. All three versions are trilingual (English, German, French) and have identical content, the only difference is the respective ISBN and stock number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
