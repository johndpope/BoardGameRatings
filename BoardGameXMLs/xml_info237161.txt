			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You roamed these lands for thousands of years, shared many meals, and listened to countless stories. Your experiences, and the world&amp;rsquo;s history, are forever archived in an ethereal library that is always accessible to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You carry with you everywhere, your closest selection from this library, full of the texts of the lands. Historical events, lore of the lands, and tales of the greatest heroes fill these tomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With your knowledge and relationship with the history of the world, you will share stories and learn secrets about its people, tame the most elusive and dangerously fantastic beasts, and gain deeper understanding of the universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example 6-10 move:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History in the Making&lt;br/&gt;You gain the ability to see ethereal historical and future visions around you. Choose one option from below, then, each time you Level Up, you may choose another option below instead of choosing a different move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Passing your hands over any text or symbols provides you with insight into their creator and a secret held within, if it exists.&lt;br/&gt;    You are deeply attuned to your quest and can always sense the direction and strength of a danger or impending doom related to it, allowing you insight from the GM of the type of danger (e.g. size of a dragon, magic level of an old lich, etc. but accurately related to the true danger).&lt;br/&gt;    When you Discern Realities, time stops for a few seconds. In place of one of your questions, you may precisely determine the origin of any object, sound, or magic within near range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become, the Master Chronicler!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
