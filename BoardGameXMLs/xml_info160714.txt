							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spurs and Sprockets: Revolutionary Decks</name>
									
			<description>Spurs and Sprockets: Revolutionary Decks is a stand alone game for 2-3 players. It includes 3 new Spurs and Sprockets decks and a new set of rules that will allow players to combine it with the basic Spurs and Sprockets decks to allow for 4, 5 and 6 players to play at the same time. The game decks also include artwork used with the new Flanking rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spurs and Sprockets is a perfect information, abstract strategy game. Players have eight matching tiles that they take turns placing orthogonally into a grid, in an attempt to link three or four in a row. There is no board in Spurs and Sprockets so the grid grows organically, based on the placement of tiles. The grid also varies in size and dimensions based on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spurs and Sprockets sets comes with sixteen tiles and rules for many different ways of playing, ranging from a simple Tic-Tac-Toe-like game where players gain 8 points for four in a row and 3 points for each set of three in a row, to a game where every placement of a tile may result in an attack and removal of another tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
