			<description>Free-download cycling game made in Melbourne (Australia). The pdf provides game board, player tokens, chance cards and shopping cards, and you will need to supply a regular deck of cards from which you will remove the jacks, 3's,and 2's, as well as the jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use the cards to move their pieces around the board and collect shopping cards as they fall on green squares. Blue squares are special &amp;ldquo;chance squares&amp;rdquo; where players get cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 winners in this game, the person who completes 5 laps first and the person who has the highest value of shopping when they finish 5 laps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
