			<description>Winner! Most Creative Game! + 2nd Place Overall in the 2011 TGC Vehicle Game Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nag! is a backseat driving board game where all the players cram into the back seat of one car and try to control it by yelling at the driver. It's a unique trick-taking hand-management game, where you don't necessarily need to win any hands to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poor Harold. He stupidly volunteered to drive everyone to Aunty Josephine's birthday party, but he doesn't know where to go. Each of you has a vague idea of what her house looks like, so you all cram into the backseat and start yelling and screaming at him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must get Harold to drive by the house you're absolutely sure must be Aunty Josephine's. Why doesn't that blockhead ever listen! Use your Nag! cards to shout the loudest. Tap Harold on the shoulder to get him to pay attention. Use the GPS to plot your route. If all that fails, call the Cops on him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get Nag! today, and drive your whole family crazy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
