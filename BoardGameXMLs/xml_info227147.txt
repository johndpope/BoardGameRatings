			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the crew of the MV Dust Runner as they face danger and intrigue across the Cascadia Subsector!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cascadia Adventures features the original Gypsy Knights Games adventure series updated for use with Clement Sector:The Rules and The Cepheus Engine!  Included are all three of the Cascadia Adventures from our PDF series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save Our Ship - A &amp;quot;whale ship&amp;quot;.  That's what the casinos on Chance call a starship sent to ferry back a wealthy gambler.  The Razz Casino dispatched their &amp;quot;whale ship&amp;quot;, Royal Flush, to pick up an influential politician on Roskilde.  However, something has gone wrong.  Now the casino has hired you to find out what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost Girl &amp;ndash; Journey to the Gagnon system to locate the lost daughter of a personal friend of The Razz Casino&amp;rsquo;s owner.  Has she been kidnapped?  Murdered?  Turned to a life of crime?  It is up to you to find out the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fled &amp;ndash; An employee of the Razz Casino has stolen a large amount of money and fled from the Chance system to the Cascadia system.  Is he a mad genius?  Or is the theft of millions of credits only part of a detailed plan to change the status quo on one of the most powerful worlds in the subsector?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
