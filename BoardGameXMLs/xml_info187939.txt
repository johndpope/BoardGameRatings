			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here before you lies the wisdom of the ages: the accumulated knowledge of the Blarch, the Notwi, the Chirga, and the magnificent Advawi; the utterances of sage and Vadabaule; the whispers of the departed dead to the movha'jiit; the howls of colliding stars and dying worlds; and the secrets of the Unknowable Other. Before you is the Encyclopedia Imperium, collected by the agents of the Emperor, in this, the sixteen thousandth year of his reign. Read, and be enlightened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sleeping Imperium is an ambitious and major implementation of the D20 system in a science fantasy setting.  The game was published in various formats including this HTML presentation of the rules.  The major HTML sections published include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Encyclopedia&lt;br/&gt;     Rules&lt;br/&gt;     d20 Terms&lt;br/&gt;     Classes&lt;br/&gt;     Creatures&lt;br/&gt;     Magic&lt;br/&gt;     Feats&lt;br/&gt;     Items&lt;br/&gt;     Martial Arts&lt;br/&gt;     Psionics&lt;br/&gt;     Skills&lt;br/&gt;     Species&lt;br/&gt;     Spells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, a robust and active online discussion/message board was utilized through development.  Many of the individual sections of the HTML were released as RTF documents; other sections were released in slightly different formats as PDF documents.  Note the &amp;quot;2000&amp;quot; version of the website offered the rules as a single monolithic HTML page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
