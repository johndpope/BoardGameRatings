			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Transformice is a free multi-player 2D platform game in which each player controls a mouse who must get a piece of cheese and bring it to his mouse hole. Although it features classic platform action usually there isn't a continuous path through which mice can obtain cheese and go back so, in each level, one or two mice are turned into shamans who can summon several kinds of objects like planks, boxes and anvils to help the other mice reach their destination. First players to get in the hole with the cheese earn bonuses but trying to rush in not only can get you killed, in some levels you can even make it impossible for the rest of the players in the room to get the cheese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
