			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Been yearning to play something a little different? Want a PC race that will stand out from the preponderance of elves, dwarves, and humans that dominate the fantasy role-playing landscape? Then look no further! Races of Evernor Part I is part one of a three-part compendium of player-character races for the d20 System and the premier product for Silverthorne Games' Realms of Evernor setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully one dozen PC races are presented here, with complete details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Physical appearance&lt;br/&gt;     Social structure&lt;br/&gt;     Religion&lt;br/&gt;     History in the Realms of Evernor&lt;br/&gt;     Appearance&lt;br/&gt;     Diet&lt;br/&gt;     Level adjustments, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each race is professionally illustrated and comes with a pre-generated example character to use as a template, PC, or NPC. The example characters gets:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full game statistics&lt;br/&gt;     Personal gear&lt;br/&gt;     Character motivations&lt;br/&gt;     Notes on personality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Races of Evernor Part I also features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New feats for each race&lt;br/&gt;     New spells and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't want to run a Realms of Evernor campaign? No problem! Although created for our setting, each race can be easily adapted for use in any campaign world. For those wanting to run a campaign in the Realms of Evernor, details on how to do this are provided in a special section in each race's write-up, along with a concise primer on the setting itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
