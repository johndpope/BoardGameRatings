			<description>Afterlife is a narrative driven tabletop war gaming experience. The story of a near-future Earth torn apart by civil war after the collapse of the social order imposed by the Unity Council will be told over a number of separate volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth burns as sprawling Mega Cities built for a world of prosperity become brutal war zones and the Unity Council&amp;rsquo;s authority crumbles away. Dozens of corporations, emergent governments and resistance movements form loose factions and alliances in battles for control of Earth&amp;rsquo;s resources and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each new Volume of Afterlife will expand on previously released Volumes, adding new miniatures and rules options, and continuing the narrative to its eventual dramatic conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Afterlife Volumes will be player driven and interactive. Players will be able to report back the outcomes of battles and the tactical choices made during campaigns, and the information will be used to drive the next stage of the campaign or impact events in future Volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will be skirmish level. The game play will be primarily statistics and D10 mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
