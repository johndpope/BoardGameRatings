			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game using concepts from general biology. The deck includes 85 cards. Object: Accumulate the most points at the end of the game, or over several games.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of eight cards from which they attempt to play special combinations. Over forty combinations are defined, such as Photosynthesis (using the cards Chloroplast, Chlorophyll, Light Reactions, Dark Reactions), Sexual Reproduction (using Gametes, Fertilization, Zygote), and Mitosis (with Mitosis, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One point is scored for each card in the combination.
