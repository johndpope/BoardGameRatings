			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is one hundred and fifty years after the Big Burn.&lt;br/&gt;Civilization is gone. Technology is gone.&lt;br/&gt;Two-thirds of the human race is gone.&lt;br/&gt;When all you have left is what you believe in,&lt;br/&gt;Will you choose extinction&amp;hellip; or Ascension?&lt;br/&gt;From the designer who brought you Immaculate &amp;trade; and the award-winning Alien Angels &amp;trade; comes a bold new concept in post-apocalyptic gaming, a world devastated not by war or natural disaster but by a global crisis of faith. Apotheosis Blues invites you to play a higher order of being, one of the strange new gods who watches over this blasted Earth. Be a nurturer who lifts your followers up with kindness and miracles. Be a warlord who leads your troops to victory in the name of unity&amp;hellip; or power. Be anything at all &amp;ndash; except ordinary. When the whole world sings the Apotheosis Blues, will you be one of the leads, or just another voice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: this game contains religious and sociopolitical themes that may be offensive to some readers. It is intended for mature audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
