			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Panels, characters receive and Origin (they are generated) that explains how the character received heir super powers and why they use them the way they do.  A typical Origin narrative should rapidly define the Life, the Loves, the Looks, the Motivations, and the Accident which made the superhero.  The Accident should have an Element that makes it difficult or impossible to reproduce, so the superhero will remain unique.  The Accident should have a Nature that raises questions about the character's history (examples: Sabotaged Experiment, Careless Exposure, Lost Upbringing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Origins must have five Treatments (attributes):  Stature, Contribution, Perspective, Gimmick, and Virtue.  These Treatments are not scored but are given narrative tags to indicate a range of possible actions.  Characters should also have mundane backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, characters should indicate their team contributions in several areas:  Primary, Major, Lesser, Rare, Grunt Work, Patronage, Networking, and Trouble Making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's resolution mechanics will depend upon which style of play the GM selects for the campaign.  The rules detail three major options, all of which should be familiar to an experienced gamer.  The combat mechanics options and various damage options are well detailed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
