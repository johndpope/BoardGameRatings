							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slasher Flick</name>
									
			<description>from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slasher Flick is a role-playing game that brings all the thrills of slasher movies from the screen to the tabletop. It&amp;rsquo;s not a universal game that can easily be used for other genres. Every rule is designed with the sole purpose of capturing all the tropes and nuances of the source material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of potential victims for the psycho killer. This may be overly blunt, but that&amp;rsquo;s the truth of the matter. It&amp;rsquo;s very, very possible that any given character will be stabbed, strangled, eviscerated, decapitated, chopped into pieces or otherwise disposed of by the time the game is over. That&amp;rsquo;s okay though, as each player controls not only a primary character (representing one of the characters in the movies that the audience knows will either survive or be one of the last to die) but can also share the secondary characters (representing lesser characters that the audience knows will be slain during the movie) with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready to go to a cursed camp or babysit some kids on a dark and stormy night. After all, that noise you're hearing is just the wind. Isn't it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
