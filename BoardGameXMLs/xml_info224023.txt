			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounters: 5&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty: Normal&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 90+ Minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capital City needs superheroes. The police are kept busy dealing with all sorts of problems. Criminals, monsters, aliens, and super villains pose constant threats. This is a city that can use all the help it can get. That&amp;rsquo;s where super kids come in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place at the Linwood Academy for Extraordinary Children. The characters are at Linwood being tested for admission into this prestigious school. The school serves as a training ground for super kids. The principal has devised a series of combat challenges and a riddle to assess whether the kids are worthy of further training and missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatibility and Conversion. While designed for Super Kids &amp;mdash; a superhero expansion for Hero Kids &amp;mdash; this adventure is fully compatible with all Hero Kids&amp;rsquo; products. Hero Kids&amp;rsquo; characters, including those from the space expansion, can be used. Game Masters might want to make minor changes to the adventure text to capture a medieval or space setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
