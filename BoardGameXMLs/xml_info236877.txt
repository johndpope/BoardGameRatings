			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are attending, with Emir Erman Aran, the strategy session with the other local regents about the recent demands made by the awnsheghlien known as the Magian. He now stretches forth his clawed hand to encompass your realm of Khourane. King Sahn of Min Dhousai, whose lands lie to northeast of your realm, sent word for the nearby regents to gather to discuss plans. The various Emirs and lord defenders of Merasaf, Yeninskiy and Rhuannach, plus your own Emir Aran, have come in answer to the summons. Each regent brought a retinue of a hundred troops with them. Much has been agreed upon and the sessions were very productive, but then Marl returned with news that greatly upset the Emir. You have all been called to the Emir's tent for a hasty late night gathering. You are told to bring your gear and to choose your spells for travelling across country against mostly undead opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        8-page DOC scenario&lt;br/&gt;        14-page DOC pre-generated characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
