			<description>Into the Fray is a print and play skirmish level fantasy war-game from Moss Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the Fray allows each player to take control of one of the factions of the Hundred Worlds. Each group attempting to uncover the secrets of the lost world of Gateway and crushing anyone who stands in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed so that each player will field between 15 and 20 figures in a standard battle, a game of Into the Fray (ITF) will last about 2 hours with experienced players. The game includes rules for the standard fare like movement, combat and morale, and also includes a system for magic and special abilities that will keep things interesting, even for veteran players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available only in an electronic format, ITF is a print and play game. It keeps the initial cost down and allows you to make as many or as few miniatures as you need to form your army. With a few supplies (cardstock and glue sticks) and a few hobby tools (a hobby knife and a straightedge), you can build all of the cards, miniatures, counters and templates you need. Add in a handful of six siders and a tape measure and you will be ready to get Into the Fray!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
