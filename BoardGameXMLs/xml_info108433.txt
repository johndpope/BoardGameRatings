			<description>Hoolihan is a game of luck, skill and chance. It was copyrighted in 1973 by Sam Reeves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It captures all of the realism of the RODEO circuit because you choose your own events, pay entry fees, have small setbacks and win prize money just like the cowboys on the Rodeo circuit. Events include Saddle Bronc Riding, Bareback Riding, Barrel Racing, Calf Roping, Steer Wrestling , Team Roping and Bull Riding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 rodeos that you enter all across the Southwest with the object of being the largest winner of cash at the end of the rodeo season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring of events is that are timed events is dependent of the spin of a spinner. Some events are judged events  and you win by picking a correct card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
