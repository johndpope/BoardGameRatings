			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the furthest reaches of unexplored space there are dangers that few have the courage to face. Not everyone has the resolve, adaptability, and intelligence to face the unknown and persevere against overwhelming odds. The people of the core worlds stare nervously at the skies, wondering what hidden menace might be lurking in the realms that lie past their own tiny corner of space. Protecting the citizens of known space from the terrors of the night is the duty of a select group of men and women known as the Terran Marine Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most highly regarded military force in core space, the Terran Marines are an elite service branch under the command of Earth's central government. Recruited from the best and brightest that the human home world has to offer, these ferocious combatants are arguably the best trained and best equipped fighters found among the four core world species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fully detailed guide to playing a terran marine in the Fringe setting, inside you will find several new advanced classes geared towards playing a marine, new information on the corps, their goals and training, and a wealth of great gaming goodess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
