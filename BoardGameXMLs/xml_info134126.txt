			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2300ish is a self-published RPG from the mid-1980s, most probably from 1986 or 1987. To my knowledge this set was never sold; I was handed this copy by the presumptive creator at a game convention in Georgia in the late-1980s. Though positioned as a system for &amp;quot;hard SF roleplaying&amp;quot; in the far future, it is reasonably well-suited for a high-tech modern or near-future game. Also, it is a generic system in that it has no setting material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a full-featured game with character generation, task resolution mechanics, and a well-worked out combat system. It also has conversion information for Phoenix Command which means 2300ish must have been published in or after 1986, the year the first Phoenix Command title was published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately no year of publication or designer information is printed in this title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
