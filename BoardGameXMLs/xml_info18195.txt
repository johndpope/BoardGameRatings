			<description>In this cycling game, there are 12 stages (including two time trials, a prologue and three mountain stages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays like Mille Bornes, you move by playing cards with a number of kilometers on them, and can hinder other players by playing handicap cards. After each stage you get points in order of finishing. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is in the lead after each stage must wear a yellow cap (included).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
