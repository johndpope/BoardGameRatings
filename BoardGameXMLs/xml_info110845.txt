							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BlindSide: Episode 1</name>
									
			<description>We&amp;rsquo;re creating a video game with no graphics, played entirely using audio. It is an audio adventure, set in a fully 3D world that you&amp;rsquo;ll never see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's called BlindSide, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the first games to bring a brand new gaming experience to sighted players, that can also be fully enjoyed by visually impaired gamers. So far we&amp;rsquo;ve completed 10 minutes of gameplay to prove out the technology, and demonstrate that our core mechanic is fun. There have been a handful of audio-only games, but nothing like this before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
