			<description>Hasta La Vista, Baby is the ultimate tabletop wargame for players of multiplayer shooters and casual tabletop gamers. We designed the game to recreate the feeling of an intensive online match and included all the popular modes you already know how to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for two players. Each player commands a team of soldiers and sends them on various missions like defusing bombs, occupying strategic positions or capturing a flag. To succeed, you are going to use the strengths and weaknesses of your soldiers, assign tactical equipment, and dominate your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And just before you win, don't forget to rub it in by saying: &amp;quot;Hasta La Vista, Baby!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
