							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sharks Are Wild</name>
									
			<description>Sharks are Wild reinforces sequencing: counting both forwards and backwards. Each player starts with a number 5 &amp;ldquo;starter card&amp;rdquo; on the table and an open hand of five cards (numbers 0-4, 6-9, and wild). On his turn, a player draws a card, then either plays a card into his sequence or discards. Once a player has achieved a sequence of five cards (including the starter card), they receive a coin, discard the sequence, and start again. A Shark card is wild, and may be played anywhere in a sequence. Playing a Shark also rewards the player with an additional coin. Advanced play includes Octopus cards to steal from another player&amp;rsquo;s sequence and Dolphin cards to block the steal. First player to receive five coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
