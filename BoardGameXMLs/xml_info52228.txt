							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Player&#039;s Secrets of Endier</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to Endier, one of the smallest domains in Anuire. Carved from the treacherous forest known as the Spiderfell, it is precariously balanced between three of the more powerful realms in the land, playing a delicate game of politics and diplomacy to survive. One misstep could mean its ruin; the fate of the land rests squarely on the shoulders of you, its regent. It is said that with great risks come great rewards. If this is so, then the rewards of ruling Endier must be great indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This package includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A full-color, eight-page foldout cover containing detailed maps of the domain and important locations within it.&lt;br/&gt;    Facts about the history, geography, and economy of Endier.&lt;br/&gt;    A summary of how the government works, and how the regent manages to keep control of it.&lt;br/&gt;    Descriptions of the major NPCs in Endier, friend and foe alike.&lt;br/&gt;    Rumors to keep the regent on the alert, and royal secrets to help keep enemies at bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BIRTHRIGHT domain sourcebook is designed for players who want to take the role of the Lord of Endier, the thief regent of the realm. It may also be used by players playing nobles, servants of the regent, or adventurers of Endier.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
