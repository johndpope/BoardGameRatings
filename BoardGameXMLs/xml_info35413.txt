			<description>From the publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The new dimension in dungeon-games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruftmeister Adventure says goodbye to dice and chance-oriented fighting-systems. Here you fight the undead with your skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four players explore the crypt of count Gramwuml in search for treasure. Behind every door there's fear: Go to the arena and fight. Playing a cryptrunner, thief, fighter or magician, you try to beat the other players. But even when there's no other player, Gruftmeister Adventure can be played as a solo-adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start at the skeleton of count Gramwuml. From there they explore the crypt room by room, adding new floor tiles. Use actions to explore the crypt, open doors, fight undead or cast spells. Once you encounter a closed door or a coffin, you go to the arena and fight with your skills. A real challenge for both younger and older players. Finally no more orgies of throwing dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruftmeister Adventure is a totally new game, you don't need an older version of Gruftmeister. Everything needed for the adventure is included: 18 floor-tiles for all-new adventures every time, 140 cards for monsters, treasures, doors, spells, more than 100 wooden pieces, the fighting arena with all the parts for thrilling duels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Gruftmeister&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
