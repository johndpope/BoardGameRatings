			<description>Drinking Quest 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinking Quest 3: Nectar of the Gods is the final entry in the Drinking Quest trilogy. Chuglox returns and teams up with 3 Gods taking on the biggest monsters and most uncomfortable saving throw situations yet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinking Quest 3: Nectar of the Gods features these four quests:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilevel Forest: Now that you're super powerful and are questing with 3 Gods, you're not going to start with weak low level goblins. These are the toughest goblins yet, they work out all the time and know how buff they are. It's dangerous to go alone, drink this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hordor - Land of the Hoarding Dragons: One does not simply walk into Hordor... because there are a lot of useless objects blocking the way. Nobody told these dragons that they should be hoarding valuable treasure instead of this useless junk. Oh is that a yard sale?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bosses Clubhouse: What luck! All of the toughest bosses hanging out in one place! It's time to save the DQniverse from a Beer-Holder, An Overly Attached Cyclops and Trent, the Bro Hive Mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolute Power is Awesome: This quest is interesting because you've just killed all of the serious threats to the DQniverse. You've already won. How will the heroes live out their days? Will they use their power responsibly or will you find creative ways to torment the wait staff because you're bored? The series does have an ending and the card is in this quest. Too bad you won't remember it the next morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
