			<description>From the web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most potent and the most dangerous of the opponents of the Third Imperium are the humans of the Solomani Confederation. This volume of the Traveller's Aide Series introduces you to the naval forces of the Solomani.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TA9 provides you with an indepth look into the structure and organization of the Solomani Navy as it has deployed in the current war with the Imperium, as well as providing you detailed data on over 30 ships in the Confederation fleets including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The newly deployed, powerful Bejing Class Fast Dreadnought&lt;br/&gt;    * The small yet versatile Viper Class Fighter/Bomber&lt;br/&gt;    * The commonly encountered Yamamoto Class Strike Cruiser&lt;br/&gt;    * The dreaded Zhukov Class Troop Carrier&lt;br/&gt;    * The tried and true Victory Class Battlecruiser&lt;br/&gt;    * The technologically advanced Zeus Class Battlecruiser&lt;br/&gt;    * The Solomani Secret Police's Purity Class Recon Frigate&lt;br/&gt;    * The standard Defender Class Light Patrol Cruiser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each comes with a description of the function and purpose of the ship, as well as detailed design specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the original Fighting Ships, this volume covers most every range of ship class ranging from mammoth dreadnoughts and battleships, to the smallest of fighters, to the non-combat support vessels needed to tend the fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the vessels that fought in the Solomani Rim War. Traveller players in other eras may run into earlier or later versions of these ships, making TA9 and indispensable tool for Traveller campaigns of any era!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
