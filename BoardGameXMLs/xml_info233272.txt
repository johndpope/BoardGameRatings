							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mercenaries of Bluffside</name>
									
			<description>Bluffside Web Enhancement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffside plays host to a large number of mercenary companies, all vieing for lucrative contracts protecting fat merchants and their caravans from the depredations of local bandits. Well, perhaps not all of them. Mercenaries have only one thing in common: they all want to be paid to fight. As for the rest of it, each company has different ways about them. Some are strict and disciplined and keep their soldiers in line, while others rampage across the surrounding countryside, looting and burning as they go. Most mercenary companies will stick to the contract, which normally includes a clause for surrendering in the face of overwhelming odds. There are a few, however, who will switch sides for a chest of gold, all previous contracts forgotten. Such occurrences are rare, as word gets around and no one would hire such a company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
