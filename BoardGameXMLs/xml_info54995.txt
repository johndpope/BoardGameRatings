							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Damn Heroes Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;Time for some thrillin' heroics...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big damn heroes.  That's you and your crew.  Don't matter where you are in the 'Verse or how you aim to pay for those Fruity Oaty bars.  Could be you're flyin' a ship held together by spit and duct tape, haulin' cargo that the Feds would consider a mite questionable.  Could be you're flyin' in a Piao Leong cruiser, doin' righteous work for the Alliance.  You and yours are Big Damn Heroes and, as such, you need a Big Damn Handbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which, as it happens, is what you're holdin'.  In this book, a partner to the Serenity Role Playing Game, you'll find new Traits such as Ain't Got Time to Bleed and Glory Hound.  There's expanded and clarified rules for character and ship combat.  More information on the Chinese culture in the 'Verse, including the Tongs and new Chao Ji Chinese phrases and proper names.  And you say you want to do a little business with your old buddy, Badger?  You'll find his description and game stats, along with a host of other NPCs -- some friendly, some not so much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's an awful lot more in this very fine book, but we're runnin' out of room to tell you about it, so best you just pick it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's to you and your Big Damn Heroes.  Keep flyin'!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
