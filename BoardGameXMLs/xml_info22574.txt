			<description>This is part of the Big Deal series of card games by Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a theme of rock-scissors-paper.  It is played in two different rounds.  In the first round, players take turns turning up cards on a face-down tableau.  If they turn up a set of winners, these cards are taken into hand.  When all of the card possible are taken, the second round begins, which is essentially a game of war between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
