			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video game cartridge simulates a pinball machine. Using two joysticks (one for each flipper), players take turns trying to score as many points as possible with the five balls they start with. Points are awarded for sending the ball into the &amp;quot;thumper-bumpers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game cartridge was manufactured for the VideoBrain, a 1977 (fairly unsuccessful) entrant in the personal computer market manufactured by Umtech Incorporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
