			<description>The Zombicide: Black Plague Companion App serves as a digital replacement for the Survivor Dashboards used in the boardgame to keep track of each character&amp;rsquo;s equipment inventory, experience and skills. &lt;br/&gt;Some of the features of the Companion App include:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A virtual deck of equipment cards which allows control over your survivors' inventory.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The  app can control the Zombie spawning deck.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; As you gain experience and new Danger Levels, your new Skill options are automatically displayed, and the app incorporates any pertinent new game effects.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Action Bar, allows players to  tick off each specific action as you take it, so you always know what actions you have left.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Roll virtual dice for any of your equipped weapons, automatically calculating successful hits according to any combat skills you may have.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Choose any of the Survivor characters, including the promos. Up to 24 Survivors can be managed on the same device.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Network capabilities;  Each player can use their own device if preferred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
