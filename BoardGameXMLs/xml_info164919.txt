			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crew is an open world driving game, with a huge map to drive on. The entire US coast to coast is available (with distances shrunk naturally). It's all done seamlessly with no loading screens, so it's entirely possible to start at Key West and just drive all the way to Seattle in a couple of hours real time. Many major landmarks are on the map, it was very cool to drive around and visit Yankee Stadium, Cape Canaveral, Mount Rushmore, Las Vegas etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is full of missions that you can attempt, you drive across the trigger spot and then do what the missions ask. Mission types are things like Speed runs where you have to maintain a high speed and dodge traffic, Slalom runs where you weave in and out of virtual markers and traffic on the road in front of you, Jump for distance, Hill Climbing, Accuracy runs where you have to follow a precise track, etc. Doing the mission well rewards you with improved car parts, virtual money and experience. Soup up your car with the parts, buy more parts or brand new cars or decorations like spoilers and paint jobs with the cash, and level up with the experience. Levelling up gives you a perk point to spend on your character in five different categories. Missions have a minimum level required, so some won't be available to attempt until you level up. There will also be a real world currency option for those who want to just buy things outright rather than slowly work their way up.&lt;br/&gt;The Crew is a revolutionary action-driving game developed exclusively for next-gen consoles. It takes you and your friends on a reckless ride inside a massive, open-world recreation of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MOST VARIED DRIVING EXPERIENCE OF ALL TIME&lt;br/&gt;Take part in a relentless ride to move up the ranks of the 510s, a gang grown around Detroit's illegal street racing scene &amp;ndash; making a rep for yourself on the underground-racing scene and ultimately taking down their activities all across the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maneuver through the bustling streets of New York City to lose the cops, cruise down sunny Miami Beach or trek through the breathtaking plateaus of Monument Valley. Each locale comes with its own set of surprises and driving challenges to master. On your journey you will encounter other players on the road &amp;ndash; all potentially worthy companions to crew up with, or future rivals to compete against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
