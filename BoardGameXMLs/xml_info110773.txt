							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Turbo Kutas</name>
									
			<description>Turbo Kutas is a Polish traditional card game for three or more players. It's slightly modified version of Kuku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic rules are the same like in Kuku, but when a player has three cards in the same color or value, instead of saying &amp;quot;Kuku&amp;quot;, he places those cards on the table (usually quickly and noisy). At that moment every other player has to put his cards (regardless of colors and values) on the table as quick as possible. The last player who layed his cards receives first syllable of &amp;quot;Turbo Kutas&amp;quot; title - Tur. If this player loses another round he receives the second syllable - Turbo, and so on. When one of the players collects all 4 syllables he is the loser and gets the title - &amp;quot;Turbo Kutas&amp;quot;. All other players are the winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
