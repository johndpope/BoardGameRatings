			<description>From the rear cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure 3: Trillion Credit Squadron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like Book 2: High Guard, this volume is about space forces, what they do and how they fight.  The fighting arms of the navy are the core of those organisations and Adventure 3: Trillion Credit Squadron allows players to construct, deploy and engage these fleets.  This book takes what was presented in Book 2: High Guard and pushes further into the organisation and building of capital ships, the equipment they use, and the locales they fight within.  The assets available to architects and limitations on design and construction, such as funds, required capabilities and pilots, are all present here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Campaign Play chapter gives everything needed to set up a campaign with planetary budgets, construction allocations and diplomacy.  The campaign turn is detailed, as are the effects of a player's actions.  Several additional options are also presented to expand a campaign further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
