			<description>The cardboard game board is assembled into a kind of stair-like chessboard (rising up to a peak in one of the corners). Each player has four different playing pieces and tries to move his/her frog king to the peak with several coins attached to it. The coins are magnetic and so are the playing pieces. When a coin is reached, it can be attached of flipped over to the other side which belongs to the other player. A player who manages to flip all coins to his/her side has also won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
