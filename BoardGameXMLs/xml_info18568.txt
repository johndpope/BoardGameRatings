			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this game, you're one of four Banshees racing to be the first to collect five skulls from the surrounding tombs. Standing on the red-stained stones (I'm not certain why they're stained red, but I suspect it's leakage from the tombs), you perform the mystic ritual of 'Spinning the Bones' to overcome the magic spells of the Stone Sentinels (which keep the tombs closed). Next you peer inside the tomb, hoping to find a skull to steal (the skeletons don't mind because then they're able to watch the race, which they enjoy greatly), and hoping not to find a Vampire (because you would then have to give the Vampire a skull for having disturbed him). Racing away with a skull, you think you might WIN this time...and then you see the horrible Zombie lurching towards you, intent on eating...that's right....your SKULL!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(MIDNIGHT BANSHEES has a spinner under the gameboard,&lt;br/&gt;so you never know which tomb might contain a Vampire!)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
