			<description>From Published Sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Supplement 3: Patron Encounters is a collection of 34 adventure ideas for Traveller games. Ideal for a quick game or an unexpected twist in an ongoing scenario, the adventure seeds in this book can be dropped easily into any Traveller setting or era. All material is compatible with any version of the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patron Encounters are presented in the time-honored fashion a person wants something doing and is willing to offer a reward for completing the task. Each patron encounter has several possible outcomes to keep the players guessing just what they have got themselves involved in this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by the Avenger Enterprises creative team plus long-time Traveller stalwarts from the Traveller Mailing List, Patron Encounters contains enough scenarios, odd jobs and misadventures to keep a Traveller group busy for many weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avenger Quote: &amp;quot;For that impromptu game or the party who insist on wandering off the planned track, Patron Encounters is a lifejacket for harassed Referees. Featuring the talents of the Traveller Mailing List, people who have kept the game alive all these years, we think we have created a worthy successor to the classic 76 Patrons.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
