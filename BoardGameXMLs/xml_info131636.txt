			<description>Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar, also known as Ultima Forever or Ultima4Ever is a free-to-play, cross-platform, online, action role-playing game developed by Mythic Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It is formally a part of the Ultima series. Information was previously released by BioWare in mid-2011 and more information was released on July 11, 2011. It was officially announced at the San Diego Comic-Con International on July 12, 2012 and it was fully released for iOS on August 7, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic states that the game will provide &amp;quot;fully integrated, cross-platform play&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based upon Ultima IV, but is considered by Mythic to be an &amp;quot;action role-playing game&amp;quot;. Ultima Forever includes both online play with a group, as well as a single-player mode. Unlike Ultima IV, there is a Lady British character instead of Lord British. This is due to Richard Garriott retaining the trademark rights after he left Electronic Arts. Mythic has emphasized that the Virtues from the Ultima series will play an important part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima Forever features a top-down isometric point of view, with &amp;quot;hand-painted backgrounds and 3D characters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
