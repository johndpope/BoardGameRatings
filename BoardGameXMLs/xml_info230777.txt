			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Feeling cornered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Match corners of your cards with the targets on the table to get rid of your cards first. &lt;br/&gt; Best Elements &lt;br/&gt; - Very simple game play : Extremely fast paced / Using both sides of the cards makes the targets change constantly &lt;br/&gt; Contents &lt;br/&gt; 1 set of rules 48 double-sided cards &lt;br/&gt; Object of the Game &lt;br/&gt; Get rid of your cards first by finding corners that match the target shape. &lt;br/&gt; The Cards &lt;br/&gt; Both sides of the cards show one shape (of 4 possible) in one color (of 4 possible) at the center. At each corner, part of a shape is shown in one of the colors with each shape and color represented once on each side of the card. &lt;br/&gt; Preparations &lt;br/&gt; Shuffle the cards, place one at the middle of the table and distribute the remaining cards evenly between the players. Surplus cards are discarded. &lt;br/&gt; The Game &lt;br/&gt; There is no taking turns in this game; everyone plays as fast as they can to get rid of your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everyone is ready; flip over the card on the table. Now everybody races to find a card that has a corner matching the shape and color at the center of the card on the table (remember that you are allowed to use both sides).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find a card that matches; put it down on top of the card on the table and continue with the new card. &lt;br/&gt; The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
