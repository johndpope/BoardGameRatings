			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control Dirk the Daring in another adventure based off of the classic laserdisc coin-op game, Dragon's Lair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1990, Roller Coaster was ported to the Nintendo Game Boy as Dragon's Lair: The Legend, with the game's plot and graphics amended in order to closer resemble those of the original Dragon's Lair coin-op. As less of the playing area was visible in the Game Boy port than in the Spectrum version, the display was effectively a window on each of the original version's screens, scrolling within each one and flicking to the next when the edge of the screen was reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dragon's Lair: The Legend&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
