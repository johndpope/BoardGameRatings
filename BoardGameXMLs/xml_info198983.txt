			<description>From the Preface:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wondered if there were complete stock stats for the many starships that only appear modified or incomplete in the West End Games sourcebooks and supplements? Although supplements have been released that focus on stock versions of starships (WEG 40143, Pirates &amp;amp; Privateers; WEG 40029, The Far Orbit Project; WEG 40150, Stock Ships; WEG 41005, Adventure Journal #5) many still only exist in modifid and/or &lt;br/&gt;incomplete form. While most of these starships are light freighters, there are also several starfighters and some capital ships. This article proposes unofficial stock statistics for those missing starships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can be sorted into three different categories: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Modified starship statistics: These are usually privately owned starships that have been more or less extensively modified by their owners.&lt;br/&gt;    Incomplete starship statistics: These starships only are published with a short statistics block with the minimum of needed game values.&lt;br/&gt;    Modified and incomplete statistics: A combination of the first two categories. Their stock statistics are the most difficult to reconstruct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
