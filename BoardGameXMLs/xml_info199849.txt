			<description>PEEKABOOM is a fast and outrageously fun strategy game where you work with your partner to assemble and detonate your explosive device before your opponents can detonate theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds easy? Not so fast! You need to use secret signals to let your partner know when your device is ready to explode. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it too obvious or you&amp;rsquo;ll get caught. But if it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious enough, your partner won&amp;rsquo;t notice it&amp;hellip; And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to watch your opponents or you&amp;rsquo;ll miss their secret signals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play: &lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player gets a secret signal card, 3 explosives cards (the player's hand) and a stack of unknown explosives cards. To start a round, each player takes a card from the top of their stack and places it face up in the center of the table. Then the player tries to collect 3 of a kind by discarding a card from their hand and collecting one from the center of the table. There are no turns - players collect cards simultaneously. As soon as a player has 3 of a kind, he or she performs the secret signal described on the secret signal card (e.g. touch your nose, tap the table, etc...). If the player's partner sees the signal and shouts 'BOOM!' that team wins the round. If an opponent sees the signal and shouts 'SNIP!' the opponent's team wins the round. The first team to reach 10 points wins (7 points for a 6 player game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced strategies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bluff! Send fake signals to make your opponents mistakenly say &amp;lsquo;SNIP!&amp;rsquo;. &lt;br/&gt;     Watch what explosives your opponents are collecting. Enjoy the look of surprise on their faces when you say &amp;lsquo;SNIP!&amp;rsquo; before they have even made their signal. &lt;br/&gt;     Alternatively, if you see an opponent collecting a particular explosive, grab it when it appears on the table before they manage to grab it themselves. &lt;br/&gt;     Even better, if you already have an opponent&amp;rsquo;s card in your hand, play it and say &amp;lsquo;SNIP!&amp;rsquo; as soon as he or she picks it up. &lt;br/&gt;     You should also watch what your partner is collecting, maybe you have a card he or she can use. &lt;br/&gt;     Watch for players who aren&amp;rsquo;t collecting any cards, they probably have collected 3 of a kind already. &lt;br/&gt;     Confuse your opponent by constantly dropping and collecting extra cards so that they can&amp;rsquo;t see what explosives you are really collecting. &lt;br/&gt;     There are blank signal cards in the Signals deck. Make up your own signals. &lt;br/&gt;     For more advanced players - don&amp;rsquo;t use the Signals deck at all! Each team makes up 3 Signals before the game and uses them from start to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
