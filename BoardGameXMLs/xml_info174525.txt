			<description>A challenging adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CardPG takes the best elements of such games as Munchkin, Talisman, and Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and polishes their best features, resulting in a game that's both easy to learn and fun to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose from one of six adventuring classes and battle a wide array of monsters, from the lowly Dire Rat up to a fearsome dragon! Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, so you can always find a character that matches your play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team up with other players to take on challenging foes, or try to go it alone and reap all the rewards for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is structured so that everyone gets to do something meaningful on every turn. There's even a handy &amp;quot;Rules Card&amp;quot; that both keeps track of whose turn it is AND serves as a reminder of all the turn phases, turning a potentially complex turn into something that anyone can understand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to level up your character to level 5 or collect 30 gold. You level up by gaining experience from defeating monsters. In each turn players can commit their characters to fight one of the enemies, buy/sell equipment, spawn new monsters or heal themselves. Players can join forces to attack enemies together and share the prize, but only if the first attacker agrees, so there's an element of negotiation involved. Additionally players have equipment and action cards at their disposal which allow them to boost their stats and perform additional actions. Monsters are defeated by comparing your characters and the enemies attack/defence stats modified by the result of a dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
