			<description>A game of pure chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a wheel with six horses on it. The wheel can be made to spin, causing the horses to go past the Winning Post each circuit of the spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bet on which horse will be last to go past the Winning Post. That horse will be numbered and that number light comes on at the side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The onjective is to have the most tokens that you used to bet with (you might even try to bet with real money).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
