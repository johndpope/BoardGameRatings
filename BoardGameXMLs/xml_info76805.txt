			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rock 'n Roll Racing is a racing game developed by Silicon &amp;amp; Synapse. The game was released in 1993 by Interplay for the SNES and Genesis and was later ported to the Gameboy Advance. What makes RnRR different from most racing games, is it's isometric point of view, the sci-fi theme, the music and the use of weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To beat the game the player has to compete on different planets in a series of tournaments (seasons). Each planet has its own graphical style and opponent. In every race, four racers are competing in a four-lap race. Racers placed 1st, 2nd or 3rd receive points for the championship. When a racing season is over, the player has to have collected a certain amount of points to advance to the next class. After two classes the player can advance to the next planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each car has a torpedo-like weapon to shoot opponents in front and a mine-like weapon for cars behind. Apart from that each car has a nitro, which gives a temporary boost in speed. All these are limited in supply. Each lap the weapons and nitro's are resupplied. The player can upgrade the type of weapons and amount of ammo on his vehicle using the money earned by winning races. Additional money can be earned by destroying opponents, lapping opponents and finding money on the track. On certain planets new cars are for sale, but buying a new car means resetting the weapon upgrades..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features the songs: &lt;br/&gt;- Bad to the Bone,&lt;br/&gt;- Paranoid,&lt;br/&gt;- The Peter Gunn theme,&lt;br/&gt;- Born to be Wild,&lt;br/&gt;- Highway star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other notable features:&lt;br/&gt;- Two player mode (also in the tournament),&lt;br/&gt;- Three difficulty levels,&lt;br/&gt;- Password system - A password is generated containing the exact status of player.&lt;br/&gt;- 7 Different drivers each with their own skills, regarding jumping, acceleration, top speed and cornering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
