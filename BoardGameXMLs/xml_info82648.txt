			<description>&amp;gt; LOOK PUMPKIN TOWN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parsely #6: Pumpkin Town is the sixth in the  Parsely line of games from Memento Mori Theatricks. Now you can &amp;ldquo;GO EAST&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;RIDE BROOM&amp;rdquo; with the best of them. It&amp;rsquo;s Halloween, the only time that human children can visit the weird world of Pumpkin Town. Can you make it back home with a bag full of goodies or will the final &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; be played on you? Parsely games are inspired by Ye Olde Text Parsers from days of yore, but substituting a live human for the computer parser. Parsely games are small, portable and fun for (almost) all occasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play them anywhere! On trips, in long lines, camping, at game cons&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play them with anyone! Young or old, expert or total n00b&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Play with a few friends or 100 random strangers at the same time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; ASK ABOUT PUMPKIN TOWN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange world where it&amp;rsquo;s always Halloween, Pumpkin Town is based on a free roleplaying game created back in 1999 by Peter Seckler with additional material by Mike Mearls and me, Jared A. Sorensen! Pumpkin Town is recommended for children as well as adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; EXAMINE SPECS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pumpkin Town v1.0 comes with a map and game guide. Parsely #1: Action Castle is not required to play but does contain the basic rules of Parsely.
