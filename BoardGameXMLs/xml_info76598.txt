			<description>A tile laying, domino-style game played within the confines of a board using 2x1 oblong shaped thick cardboard tiles of a diamond design utilising seven colours.&lt;br/&gt;The game box contains &lt;br/&gt;4 page rules sheet in 6 languages.&lt;br/&gt;a 48cm square board with 14 x 14 squares thereon onto which the tiles cover 2 adjacent squares.&lt;br/&gt;a pad of score sheets.&lt;br/&gt;4 x cardboard racks for players to display their tiles to them whilst concealing from other players.&lt;br/&gt;a box containing 49 different tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game all the tiles are placed face down on the table and each player selects 8 - 10 tiles [depending upon number of players] and puts them on his/her rack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The double tiles [coloured triangle the same each end] are numbered 1 - 7 and the player with the lowest numbered double starts the game by placing the tile to cover 2 of the 4 centre squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player [if wished] matches the end or side of one of his/her tiles and places the tile so that the triangles on the 2 tiles make a coloured square. If the player cannot or chooses not to play a tile the player misses a turn and picks up, if available, a tile from those faced down at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players cannot form squares using triangles of different colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one player succeeds in playing his last tile [or no player can play]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matches consist of several games to decide overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
