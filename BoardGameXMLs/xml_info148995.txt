							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stargate 1895</name>
									
			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Stargate 1895 is a roleplaying game where the emphasis has been placed upon simplicity and ease of use. Characters are intentionally two-dimensional yet allow you to develop them into old friends. The Game Engine upon which is based is the D20 Microlite system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in height of the Victorian era. When the British Empire was the world&amp;rsquo;s only superpower, but as yet unprepared for the extraordinary conflict to come. An era subtly different from our own history where the tales of H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling and Jules Verne were closer to reality than the average person would like to admit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
