			<description>From the back of the box: Fj&amp;ouml;r til enda is a fun, varied game where players travel around the world and have exciting adventures and all kinds of troubles. Players can win a trip with a private jet to South America, ride a bike, train, taxi or stay for a visit at the North Pole. Everybody is active the whole time and anything can happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is the first one to get six continent cards (one for each continent) wins the game. Players roll two dice and move accordingly on the map. They can use the Forward/Not cards to add/subtract from their rolls. Luck/Bad luck cards are as the name implies good or bad for the one who draws them. Continent cards are the object of the game, players have to roll a die and depending on the number, perform some action to win that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
