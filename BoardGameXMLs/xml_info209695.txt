			<description>This board game is based on the 1990's television cartoon series &amp;quot;Stickin' Around.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains two games that are played one after the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is called &amp;quot;Mix and Match the Illustrations.&amp;quot; In this game, players attempt to assemble complete characters by collecting the correct heads, bodies, and feet cards. The more characters collected in this game will help players in the second game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game is called &amp;quot;Turn the board for explorations.&amp;quot; In this game, players roll dice to advance on a board towards the goal, planet Uranus. This game is a combination of luck and skill, as the characters that you collected in the first game can allow you to affect the game, such as stealing an opponent's character, or switching positions on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
