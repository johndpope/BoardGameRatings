			<description>Manic Monster Mayhem is a hilarious story-telling card game. Fend off terrifying monsters like the T-Rex with everyday objects, wit and a sharp tongue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re walking down the street with a balloon in your hand, chewing gum in your mouth and a skunk on your shoulder. You&amp;rsquo;re just about to call your best friend, as you see a zombie that&amp;rsquo;s slowly approaching you on a unicycle. You can&amp;rsquo;t run, you can&amp;rsquo;t hide, so what are you gonna do? You&amp;rsquo;ve got 4 objects at hand&amp;hellip;Manic Monster Mayhem is a card game about stopping monsters with everyday objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-5 players&lt;br/&gt;~30-45 min&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 4 different objects, with which they have to stop beasts like a T-Rex on a pogo-stick from attacking. How they get rid of that beast is up to them &amp;ndash; defeating, bribing, seducing, scaring... everything goes. Almost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But since there are no heroines or brave adventurers among them, our poor players have to face ghastly monsters with ordinary things like spoons, lemons, vacuum cleaners and ladders. So the only way to succeed is using their wit and creativity &amp;ndash; alright, a sharp tongue might be helpful as well&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;- Each player takes a pen and a piece of paper and writes his/her name on it&lt;br/&gt;- Draw 1 Monster and put it in the middle of the table&lt;br/&gt;- Hand out 4 item cards to each player&lt;br/&gt;- Select starting player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the game is set up and a monster has been selected, our &amp;quot;heoroes&amp;quot; have to tell the others how they defeat the gharstly beast. Hereby the players take turns, beginning with the starting player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all players have told their story, they secretly vote for the best one, writing the name of that player down. Afterwards a new round begins and a new player becomes the starting player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After every monster has been defeated (number of monster = number of players) and everyone has voted, the grumpiest player counts the votes and announces the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
