			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You thought you were going to have a nice relaxing evening at the tavern. Then out of nowhere an injured man came crashing through the door. Before you knew it a figure in black threw a firebomb into the tavern and tried to burn it down. There goes your relaxing evening...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Shadows in the City, an introductory adventure in a multi-part series for the Afterpeak Systemless Setting. This adventure takes place in the city of Oshkosh, though it can easily be adapted to other locations. Someone has been murdering doctors and the town guard has asked you to help find out why. Will you catch the ones responsible for this dastardly deed? Or will the guilty go unpunished? Choose wisely, because scores of innocent lives will be saved or taken based on your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
