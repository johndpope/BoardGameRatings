			<description>In MountTen (テンガロン), players want to rid themselves of cards in hand first in order to win the round. The deck consists of green cards numbered 1-40 and red cards numbered 10-30. Players start with ten cards in hand with 2-3 players and eight cards with 4-6 players. Set the deck nearby with the top card revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start player plays any card to the center of the table. The next player must play a card at most ten lower or higher than this card, e.g., playing 14-34 if the 24 was lead. If the second-played card is lower (higher), then all subsequent cards must be lower (higher) &amp;mdash; but also always within ten of the most recently played card. If a player cannot or doesn't want to play, they pass and draw the top card of the deck, then reveal the new top card. If all players pass in turn, then whoever played the most recent card clears the table and leads a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two exceptions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. If the next player in turn can play a green card exactly ten lower or higher than the topmost card on the pile (no matter the direction of play), that player can call &amp;quot;Mount Ten!&amp;quot;, play the card, then clear the table and lead a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. If any player can play a red card exactly ten lower or higher than the topmost card on the pile (no matter the direction of play), that player can call &amp;quot;Mount Ten!&amp;quot;, play the card, then clear the table and lead a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. Each player with cards in hand scores -1 for each green card and -2 for each red card; the player who went out scores positive points equal to all the negative points scored that round. Complete as many rounds as the number of players, with the start player rotating each round. Whoever then has the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
