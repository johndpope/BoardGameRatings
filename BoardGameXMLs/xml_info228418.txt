			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of the adventure is only sanctioed for, and playable at, WINTER FANTASY 2004. This adventure is worth 8 DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS reward points.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure the PCs have been delegated to a relatively minor task in the entire attack on the Dungeon of the Hark. It&amp;rsquo;s their job to clear out the Hark&amp;rsquo;s Worg Warrens, a lesser group of dungeons almost a half a mile away from the dungeon&amp;rsquo;s main tunnels. While it is disappointing to be stationed so far away from the main fight, the PCs have a big role to play in the battle. Unbeknownst to anyone, these worg warrens will be the prime route of escape for the Hark when the battle goes against the wererats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure starts with a walk up the winding Crag Path that leads from the Delimbiyr Valley floor to the lower plains of Moorsedge. This path leads to a place called the Hanging Tree, an old, dead, and moss&amp;ndash;infested tree covered with nooses. At the base of the tree is the upper entrance to the Worg Warrens. There the PCs tangle with goblin sentries, and are in for a nasty surprise when they find that the tree is actually an animated object that lashes out its nooses in an attempt to hang trespassers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the PCs gain entrance into the warrens they come across a variety of goblinoid guards, and a rat swarm trap. Beyond those caverns they stumble upon a Zhentarim embassy and can learn more of the connection between the Hark and Llorkh. In the passages past the Zhents, the PCs delve deeper, and tangle with the lieutenants of the Hark, both in goblinoid and wererat form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deeper in the warrens still, the PCs fight worgs, more goblinoid, lesser demons, and the Hark himself. If they defeat the Hark, they&amp;rsquo;ll be the heroes of the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
