							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle with the Graf Spee</name>
									
			<description>Simple looking tactical game of the battle with AJAX, EXETER, ACHILLIES AND THE GRAF SPEE off the river platte early in ww2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy cardstock components, poor diecutting, but diecut units nevertheless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one small strategic map in the game, and several tactical maps one for each ship involved. Each player has gunnery and torpedo markers for his ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tactical maps are kept hidden from the opponent and moves are plotted with units on these maps, then translated into movement on the strategic map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory conditions are simple enough with the win going to the side sinking all the enemy. If the turn limit is reached then damage and sunk british ships factor into a victory calculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage charts include hit location and various special hits. ( speed loss, gunnery loss, jammed rudders etc. )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
