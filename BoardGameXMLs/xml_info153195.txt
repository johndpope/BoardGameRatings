			<description>The Dragon Ball Collectible Card Game (Dragon Ball CCG) is a collectible card game based on the Dragon Ball franchise, first published by Bandai in July 2008. This is not to be confused with the Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game that was released in the year 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to inflict 10 points of planet damage to the opposing player by use of your warriors. Upon doing so the game is won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you can assemble teams of characters from the shows Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball GT; you can also collect the seven dragon balls to make use of a wish card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, there is a mechanic in the game that allows you to channel chi -- certain cards will be unable to be played without channeling chi of a certain kind (ex; Alien, Earth, Super, et cetera)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
