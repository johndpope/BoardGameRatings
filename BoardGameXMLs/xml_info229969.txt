							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Journey Begins: Well of Woe (Round 1)</name>
									
			<description>A Three-Round Adventure for 1st - 3rd Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All four factions have recently been made aware, through the draconic Prophecy and other research, that there is a spot on Xen&amp;rsquo;drik known as the Well of Woe. At this spot there is some sort of flame, and interaction with that flame may hold great significance for the future of Eberron. With this in mind, all four factions are planning to send members in search of the Well of Woe and the flame. Each faction has a different goal in their interaction with the flame, so it might be possible for them to work together to meet all their goals. Getting to the Well of Woe, however, is not as simple as following a map. Travelers through Xen&amp;rsquo;drik come to find very quickly that all normal means of navigation, and even some magical ones, are useless. It is as if some things on Xen&amp;rsquo;drik just do not want to be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After getting their instructions from their leaders, the PCs meet the rest of their expedition. They head into the wilds of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik looking for the Well of Woe. After being attacked by twig blights, the PCs get lost and must deal with a lizardfolk druid, a nothic, and a yuan-ti trueblood. After being lost and possibly being ambushed by a crocodile, the PCs can encounter an orc who offers them a magical item that can give them direction toward the Well of Woe. Then the PCs enter the territory of the Slayer forestkith goblins and come across some animated wolf skeletons as they prepare for the next round of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
