							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orbi: The Roving City-Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Sitting on a disk dozens of miles across is a city of metal and glass. Yet, for as intimidating as it appears from a distance the streets are a riot of warm colors and filled the soft sounds of laughter and good cheer. This is the city of Orbi: home to the exotic Nomi and galactic hub of entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbi isn't a normal city, however, but a city-sized ship and space-station that serves as home to more than half a million aliens from across the galaxy, most of who were picked up in their home systems, as Orbi touched down on their planets to sample their culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on these worlds isn't an exception, but rather the rule. Thanks to the city-station's incredible Bend Engine, Orbi is more than capable of landing on nearly any planet they can reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this book are rules for the Nomi, the excitable six-limbed explorers of the universe. Gregarious and curious to a fault, this small race excels in the use of alien technology, using their excellent problem-solving skills and short term memories to break down alien cultures or mechanical problems with equal ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orbi is a perfect fit in any science-fiction setting, such as the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, but already contains rules to be instantly adapted to a fantasy setting instead, such as the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. And the mobile nature of the station says it doesn't need to only show up once - it can appear in different times and places throughout a campaign, no matter how far the party might travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
