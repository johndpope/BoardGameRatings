							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rottnest Island Game</name>
									
			<description>This is an educational game, endorsed by the Rottnest Island Authority and (heavily) sponsored by Agfa Film.  It's a standard Roll and Move game with a single path and a start and end.  The first half of the path is by boat from the mainland to the island, the second half is by bike on the island itself.  The main theme, not surprising given the sponsorship, is photographing wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual with these sorts of games, various points along the path cause things to happen, mostly drawing a card of some sort.  You win by getting a photograph of a quokka and getting to the end of the path.  There are a group of six quokka photo squares, such that you can't possibly miss it on the way through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main educational content of the game is a small brochure with (tourist) information about the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
