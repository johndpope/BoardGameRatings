			<description>Some can journey through the stream of time. They are the Travelers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some can control the flow of time. They are the Manipulators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some are forced to wade the tides of time. They are the Thralls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Timestream is a game of cinematic time travel, featuring mechanics that enable you to play the fun and interesting parts of a time travel story without worrying too much about how it all works. Character creation links the characters through the ages with bonds stronger than time. Play sees their evolution and changes as they strive to gain that which means most to them without suffering the inevitable consequences. Though they have ultimate power, they must balance it with their all-too-human passions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
