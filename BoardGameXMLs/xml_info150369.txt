							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mechabrick: Gangs of Neon City</name>
									
			<description>Mechabrick is a range of precision molded plastic kits to convert your minifigs into 1/144 scale fighting robots or 'mecha'. You can upgrade your mechs with weapons and accessories and then battle for supremacy in a fast-paced board game using buildings and scenery built from your favourite plastic toy building bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game in the Mechabrick product line is Gangs of Neon City. Set in the back-streets of a futuristic far-eastern metropolis the game uses durable plastic gaming boards (supplied in the game box) printed with a brick-standard grid pattern (4-bricks square) upon which movement and shooting range of the robots is measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's up to you and your imagination to build, change and rebuild the buildings and scenery on your game board from plastic toy building bricks and create your perfect battle environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game sets two or more players in a head-to-head battle of turn-based play using 'action points' to choose whether each robot should move, shoot or both in each turn. Customisation and upgrades to your robots are key to a decisive win, but be careful not to weigh down your mech with too many upgrades and make them too slow to fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The printed rulebook supplied with the boxed game is only 4 pages long and is designed to be fun and fast-paced for all the family. We will be publishing free add-ons and expanded rules for the game to keep even the most hardened gamers interested for many years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boxed game includes four of the 'Wakazashi-Class' mech kits (two black and two white), four plastic game boards, a decal sheet to customize your mechs and your scenery, two D6 dice and a full rule/instruction booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
