			<description>A player discovers that the crook wears blue trousers and has a beard during the &amp;quot;crook spinner&amp;quot; turns on. He further thinks that the crook wore boots and had a pocket torch with him. &lt;br/&gt;The active player correspondingly puts his four search items on these four features of his &amp;quot;Search Table&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;In the evaluation phase the players check his features with the crook card. He will notice that the trousers and the beard were right, but boot and pocket torch wrong. Result: The policeman in the game moves two fields forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to catch the crook before others do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
