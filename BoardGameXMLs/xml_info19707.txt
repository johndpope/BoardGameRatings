			<description>The players place square tiles on which footbridges and pillar places are printed. Footbridges are pathways used by players to transport pillars.&lt;br/&gt;Then they place new square tiles on the pillars, new pillars on the plates and so on in order to build a pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player scores points when he places tiles. The number of points depends on the pillars on which the tile is placed. The more the pyramid rises, the more these tiles make points. Thus each player must try to place a maximum number of tiles and to place them on pillars of his own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the pyramid is finished, some penalties are given to the players who let unused pillars on the building site. The foreman who has got the most points gets glory, wealth, women and horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
