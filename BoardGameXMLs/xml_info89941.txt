							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mutazoids 2nd Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutazoids 2nd edition is a post-holocaust role-playing game. It takes place in a dark future with political and racial overcasts caused by governmental suppression of the mutant majority. Players create Enforcers - the futures equivalent to police officers who carry out laws passed by the cruel government known as the Second Republic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutazoids 2nd edition contains 30 more pages than the original game. These pages include more information on secret political organizations, new equipment, a beginning scenario... plus a lot more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2173, one-hundred and sixty years after an accidental virus was released into the earth's atmosphere. It caused death to over 80 percent of the world's population. The majority that survived are mutated, and society is slowly crumbling. It is up to you to keep chaos from prevailing. That is your job... you are an Enforcer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
