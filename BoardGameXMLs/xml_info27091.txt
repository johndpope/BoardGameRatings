			<description>N.E.W. Nano Engineered War is a strategy war game that engages players to use nano-technology to simulate ancient creatures from heads, bodies and legs pattern cards. Nanite material is required to create the creatures and each player fights for their individual clan to gain all of the collection material to help their tribe survive. The background of the game is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planet Xioc has endured major wars throughout decades of time. The life sustainable resources of the planet have returned to their raw element forms. Air, food, water and plant life is scarce, and only a few humans have survived this mass devastation. Nano-technologies, more specifically molecular sized robots called nanots, were invented prior to the apocalyptic destruction. These self replicating machines along with a special material called nanite is the only way that humans have been able to synthesize small life sustainable ecosystems across the planet. Nanite is found in only trace amounts on the planet and is considered extremely valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions and tribes of people living in anarchy, fight for what meager nanite remains. War is no longer waged in taking the life of another human directly, but is decided through nano-engineered war battle arenas. A small amount of battle nanite is used with nanots and pattern cards to create virtual creatures that fight for their tribe. The prize is to win the precious collection nanite that will allow the tribe to continue living.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the leaders of your respective clans and are battling to keep your family alive! Good luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
