			<description>Inflate a number of balloons equal to one less than the total number of players and place them under the Bang Box.  Each player on their turn spins the spinner and must drive that number of nails into any holes of their choice without busting a balloon.  When a player bursts a balloon that player is out of the game.  The remaining players continue until there is only one player left, the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
