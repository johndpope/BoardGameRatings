			<description>&amp;quot;Rouba Queijo&amp;quot; means, in a free translation from portuguese, &amp;quot;Stealing Cheese&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a two player game where each player takes control of a mouse and need to put as many cheese as they can in their respective holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a high-relief thin bubble plastic representing an old basement and the cheese are represented by small dice. There's a magnet under the mice and in the ends of rods that are used to control them. Mice and cheese go over the board and players control their mice using the magnet on the rods under the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
