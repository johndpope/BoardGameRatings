							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghosts of Allan&#039;duril</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden within the foothills of the Coldarai mountains the small mining community of Allan'duril had always remained peaceful and secluded. One of only three sources of high-grade silver used in the production of currency for the Union Mint in Castaal, the mines of Allan'duril have played an important part in maintaining the prosperity of the Kalborean Union. There came a day however, when two miners staggered terrified from the mine, their stories of spectral figures and deadly sabotage infecting the superstitious townsfolk with a certainty that the mines were both haunted and unsafe. On that day production ceased and none would enter the mine until an Inquisitor could be called, one who might put aside the concerns of the settlement and declare the mine safe once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
