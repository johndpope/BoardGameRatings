							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caracalla</name>
									
			<description>In ancient Roman times Caracalla was a beautiful public bath, the cultural an social center of these times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to meet their family members (and other family members) in one of the 6 baths by placing their members in the Caracalla and moving them around. Points are awarded for holding meetings where only certain persons score (e.g. only the female, only the grandparents etc.). Every player (family) that participates in the meeting scores a certain amount of points for each scoring member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player who reaches the temple first (which is in fact the end of the scoring track).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quite interesting game about forming different types of groups and so influencing not only the personal score, but also the score of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
