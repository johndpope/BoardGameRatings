			<description>Outwit your fellow swashbucklers to claim the treasures hidden in the Cove! the blood seal which lies over the entrance to the Kraken's lair requires items which are identical in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kraken's Cove is a social Bluffing game inspired by the prisoner's dilemma. it is designed for 4 to 8 players and lasts about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure cards are placed facedown for the amount of players in the game. each player starts the day with two facedown cards of stolen goods, these can come in many forms from being magical elements, precious gems and sometimes just everyday things such as grass. players must aim to get identical items so that they may access the treasures and score Victory points in the form of Coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;on their turn players will trade one of the two item cards they have with another player, this is done facedown and both players must agree to the trade. you can be as honest or as dishonest as you like, keep in mind players are after what you may or may not have so keep your wits about you and suss out the liars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have an identical pair you may enter the lair which the kraken sleeps, you may now secretly look at a facedown treasure card. you may now choose to take either take this card or look at another one, the second card however must be taken. the treasure cards have point values on aswell as curses and items which carry bonuses. once all but one of the treasures have been taken all players must flip over their cards and score their winnings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who collects the most coins (victory points) over a period of 7 weeks (rounds) will go home the victor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
