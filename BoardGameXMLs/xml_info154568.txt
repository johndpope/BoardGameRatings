							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Compounded: Methamphetamine</name>
									
			<description>Designed as an exclusive promo for Unpub4. The Compounded Methamphetamine compound was made for those clamoring for an expansion based on a wildly popular television show. This is probably the closest to that becoming a reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Methamphetamine Compound can be used as a Lab Partner card, following the same rules for that expansion (which is included in all copies of the base game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
