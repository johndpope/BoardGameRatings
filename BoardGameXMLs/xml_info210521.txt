			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game spaces in RAUF!en are arranged in several levels. The bottommost level is the widest one; the more you go up, the fewer spaces there are on every level. The cones always have to be placed on the bottommost level, and there is a maximum of three cones in one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving to the next higher level is allowed only if all spaces of the current level are occupied &amp;mdash; and moving up costs you cones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may be cones of only one color on a space. However, they can be captured by opposing cones if those have the majority there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucial for the win is placing and moving your own cones at the right moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
