							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Di End</name>
									
			<description>Di End is very simple abstract game for 2 players. It could be played everywhere, every time, and could be played with chess or draughts (8x8) set. You've got 8 pawns each, all in 1. (or 8.) row. You must capture maximum possible number of opponents pawns in your turn. To win, you must capture all of opponents pawns or to move all your pawns which still are on the board to the last row. Ties are rare, but possible. You must pay attention, because it's possible to lose more than 5 pawns in one move, even if it doesn't look like. Easy to learn, hard (or maybe impossible) to perfect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
