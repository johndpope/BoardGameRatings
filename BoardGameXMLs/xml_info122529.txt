							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Afriqu&#039;enjeux: The Africa Memory Game</name>
									
			<description>The purpose of this game is to test and increase players' knowledge of Africa.  Players travel through different regions of Africa and have to answer a number of questions about the continent along the way.  The progress they make will be partly determined by how well they answer these questions.  Players have to pay a fine when they do not answer questions correctly, but even if they do answer questions correctly, they still have to face a number of obstacles that may slow them down.  Players have to quit the game if they lose all of their money.  The first player to reach &amp;quot;The Heart of Africa&amp;quot; wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
