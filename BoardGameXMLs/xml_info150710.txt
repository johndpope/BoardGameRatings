			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spellbook Games is pleased to announce the release of another versatile system-less game-aid for Games Masters, Town Generator.  A Games Master can&amp;rsquo;t always plan out every location in their campaigns, so when Players venture into uncharted territory, turn to Town Generator to fill in the gaps. Town Generator provides sixteen methods to generate descriptions of the essential services found in any locale, from a tiny hamlet up through a larger urban setting.  This product is sure to cover everything an Adventurer might want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, Town Generator also provides a section on generating important locale information, such as the local form of governance, an area&amp;rsquo;s loyalty, selecting among local specialties and products.  And more, there is an extra bonus section that provides help in generating names for towns and for city streets.  Town Generator is a 42-page system-less product usable by every Games Master. It can be a highly useful campaign design tool in addition to solving problems at the game table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
