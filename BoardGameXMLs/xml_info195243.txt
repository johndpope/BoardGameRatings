			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All aspects of the game depend upon card play, including character creation.  Characters are defined by random card draws; characters primarily are defined by narrative tags.  The course of the game also is directed by card draws and plays.  Action resolution uses either cards or dice depending upon the circumstances.  The game can be played in one evening or over the course of several evening in campaign mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specialized cards used in the game are provided as text, but they have not been formatted.  Play thus would require some investment in making and printing cards prior to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
