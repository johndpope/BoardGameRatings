			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of the furtive whitetail buck! Considered by veteran hunters to be one of the most challenging big game species on our continent, he is an amazingly adaptable animal, inhabiting regions from the fringes of our cities to remote wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join fellow hunters in the stimulating, educational, sometimes frustrating, but always exciting chase as the whitetail seeks to elude you on his own turf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WORLD RECORD BUCK is more than just a great game. It is a fine training tool for the young or future hunter, and serves as a reminder to us 'old timers' as well as we prepare for the next season. This game will help you get it all together! And who knows? The taker of the next 'World Record Buck' just may be you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this game, players play both a hunter and a deer, trying to stalk the deer belonging to other players while moving their own deer away from any hunters. First player to bag two deer win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
