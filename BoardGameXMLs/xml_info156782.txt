							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Thousand Dead Babies (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple introductory adventure about a small little town in the grips of some religious turmoil. It switched to follow the Holy Church about a generation ago, throwing off their ties to the Old Gods (mostly). There are some hold outs. Recently however, tales of demon worship and witchcraft have begun to flourish, leading the young and inexperienced priest to enter a panic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town is at a crossroads and the players can influence what happens to the very souls of the town&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. Will they let the witches and warlocks rule the night? Crush the pagans once and for all? Overthrow the oppressive Holy Church or perhaps just keep everyone from killing each other and hopefully get along?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer is probably whichever one occurs as a side effect of stripping the place of everything valuable that isn&amp;rsquo;t nailed down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;As some of you are no doubt already aware,  the adventure A Thousand Dead Babies has been updated to include professional art, layout and cartography by Jez Gordon.  It also includes a dungeon that was previously only hinted at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
