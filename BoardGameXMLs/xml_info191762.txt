			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Turtle, Turtle, What's My Name?&amp;quot; is a light game to be played when four dear friends have gathered in the parlor for an evening's entertainment. Each of you will play the part of a character from the beloved children's books of the celebrated author, Timothy Roberts. Do not fret; it is not necessary that any or all of you have intimate familiarity with his stories or the delightful talking animals that dwell therein. Simply follow the instructions given here carefully, set out some tea and sandwiches, and you and your party guests will be ensured a grand time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Three characters are polite turtles, who speak in a deliberate and calm manner, and only in statements (never questions). The fourth is Banger the rabbit who is mischievous (though not malicious) and interrupts whenever he wishes.&lt;br/&gt;Two of the turtles, Flopsy and Mopsy, must try to deduce the third turtle's name. That third turtle cannot speak its own name. Banger is trying to get in the way, preventing Flopsy and Mopsy from working out the turtle's name before the game ends, but can be quieted for a while by the other three.&lt;br/&gt;The game should last around fifteen minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
