			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prism is an intriguing game that presents a generic, universal system that is modular in design.  That is, the system can be used as a whole but if some part of it is not satisfactory, the game has been designed so that part can be replaced with another rule set from another system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prism itself is not actually a complete system, lacking a native combat system and a native magic/psionics system.  Instead, Prism utilizes the combat system presented in Iron Crown Enterprises' Rolemaster and Spacemaster books.  This system will require reference to the Arms Law &amp;amp; Claw Law and Spacemaster products.  Prism does adapt these rules in minor ways.  Prism does not specify a particular magic or psionics system, noting that such systems often are tied closely to particular settings.  The rules suggest that Steve Jackson Games' GURPS Magic is a good resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two &amp;quot;sub systems&amp;quot; are presented as part of the Prism rules.  These systems are intended to be separate and fully modular, suitable for use with Prism or any other game.  These two systems are presented in separate appendices and they are 1) the IRIS Initiative System, and 2) The RDI System of Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remainder of Prism is focused on character creation (nine chapters) and maneuver resolution systems (as separate from combat systems, 5 chapters).  Finally, a chapter of equipment and a chapter of reference materials completes the rule set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
