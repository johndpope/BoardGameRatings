							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orkhorde</name>
									
			<description>Orkhorde is a card game based around the daily life of an orc horde. Planning their actions, the orcs can decide to favor their own tribe or to cooperate with larger raids. In the end, it's important how many trophies the tribes gather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game turn, each tribe decides for its members how much work they will spend at the tasks, which is limited by the health of the orcs. Afterwards, these tasks are resolved: the shaman runs a ritual assisted by the other orcs to improve the warbands' chances, the male orcs go hunting alone and as the big warband, the female orcs educate the children and gather fruits and herbs, and in the end the orcs have a chance to improve their position in the pecking order by fighting their immediate superiors. Hunting, raiding and fighting for a better place in the pecking order can net an orc not only food &amp;ndash; orcs that go hungry, starve and lose health and thus have fewer activity points to spend for tasks &amp;ndash; but also trophies (trophy points) which determine which tribe is the most successful in the end. Part of the rule system has been taken from Wolfsspuren and is used with permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the planning phase and inter-horde rivalries, there is lots of competition and backstabbing as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
