							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Vehicles to Recover in the Savage Wastes, Set 1</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, so you have this party of post apocalypse survivors that suddenly want to scrounge the ruined city for running, drivable vehicles. Even worse, you have a few detail sticklers in the group that want to know exactly what the found vehicles are? Panic, repeatedly offer them the same vehicle make and model over and over again, or reach for a random roll chart? If you decided to reach for a random roll chart then you are in luck&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s a nifty one that will give you results from atvs and scooters to midsize sedans and sport utility vehicles to recreational vehicles, tour buses, and garbage trucks. Grab your percentile dice and roll away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
