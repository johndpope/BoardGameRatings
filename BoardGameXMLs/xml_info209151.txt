			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Black Monk, the characters are people living in a desolate, but vibrant world where time seems to have lost meaning. Living for decades, perhaps longer, in isolation from others, the people of Elysia toil in work, only to be visited once a year by the Black Monk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In between these visits, their lives are interrupted by sometimes trivial and other times confusing events. Everything seems to fit together like an elongated jigsaw puzzle, but no one can see the starter pieces stretching across the horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But they don&amp;rsquo;t complain. There is always more work. The village needs workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then one evening, the sun stayed in the sky all day. When there should have been night, the sun remained. And now it feels as though it&amp;rsquo;s been years since the Black Monk came. But perhaps it was yesterday. Nothing is right&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is that blood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Praxis is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters into dramatic situations and is based on the principles of the Protocol game system. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start-points, roles, plot twists, and finales. Praxis does not play like a traditional roleplaying game. It does not require a gamemaster. There is no script. No endpoint. No cumbersome or extraneous mechanics detracting from the story. An entire epic can be played in under four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
