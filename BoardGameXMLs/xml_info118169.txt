							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Magical Society Aggressive Ecology: The Undead Leviathan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is an aggressive ecology? It&amp;rsquo;s a new type of challenge for your players, a monster with many faces, a web of interrelated challenges that can together form a complex encounter-in-depth. It is a world-building device based upon a magical interrelationship between disparate, yet connected creatures. It is, in short, something not seen before and something not quickly forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are few aggressive ecologies found in the deep oceans, and only one centered upon the rotting carcass of a fallen whale. A whale fall is an unusual event in and of itself, but occasionally these massive bounties of detrital material land in places that simply cannot sustain natural life of any sort: a negative energy sink. These strange negative energies infuse a whale carcass with unholy power giving unlife, mobility, and malevolence&amp;mdash;creating an undead leviathan. But worse, after enough time, the undead leviathan rises to torment the land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This aggressive ecology presents appropriate challenges for groups of 10th to 25th levels, ranging from the oceans to the land. Present your players a new type of challenge, the Aggressive Ecology!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
