			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;The Jumpers Roleplaying Game is a game of survival. Players randomly travel through the infinite expanse of the multiverse, working to cope, to survive, and hopefully find their way home. The game is ideal for players who are new to the idea of a roleplaying game, as well as groups who may not be able to always get together the same group of people to play a game every week. Whatever your desire from an RPG, Jumpers is there!&lt;br/&gt; This version of the core rules contains all-new artwork from Robert Krums as well as running commentary from several Jumpers providing insight and survival tips for those unfortunate enough to be pulled into the chaotic existence that is jumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
