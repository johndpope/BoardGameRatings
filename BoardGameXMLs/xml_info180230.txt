			<description>Turnpike is the game of highway mayhem. Life on the road means relying on quick wits, mad skills, and a bit of luck to get you there in one piece. Turnpike captures the rolling shark tank that is the modern highway system where complete strangers shamelessly screw each other over in an infuriating race that no one really wins &amp;mdash; until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Players roll dice to move. The play actions are inter-weavable and open. Players may do the following in any order: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     move their car&lt;br/&gt;     play cards&lt;br/&gt;     move a non-player car &lt;br/&gt;     add or subtract a car&lt;br/&gt;     generally wreak ruin upon the road &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Every turn, players move non-player cars out of their way and into the path of opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The cards give players movement bonuses, allow control over road traffic, and let them mess with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. The card types are: DRIVER, TRAFFIC, AGGRESSIVE, INSTANT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. The winner is the player to push through the traffic jam and get to the EXIT first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
