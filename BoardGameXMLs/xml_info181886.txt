							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Ravenmere</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ravenmere is a small village situated between the market towns of Appleby and Cricklewood, and once supplied both with cattle and the odd sheep. Today the village has been isolated by the local lord, for a plague has come to Ravenmere and all of its villagers are dead by their own hands. What will bold aventurers discover in the isolated village?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is what I like to call an Adventure Site, a location-based adventure that can be easily slotted into an exisitng setting with, I hope, a minimum of fuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
