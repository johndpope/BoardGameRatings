							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Beat</name>
									
			<description>In Tank Beat players take control of Vill Katjue, a rookie tank driver lost in the chaos of an invasion. The game features 24 missions as well as skirmish modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with the stylus, with players drawing paths on the touch screen for their tank to follow, dragging the stylus across the screen to rotate the camera, and tapping on enemy units to fire upon them. More than 20 different tanks and combat vehicles such as APCs or missile launchers are available to the player, each differing in speed, defense, firepower, and weapons. Players can also give commands to allied AI-controlled tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
