			<description>Gamer Deck is a series of card decks that appeal to gamers and game designers. Each deck will be more like a card system than a standard deck of cards. A card system has multiple elements to be used to play and design many games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamer Deck 2 - Theme is like a standard deck of cards because it has 4 suits (A-K). The suits are cards, meeples, hexes and pawns. There is an RGB color scheme to the deck. There are dice images on each card. The cards are numbered 1-52. Each card has a letter and 3 game themes on each of the 3 colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
