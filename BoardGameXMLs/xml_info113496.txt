			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Monster is a battle game where the player makes use of cards to summon beasts. The player can create their own deck of cards, select three cards then place them on the battle field. They then select a monster to summon from one of these three cards. Each monster can be made to perform one of two attacks, or if you feel a slight imbalance against your opponent, can recall their creature and send out another in its place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
