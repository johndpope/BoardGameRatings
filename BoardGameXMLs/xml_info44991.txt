							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hounds Around</name>
									
			<description>A small children's race game. The players pick a colored dog from the four colors provided and the race begins. If more than 4 players are in the game, some of them share a dog and take turns spinning the spinner. (This is to teach cooperation and team work).&lt;br/&gt; The game spinner is divided into 6 equal areas, Four are the numbers 1-4, the other two spots are dogs falling. If the spinner lands there, your hound moves back 1 space. You spin the spinner and move the amount shown. Each number also has a color background, If an opponent spins the number with your hound's  color, you get to move forward one space on their turn, then they move the full amount of the number spun. This continues until one hound crosses the finish line. The first hound to win 4 races is the Top Dog!!!&lt;br/&gt; Inside the game is a letter from Prince Pooch, telling children how to behave, eat right, get plenty of sleep, avoid strangers, not to play with matches, always recycle etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
