			<description>Getting Back to Nature has Never Been So Deadly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Great Wide Open, players wake up in a frozen wilderness, alone. Making use of what they can, players will attempt to survive each day while searching to discover a way back to civilization. A single player may play as Nature, influencing the weather, wildlife, and special events that the other players must endure throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Wide Open is an Asymmetrical Competitive and Cooperative Survive and Escape board game. &lt;br/&gt;Each passing day is an opportunity for Nature to shift the environment that the Survivors attempt to progress in. Survivors will explore and discover resources, items, and special events allowing each game to form its own story. Triggered by in-game events, a Salvation Card will be drawn that describes how the Survivors can get back home. If the Survivors can fulfill the requirements of the card, the game is won. If they die in the progress, Nature prevails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
