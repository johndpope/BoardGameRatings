			<description>Hell: A Game of Trench Warfare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell Revised is published October 1st 2009. Thank you to the testers and the reviewers who gave very useful feedback on the original version. This new version is greatly expanded and reworked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell is a quick, fun to play card game set in the period of the Great War. Players compete to build the longest Trench Line before going Over-the-top, engage in air battles and struggle against the Spanish Influenza. Cards employed include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Machine-guns&lt;br/&gt;     Trenches&lt;br/&gt;     Fighter planes&lt;br/&gt;     Armor&lt;br/&gt;     Engineers&lt;br/&gt;     Entrenchment&lt;br/&gt;     the Battle Hymn&lt;br/&gt;     Rain cards&lt;br/&gt;     the Flu&lt;br/&gt;     and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game set comes with a British Army Deck, a German Army Deck, a Victory Track card and a Day/Night Time card. Two pawns are included for keeping score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell is illustrated with real front-line photos taken a century ago and is themed to illustrate this important time in history. Winning this game requires strategy, some bluffing, hand managment and general cunning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a stand alone product that comes with everything needed to play but will be expanded in the future for players who want to add more to their games of Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell book cover image by Nathan Trimmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go here to check out the added card designs, read the expanded rules and buy Hell:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/hell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/hell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
