							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flower Table</name>
									
			<description>Flower Table is a game in the Wooden Balance Game series by Daiso, the Japanese 100-yen shop chain. These games may be cheap but they do have nice production values and are made of wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a flower-like board that is balanced precariously on a stand in the shape of a truncated pyramid. The board is divided into petal-like segments, each with a blue, red or yellow spot. There are several little cubes and a die with a blue, red or yellow spot on its sides. Each player rolls the die and has to place a cube on a petal segment with the corresponding coloured spot. The player who causes the flower table to topple loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
