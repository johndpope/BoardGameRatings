			<description>Abstract game, a variation to Score Four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing area consists of 5 columns which can store up to 6 marbles. Under each column is space for 2 more marbles, the lowest one being accessible. These two rows, which cannot be part of a scoring row, are filled alternatively with the marbles of the players at the beginning. Then, players choose one column to fill it with one of their marbles or grab the undermost marble and fill it again into the same column. The winner is the player who first succeeds in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row of 5 marbles of his own within the scoring area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
