Part I: The Early War Years!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;55 cards of different military WW2 weapons from the first years of the conflict. Classics British legends like SMLE and Webley are mixed with treacherous Nazi silenced pistols and crappy Italian machineguns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect for anyone who enjoys role playing in the WW2 setting or just have a mild touch of gun fetishism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
