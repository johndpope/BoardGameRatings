							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grimtooth&#039;s Dice of Doom</name>
									
			<description>Inside the clear plastic tube are six of Grimtooth's favorite dice:  a &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; die shows six generic trap types, the Grimtooth devil die, a pumpkin die, a ghost die, and a glow-in-the-dark die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can use these dice to play all sorts of games!  Rules for two are included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halloween Candy:  Players put their sack of Halloween candy by going around the circle and rolling the dice.  Roll a skull and you have to put a piece of your candy into the pot.  Avoid the skulls wins you a chance to take it all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampire:  Dice are put into a bag and secretly drawn by the players.  The player with the glow-in-the-dark die becomes the vampire.  Players then search and debate about who the real vampire is, challenging each player until the real vampire is revealed!  (This is a variation of &amp;quot;Are you a Warewolf?&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Buffalo product #203.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
