			<description>You people! You people! Listen to me! I know all about this - I know what is going on here. You aren't healers - you're jailors! They're all terrified of us, so they let you treat us any way you like! But I know what goes on in here, what goes on behind those doors, when the secretaries and the orderlies go home! You think we're the monsters, because we don't think like you do? You haven't seen monsters, until you&amp;rsquo;ve been in HERE. WITH US!- Red Samuel, Bishopsgate inmate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A look at insanity and its use as a Storytelling tool for horror games - including comprehensive rules for gaining and curing derangements, as well as systems for the treatment of madness.&lt;br/&gt;A history of institutions and asylums, as well as useful advice for players and Storytellers in using these locations either as backgrounds or as the setting for an entire chronicle.&lt;br/&gt;Bishopsgate, a fully detailed insane asylum ready to be place anywhere in your World of Darkness chronicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
