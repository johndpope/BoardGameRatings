			<description>This expansion introduces the 'Collection' variant and includes 12 new cards and artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLECTION VARIANT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Collections set is in pairs.  At the beginning of a game, you shuffle the Collections deck and then deal out all of the cards evenly to each player.  You keep your collection secret from all other players.  At the end of a turn that you did NOT add cards to your Hoard you may 'Trade' with another player like so:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Choose one of your own collection cards and set it aside.&lt;br/&gt;- Choose a player and draw one of their collection cards at random, adding it to your collection.&lt;br/&gt;- Give that player the collection card you set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When The Crown is drawn to end the game everyone turns over all of their collection cards. For each pair that a player has they are awarded 3 additional points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
