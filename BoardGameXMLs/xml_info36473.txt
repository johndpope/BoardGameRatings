			<description>&amp;quot;Card Game for 2+ players. Star Trek theme.&amp;quot; The game is played with two custom card decks - the Crew Deck and the Dilemma Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crew Deck cards represent crew members, actions and equipment. They are used to solve Dilemmas. Cards have ratings for one or more of the following attributes: Tactics, Science and Negotiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dilemma Deck cards represent episodes from the first season of Star Trek. Each card lists what levels in the three attributes are needed to solve the Dilemma. Each card also has a Victory Point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Game Ending: The game ends when all Dilemmas have been solved. Victory: The player with the most Victory Points (from solved Dilemmas in his Captains Log) is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
