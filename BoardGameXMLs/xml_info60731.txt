							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NPCyclopedia: Psionics</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you have purchased the Psionics Handbooks, and one of your players has decided to use a psionic class. You want psionics to be part of your world. The problem is that you use a lot of pre-made modules, and those don&amp;rsquo;t include a lot of psionic characters. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve procrastinated finishing tonight&amp;rsquo;s adventure. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the caverns mapped out, and the traps set, you just don&amp;rsquo;t have the statistics of the main villain. Or maybe you are looking for a few new ideas to spark you imagination. You might want a reoccurring villain to challenge your characters over the course of the campaign, or you might just need a one short conflict for next week game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever your needs, if you use psionics and you use NPCs, this book is for you. NPCyclopedia: Psionics features eleven different psionic NPCs. Each contains a detailed background, adventure hooks, combat tactics, and statistics for every level from 1 to 20. A complex interconnected background between all characters allows you to use these as both one shot NPCs at any level of your choice instantly, or even as interconnected NPCs spanning a longer campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
