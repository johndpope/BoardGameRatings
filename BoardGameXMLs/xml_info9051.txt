			<description>This is a roll-and-move game, but more complex than most. The outer track includes spaces for State Primaries, Ballots, Strategy Cards and Progress Report cards, as well as the entrances to various key Caucus tracks and to the risky &amp;ldquo;Smoke-Filled Room&amp;rdquo; where the party bosses will either heap rewards or boot you from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary spaces are like Monopoly properties: the first to land claims them, and others then pay &amp;ldquo;rent&amp;rdquo; in  the form of Uncommitted Delegates. Landing on the entrance to a Caucus allows moving along its track and maybe winning its large bloc of votes (but a later player can win it back). Players may hold Demonstrations by making a declaration; if their next three moves avoid any squares with negative consequences, he gets 30 delegates from each player and can move to any square on the board. Failure means paying 20 delegates to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player lands on a Ballot square, hands are scored, and the leading player wins a Bandwagon effect (50 Delegates from each other player). A player that gets ahead therefore tries to trigger other ballots as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
