							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Patterns II</name>
									
			<description>This game of inductive logic is similar to Eleusis. One player is the &amp;quot;designer,&amp;quot; who creates a hidden pattern of symbols in a 6 by 6 grid which the other players try to discover. The other players can &amp;quot;peek&amp;quot; at any of the grid cells they wish, but the more they view, the lower their score when they finally guess the pattern. The designer's score is based on the difference between the best and worst other scores, so it's in his interest to make the pattern somewhat, but not too, challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patterns II was published in Sackson's book _A Gamut of Games_.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
