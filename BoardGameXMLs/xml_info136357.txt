							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin Pit Fight</name>
									
			<description>Goblin Pit Fight is a card game in which players choose one of four tribes of Goblins. This fast paced game generally takes 30-60 minutes to play. The object is to create the best hand; outscoring other players and possibly defeating the pit for extra points. It has an easy to learn, multi-level scoring system that allows players to be creative when building a hand. Each player keeps a camp, where they can secure cards for future hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 7 cards from which they have to make a four card hand.  Players put one card into the center as their Pit card.  They then have two cards left over for their Camp which rolls from turn to turn allowing players to always have two cards in reserve for future hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is based on card icons such as tribe, class, bone value, and Pit strength.  All of these icons allow for different ways to score points each hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
