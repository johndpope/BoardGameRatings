							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tube Slider</name>
									
			<description>Tube Slider is a futuristic racing game released exclusively in North America by NEC and developed by Nd Cube for the Nintendo GameCube on April 17, 2003. A Japanese release of this game was planned but was canceled for unknown reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective is to pilot a hovercraft through a track and compete against other racers (human or AI controlled). Tube Slider is unique in the fact, like its name, the vehicles race through transparent tubes that are often suspended off the ground. The modes available are a generic single-player mode, a time trial mode, and a multiplayer function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tube Slider&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
