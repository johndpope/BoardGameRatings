			<description>The First Edition Collection - being a compilation of all First Edition Fred's World materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter at your own risk...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was introduced to Fred Funk and his campaign when I was about fifteen years old. Our regular gaming group met in South Minneapolis most Friday nights at Viking Computers on 24th and Nicollet, and often got back on our bikes to ride home early Sunday morning. One such Friday we were introduced to Fred, who would be running his campaign that evening, and I did not know what kind of ride I was in for. It was the first of many delightful moments in Fred&amp;rsquo;s World that spanned more than a decade of gaming a two plus decades of friendship. While the players changed on occasion, the events in Ethelbertville took us ever deeper into his particular rabbit hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1989 a concerted effort to document Fred&amp;rsquo;s particular world was undertaken at the behest of Fred, with the largest share of the effort performed by Andrew Sabo. Additional contributions were made by Craig Martin, Keith Westrum and myself. Artwork by Lou Frank in 1987 was added to the campaign and the most formalized set of documents to date were created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This memorial edition of his campaign is a collection of his First Edition documents from 1989 in a single volume. As I have received comments on the pre-release version I wish to address a few things before the ride begins. These documents were written in 1989 and reflect both the campaign at that time as well as the recollections of its author Fred Funk. As has been noted by reviewers there are date inconsistencies, incorrect publishing references and claims anachronistically out of place. I attribute these errors to the faulty nature of memories and not of any intent to assign accomplishments to incorrect parties. The exact years and certain details as remembered by Fred are not considered to be completely accurate by game historians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fred worked hard on his campaign, and it is a pleasure to compile his efforts for others to enjoy. In this electronic age, it is my intention to see his campaign spread as far and wide as I can so that the memory of his world, and of the man, can last as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
