							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piratenkreisel</name>
									
			<description>The pirates have found out that huge golden orbs can be found on the large Caribbean island, and of course they are trying to get them. Each player has a pirate ship and tries to bring a golden orb to his/her home harbour. On their way, the pirates have to avoid other pirates because they will naturally try to steal their golden orb. But even the best pirate has to strike the sails when the weather is bad. A magnetic spinner in the center of the board rotates the golden orbs around and also causes the dreaded storms. This causes surprising twists of fate in the race for the golden orbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
