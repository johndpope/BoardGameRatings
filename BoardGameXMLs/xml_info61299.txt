			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asterix, Obelix and Dogmatix set out on another dangerous mission!  The mistletoe crop  has failed in Gaul, and supplies are urgently needed to make the magic potion which gives the Gauls their superhuman strength.  They need YOUR help!  YOU are needed to make the vital decisions and deal with the various problems they will meet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to supervise the mission is contained in this special plastic wallet.  This is the travel-book, and with it are the character cards, the special decision dice, a map, a translator, a password scroll and a coinbag.  There are also some precious magic potion cards to enable Asterix to build up his strength to fight the Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exciting and challenging game can be played over and over again.  There are many different routes to be followed to the British mistletoe, and each route involves different hazards and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is your chance to help Asterix reach the vital ingredient for the magic potion - before his own supplies run out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
