			<description>Text from cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pedro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There'll be no siesta for Pedro, he's the busiest gardenener South of the Border. After many years of hard work and loving care Pedro now has the most beautiful flower garden in Old Mexico. The trouble is all the animals for miles around have acquired a taste for Pedro's succulent blooms and are always looking for ways to break into his garden to eat them. From dawn till dusk as Pedro slaves away, the animals never give him a moments peace. He tries everything to stop them getting to his prize blooms, from blocking the garden paths with compost and bricks, to chasing them away and even jumping on them; but even so, some still manage to get through. Everytime an animal gets into the garden and eats his flowers Pedro has to plant more seeds, it's problem after problem, and if things aren't bad enough the village tramp keeps sneaking in to try and steal Pedro's seeds, so he has to be chased off as well. What with marauding animals and thieving tramps it doesn't look as if you're going to get much of a siesta either. So look lively, you can't put things off till manana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIM OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To stop the animals from eating his plants Pedro must collect bricks or compost from the bottom corners of the screen and block the maze exits. He may not carry or place more than one object at a time. Any animals getting into the garden will make for the plants and start eating them. You must decide on whether to block up the maze or stamp out the animals, then you must re-seed the gaps in the garden, at every possible opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
