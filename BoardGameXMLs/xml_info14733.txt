			<description>Be the first to fill your chosen figure with a combination of geometric shapes and win! GeoShapes combines the art of skillful play with pure chance to create an unforgettable board game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is assigned a quadrant on the game board that contains geometric drawings. During play, colorful plastic shapes are acquired which are then used to fill up the drawings on the game board. The first player to complete the assignment is the winner. Sound easy? Well, there are obstacles in your way. You may not draw the piece you need or one of the other players may be holding that piece to block your play. You might need to barter one of your prized shapes or pick up a discard pile in order to obtain the critical piece. So plan your strategy, calculate the risks and see if you can out-maneuver your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOR PARENTS AND EDUCATORS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GeoShapes introduces a child to the shapes and names of geometric figures. It also encourages the use of simple mathematics, helps develop a child's awareness of spatial reality and utilizes the concept of probability during play. All measurements are in both inches and centimeters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
