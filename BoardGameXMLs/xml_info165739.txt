			<description>This small expansion contains 12 red dice (with 2 traps, 2 Fleas and 2 Zoo Keepers on each die), which are mixed in with the base game dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleas can be played alone or together with other animals. When played alone, Fleas are smaller than Earthworms in size; when played together with other animals, Fleas are counted as the animals they are played with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there are already Fleas in play, a player who then puts out other animals with a larger body size on the playing surface will get all of those Fleas in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, each Flea side that faces up counts as 8 deduction points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Administrators cannot be put out to play.&lt;br/&gt;Immediately after throwing your own red dice, for each Administrator side that faces up, you get to choose one target white die (which can either be from your own collection or from any other player&amp;rsquo;s collection) and turn it to any side you desire to have face up. At the end of the game, each Administrator side that faces up counts as 9 deduction points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
