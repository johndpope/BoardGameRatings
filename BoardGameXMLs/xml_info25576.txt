							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Bold Move: Battle for Tay Ninh, 1968</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the military failure of the North Vietnamese Tet offensive in January, the NVA conducted their first divisional attack in the Tay Ninh environs during a hot, monsoonal August. It was the last attempt to &amp;quot;spill American blood&amp;quot; in large quantities. Politically, the January attack was a success as the American media heavily reported it. Militarily, it had totally failed in the assigned objectives. For the August offensive, the NVA concentrated two divisions, the 5th and 9th. The 5th had grown to 15,000 men and elements of the plan called for the capture of American M113 APCs from the 10l ARVN squadron to infiltrate into the US headquarters for it's destruction. The plan also called for the divisions to be used piecemeal with the objective of killing Americans and occupying Tay Ninh City. Such an event would reap a political bonanza equal to the Tet Offensive. It was thought this would decimate US morale because War Zone C was well occupied by American troops. More important to the NVA plan was the hope that the awesome American airpower would be neutralized by the August monsoons. For the next 11 days, a hectic, fierce battle strung out the Americans and their M-48 tanks. When the NVA occupied over five city blocks of Tay Ninh, it was the worst nightmare for the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contains:&lt;br/&gt;2 11x17 inch maps (which combines together)&lt;br/&gt;280 counters&lt;br/&gt;Player aids, charts and tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: company and platoon level, each hex 1/2 mile, each turn one day for a total of 11 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
