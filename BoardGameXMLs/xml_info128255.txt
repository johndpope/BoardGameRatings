			<description>Mr. Buckethead gets to choose between visiting the candy store or the toy store; somehow, this eventually leads him to prehistoric jungles and the dangerous surface of the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interactive gamebook where the player constantly chooses options in an evolving comic-book-like story, collecting money, items, friends and Action Points (used to activate special powers). The book includes a scoresheet and many puzzles and mini-games throughout, as the player works to gain the challenging Victory Point (by defeating the Moon Monster). Like other books in the series, there is also a 2-player monster fight mini-game included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE SERIES:&lt;br/&gt;Based on the live action television and film character, this new series of interactive gamebooks is adventure-packed! 64 pages of intense gameplay action with an innovative story structure that allows continuous play across multiple issues. Each issue in this series contains a solo adventure plus a bonus multi-player monster fighting game! The appeal of an evolving RPG with the look and feel of a comic book, the Mr. Buckethead Adventure Game Series is challenging and entertaining fun for all ages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
