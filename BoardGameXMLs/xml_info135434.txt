			<description>Roll and Move game on a snake formed line of 95 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 4 pawns. If you land on a space with your own color, you move again the same amount indicated by the die. If you are captured, you can avoid starting at the beginning by paying 1 coin to the other player. If you land on a grey space, you are entitled to change your pawn to an express pawn (by paying 1coin) which is allowed to advance the double amount. By landing on the last space, you receive 1 coin. By landing with the 4th pawn on the last space, you receive all coins of the stock and the game ends.  Player with the most coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
