			<description>Captain Tsubasa is a 1994 video game released by Tecmo for the Sega Mega-CD and based on the popular Captain Tsubasa manga/anime series. It was published only in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a further extension of Tecmo's &amp;quot;Cinematic Soccer&amp;quot; genre of games that appeared previously in other platforms, with the player watching from a cinematic angle and having to choose his actions from a timed list, with the results of these actions being animated on screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also notable for being the first CD-ROM based Captain Tsubasa video game, featuring improved spoken cutscenes with the purpose of retelling the original Captain Tsubasa story more closely to watching the anime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Captain Tsubasa (Mega-CD)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
