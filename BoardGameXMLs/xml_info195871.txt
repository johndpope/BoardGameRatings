			<description>Each player has 16 playing pieces: 7 hunters, 4 catchers, 2 scouts, 2 squires and 1 bux-master. The goal of the game is to capture the opponent bux-master. The hunters move up to 2 spaces, the catchers up to 3 spaces, the scout up to 4 spaces, the bux-master and his squires 1 space (no jumping over other pieces allowed). If pieces of both payers are on three connected spaces in a straight line, the minority piece is eliminated from play unless it is able to escape in the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for 2 variants included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buxelkuh: One cow has to break through a line of 9 peasants and 1 mayor. The latter try to trap the cow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buxtehu: The players try to get all 16 playing pieces to the opposite end of the game board. Each time a player gets one of his pieces to a space at the other end of the board, he may take one or more enemy pieces off the board. The game ends if all 11 spaces at one end of the board are occupied or if there ar no more pieces on the board. The player with the most captured pieces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
