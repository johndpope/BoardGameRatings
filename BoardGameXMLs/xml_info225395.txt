							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Defining a Nation India on the Eve of Independence, 1945: Instructor&#039;s Manual</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game raises questions that echo contemporary debates throughout the world: How can democratic governments be installed among peoples who have for generations lived under non-democratic governments? How can different religious and social groups cohere as a single nation? How can the rights of vulnerable minorities be protected from the potential tyranny of a democratically-elected majority? This game provides perhaps the finest evocation of such issues in the modern world, in large part because the leaders of India in 1945 were themselves outstanding: Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Bhim Rao Ambedkar, and others at the time wrote voluminously and well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The excellence of the leaders, however, makes the dismal outcome all the more perplexing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
