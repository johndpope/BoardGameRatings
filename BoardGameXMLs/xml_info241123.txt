			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once an ennead, the Earthspur Mines are home to a competition between many dwarves.  Each clan sends its best and brightest crafter to compete in a test of endurance and skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While a time of celebrating and companionship between clans, it is also a time of treachery and deceit, as each tries to sabotage the others.  Unfortunately for Riswynn Rumnaheim, her clan has nearly died out, and is unable to watch her back, nor can she trust her closest friends at this fraught time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So she has placed a call for adventurers, and you have answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A four hour adventure for 1st - 4th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
