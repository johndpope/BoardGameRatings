							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Umbrage Saga: The Wicked Cauldron</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a thousand years the horned god ruled from his throne in the great towers of Aufstrag. Shaped in mockery of the Great Tree, Aufstrag lorded over the kingdoms of man, elf and dwarf and its master, Unklar, ruled with his iron mace. But time swept him away and into the Void, and upon the ruins of his dark memory new kingdoms have risen, a new world born. An age of heroes is begun, where adventuring crusaders ride forth into the wilderness to reclaim it through the iron in their veins, and the magic they too control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But memories run deep and the stain of Unklar&amp;rsquo;s reign is not so easily rooted out. His minions haunt the dark places of the world. They occupy forgotten temples, ruined dungeons, castles on the borderlands; from these bastions they plot the return of their horned master, or at the very least, the terror of men. Here evil resides, and thrives; treasures abound, hidden magic lies unused and forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is perhaps no greater bastion for the refugees of Aufstrag than the lands south of that fated tower. The Blacktooth Ridge dominates the country, jutting out from the southern foothills like a finger pointing to Aufstrag. Beneath it flows the slow moving, dark Hruesan River and beyond those banks are the Lands of the Barren Wood and west of it all the Blighted Screed. These lands rest upon the Northern Marches of the Kingdom of New Aenochia, and the few towns that are here, Botkinburg and Ludensheim, lie on the very edge of civilization. These lands are a Wicked Cauldron of desperate evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here adventure abounds, for the Empress has called a Crusade to root out all the evil that hounds her northern domains. Wealth and bounty are promised, and land and title for those so interested. In these twisted woods and in the Shadow of the Great Tree begins the Umbrage Saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure to the Wicked Cauldron, begin play at 1st level and run the gauntlet of adventures from the following adventures: A0 Rising Knight, A1 Assault on Blacktooth Ridge, A2 Slag Heap, A3 Wicked Cauldron, A4 Usurpers of the Fell Axe and the A5 The Shattered Horn - Perfect Bound in one Book&amp;quot; - This box set also includes an adventure previously published only in PDF, some new encounters and a more concise history of the great horn and the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to start a wild adventure of C&amp;amp;C fun lies in the adventures contained here, in the Umbrage Saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
