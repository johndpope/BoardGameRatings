			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not unusual (even if deeply regretted) that some of the residents of Shadowdale occasionally go missing. Bears, mountain lions and even wyverns are known to occupy the woods around the dale. In recent months however the rate of disappearances has risen. It began with the occasional mysterious loss of caravans on both the Northride and the Tethymar Trail. These losses were clearly not the work of bandits as no bodies were recovered. Then people from the outlying crofts of Shadowdale began to vanish. Travellers brought reports of similar events around Daggerdale. Finally, last tenday, three residents of the village of Shadowdale itself disappeared: Britaria Bestil, Brennan Elventree and Pelda Hillstar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no clues as to where they have gone. Rumours in the Old Skull Inn are rife. Kidnapped by a Red Wizard of Thay say some, slain by agents of Zhentil Keep say others. Whatever the reason it is up to you to find out what the cause of these disappearances may be, and if possible destroy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 2nd level characters.  Distributed as a ZIP archive with the DOC adventure and two GIF images (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
