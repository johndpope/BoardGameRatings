							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beetle Knight</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beetle knight was once a great and renowned dwarven knight with a suite of unique and magical armor. His legend revered and tomb visited by dwarven pilgrims wishing to follow in his famous footsteps. . . . BUUUUUUUTTTTTTT . . . . not everyone holds the tomb of the Beetle Knight in quite that sacred of a regard . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this spotlight is three iterations of the Beetle Knight for your heroes to fight. I know he used to be a good guy, but y&amp;rsquo;know . . . stuff happens. The three different versions of the Beetle Knight vastly range in power and tactics to ensure a vast variety of encounters. Also, all three versions of the Beetle Knight can be tied into a single story arch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would the Beetle Knight be without the Beetle Knight armor? Not the Beetle Knight! So also included in this evildoer Spotlight are the stats for the magical Beetle Knight armor. The armor is unique and how its awarded is up to you the GM, so have fun with how you introduce it into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beetle Knight&amp;rsquo;s are intended to be used against heroes whose levels range between 6-12 and depending on how the final version of the Beetle Knight is used &amp;amp; the types of creatures paired with him, this could pose a threat to up to 15th level heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
