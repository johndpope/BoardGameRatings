			<description>Alphabet game with two levels of play, featuring Marie to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mini game board is assembled and all the letter tokens are sorted into 4 matching coloured piles. Each player is dealt an even number of books. Players take it in turns to roll the die and move Marie around the track. Pick a coloured tile matching the space and call it out. In the first level the players can use the pictures and letters to recognise the letters. In the second level, only the letters can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has completed all their books they win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
