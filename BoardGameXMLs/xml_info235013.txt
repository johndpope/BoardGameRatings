							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales from the Bloody Bucket</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome adventurers!  Pull up a chair, and stay a while. I&amp;rsquo;m Chris Hinson, the creator of RPG Crate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, allow me to say thank you for joining in the adventure.  By obtaining and using this Adventure Setting, you are participating in what I hope is the first of many fantastic game sessions.  This publication represents an introduction to a new fantasy roleplay world, created for and exclusively distributed by RPG Crate and can be adapted for use with most any fantasy roleplay game system.  The setting was first created as a free downloadable PDF and distributed to all of the RPG Crate newsletter subscribers.  Print copies will be made available for puchase at a later date. Just as the adventurer begins his journey one step at a time, one challenge at a time, and one tavern at a time, this setting will be revealed to the subscribers of RPG Crate one exciting tale at a time, as told from the most infamous brawling tavern of the area - The Bloody Bucket.  The &amp;ldquo;Bucket,&amp;quot; as some have come to refer to it as, is a rough and tumble place - stout ale and strong cheese is served just as often as fine wine and fresh fruit.  The patrons are equally as diverse, bringing to The Bucket a seemingly unending source of adventures. Each month, a new set of tales will be revealed and added to RPG Crate.  Subscribe to our monthly crate, and you won&amp;rsquo;t miss a single tale - adventures for months to come - and easily adaptable to most any fantasty roleplay game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
