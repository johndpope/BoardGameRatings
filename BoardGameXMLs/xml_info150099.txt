			<description>Doraemon is a robotic cat featured in a Japanese comic/animation series of the same title. The game comes with 5 Doraemon figures and 6 sets of 5 cards of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play, you take Doraemon figures, one less then there are players, and put them in the middle where everybody can reach them. You take as many sets of colored cards as there are players. You shuffle all these cards and give each player 5. Then everybody passes one of his cards at the same moment to his right hand neighbor. When a player has a set of 5 cards of the same color, he grabs a Doraemon figure and calls out 'Doraemon'. Then the remaining player have to grab one of the remaining Doraemon figures as fast as possible. The player who wasn't able to grab one, gets 1 minus point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as 1 player has 3 minus points, he loses, while all the other players win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
