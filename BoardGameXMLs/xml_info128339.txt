							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mandate Archive: Bruxelles-class Battlecruiser</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Iron Ghost from a Dead Age...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bruxelles-class battlecruiser was one of the mainstays of the ancient Terran Mandate, a regular sentinel along the ragged borders of the core and the deep colonial wilderness of the frontier. Its fearsome guns brought peace to squabbling worlds and rebuked raiders and alien interlopers with radioactive fire. When the Scream washed over the human empire, countless Bruxelles-class ships were left lost and isolated on the fringes of human space. Many died in vain attempts to get back to Old Terra, but a few such corpses still linger in the dark between worlds, waiting for some reckless soul to drag them back to a bright and terrible life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free Mandate Archive gives you the details on the Bruxelles class of battlecruiser - its history, function, standard crew complements, and statistics for the free Stars Without Number role-playing game. A half-dozen plot seeds are also provided, each one revolving around this ancient engine of war. Finally, several examples of pretech ship weaponry are given with which to terrify the feeble heirs of the Mandate's lost glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
