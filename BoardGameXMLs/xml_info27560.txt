			<description>Quick-playing but detailed simulations of college baseball. Instant download, print and play game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features Easy to set up &amp;amp; play: Just shuffle the action cards and play. (If you want to keep score, enter the player and team names onto the provided score sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All play derived from 100 &amp;quot;action cards&amp;quot;: Each card is 2-sided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistically accurate: Every college team from the 2005-2006 season, along with the players, are rated in every major statistical category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All division I college teams represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team and player rated in several categories: Every statistic you would expect to be covered is here. Batting average, singles, doubles, triples, home runs, stolen base attempts, stolen base success percentage, opponent's batting average, strikeout &amp;amp; walk frequency and team error ratings are all here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep score as you play and compile stats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players listed by position, with usage chart included. This enable you to replay games where the players appear in realistic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional injury system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; ratings: One problem I've found with other baseball sims is the lack of realistic batter/pitcher interaction. With the control system, you will see the great hitter outperform the mediocre pitcher (and vice-versa) in a more consistent manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game engine drives the action. Players will even attempt to steal bases without your input. Of course, you can always call the shots if you prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents&lt;br/&gt;complete rule book, including a detailed description of a partial sample game, useful as a tutorial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set of action cards, ready for printing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out chart &amp;amp; extras chart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team cards, divided by division/conference. Each conference is printed on one separate .pdf file, all organized within division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAQ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do the team cards look like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the roster size, anywhere from about half a page (8-1/2X11&amp;quot;) to almost a full page. The tops of the cards are in the team's school colors. All data is organized into color-coded colums for easy reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can I edit the team/player data?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, if you wish to do so. I may release a semi-automated editor for excel if there is any interest in such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can I set lineups, call plays, make substitutions, etc?&lt;br/&gt;      You set your lineups and make substitutions. There are a few provisions for calling special plays, such as bunting, hit-and-run, and playing the infield &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;. The game being a self-contained simulation, it needs little user input. Having played other basetball games which feature individual player cards, setting of lineups, keeping track of stamina, etc., I wanted something that would yield even more realistic results with less work on the user's part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
