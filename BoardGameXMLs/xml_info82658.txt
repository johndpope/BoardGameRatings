			<description>Featuring over 50 levels of pure retro-action, this remake of the classic pocket ball game will keep you hooked for hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;54 original 3D levels that range from the mind-numbingly easy to the &amp;quot;rip your eyes out of your head, toss your iPhone across the room&amp;quot; insanely hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike labyrinth games, you must get the balls into the holes, not around them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sink them fast, sink them with style! Sink them faster than your friends. We've brought the classic, &amp;quot;back seat of your parents car during the crazy long roadtrips&amp;quot; handheld device of old back! Get ready to experience the fun anew on your iPod and iPhone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a trip down memory lane with an original retro soundtrack and artwork, as you gently shift the playing surface to ease the balls into place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose from 3 levels of difficulty - go ahead and drop it down to Easy if you just can't handle it - or notch it up to Hard to get that unbeatable high score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Share your scores with your friends and family using Facebook Connect - dare them to beat your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How fast can you sink them all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
