							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faded Glamour: Maxed Out Edition</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once Upon A Time...&lt;br/&gt;when your heart was full of joy and the path before you was paved with gold, you knew no fear and no sadness. You were a citizen of the Shining Realm, that perfect land that mortals can only dream about, where the rain is like a lover&amp;rsquo;s kiss and the sunshine a mother&amp;rsquo;s hug. Magic was yours to wield, ensuring you a long and happy life filled with wonder and romance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put all that behind you and try to forget the privilege that was yours: the memories will only torment you and drive you deeper into your sickness. This is the life you chose, forsaking your glamour in order to live as a human being in this squalid city of empty promises and unfulfilled desires. Like the other exiles here, you can try to bring a little of the Shining Realm to the tawdry streets of Los Angeles, and maybe it will even stave off the cancer in your soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it worth giving up immortality to bring a little happiness into these tiny lives? Probably not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have a choice? No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faded Glamour is a game set in the underbelly of the Hollywood Dream, in the shadow of its golden age. The year is 1935 and the main characters are some of the lesser movers and shakers trying to get by: talent agents, screen-writers, club owners, musical directors and studio muscle. Never anyone who appears on the silver screen though, as that would attract too much attention, because really the characters are exiles from a land of enchanted beings. Call them elves, fairies, spirits or whatever you like, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter anymore, because they gave up that heritage. In a world of childlike simplicity, they allowed dark &amp;amp; complex emotions to enter their hearts; when faced with the prospect of being purged of this state and returned to innocence, they just couldn&amp;rsquo;t let go of what they&amp;rsquo;d become, despite the great pain it caused them. The only other choice open to them was to forswear their true nature and leave the Shining Realm forever, to live out the remainder of their existence as a mortal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Los Angeles is a city of secret exiles, a home to the few dozen who have known a better world where everything that was dreamed became possible. These outcasts are addicts, enslaved by their own need to feel something terrible and painful; even the remorse that wracks them over leaving their home feeds their need for suffering. It&amp;rsquo;s a vicious circle they can never break out of, except... there is a pale imitation of glamour in this city, like the echo of a song heard through a separating wall. It can never be what they had in the Shining Realm, but maybe one day, if it is nurtured carefully, it can lead them home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the same game as the Game Chef Edition, but with over double the word count, it has more room for examples of what to do and how to play. Much thanks to Neil Smith (I) for reading through the basic game document and asking a set of incisive questions that pushed me to take it that little bit further!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
