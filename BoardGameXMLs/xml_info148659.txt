Can you find all four cures in time? The fate of humanity is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandemic: The Board Game is a family-friendly cooperative game. Pandemic: The Board Game puts you in an apocalyptic situation where you must work as a team to save the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pandemic: The Board Game each player has a unique role with different abilities.

They can remove disease cubes from the board; fly to a city in need; trade cards with fellow players; and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of every player&amp;rsquo;s turn, new cities are infected with disease cubes and Epidemics may arise.
