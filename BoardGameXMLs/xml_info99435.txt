							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lunar Chapters: INVINCIBLE</name>
									
			<description>INVINCIBLE is a game of battle between endurance and courage. It takes you into an arena, where champions from faraway lands come to compete and remain the last man standing. By mastering the balance between courage and endurance, you may reap the glory of the INVINCIBLE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players chose their champion from among 3 different tribes, each fielding a variety of 6 *(7) different classes. 18 *(21) unique characters with 2 special abilities each, 3 playing modes for 2-6 *(7) players promises great replay-ability. When designing the rules, our goal was to make them as easy to pick up as checkers, and as tactically deep as chess. From our experience, it is best learned &amp;quot;on the go&amp;quot;, and even first-timers DO win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have 3 types of card at their disposal. &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; card with reddish background, &amp;quot;Equipment&amp;quot; cards with yellow background, and &amp;quot;Special&amp;quot; cards with green background. The action cards work on a bit more complex &amp;quot;rock-paper-scissors&amp;quot; mechanics, and players need to decide which attacks to commence, in order to get their opponent in the spot they want them. Players pick 3 cards from the deck every time it's their turn in the round, or when they are challenged to a duel. At the end of their turn in the round, they may chose to discard one card for their convenience, yet this could also work against them, since the less cards you have on your hand, the more mouth-watering victim you make yourself. Duel is a battle mechanism, where two players engage into an exchange of action cards, where both of them are allowed to use two action cards for an attack, single special card of every kind, use as many equipment cards as they posses, and utilize their special abilities based on the amount of courage they gained in the season. (One whole game of INVINCIBLE represents a season in the arena). Each player's champion has different starting endurance, courage and  card stock based on their tribe of origin. Endurance and courage are two main resources used in the game. Endurance determines how much damage can the player take, and if it drops to zero, the player is eliminated from the competition. However, they are not eliminated from the game. Players who's endurance drops to zero, come back to game in the next turn as &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot; players. Losing all their equipment and courage, starting with a single point of endurance. Players who are still competing for the title of INVINCIBLE, can no longer duel the ghost players, but this does not work the other way around, and so they may take revenge on their executioners or simply have fun playing with other player's chances in the game. Courage is gained with every successful hit. This means every time you play an attack card, and you duelist does not play a valid defense card against it, that player loses a point of endurance, and you gain a point of courage. Each character has two special abilities, which spent the courage when used. First ability costs 4 courage points, and the other spends 6 points being twice as powerful. Players need to chose whether they spend their courage early, or save up for more powerful abilities and risk that they get eliminated in the process, or somebody uses a card or ability that would steal their courage. The closer to the epic final duel the game gets, the more courage players gain, as every time you eliminate a player, you gain 6 points of courage, and also, there are more equipment cards available for less competing players. Equipment cards improve endurance and courage capacities, and special cads have many uses to disabling your opponents and &amp;quot;resource redistribution&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    (x) marked values refer to Collector's and Signature editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
