			<description>When gold is discovered in the Northern California wilderness, speculators flock west in hopes of striking it rich. Along the way the kind-hearted, but financially struggling Baron family (a farmer named Jake, his wife Emily, and their son Redd) welcomes three weary travelers into their home and offers them a place to rest. Grateful for their hospitality, the pioneers make a promise to repay the family for their kindness and generosity when they are settled. Unfortunately, a greedy land speculator named Silas McAllister plots to gain control of valuable land and eventually, governorship of California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Westward (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
