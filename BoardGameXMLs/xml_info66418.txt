			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of pre-generated lizardfolk ready for use in your game.&lt;br/&gt;Class levels, templates, variant builds.&lt;br/&gt;No rolling required&lt;br/&gt;The Lazy GM: We Work, You Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creatures presented here have been selectively pre-generated with class levels and templates. For reasons of space, and the sanity of the author, we have not attempted to provide every possible combination of class, level and template. What is given here are a wide range of basic creature and a few &amp;lsquo;character&amp;rsquo; style opponents. The levels chosen for the standard types of opponents are derived from the range of levels listed in the SRD entry for that particular creature. Some class combinations are chosen according to the &amp;lsquo;implied culture&amp;rsquo; of the MM listings of the creatures. Favoured class and the creature&amp;rsquo;s typical role in adventures have been borne in mind during creation, but some unexpected combinations have been included for variety.&lt;br/&gt;The concept is that you should be able to copy and paste appropriate opponents into your own adventures, or print out sheets as needed rather than print out the entire book in one block, although there&lt;br/&gt;is no reason not to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
