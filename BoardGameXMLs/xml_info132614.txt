							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunt the Hunny</name>
									
			<description>An action version of games like Snap. There are 36 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out all the cards which players stack in a pile in front of them (without looking at them). Starting with the player left of the dealer, a player turns over the top card in his pile and puts it the centre of the table. Thus, the game progresses. Shouls one of the four Hunny cards be revealed, all the players must race to be the first to touch the card. The fastest player gets all the cards in the centre of the table which go face-down on the bottom of his stack. It is suggested that if at all possible, a referee should be on hand to settle disputes over who was the quickest. If you run out of cards you may still join in the race for the next Hunny card but should you be not the quickest, you are out of the game. In effect, you get a second chance to stay in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who collects all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
