							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperial Janissary</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, when a rebellion or an enemy incursion or a supernatural threat menaces the security of a province, the Imperial Alliance sends a division of soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, it sends a single Imperial Janissary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Imperial Janissary is a member of the Imperial Alliance's most elite martial brotherhood a psionic warrior and investigator without peer. Many problems resolve themselves as soon as he announces his presence; the Imperial Janissary has arrived and the game is up. He is well equipped to deal with the few recalcitrant villains who attempt to hide or fight him, however. Malcontents fear the Imperial Janissary's power more than any other foe's, for few indeed can hide their thoughts from him and fewer still can stand against him once he roots out their offenses. The Imperial Janissary's reputation among the citizenry is somewhat more mixed. While his efforts to keep the peace are greatly admired, his psionic abilities unnerve those he is tasked with protecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play a Imperial Janissary prestige class in your NeoExodus or other home setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus Imperial Janissary counters for miniature games.&lt;br/&gt;     Finally NeoExodus: A House Divided Initiative Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
