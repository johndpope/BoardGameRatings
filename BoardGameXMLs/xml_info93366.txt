							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bully Free card game</name>
									
			<description>Based on The Bully Free Classroom by Allan L. Beane, Ph.D., this card game plays like Crazy Eights (players must match an element of the top card of the discard pile to play), so most kids will have some familiarity with the process. The cards are divided into four categories: What Would You Do If...,Self-Esteem Boosters, Ways to Stay Bully Free and Why Should You Do This? &lt;br/&gt;Kids get rid of cards (and move closer to being out, or bully free) by offering reasonable suggestions and responses to questions. Meant to be played with adult supervision (a teacher, counselor, or youth worker familiar with anti-bullying themes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
