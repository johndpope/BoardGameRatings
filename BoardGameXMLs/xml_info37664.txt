			<description>Die Kleinen Leckerm&amp;auml;ulchen (the small, sweeth-toothed critters) uses a three-dimensional board that shows a flowery garden. The board can be constructed for each game and collapsed easily for storage. The standing part of the board has 18 holes, and at the beginning of the game eight different wooden fruits, each on a string, are each placed into one of the holes. The strings lay on the flat part of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a set of animal tiles, and each animal has a favorite food. On a turn, players pick a card and then must pull up the fruit that the animal likes to eat. Of course, all they can see are the strings that all look the same, or remember where they last saw the fruit. If they pull up the right fruit, they keep the tile. Otherwise, they must return the tile. The player who collects the most tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
