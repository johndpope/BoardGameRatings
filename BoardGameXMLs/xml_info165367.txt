							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Way Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unnamed is at the Way Station. Commonwealth soldiers bivouacked there are disgusted. The Unnamed stinks. It stinks of fish and barnacles and human waste. They hold their noses, oblivious that the Unnamed is what they are actually there for. Best they don&amp;rsquo;t know. Best, even for you not to look closely &amp;ndash; not to see the empty eye sockets lost in the hood, swirling a tapestry of cosmic stars. Be warned. Even the voice of the Unnamed can damage paltry human stuff. Yet, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a job here. You must help it. No Joke. Use your puny power to aid the Unnamed. It may be the avatar of the Dead God, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to become what you guide it to become. Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s only on the edge of real. Your job? Influence the Unnamed and usher in a golden era for the mortals of the Third Age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
