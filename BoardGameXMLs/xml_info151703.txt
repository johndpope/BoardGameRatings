			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Introductory Adventure of Steam, Intrigue, and Walking Corpses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in the alley, he&amp;rsquo;d seen the marks he needed to tag.  Now, he just needed to wait for the right time &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And right on cue, the lot of &amp;rsquo;em marched out of the alley like they were on some idealistic crusade.  They certainly looked like nice enough people, but he knew that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything.  Even the nice ones could have some kind of terrible secret hidden up their sleeve along with their money.  Secrets, like the one in his coat pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tick. Tock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, the West End of New Arcadia has been plagued by  a series of mysterious disappearances.  The corpses of the missing reappear, days later, unnaturally modified (some say mutilated) with mechanical contraptions.  The city leadership is growing worried.  Wanting to keep everything quiet, and out of the press, the New Arcadia Constabulary has hired you to investigate what is going on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the street, groups like yours are known as muckers; those who climb about trying to clean up the filth while making a healthy profit.  Your about to find out why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
