							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TNN Bass Tournament of Champions</name>
									
			<description>TNN Bass Tournament of Champions is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Mega Drive/Genesis fishing game, based on the Nashville Network cable TV channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to catch as much large bass as possible so that the player can advance through the tournaments and eventually win the championship. The player has from sunrise to sunset to fish, thus giving him the necessary time to develop strategies related to participating in a virtual fishing derby. Other fish (besides bass) can be accidentally caught as well, but they will not count towards the final score. Only bass will count towards the player's progression throughout the game.  Changes in the season and the weather will try to impede the player's progress as he attempts to win the championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TNN Bass Tournament of Champions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
