			<description>A Fun and Educational Game for 2 Players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game: Find the secret word from the other player before he finds yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;Put the playingboard between the 2 players. Each player receives 16 chips of the same color. Choose a playingcard together to play with. There are 2 copies of each card, one for each player. Place the chosen card under the holes in your playfield. You can see all the words from the playingcard in the holes now.&lt;br/&gt;If you choose a blue playingcard for example, you both choose a blue wordcard. You recognize your own wordcards by the white or black triangle in the corner of the card. Player 1 chooses a card from the stack with white triangles, and player 2 from the stack with the black triangles. This is your secret word your opponent has to search for. Put the wordcard against the sloping side of the playingfield, so your opponent can't see it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to guess the word from the other player wins. On your turn, you ask your opponent a question which he can answer with yes or no. For example: Does your word start with a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;? If your opponent answers no, you can put a chip on every word on your playing card that does not start with a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;. This goes on until only one word remains. He calls the word and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
