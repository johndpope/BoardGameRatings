			<description>Wit is a simple card game where players start with nine cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player in a round to use all of the cards in your hand by forming words of 2 or more letters and eventually win the game by scoring 25 points. Players score points on the number of letters in a word - the more letters, the higher the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are also allowed to anagram other players words by adding one or more letters to the word to score points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
