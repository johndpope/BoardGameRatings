							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paper Trails: American Revolution!</name>
									
			<description>50 tear-off sheets in each Paper Trails pad make this an ideal travel game. Each game combines the luck of the dice and strategy in the attempt to reach the destination before your opponent. Be the hero of the Revolutionary War in the HISTORIC SITES! edition. Each Paper Trails includes a 50-sheet Game Pad, a Pencil and Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts from a starting position. Players roll dice to see how far they move. A bad roll results in damage. If a player receives too much damage is out of the game. Once players reach a checkpoint, they must roll dice each turn until their total equals/exceeds that checkpoint's number. The first player to clear all four checkpoints and reach the finish wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
