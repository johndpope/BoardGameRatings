							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Encounters in a Fey Forest (PFRPG)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;orests inhabited by the fey can be full of strange, wonderful and dangerous things to encounter, including the fey themselves. This supplement has a variety of different things to encounter in these woods, some of which may be beneficial, some dangerous and some simply odd. In some cases, the encounters have the potential for more than one of these outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party comes across a tree with roots growing from its branches into the ground, forming multiple anchors and thick, rope-like tendrils. The tree is filled with cats. A DC 15 Perception check reveals that none of the cats wear collars. A DC 25 Perception check reveals that some of the cats appear to disappear in mid-air, or to walk into a knot hole at the base and appear a moment later on a high branch. If someone uses speak with animals, the cats ask them for food, and tell them of the great Cat Sith. Sometimes he comes to play with them, but they never know which cat he is. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is cover, one the front matter, around half a page is ads and one page is the Open Game License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a system neutral version. The latter is a bit shorter and doesn't have the Pathfinder stats for some items. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
