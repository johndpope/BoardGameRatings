							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Celebrity Piggy</name>
									
			<description>Here's a fast-moving fun game for people of all ages. It's a great party game because any number of people can play. Or you can challenge just one person to a duel with the dice. In the place of 1's on the dice are smiling pigs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody antes one chip into the pot. You roll the dice as many times as you want to earn 100 points, but rolling a piggy ends your turn and rolling two piggies takes away all the points accumulated up to that point in the game (at which point everyone else goes &amp;quot;oink oink&amp;quot; to show how greedy you were). The player then has to ante another chip into the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gets to 100 points gets all the chips in the pot and is the winner for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note that despite the involvement of Peter Marshall and the use of &amp;quot;Celebrity&amp;quot; in the title, Celebrity Piggy was never actually a game show.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
