							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wrath of the Seven Horsemen</name>
									
			<description>Arthur Wooms has always had a deep craving for power. While exploring a long forgotten Inca temple he found a strange, dark, worm-scepter. As he picked it up he was suddenly surrounded by thin piping voices asking him what he wanted. Driven by his unsatiable longing, Arthur screamed his answer: POWER! Power to frighten and horrify, power to torment and crush. As the scepter seethed and coiled, the transformation began. For Arthur, the time of retribution had begun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus was born Fear, first of the Horsemen. With the power of the scepter, Arthur could call forth an individual's dominant trait and amplify it to overwhelming dimensions. By concentrating on the darker side of human nature he created the Horsemen: Death, Destruction, War, Famine, Terror, and Plague!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WRATH OF THE SEVEN HORSEMEN is a multi-part adventure scenario for CHAMPIONS. It can be used as the basis for a campaign or it can be inserted into an already existing campaign. Each scenario leads logically into the next, providing a smooth flow of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have your superheroes become so powerful that they take on any villain as just a part of the day's work? This vicious batch of high-powered bad guys won't be taken so lightly! The Seven Horsemen will re-introduce desperation and fear into your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
