			<description>Puppy Dogs From Space is a fast playing card game for 3-6 players where each player tries to assemble their team before the other puppy dog factions can. Players must balance getting their puppies assembled while also preventing opponents from doing the same with cards like &amp;rdquo; flea infestation&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the cone of shame&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;the dinosaur bone&amp;rdquo;. Each puppy also has their own special power that can be used to help their faction accomplish it's mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has the same 9 puppies and powers.  Players take their 9 puppies and shuffle 20 random cards from the 120 core cards to create their own draw deck.  This will randomize the cards from the core deck and the order their 9 puppies come out in play.  No two games are the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
