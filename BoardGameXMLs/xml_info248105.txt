			<description>Four player 'checkers' style game.  Each player tries to move their frogs to the opposite corner of the board, stacking and obstructing your opponents frogs at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 1 king (moves any direction), 1 queen (moves diagonally and carries frog stacks), 1 princess (moves diagonally), 2 knights (move vertically/horizontally and carry frog stacks) and 2 soldiers (move vertically/horizontally). On a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, they can move one frog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move their seven frogs to the goal, located on the opposite corner of the board from their start position, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
