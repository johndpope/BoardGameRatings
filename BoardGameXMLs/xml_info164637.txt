			<description>SEAL TEAM: VIETNAM is a solitaire game of Naval Special Operations Combat in Vietnam. The player assumes the role of a commander of a US Navy SEAL Platoon in Vietnam. As commander, you are responsible for securing your Area of Operations (AOR) by successfully conducting various military operations in order to locate and destroy the enemy. Although there are many units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE &lt;br/&gt;The objective of SEAL TEAM is to successfully complete a number of missions and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the US Forces. The player can choose to play a short game (4 Missions), an average game (6 Missions), a long game (8 Missions) or a full Tour (12 Missions). Once all Missions have been resolved (successfully or not) the Player totals his VP and compares this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;SEAL TEAM features many colorful Counters and Large Hex Map. Missions include RECON Patrols, Ambush Patrols, Snatch and Grabs, River Patrols and Ambushes, Raids, Search and Destroy and Phoenix Operations. SEAL Counters represent individual SEALs. Vehicles include PBRs, Huey Helicopters, STAB Boats, and AH-1 Cobra Gunships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
