			<description>Task Forces at War is a really quick card game for two, pitting the Axis' and Allies' naval vessels against one another.  Players secretly and simultaneously select three ships from their hand of five, then reveal the chosen three.  Each ship has three combat values, namely aircraft, big guns, and torpedoes.  If there are four or more aircraft carriers, then the battle will be a carrier battle, and all ships use their aircraft.  If, instead, there are five or more battleships, all ships will use their big guns.  Otherwise, the ships will employ their torpedoes.  Once the type of battle is identified, the players total their combat strengths, then compare them.  The player with the higher total sinks one of the opponent's ships.  Generally, the loser selects the ship to sacrifice; however, if the winner has double or more the combat value of the loser, then the winner sinks whichever ship she likes.  Once the decks are exhausted, the round is complete, and the player who has sunk the higher total victory point value of ships wins the round.  Winning two rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
