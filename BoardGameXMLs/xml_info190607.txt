							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Smash Quest Brawl</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting and several notable non-player characters of Super Smash Quest Brawl are derived from the Nintendo video game.  The game system itself is an adaptation of the Exalted D10 flavor of White Wolf's Storytelling System.  The game was designed for play over IRC (Internet Relay Chat), though it is not dependent upon that venue (however, most of the game materials, such as the character record sheet, are presented as text-only).  Character creation supports a wide variety of characters though the focus is heavily on combat moves and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a &amp;quot;Smash Dex&amp;quot; with several entries derived from the video game (e.g., a small Bestiary).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
