							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows on the Vatican Act I: Greed</name>
									
			<description>Visiting Rome from Chicago, where he works as a doctor, ex-priest James Murphy answers a mysterious call for help from his friend Cristoforo.&lt;br/&gt;The disappearance of a briefcase containing compromising documents is enough to convince James that his friend is a victim of something shady and sinister. The Vatican&amp;rsquo;s involvement and some strange parallels with his own traumatic past inspire James to get to the bottom of this mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along this dangerous and disturbing path, James finds the most unlikely travelling companion who will question his deepest beliefs. And so the two characters begin both a physical journey in search of the truth, and a metaphysical exploration of the inner soul and the darkest secrets that everyone hides, even a &amp;ldquo;champion of the faith&amp;rdquo; like James.&lt;br/&gt;Rome is the stage for this adventure &amp;ndash; a city bathed in eternal twilight, its skies tinted the color of blood spilled in more than thirty years of intrigue: blood of innocents and guilty, unknown and famous victims alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
