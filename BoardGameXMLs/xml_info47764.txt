			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The doors of the inn open and two enormous orcs enter, scrutinizing everybody grimly. One of them makes a sign to the entrance, then a beautiful woman in a figure-hugging silk dress enters the tavern. Her face is almost completely hidden behind a black shroud, her walk is cat-like and she attracts the men&amp;rsquo;s gazes. She approaches the portly innkeeper and talks to him briefly, then he points towards the characters. The woman sits down at a reserved table behind a screen. Straight away, one of the grim orclins approaches you and says in a perfect human dialect: 'Begging your pardon sir, my lady wishes to speak with you, would you be so kind as to follow me to her table?'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a generic adventure set in a small town. It can be inserted easily into any world. The adventure is designed for a party of four to five adventurers of levels 4-5, but it can be scaled easily by modifying the number of creatures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
