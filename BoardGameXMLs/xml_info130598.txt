			<description>10 Tage durch Deutschland &amp;ndash; the latest title in Moon and Weissblum's 10 Days in... series &amp;ndash; has players trying to complete a ten-day &amp;quot;journey&amp;quot; through Germany. The first player to do so wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a rack that holds ten tiles; each tile shows a section of Germany (with the sections having five different colors) or a train (with trains coming in the same five colors as well as white). To start the game, players shuffle all the tiles face down, then draw tiles one at a time, placing each tile in a specific place on their rack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player either draws a tile from the deck or from one of the three face-up stacks of tiles. The player can then either discard this tile or replace one tile on his rack with this new tile, discarding the old one. The goal is to create a &amp;quot;valid&amp;quot; journey in which all adjacent tiles are connected in the proper ways. More specifically, the first and last tiles on the rack must be regions, not trains. Two adjacent region tiles must be adjacent on the game board, too. A colored train can connect two regions of the same color; a white train can connect two regions that lie upon the same train route on the game board. Players continue to take turns until someone completes his journey and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
