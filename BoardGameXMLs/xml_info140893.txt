							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Puppeteer</name>
									
			<description>Puppeteer is a platformer game in development by SCE Japan Studio for the PlayStation 3. It is being directed by Gavin Moore; who served as lead animator on The Getaway, Forbidden Siren 2 and Siren: Blood Curse. The game is set to be released September 10th, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be playable in both traditional 2D and in 3D. Gavin Moore says Puppeteer plays better in 3D than other games because the camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t move and his team used a method of 3D that hasn&amp;rsquo;t resulted in a reduced frame-rate.&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a boy named Kutaro, who has been turned into a puppet and had his head torn off. Kutaro also wields a pair of magical scissors named Calibrus, which can be used to attacking enemies, cutting objects in the background to reveal secrets and advance further into the game. Another notable feature of the game is its unique control scheme, more specifically the use of the analog sticks. While the left analog stick is used to control Kutaro, the right analog stick is used to control a ghostly cat named Ying Yang. Ying Yang can be used to examine foreign objects and find new heads for Kutaro.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Puppeteer (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
