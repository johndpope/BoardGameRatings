			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to Vienna!&lt;br/&gt;This city is not only a world famous cultural hub, it is in fact the city with the highest quality of urban life on our planet. A huge amount of museums await the public with unique art and science exhibitions. From the world famous opera to clubs, from shopping to recreational areas - all are easily reached by public transport. There are many charming caf&amp;eacute;s which serve cake specialities or the viennese favourite, the &amp;quot;Melange&amp;quot; to strengthen tourists on their way. Vienna has something to offer any taste - day or night!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple game is played on a city map of Vienna. The map features stations of public transport facilites: underground, bus and tramway. At the beginning of the game, a player's pawn is put on a random station. He then draws a number of destination cards showing the stations he must visit in order to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, a player rolls five special dice, showing the symbols &amp;quot;underground&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tramway&amp;quot;. He then moves his pawn from station to station, using only the transport facilities his dice offers him. If he reaches a station which corresponds with one of his destination cards, he may discard that destination card.&lt;br/&gt; You win the game if you have visited all destinations on all your destination cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
