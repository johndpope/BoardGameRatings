			<description>Imperium of Man is a solitaire card game set in the Warhammer 40K universe. The player represents the Human Empire who must defeat all enemy units from the alien worlds: Chaos, Eldar, Tyranids, Orks, Necrons, and Tau. There is also 1 Internal Foe: Rebel Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn in the game contains 10 phases. In these phases, new enemies are spawned, random events happen, new tech is built, and battles are fought. Battles are fought by rolling a D10 and applying any modifiers from built technology. A modified roll of 6+ is a hit for both the enemy aliens and the Human Empire. The player has a supply of Empire Points which grow throughout the game. These points can be used to absorb hits when no Empire Units are left on the battlefield. The Empire Points aslo affect the number of new units that the player can recruit each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, the player must eliminate all enemy unit. The final score is the number of turns it took to eliminate them. The game is lost if the player loses all Empire Points before eliminating the enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
