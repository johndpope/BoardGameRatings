							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slush Fund 2: Powers Players Promo Pack</name>
									
			<description>This is a special item that is only available to backers and members of Dr. Finn's Kickstarter Club (which is only possible for backers of this project or a future Dr. Finn's project). The promo pack will not be available in the retail version nor will it be distributed to retail stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of three cards. Each card provides a special power to be used once during the game. Each player is given one randomly at the start and the card stays secret until use.  The three promo cards include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FBI - Prevent opponent from using Slush Fund for 1 turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Windfall - Draw 3 more cards, return 3 to the top of deck, and then take your turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encryption - Place on a politician to prevent hacking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
