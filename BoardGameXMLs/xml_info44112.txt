			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save The World . . . Or Destroy It!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Powers is the ultimate guide to ultimate abilities for ultimate heroes. Want to create a comic-book superhero? A wuxia fighter? An earth-shattering psi? A wizard or shaman with abilities far beyond mere spells and rituals? A god? With the GURPS Basic Set and Powers in hand, the only limit is your imagination. Powers has everything you need to create superhuman heroes, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Case-by-case advice on how to turn over 100 advantages from the Basic Set into superhuman abilities - complete with new special modifiers, variant traits, optional rules, and plenty of worked examples.&lt;br/&gt;    * Five flexible new advantages: Control, Create, Illusion, Leech, and Static.&lt;br/&gt;    * Dozens of all-new enhancements and limitations that let you fine-tune your abilities.&lt;br/&gt;    * Specific suggestions for representing hard-to-game abilities, including super-speed, invulnerability, stopping time, and granting wishes.&lt;br/&gt;    * Options that change the way groups of abilities work, such as Energy Reserves to fuel them and &amp;quot;alternative abilities&amp;quot; that don't all work at once.&lt;br/&gt;    * Advice on personalizing your abilities with special effects.&lt;br/&gt;    * Hundreds of worked-out sample abilities - energy blasts, supernatural curses, defenses, subtle mental gifts, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;    * Rules for powers - groups of abilities that originate from a common source and have common benefits and drawbacks - with over 40 ready-to-use examples.&lt;br/&gt;    * Guidelines on biological, chi, divine, elemental, magical, moral, nature, psionic, spirit, and super powers - even godlike cosmic powers - with special attention to how they interact.&lt;br/&gt;    * A full chapter on powers in action, covering stunts such as combining powers and using existing abilities as entirely different ones - and drawbacks such as crippling powers and losing control of them.&lt;br/&gt;    * Advice to GMs on how to keep it all fun and prevent high-powered heroes from trashing adventures and campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for? Crack open Powers and power up your game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Powers requires the GURPS Basic Set, Fourth Edition, and completely replaces the rules from the Third Edition books GURPS Supers and GURPS Psionics; however, GURPS Powers does not contain all of the same content. The advice on abilities and powers can be used with any game that features superhuman characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
