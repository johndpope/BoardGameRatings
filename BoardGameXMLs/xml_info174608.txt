			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold the Magic of Music!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fantasy genre is full of musical instruments that possess great magical powers, and, when played, can have all kinds of incredible and wondrous effects. While there are certainly a few magical instruments to be found in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook (a surprising number of them horns), there&amp;rsquo;s always room for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result, we&amp;rsquo;ve packed this book with seven never-before-seen musical instruments that are also wondrous items. Percussion specialists can enjoy the somber tones of the drums of the dead, which are great for s&amp;eacute;ances, but can also empower poltergeists and bring peace to restless spirits. The persistent notes of the fey fiddle can be heard even in areas of magical silence, and anyone who plays it well finds that it makes fey creatures very friendly indeed. Or, for those who enjoy brooding over their instrument in true theatrical fashion, consider the grand piano of the infernal maestro, whose keys can not only produce music, but, in the right hands, open up portals to hell itself. All these and many more instruments can be found in this tome!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
