							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soli2</name>
									
			<description>Soli2 is a new twist on and old classic - it's Solitaire for Two. As in Peg Solitaire, you jump a marble over another, removing the marble that was jumped over. In Soli2, what you want to jump over and remove is your opponent's marble. However, if there is no opponent's marble available, you must jump over - and remove - one of your own. Last player standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also play Solitaire, using this new 49-hole design, with either the traditional or the new Soli2 rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soli2 is part of Enginuity's Signature Collection of solid wood and glass board games that look good enough to keep on display. The collection also includes 3 Stones and Doubles Wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
