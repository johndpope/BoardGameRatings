			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy...&amp;quot; - Book of Revelations, Chapter XIII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Static Transmission is a modern-day Call of Cthulhu&amp;reg; one-round convention scenario for six Investigators set in the near future (2017) on an island in the Pacific Ocean. Investigators need not be experienced Call of Cthulhu&amp;reg; players, although this is of benefit. The scenario is designed to be run with the pregenerated characters included, although the Keeper may wish to allow the players to generate and run their own characters, albeit with the limitation that the new characters should have broadly similar skills to the pregenerated characters, and are all military types. The scenario is rather handout-heavy, there is a lot of information for the Investigators to peruse and (hopefully) extract relevant data from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
