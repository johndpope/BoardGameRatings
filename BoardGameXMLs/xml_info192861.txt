			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B Sharp is a new, unique board game to help all, beginner to advanced, young and old, improve their music reading skills and knowledge, while spending quality time together with friends and family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal - With B Sharp, your goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. You roll the die and move your piece to the left or to the right, allowing you the best play according to the cards you have in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing - When you have one or more cards in hand that match the key you land on, you can discard it/them. If not, you pick a card (or roll again if you landed on the Play Again symbol), which you discard in turn if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack - When you land on a key where another player is, you can Attack them by giving them one of your cards. But they can defend themselves with a special card: the Natural! And they give back two cards in return. And so on if the Attacker also has a Natural Card...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural - The Natural Card can also be used to make another player pick up two cards if they discarded a Sharp or a Flat Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions - You can choose to play with or without the question cards. The future B Sharp Question/Challenge App will allow you to choose the level and type of question and challenges and learn more and more as you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
