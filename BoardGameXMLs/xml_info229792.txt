			<description>Ёжик-Потеряшка (&amp;quot;Lost Hedgehog&amp;quot;) is a speed matching game. Five cards form your reference: a white horse, green frog, brown bear, yellow owl, and blue elephant. Then, you will draw a card from a 40-card deck. All the cards in the deck have two of these animals of different colors on them. Your job is to find which animal or color is not represented on the card at all, and slap that reference card. You then claim the card that was flipped over. If there is an exact match (i.e. a green frog), disregard the other rule and slap that exact reference card. You then claim the card that was flipped over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds until all the cards in the deck have been claimed -- most cards is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
