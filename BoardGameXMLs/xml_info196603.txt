			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ERA, you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. To create an interesting character, a good selection of race and profession is paramount. Rolemaster also provides background options to add more variety between characters. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample races, 2 professions and 3 background options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This feature package provides all races, professions and background options in RMFRP and RMFRP Character Law. Choose your race. This will automatically affect your stats and resistances. Then select the right profession depending on your magical and combat preferences. That will update skill costs and ensure you get all the right skill bonuses. Make a memorable personality by adding some of the background options descriptions included, covering special upbringing, magical abilities and powerful items, or just go for the money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
