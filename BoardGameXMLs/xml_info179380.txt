			<description>The first player to get his two pawns from space 1 to space 90 wins the game. Movement is determined by a die. On the roll of a 6, the player moves a pawn and gets to place a pit to trap his opponents. But beware, some pawns may fall into their own pit. Pawns that fall into a pit have to start at the beginning again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published between 1922 and 1938.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
