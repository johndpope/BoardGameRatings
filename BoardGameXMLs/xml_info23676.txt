			<description>From the back of box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hooked (tm) is an exciting board game of chance and skill that keeps everyone at the edge of their seat.  Players never know what the next move will bring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;To move your boat as quickly as possible to the fishing grounds (required at least four times), pick up your fish (one fish per trip), deliver it to the processor at some point during the game and then return to your home port.  The first boat (team) to deliver all four fish to the processor and return to its home port wins the game.  Advancing around the board becomes more of a challenge when the team members must guess mystery words related to the ocean, seashore or boats by the means of CHARADES and SKETCHES.  There are short cuts and good news/bad news situations that also come up during the game which make HOOKED(tm) even more exciting and always changing.  Playing time is about 60 to 90 minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires at least four players (two teams) to play.  Up to four teams (eight players) can play.  Teams take turns rolling the die and moving the boat and following the directions on the space landed on.  Spin the spinner when instructed and following the instructions.  In SKETCH situations, one player must guess the mystery word based on clues drawn by the partner.  If the mystery clue is correctly guessed, the team goes again.  There is also a CHARADE option in which the mystery word must be guessed based on CHARADES type clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No designer or publisher listed but a Petersburg, Alaska address is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
