			<description>&amp;quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a 2002 Xbox video game based upon the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise. It is the second video game based on the franchise to be released, though the earliest in terms of setting and the first for a console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was written by Christopher Golden and Thomas E. Sniegoski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;Set in the third season between &amp;quot;Revelations&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Lovers Walk.&amp;quot; The Master, being resurrected in a phantom form, is searching for a body to possess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levels&lt;br/&gt;There are 13 levels in the game:&lt;br/&gt;Spanish Mission &lt;br/&gt;Sunnydale High &lt;br/&gt;The Bronze &lt;br/&gt;Sunnydale Cemetery &lt;br/&gt;The Mausoleum &lt;br/&gt;The Sunken Church &lt;br/&gt;Angel's Mansion &lt;br/&gt;Sunnydale Docks &lt;br/&gt;Return to Sunnydale High &lt;br/&gt;The Foundry &lt;br/&gt;Return to the Sunken Church &lt;br/&gt;The Dreamer's Realm &lt;br/&gt;The Apse &lt;br/&gt;In addition, between missions Buffy and her friends meet in the Sunnydale High School library. During these meetings, Buffy can learn more of the story, get new weapons from Xander, learn new fighting moves from Giles and gain increased health and 'Slayer Power' from Willow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;The Scooby Gang:&lt;br/&gt;Buffy &lt;br/&gt;Xander &lt;br/&gt;Willow &lt;br/&gt;Cordelia &lt;br/&gt;Giles &lt;br/&gt;Angel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Guys:&lt;br/&gt;Malik &lt;br/&gt;Scylla &lt;br/&gt;Matereani (The Necromancer) &lt;br/&gt;Spike &lt;br/&gt;Angelus &lt;br/&gt;The Dreamers: Urd, Skuld and Verdandi &lt;br/&gt;The Master &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies&lt;br/&gt;Vampires &lt;br/&gt;Hell Hounds &lt;br/&gt;Zombies &lt;br/&gt;Spiders &lt;br/&gt;Hanoch Demons &lt;br/&gt;[edit] Voice cast&lt;br/&gt;David Boreanaz: Angel &lt;br/&gt;Nicholas Brendon: Xander Harris &lt;br/&gt;Charisma Carpenter: Cordelia Chase &lt;br/&gt;D. C. Douglas: The Master &lt;br/&gt;Alyson Hannigan: Willow Rosenberg &lt;br/&gt;Anthony Stewart Head: Rupert Giles &lt;br/&gt;Giselle Loren: Buffy Summers &lt;br/&gt;James Marsters: Spike &lt;br/&gt;Tony Menke: Brent &lt;br/&gt;Scott L. Schwartz: Biker Vamp &lt;br/&gt;Vladimir Tevlovski: Other Voices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production and release&lt;br/&gt;This project started as a PlayStation game, but development was moved to the Dreamcast and Windows. These versions were later scrapped, and development was moved to the Xbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was re-released as part of the Xbox Classics series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional features&lt;br/&gt;While Buffy the Vampire Slayer was advertised as a single-player game, it has a hidden multiplayer mode, apparently for debugging purposes.&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with a variation of the expository narrative that was featured in the early Buffy episodes, as well as a variation on the opening titles sequence. However, both of these are made up of game footage.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(Xbox),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
