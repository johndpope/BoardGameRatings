			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will often come across treasure after slaying whatever monsters they have encountered. This treasure can be detailed and can have value. But how about what is used to store the treasure itself? If the valuables are not simply rolling around loose on the floor, they will likely be stored in something, and that something may have value in itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 different containers and other items that have been used to store valuables in. All have value; in some cases this value is not very much though. Some have hidden secrets for players to find whilst others are far more straightforward. The containers are aimed at traditional fantasy games, but they could easily be used in others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveller's Chest - The chest has been covered in an unusual scaled hide (alligator skin) which has been attached to the wood using large brass rivets. When the trunk is open, it can be seen that it is made of comparatively ordinary oak, despite its covering. Thick brass strapping reinforces the trunk and a brass hasp and staple with a good steel padlock keep it fastened. The chest is about two feet square by a foot and a half high. Value: Chest 15 gp; Padlock 25 gp with key, 8 gp otherwise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter and slightly more than one is the introduction and ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
