							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mafiosi Spinosi</name>
									
			<description>A mafia-themed memory game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;Signore Spinosi, an old mafia boss, has learned that a gang of young mafiosi is plotting his demise. But they have reckoned without their host - old Spinosi isn't fooled that easily. He sends six of his most trusted spies to uncover the conspirators. You are one of his confidants. Will you be the first to uncover all 8 members of a conspirator gangs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to find and reveal all 8 wooden discs of the colour determined by the card you draw at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The 50 wooden discs (48 of them with a face in one of 6 colours) are shuffled face down and then placed on the board. The 6 cards are also shuffled. Each player draws a card, remembers its colour and places it face-down in front of him/herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns looking at the face-down side of one of the discs (without showing it to the other players). The active player may either uncover the mafioso (= put him back face-up) or just put him back. If the player reveals him, he/she gets a second try. If not, it's the next player's turn now. If the second mafioso is also revealed, the active player gets a third and final attempt, on which he/she always has to mask an already revealed mafioso (= return the disc face-down). A player's turn always ends after a maximum of three attempts.&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn also ends when he/she looks at one of the two discs without a face, and these cannot be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all 8 conspirators of one colour have been uncovered (unless that colour is not attributed to a player, which can happen with fewer than six players). The player with that colour card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
