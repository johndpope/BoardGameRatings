							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonic celebrates his 15th anniversary by reprising the starring role that made him a gaming icon worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonic The Hedgehog shines with production values you'd expect in a Hollywood CG movie and combines them with next-generation art, physics and game design to create the most intense sensation of speed ever experienced in videogames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Sonic debuted on the SEGA Mega Drive back in 1991, he shook up the action-platform genre with his now famous trademark speed and attitude. Fifteen years later, the rebirth of Sonic will take place in an epic-scale adventure where a princess is kidnapped by none other than the calculating Dr Eggman, and the very existence of a kingdom is threatened unless Sonic uses every ounce of his speed, agility and cunning to restore order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for Sonic, a mysterious new character is out to take him down using shocking new psychic powers that even the blue dude with a 'tude will find difficult to out-manoeuvre. Just who this character is, and why Dr Eggman kidnapped a princess to threaten a whole kingdom, is up to Sonic to figure out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Sonic's trademark speed gets redefined through cutting-edge animation production values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Next-generation technology such as rag-doll physics, light scatter and environmental blur effects make the world of Sonic come alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A rich storyline that delivers an epic free-roaming and ultra-high-speed adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Customise and personalise Sonic's special abilities by spending the rings you've collected on custom moves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Multiplayer modes where you can play through a unique co-op adventure with another player, or duke it out with others whose goals are completely different to yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
