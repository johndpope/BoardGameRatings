							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tom Clancy&#039;s Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Based on the Unreal engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and scopes), and a redesigned multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A console version (featuring the same basic game engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, storyline and features), Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube video game consoles. A port was also released on Mac OS X in December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2006.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tom_Clancy's_Rainbow_Six_3:_Raven_Shield,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
