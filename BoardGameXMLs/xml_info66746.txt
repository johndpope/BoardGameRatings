			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Threat Record issue #2!&lt;br/&gt;In this installment we delve into the mysterious world of the Martial Arts! We&amp;rsquo;ll learn about several styles that are popular in both fiction, and the real world. We will also be investigating several of the weapons used by martial artists from around the world. Further, each of our regular complement of five NPCs have a background in one form of martial arts, or another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Threat Levels&lt;br/&gt;Each NPC presented in Threat Record is rated with a Threat Level that will assist a Game Master in choosing the right villain to use against his or her group of super heroes. This level is a rank number that represents the NPC&amp;rsquo;s greatest offensive ability that will be used most often against the PCs. This can be the rank of a power, or one of the character&amp;rsquo;s Primary Attributes such as Melee, or Brawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills &amp;amp; Skill Levels&lt;br/&gt;The skill rules, as presented in the 4C System rule manual, are basic. They are designed for use alongside the powers that a character may possess in a supers oriented setting. In Threat Record Issue #1, we introduced the concept of five levels of skill competency for use in both supers and non-supers campaigns. Though not considered &amp;ldquo;canon,&amp;rdquo; as far as the 4C System is concerned, this new skill system will be used in some future publications from Keck Publishing, and is also used with the NPCs created by Keck Publishing presented within these pages. The rules presented in Issue #1 of Threat Record are reprinted below. Publishers wishing to use them in their own productions are free to do so as they are considered public domain material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
