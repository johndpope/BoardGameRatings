							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">vs. Moon Men</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Didn&amp;rsquo;t Come in Peace! Send Them Back in Pieces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the VsM Engine created by Phillip Reed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Moon Men is a roleplaying game in which players take up arms against alien invaders from another (but very nearby) world! Steal a ray gun and take the fight to them, or fight from the shadows while avoiding spies and collaborators. Fight for freedom, stay out of the way, or help the invaders (but only if you&amp;rsquo;re a jerk). From the streets of Moscow to the backwoods of Tennessee, the Moon Men are here, and somebody needs to stop them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play vs. Moon Men you need at least two players (but more players means more fun) and somebody to be the Moon Master. You also need some paper, some pencils (or pens if you really like to live on the edge), and a deck of playing cards (but take out the damn Jokers). vs. Moon Men uses the vs. M Engine, a rules-light system that is easy to learn and fast to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
