			<description>&amp;quot;Forsaken is a 3D first person shooter video game. The game was developed by Probe Entertainment for the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation and by Iguana UK for the Nintendo 64, and distributed by Acclaim Entertainment. The game was released on April 30, 1998 in North America, June 3, 1998 in Europe &amp;amp; Australia, and in 1999 in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Descent, Forsaken had a strong following due to its &amp;quot;six degrees of freedom&amp;quot; gameplay, but suffered in popularity to the conventional ground-based 3D first-person shooter games because of its challenging nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the distant future, the advancement of science has exceeded humanity's ability to control it. During a subatomic experiment, an accident causes an uncontrollable fusion reaction, utterly destroying the surface of the planet Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One year later, Earth has been classified as &amp;quot;condemned&amp;quot; by the ruling imperial theocracy, meaning that it is now legal for anyone to salvage anything left on the planet. Mercenaries from all over come to raid the dead planet, forced to battle not only each other, but the robot sentinels that the government has left behind.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Forsaken (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
