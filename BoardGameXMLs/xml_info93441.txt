							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castaways of Deadmans Bay</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The death of the famed pirate William Dread leaves the crew of the Rusty Barnacle fighting over his successor. The only way to survive this fast paced dueling game is to outsmart and trick your way to the top. All ages can enjoy this simple yet addictive battle of wits.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castaways puts the players in the muddy boots of 3 eager pirates with aspirations to captain their very own ship. Gameplay is based around building up your attacks and tricking your opponent to defend against the wrong attack. A successful attack could push you off the plank, drop your health or force your crew to desert you. Either way you're shark bait if you can't keep up with your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The duel is fast paced and mechanics are simple but strategies quickly form as you try to bluff your intentions while predicting your opponents. Younger audiences will find the duel fun and exciting while older audiences will enjoy the trickery when played with a clever opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer Jack Johnson&lt;br/&gt;While simple minded &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; found that most problems in life share a simple solution. Jack freely shares his solution with sailors dumb enough to call him by his first name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chef Phillipe Forchette&lt;br/&gt;Phillipe was hired to cook for the Queen on the great French galleon La Grandiere. He was quite shocked when he boarded the Castaway by accident. Now the only way home is to be at the helm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannonade Kate&lt;br/&gt;Raised at sea Kate grew up on gunpowder and steel. She's gained a fearsome reputation for crushing ships with her heavy cannon salute and could easily rule the sea- as soon as she has a ship of her own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
