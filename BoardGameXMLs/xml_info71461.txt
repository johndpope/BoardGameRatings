			<description>Crush wasps, mosquitoes and hornets which pass at hand. But, attention: the fly is nice so don't touch the fly! Well, not all of them, some flies are evil. Also be careful with swarms, as you do not always know what you crush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the publisher web site)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;insect&amp;quot; player  mixs tokens (1 hornet token,1 mosquito, 1 wasp and 4 flies) in the center of the table taking care that none overlaps or is in contact with another then takes one of his cards and puts it in front of him back side up, so it is visible to all. He is then free to distract the attention of the players by any means until  the moment when he turns the card revealing one or several insects. The action the players will need to do depends on the insect on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is a hornet, mosquito or wasp, the first player who puts its hand on the correponding token or on a fly gets victory points. A player making a mistake loses victory points.&lt;br/&gt;If it is an evil fly, only the fly earns victory points.&lt;br/&gt;If it is a nice fly, no insect must be harmed !&lt;br/&gt;As for the swarms, usually the most numerous insect on the card counts. But if there is only one nice fly, the card is considered as a nice fly card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(personal sum-up based on the rules.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
