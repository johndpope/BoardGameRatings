			<description>From the publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Dicecar's Tri-Oval Speedway. Now available with either Dicecar Jr. rules and Extreme Dicecar rules packages.&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the skinny of what Dicecar is. Dicecar is a Table Top Racing game that is played using dice and cards. The drivers must have their own 1/64th scale race cars. These are available at most department stores in the toy section or at your local racing collectible stores. Some spaces on the race track allow you lane changes or prompt you to draw cards which could be good or bad. Pit road is outlined in yellow, so you know where the speed limit begins. Strategies include pit stops in which you choose gas only, one side or both sides tire changes. Avoiding trouble and making moves which can put you in front of the competition are important strategies as well. To win you must be the first driver to cross the start/finish line after completing all of the laps and pit stops. Table Top Racing is no fantasy as you race face to face with your family and friends. Everyone can race at Dicecar. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a race fan to enjoy the game. Racing knowledge can help but it is not necessary. Experience counts, so race a few times as you develop your strategy. Dicecar includes qualifying, drafting, unscheduled pit stops for tire or engine trouble. Crashes can happen and the yellow flag will bring out the pace car for a caution. Have fun racing and building your 1/64th scale racing world. Different tracks are available as well as accessories like the high banks and soft walls. Other items such as the pace car, jet dryer trucks, tow trucks and ambulances are also available and make your world of Dicecar a lot of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
