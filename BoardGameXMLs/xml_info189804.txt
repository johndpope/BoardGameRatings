			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shoot em up where your ship is able to transform into three different forms giving you different ways to attack. Each stage also gives you credits that you can spend on upgrades and as you level up skill points can be spent to make six different powerups you can activate more powerful. Each planet in the game has three stages and once cleared credits can be used to colonize the planet, buildings can be created over time and research can be completed to improve your weapons and colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
