			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have in your hot little hands a game about the Apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, you hear that, and  it brings to mind millions of images: dingy desert huts, rusty technology, stockpiles of military weapons, raiders in leather jackets, giant ants...&lt;br/&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t worry-all that&amp;rsquo;s gonna be there if you want it. The big difference here is that you won&amp;rsquo;t be takin on the aspects of a bunch of hardened, ragged, stubbled heroes of the wastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about how to survive the end of days with nothin in your arsenal but a smile, a beat, and the right moves. For some reason, all of the Dance Teams on Earth have survived a catastrophic event, while the entire rest of the population was devastated. These Teams roam the city, entertainin survivors, facin off against other Teams, and, of course, fightin zombies. The Teams are the greatest hope for humanity, and every Team is out to become the Hottest Team in Town. To do this, you will need a copy of the character sheet, a deck of ordinary poker cards, a bunch of 6-sided dice, and some funky beats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t think of the Apocalypse as Mad Max and Day of the Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of it as The Warriors meets You Got Served.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
