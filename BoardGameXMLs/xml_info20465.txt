			<description>THE BILL - A game to beat all others is described as &amp;quot;an exciting chase game where you start as a humble Bobby onthe Beat and compete with the other players to become Superintendent.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is loosely based on the Thames Television (UK) police series, but is different from the other game on the database of the same name which is also based on the same TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to roll a die and move their police car marker round the board.  The square landed on will be of three types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Incident&amp;quot; - follow the instructions on the square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, hello, hello&amp;quot; - draw a card from the appropriate deck.  These are general knowledge questions on various criminal and legal subjects as well as general police procedures.  Successfully answering of the question will allow for advancement or the avoidance of  a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In Court&amp;quot; - draw a from the appropriate deck.  These will involve certain skills (observation, memory, impersonation etc.) and will usually result in moving forwards, backwards or missing a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At various places on the board there is the opportunity for promotion (and also demotion).  The winner is the first person to do their time by passing the golden handcuffs square on the inner ring twice, to become the all powerful Superintendent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
