			<description>User Summary: Collaborative storytelling rpg of time-traveling pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;Some say that time be like a rope. They say it be a single line that be goin' from the beginnin' to the end. In some ways they might be right, but only if ye be lookin' at a rope closely, for time be a mass of lines twisted round one another in complicated ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others say time be like a stream or river, flowing from one point to another, and this be true as well in a way. That's b'cause time be flowin' with currents and eddies, and it can change on a whim like the driftin' of sand banks. Only an experienced navigator can get a crew from one point to another without gettin' into a whole mess o' trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, if ye be askin' me, and ye wouldn' be writin' this down for others to read if ye' didn' want me opinion...Time be a vast ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It be a swirlin' mass of flows and currents that can take ye anywhere ye imagination could desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She be a harsh mistress, but one who treats her well is in for the time of their life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forget ye landlubbin' and chronostatic ways...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a world of high seas, quantum waves and differential currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Eighth Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
