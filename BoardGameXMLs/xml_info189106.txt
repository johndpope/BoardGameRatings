			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taverns and Tales is a rules-light, fast-start role playing game.  The game is played on a board grid with token representing individuals.  Movement is along the grid, by squares.  Character creation involves selecting a character Class, which subsequently determines all other character abilities and statistics.  For example, all Bards have 5 Stamina, 13 Defense, 7 Speed, 4 Weapon, a Guitar Accessory, and Inflict 4 damage, as well as having a predetermined kit of equipment and a specified special ability.  It is suggested that scenarios be created prior to play and not improvised.  An introductory scenario, &amp;quot;Troubled Village&amp;quot;, is provided.  This rapid setup is much like a board game, but play subsequently follows typical role-playing methods.  The rules note, however, that the method of setup does allow for easy solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
