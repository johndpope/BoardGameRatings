			<description>Raus aus dem Schneckenhaus (translation: Out of the Snailhouse) is a simple roll-and-move game with some special cards, where you have to collect (visit) all different coloured spaces, before you are allowed to exit the track.  If you exit the track without having collected all the different colours, you are forced to lose one colour and start the track at the beginning again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very rare game which only had 200 copies produced and only 10 were ever sold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
