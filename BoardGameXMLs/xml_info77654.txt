			<description>[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectre VR is a sequel to the earlier Spectre 1.0 that adds a large number of new features.  Spectre is a 'Battlezone' style tank game where players move their vehicles around a polygonal 3-D environment and battle enemy tanks, collect power-ups, and race to grab all of the flags and finish the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version introduced many new enemies, such as slicers, missile turrets, moving walls, optical-, and radar-cloaked varieties, as well as new kinds of 'ammo cache' power-ups.  &lt;br/&gt;Some of these enabled the player to fly temporarily, while other spots would allow him to submerge below the battlefield and move beneath normal enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player game consisted of an infinite number of increasingly-difficult levels.  Also included was the ability to compete over a local area network in several game modes, or even via modem in the PC version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
