There are basic, advanced, and optional rules enabling the wargamer to play the game at the level of complexity he finds best suited. The advanced rules include command and control, constructing and dismantling of fortifications, special cavalry rules, attacking/combat modifiers, advanced unit step losses, special combat capabilities for Berdans sharpshooters, and morning / evening combat modifiers [The &amp;quot;Has Your Coffee Kicked In Yet?&amp;quot; Rule] that can be introduced singly or as a unified set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules deal with repairing / employing captured artillery, using a mounted cavalry attack, unit morale, concealed units, terrain values, and using variable leader values (ever wonder what would happen if a good leader had a bad day, and a bad leader had a good day?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;one 22 by 34 inch map &lt;br/&gt;500 die-cut back printed counters &lt;br/&gt;rules booklet &lt;br/&gt;6 scenarios &lt;br/&gt;charts and tables cards &lt;br/&gt;two dice -- one blue, one gray &lt;br/&gt;boxed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
