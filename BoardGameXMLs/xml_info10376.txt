			<description>Ring of Fire: The Fourth Battle for Kharkov, August 1943 is an operational simulation of the fourth battle for Kharkov, which took place over the two week period of August 3 to August 16, 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Russian Army Fronts, attempting to retake the city of Kharkov, are on the offensive, driving against dug-in German forces to try to take as much of the map as possible and to exit forces in a breakthrough, while the Germans must race fire brigades of panzers and infantry to plug the holes in their lines and cut off the Russian advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most noteworthy feature are the tank combat rules, which allow adjacent armored forces to trade fire before the more traditional odds-based CRT combat phase.  This favors the Germans, provided that the Russians do not bring too much armor against them at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other key feature are the reserve rules, which allow a player to both react to the opponent's attacks and to exploit holes punched by his units.  Airpower can be used to interdict reserves - and doing so can be important to winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1 day &lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1.2 miles / 2 kilometers &lt;br/&gt;Units: Regiment to Division&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed countersheets (360 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 24-page Ring of Fire rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC Player Aid charts&lt;br/&gt;Two single-side printed Player Aid cards&lt;br/&gt;One 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Very High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-10 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
