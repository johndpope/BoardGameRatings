							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atlantean Merchant Barge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, two level, full color floorplan of an Atlantean Merchant Barge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pirates have grappled the ship! Where is that damn Captain Tavios? He is supposed to be our escort!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Atlantean Merchant Barge Captain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlantean Merchant Barge contains a two level map of an upper and lower deck of a fantasy merchant barge. The upper level is lightly armed with one harpoon and two catapults. The main feature of the Atlantean Merchant Barge is a very large cargo hold with a dual crane allowing for a quick unloading and loading of cargo. Usually one crane is unloading as goods going out are pushed toward that side of the cargo hold while the other crane loads goods coming in to the ship as space is cleared on the opposite side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlantean Merchant Barge is intended for use in fantasy or pseudohistorical settings which would include Atlantis. This fantasy merchant barge is perfect for many fantasy settings where technology has not yet advanced to blackpowder cannons. Some of the Atlantean tech on the ship might also be interesting in clockwork or steampunk fantasy settings (for example the harpoon and crane might be based on these kinds of fantasy tech).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ocean Patrol Part Two: Captain Tavios is attempting to escort an Atlantean Merchant Barge to the mainland and back on one of his patrols. However, pirates appear from the mist, a technique he has mastered but didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the lesser cultures to be able to perform the maneuver. The pirates hook onto the Atlantean Merchant Barge he is attempting to protect. He can&amp;rsquo;t fire on the pirate ship, because it might hit the barge. So he decides to hook his warship to the other side of the barge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Tavios&amp;rsquo; men surge onto the ship to protect the barge from the pirates making it a three way battle with the soldiers fighting the pirates and the merchant sailors trapped in the middle of the combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters could be a part of any of the three groups; pirates, Atlantean soldiers, or even Atlantean bodyguards of the merchant on the barge. Can they turn the tide of battle in the favor of their side and either steal or protect the Atlantean goods on board?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
