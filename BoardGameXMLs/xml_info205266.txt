			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do giant radioactive beetles want? Nuclear War!&lt;br/&gt;When do they want it? Everywhen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine an 8-foot tall psychic beetle with a bad temper, and you have the ezeru. Evolving to rule the Earth in the aftermath of nuclear war, they expanded their dominion by infesting and colonizing parallel realities - until TimeWatch engineered history so the apocalypse never happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But a few ezeru remained caught in the time stream, determined to restore their alternative reality; and only you, the agents of TimeWatch, can stop them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on these fearsome insectoid foes in Behind Enemy Times, a series of missions for the TimeWatch Role Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gadget A 24th-century disembodied brain draws the ezeru's attention when it steals nuclear warheads from the past for its own personal museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thief In The Night A plague is destroying humanity's greatest thinkers and creators. Who's behind it, and what are they trying to achieve?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Will Tell A rogue memory technician teams up with William Tell to fight oppression through history&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebel Heart The agents go deep under cover to infiltrate a rebellion against TimeWatch itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hatchet and Axe The Cuban Missile Crisis leads to nuclear war, and following the historical mystery introduces the agents to would-be Presidents, Prohibition-era activists and the most awkward wedding ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hatching Time In the explosive finale, the ezeru plan to hatch millions of eggs in the heart of New York City by flooding the city with radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run Behind Enemy Times missions as one shots, or as a campaign run in any order, ending with The Hatching Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
