							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Birth of A Nation American Civil War Rules</name>
									
			<description>A set of medium to large scale wargames rules for the American Civil War period 1861 to 1865.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are organized into Brigades and commanded at Divisional level for the Confederation and at Corp level for the Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very simple command ordering system allows a fast flowing game to unfold right before your eyes. This is achieved through a command structure where commanders must keep their troops motivated or their formation and army morale may crumble. Control of the battle is achieved through a series of morale checks; these are effortless and give extremely good historical results. You may find your units running for cover when you least desire it, then find that they return with a new resolve and vigor for the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules are capable of reproducing all the major battles of the American Civil War from Bull Run 21st July 1861 through to Parnetto Ranche 13th May 1865.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
