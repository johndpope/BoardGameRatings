							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dracula in London</name>
									
			<description>Excerpts from In-Game Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Dracula left his own barren land-- barren of peoples-- to come to a new land where life of man teems like a multitude of standing corn. To sustain his Un-Dead power, he has brought 50 large crates of native soil. Only six persons know of the Count's evil intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User your wits to track down the blood-thirsty Vampire and put an end to his evil menace. Beware! The creatures of the night will thwart your sacred purpose. Know too that Dracula has the strength of twenty men and the cunning of centuries. He will kill any who subvert his unquenchable thirst for souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects and assumes the role of one of the following vampire hunters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Van Helsing - renowned metaphysician&lt;br/&gt;Mina Harker  - schoolmistress&lt;br/&gt;Jonathan Harker - solicitor's clerk&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Seward - head of a lunatic asylum&lt;br/&gt;Arthur Holmwood - son of Lord Godalming&lt;br/&gt;Quincey Morris - a wealthy young Texan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there's less than six players, divide the extra hunters as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each day is divided into 8 turns of 3 hours each. The hunters must select one activity per turn. Some activities are allowed only during the day, others only at night. Most of the activities can only be performed by certain hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At game's end, surviving hunters score up to 100 points each, depending on Dracula's fate and how many other hunters survive. (For more information, send for your vampire packet today.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
