							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Broken Bridge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was dark when they arrived at the bridge and they could all see that it was broken. Someone had laid some planks over the gap, a very crude job and passing over it seemed not to be a very good idea at this hour. On the other side of the river they could also see a small watch tower and in the top window a light was flickering as if a candle was burning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a map that is perfect to use for breaking up the adventurers travel between two sites. It depicts a river crossing with a broken bridge, a tower and a ruined house among some hills and trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the adventurers be ambushed here when they try to cross, who lives in the watch tower, why is the bridge broken, the possibilities are many.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is meant to be shown to the players during play and it works just as well for online and offline sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf is in letter format and consists of three different versions of the map, two coloured and one black and white. One of the coloured maps and the black and white version has a grid attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
