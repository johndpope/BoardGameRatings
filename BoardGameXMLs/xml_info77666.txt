			<description>From wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rune Factory Frontier is a simulation/role-playing video game developed by Neverland Co. and published by Marvelous Entertainment in Japan, Marvelous Entertainment USA and Xseed Games in North America, and Rising Star Games in Europe for the Wii video game console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The player can grow a farm. There are 4 distinct seasons, 3 of which you can grow different types of crops. Examples include: Strawberries and turnips in the spring, tomatoes and pineapples in the summer, and yams in the fall. There are many other crops, and you can grow flowers, which can all be sold for gold (the game's currency.) Farming is only half of the game. The other half is dungeon crawling. There are four very different dungeons, three of which represent the four different seasons (the third dungeon represents both autumn and winter). In these dungeons, crops of that dungeon's seasonal affiliation can be grown. The fourth dungeon, Whale Island, is omni-seasonal, and all crops can be grown there at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another feature is the concept of Runey distribution. Runeys come in four different variations: water, rock, tree and grass. Runeys represent the ecosystem of Trampoli; when Runeys are in perfect harmony, the area that they occupy reaches a state of Prosperity, and crops in that area will grow much faster than normal. However, should even one area of Trampoli become devoid of Runeys, the ecosystem suffers, and crops grow much slower than normal. Runeys can be re-distributed from area to area using a tool called the Harvester, and the game itself distributes Runeys randomly across Trampoli daily. Every nine ripe crops in the field in front of the character's house also spawns one Runey daily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Rune Factory Frontier , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
