			<description>A very long time ago, when science sucked and magic was really trendy, when there was a really huge offer of heroes and, luckily, they did not want to be paid, when behind each door you could find ugly but precious treasures or cute but lethal monsters and a dice roll could often decide the destiny of the humankind...&lt;br/&gt;... in other words, when the world was a funny place, some incautious accepted each dangerous mission that was assigned by the most powerful characters of the time. The fate was on their side and their gestures became legendary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could you beat their fame? Be incautious yourself and try to build an even more legendary legend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round all the dice are rolled and grouped by their value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player chooses one group of dice and place it beside a deck of his choice in order to recruit Heroes, accepting new Missions or discover new lands (and the monster that lives there!) recovering special items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the dice will be placed, each player in turn will use one or more heroes from his hand in order to defeat the monsters. The colour of the dice used to discover the land determines the skills the hero must have in order to participate to the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recruited Heroes will be added to the player&amp;rsquo;s hand, while Missions, defeated Monsters and Items will be placed in front of him side by side forming the timeline of his legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the player will gain points for each item, monster and accomplished mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be accomplished, some of the missions requires the player to discover certain items or to kill a specific monster (so only the cards placed after the Mission in the timeline will be considered), while some other requires the player to have already discovered certain items or killed a monster (so, in this case only the cards placed before the Mission in the timeline will be considered).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
