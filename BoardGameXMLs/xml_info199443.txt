			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Izzy Wizzy lets get Bizzy!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's always trouble when Matthew goes out. This time he has left Sooty in charge until he returns. Unfortunately Sweep has been up to his old tricks and not only left his dirty old bones all over the house but has left the door to the garden open and all the creepy crawlies have got into the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sooty and Sweep will be in big trouble if they don't clear up all the bones by the time Matthew gets back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily Sooty has his magic wand out and Sweep his water pistol, (in the two player game). They decide to find all the old bones and ask Soo to help to collect them. As Sooty and Sweep collect the bones they give them to Soo who puts them in the basket. Some of the bones have been left in the most awkward places and Sooty must be very careful when he tries to get them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creepy crawlies that are in the house will try to catch Sooty and Sweep. They can be avoided by jumping over them or stunning them with either Sooty's magic wand or Sweep's water pistol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sooty was a children's TV character first created in 1948. He is a hand puppet of a small yellow bear with black ears, originally operated by Harry Corbett and later by his son Matthew. He was joined by Sweep the dog and Soo, a panda. The Sooty Show first appeared on British television in 1952 and ran for 43 series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the mid 1980s, Sooty was still highly popular, hence the video-game tie-in. It is aimed at younger players with both an easy and hard version and was released at a budget price-point. Two players can play simultaneously and semi-cooperatively. Both players are cooperating to collect the bones, but custard pies can be thrown to cause the other player to drop what they are carrying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
