			<description>Original description from the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BOOMI, the Chief-Deity of the BOOMERANG ISLAND was very angry because his quarrelsome islanders had started war against each other and disturbed his afternoon nap, immediately he teleported all magicians of the tribes summoning them and told them: &amp;quot;I am fed up with you. In the future there shall be but one tribe on the island, that one which succeeds first to carry out my order given to you'-&amp;quot; And all in a flash, the magicians found themselves home again and each holding an order of the Chief-Deity in his hand. And thus the last clash of the islanders -- our game -- began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a sub-deity of a tribe and tries with the help of his fearful chieftains as well as with that of magicians with superhuman crafts to gain the victory in the last struggle of the savages of the Boomerang Island. And all this happens in the course of the breathtakingly exciting and sometimes humorous game on the lovely coloured fanciful playing field.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design: Imre Vincze and the Pancserek&lt;br/&gt;Artwork: Zolt&amp;aacute;n Tarn&amp;oacute;czy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be considered an unofficial Risk spinoff (or even clone) with a different theme, some added features and some different rules. The main difference is the presence of chieftains and shamans (aka magicians) that have a special (random and secret) power and can kill/teleport an enemy tribesman regardless of the dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board pictures an imaginery continent divided into 6 distinct countrysides with 42 areas total and most command cards that players must draw at the beginning of the game requires to conquer 2-3 &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot; of those.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's very much like in Risk, but the board offers more variety both in area names and in relation to the rules. (Eg. one chieftain's special power lets you swim between lakes, another lets you recruit new tribesmen based upon board graphics.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable by 1-6 players with special rules (victory conditions) for 1, 2 and 3 player games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
