							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Makyou Kessen Daimajyuu DX (Deluxe)</name>
									
			<description>A deluxe version of one of Bandai's Party Joy series of games, a light series of games released only in Japan. The original, simpler version of the game was #77 in Bandai's Party Joy series, and had the same title without the &amp;quot;DX&amp;quot; at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best translation I can come up with on the title is:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Demon World Battle Great Magic Game DX&amp;quot;, but I'm sure someone else would do better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 50 hexagonal game panels that can interlock into whatever shape you want the board to be (but seem to hate to be re-seperated when you get a clump of them together). Each has different terrain on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken into 3 areas, and you must level up your character and gather money to equip yourself to have any chance in the 2nd and 3rd regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has basic magic (just a couple kinds really) as well, and overall, the game is in the same genre as Talisman, in that you build up your character via fantasy combats to be able to handle the endgame that you can see from the beginnning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
