			<description>Quickly, the coast is in danger! A lot of waste has been abandoned on the beach and there is a risk they are being swept away by the waves.&lt;br/&gt;Find the hidden marine animals from the garbage and move the waste in the correct bins before the sea rises!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player rolls the die and acts accordingly:&lt;br/&gt;If it shows &amp;quot;animal&amp;quot; - the player turns around a waste tile.&lt;br/&gt;If the same type of animal is under that tile player may trash the waste. If not He puts the tile back on the board.&lt;br/&gt;If it shows &amp;quot;trach can&amp;quot;  - the  player may trash any tile from the board.&lt;br/&gt;If it shows  &amp;quot;waves&amp;quot; - the sea rises a little bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the players find all the animals under the waste they win together.&lt;br/&gt;If the sea level rises so much that the waste pollutes the sea then the players lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
