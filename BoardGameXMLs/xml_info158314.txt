			<description>From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fardh al-Qanoon is a simulation of the 2007 counterinsurgency operation in Baghdad, also referred to as the &amp;lsquo;Baghdad Security Plan.&amp;rsquo; The simulation takes place from February 2007 to November 2007 in month-long turns as the US-led Coalition and Mahdi Army vie for control of the Iraqi capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players &amp;amp; Objectives &lt;br/&gt;One player represents the Coalition, and another the Shia Mahdi Army. The Sunnis of Baghdad are represented in a non-player faction that affects the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coalition&amp;rsquo;s goal is to secure control of Baghdad&amp;rsquo;s districts and Sunni neighborhoods by November 2007 while minimizing casualties and violence. The Mahdi Army&amp;rsquo;s goal is to maintain a strong presence in Baghdad and prevent the Coalition from securing the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Sequence of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manpower Phase &lt;br/&gt;During the Manpower Phase, the Coalition assigns units to districts and the Mahdi Army moves Militias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunni Action Phase &lt;br/&gt;The Sunni faction&amp;rsquo;s actions are determined,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baghdad Phase &lt;br/&gt;The Coalition has an opportunity to reassign units, the Mahdi Army activates Militias, and players have the opportunity to engage in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reset Phase &lt;br/&gt;Changes are determined before the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concepts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intelligence &lt;br/&gt;1.    Intelligence enables the Coalition to seek out Militia units hidden amongst the population and to reassign units in districts during the Baghdad Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mahdi Will &lt;br/&gt;2.    Will represents the Mahdi Army&amp;rsquo;s ability to con&amp;not;trol the Shia Militias operating in Baghdad. The Mahdi Army requires Will to raise new Militias and to activate ones that become dispersed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secured vs. Unsecured &lt;br/&gt;3. Districts and Sunni neighborhood spaces are by default 'Unsecured' areas. &lt;br/&gt;4. An area is 'Secured' as soon as the Coalition meets its the Manpower Requirement and there are no Active Militias present. &lt;br/&gt;5. An area becomes unsecured immediately once the Manpower requirement is no longer met or there are Active Militia units present. &lt;br/&gt;6. Securing a district does not secure Sunni neigh&amp;not;borhood spaces within the district. They must be secured separately. A Sunni neighborhood can be secured even if the district it is in is not secured.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
