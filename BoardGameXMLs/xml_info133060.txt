			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, here we are. Within a 24 hour period, I wrote this game. I'm sure it shows. It was fun to do, though, and I think it may have legs, so I hope you enjoy reading it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was inspired by an anime named Durarara! that I watched recently, though it also got me thinking about similar ideas found in Sin City. I decided to try writing a game that would replicate that idea of people who interact within a large city, people who really don't often know each other very well, even if they are friends. People with power of a variety of kinds. Information brokers. Gang leaders. Immortal masterminds. Monstrously strong thugs. Some are obvious about what they are. Others have hidden power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And they're all connected by relationships, favours, and history. I'm not sure if I pulled that off in this game or not, but it was worth a try. Please tear into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
