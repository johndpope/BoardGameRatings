							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goodman Games Gen Con 2016 Program Guide</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Goodman here, welcoming you to Gen Con 2016. It's hard to believe another year has passed, but so it has. Each year this Program Guide is one of my favorite releases, since it recaps the year that has passed and gives hints as to the year that will come. And, as always, we pay homage to the inspirational past that brings us all together in mutual respect and admiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this year's Program Guide, we have an incredible interview with legendary artist Erol Otus, including original sketches, never-before-published art, and material from his complete oeuvre across multiple industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For DCC fans, there are two new adventures (both funnels!), the spell duel tourney from last year's Gen Con, and a variety of supplemental material. Fans awaiting our DCC Lankhmar line will find some new material as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2016 is a special year for the industry, as it marks the 40th anniversary of two milestone product lines - both of which Goodman Games is honored  to publish. In this issue we look back at 40 years of history for both designs: Metamorphosis Alpha and the Judges Guild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounding it all out is a tribute to Appendix N, in the form of new fiction. Plus several other new articles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope your 2016 was as good as ours - and we look forward to seeing you at the big show in Indy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
