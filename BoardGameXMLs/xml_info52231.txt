			<description>Construction Whist&lt;br/&gt;Thin veneer of theme: players are pyramid builders in ancient Egypt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take one deck of cards, remove any jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Turn over the top card; of the deck; this is trumps.&lt;br/&gt;- Shuffle the deck&lt;br/&gt;- Deal 13 cards to each player&lt;br/&gt;- Choose a first player for the round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round consists of 13 construction tricks, in which the players bid for raw materials to extend their pyramids. In each phase, perform the following steps:&lt;br/&gt;- turn over two cards from the draw deck&lt;br/&gt;- first player plays a card&lt;br/&gt;- second player follows suit if possible, trumps or discards if not&lt;br/&gt;- the WINNER of the trick &lt;br/&gt;-- MUST extend their pyramids with one of the two cards face-up on the table&lt;br/&gt;-- MAY further extend their pyramid with the card they played&lt;br/&gt;- the LOSER of the trick MUST then extend a pyramid with the other face up card, but can not use the card that they played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extending a pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;- Each pyramid consists of a stack of cards in a suit. &lt;br/&gt;- Each card must be played on a card of higher rank, so the numbers gradually descend.&lt;br/&gt;- Each player can only have one pyramid in each suit&lt;br/&gt;- If a player MUST play a card on a pyramid, but can't, then they have to demolish their pyramid and start again with the new card as the base&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players score points for each pyramid equal to the number of cards in the pyramid squared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
