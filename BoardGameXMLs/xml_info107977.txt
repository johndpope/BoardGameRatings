			<description>Most of the cards in this card game are letter cards, with which a word is formed; the rest are special action cards. Each player has six cards at the start of the game; the goal is to get rid of one's cards first.&lt;br/&gt;The first player plays a card on the table; this card will be the first letter of a word that s/he thinks about (but doesn't say out loud). The next player adds a second letter to the word, etc. There are many jokers, so there are also many possibilities for what a word might be. When a player doubts that the last player can still think of a word starting with the letters on the table, s/he can call the bluff. If the previous players cannot produce a word, the bluffing player must pick up the cards from the table, if s/he can, the accusing player picks them up. Instead of playing a card, a player can also choose to draw a new card from the stack, but still takes responsibility for the word on the table (i.e., if called, must produce a word with these letters).&lt;br/&gt;By placing a facedown card on the table, any player (out of turn order), can announce that a word is complete. The letters are then discarded and a new word is started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various special cards with which players can be forced to say a word with the current letters, cards can be passed to other players, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player plays his or her last card, the other players count the points printed on their remaining cards. These are their negative scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
