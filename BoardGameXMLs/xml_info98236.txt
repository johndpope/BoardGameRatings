			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonar Search is provided in two versions: A one-player version in which the player attempts to locate a hidden fleet before running out of ammunition; and a two-player version in which each player tries to sink his opponent's fleet before his own fleet is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the one-player version, the Computer will &amp;quot;hide&amp;quot; a fleet of five ships &amp;quot;Somewhere&amp;quot; in the Battle Zone. The player is provided with a &amp;quot;Magazine&amp;quot; load of a randomly generated number between 68 and 94. This constitutes the entire number of shots during his turn of play. He takes one shot at the time attempting to locate the hidden fleet and sink it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the two-player version, the computer will hide differently colored fleets in the Battle Zone. Each player starts out firing &amp;quot;Salvoes&amp;quot; of 8 shots each during his turn attempting to locate and sink his opponent's fleet. Whenever a player has had one of ships sunk, he loses one shot in his next salvo. One shot is lost for each ship sunk, regardless of what kind it is. For example, losing a destroyer counts as much as losing a carrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you fire a shot and miss you will hear a number of Sonar &amp;quot;Pings.&amp;quot; These &amp;quot;Pings&amp;quot; are a result of an ever widening invisible square which radiates from your firing coordinates pinging at each step as it expands outward. The pinging changes tone and stops when this expanding square contacts an enemy ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By counting these pings you can judge the distance an enemy ship is from the last location fired and by &amp;quot;remembering&amp;quot; your previous search you can determine his approximate direction. By learning to plot your sonar you can add a new depth both in interest and skill to this already fascinating game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
