							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Flayed King</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flayed King started out as Tullius Well. I had the map, and in my game the Northmen use wells in their religious ceremonies. So I started writing this with that in mind and somewhere from my mind the concept of the Flayed King came into mind. Heavily borrowed from the story of Odin gaining his wisdom and losing his eye. This guy didn't fair so well. Also throw in a bit of Arthurian mythos and a dash of Egyptian and this is what I came up with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the adventure you'll find a new cultural item and a new, minor artifact. I think both are cool and hope you find them interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
