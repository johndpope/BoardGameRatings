			<description>Spend an afternoon on the 'ice'. Hockey played the electronic way has all the fun and fast-paced action of the real thing . . . Your ingenuity keeps the game fascinating. Outwit your opponent for a goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their &amp;quot;Computer Games&amp;quot; line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a  game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
