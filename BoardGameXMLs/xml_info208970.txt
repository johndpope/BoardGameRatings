							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Scarecrow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your average scarecrow is created to scare of, well, crows and maybe other animals, but what happens when you take a primal spirit or even the soul of a murderous creature and bind it to a scary sack of hay? Those who can wield such wicked magic animate scarecrows to serve as guardians and wreak fear upon those who dare to trespass their lands. Regardless of the method of your creation, as a scarecrow your primary source of energy and magic is fear. Fear is what gives you purpose, fear is what you crave and fear is what feeds you. As you level up, you will have options to increase the number of ways you instill fear in your victims, become supernaturally durable, and even gain a crow companion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 21 page playbook containing over 20 moves, and some weapons&lt;br/&gt;    Three compendium classes&lt;br/&gt;    And a two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
