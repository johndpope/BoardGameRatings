			<description>Horsefeathers is a bluffing-and-betting dice game requiring only twelve 6-sided dice, a dice cup, a handful of tokens, and a box of poker chips in order to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll one die each turn and add it to the dice that are already in the center of the table.  These dice are grouped by number.  When there is one die of a given number (say, one 6), it is referred to as a &amp;quot;single&amp;quot;; when there are two dice of a given number (say, two 3s), they are referred to as a &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;; there can never be three dice (a &amp;quot;triple&amp;quot;) of the same number in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When players roll their die, they conceal it under the dice cup and then declare its value.  If, however, the number rolled would create a triple, then the player must call it something else.  The player must lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other players can challenge the declaration by calling &amp;quot;Horsefeathers.&amp;quot;  If the rolling player was lying, then the challenge is successful and the challenger takes a token from the center of the table; the lying player is out of the round.  If, on the other hand, the rolling player was telling the truth, then the *challenger* is out of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal in each round is to be the last player standing -- that player gets the pot of chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this fashion until the last token is taken.  The current round is finished, payouts are made based on any token discrepancies, and then the chips are counted.  The player with the most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to give it a try, the rules can be found on the game's homepage, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/horsefeathers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/horsefeathers/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
