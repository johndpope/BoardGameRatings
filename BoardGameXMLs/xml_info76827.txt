							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeonmaster&#039;s Index</name>
									
			<description>Subtitle: An index to the D&amp;amp;D Family of books for role playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From forward: In spite of the many years that there have been rules out for playing FANTASY games, there has been no comprehensive index guide to the players in making the best use of the rules. It has always proved to be a most difficult job for Dungeonmaster and Player alike to find all the facts needed to judge their expedition or campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herein compiled is a guide to the Monsters and Magic that make up the world of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons(R) and it's many supplements. References have been set up for all MONSTERS, SPELLS, and MAGICAL ARTIFACTS that play such an important part in the games, also listed are the locations of the many Reference Tables that are contained whithin this family of works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
