			<description>A card game of establishing trade routes between players.&lt;br/&gt;A route is a series of three matching cards : a resource, a population and a trader. Sets can be done alone or with the help of a neighbour, in which case the route is placed between the players and its gains shared.&lt;br/&gt;The gameply is simple, but has a twist : if the first player has too much of an advance on the last, he is eliminated. This ties in with the educative intent of the game, which aims at talking about fair trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
