							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">They Came from the Mall!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;d avoid the Mall when the sales on if I were you &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;ll be a nightmare!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Came from the Mall! is a new adventure that can be used as a standalone adventure or as a sequel for the Tar Pit Zombies adventure included in Dead of Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the town of Chaddlestone was overrun by zombies the first time, everybody thought they would be safe. But the dreaded undead mask has returned and this time it&amp;rsquo;s fallen into the wrong hands! A trip to the Mall takes on a decidedly nightmarish turn when the dead begin to rise! Can you survive the Mall and grab yourself a bargain in the sales?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a complete adventure for the Dead of Night roleplaying game, but is easily convertible to any horror system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
