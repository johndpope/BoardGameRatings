							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Finger Football</name>
									
			<description>Cute little game in which sets consist of a goal, two soccer shoes and two small dodecahedral footballs coloured with half the faces in black and the other half in white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, the shoes fit on the ends of fingers and one player guards the goal, while the other player takes penalty shots with the footballs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With more than one set (different sets may have different coloured strips on the shoes), players can set up two goals and play an actual game of table soccer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
