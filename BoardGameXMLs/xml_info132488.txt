			<description>A cooperative, zoo-themed educational game for children aged 2+ in which they get to know the numbers 1-3 as well as some shapes and colours in a playful way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background story:&lt;br/&gt;Milly, the animal keeper, has lots of work today. She has to deliver the mail to the bear, the two lions and the three elephants, bring them food or paint the animal houses. And Dapdap, the penguin, has escaped from his enclosure and visits all his animal friends. Can you help Milly with her tasks and return Dapdap to his enclosure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 board&lt;br/&gt;- 18 tiles (9x food, 3x flags, 3x paint bucket, 3x letters)&lt;br/&gt;- 16 task tiles&lt;br/&gt;- 1 wooden &amp;quot;Milly, the animal keeper&amp;quot; token&lt;br/&gt;- 1 wooden &amp;quot;Dapdap, the penguin&amp;quot; token&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;For the basic variant, 6 food tiles are removed from the game. 3 food tiles (showing 1 honeypot, 2 pieces of meet, 3 lettuce heads) and flag, paint bucket and letter tiles are put close to the corresponding corners of the board. The task tiles are randomised and stacked face-down. Dapdap is placed on the penguin enclosure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;The start player takes the Milly token and puts it in front of him/herself to show it is his/her turn. He/she draws a task card. If it is a Milly card, he/she gets to help Milly. He/she looks which house (red, yellow or blue roof) Milly is running to and if she is delivering the mail, carrying the paint bucket, a flag, or if she is distributing food. He/she then looks for the correct tile at the board corners and puts it in the corresponding area on the board and gets to keep the task tile as a reward. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Correct&amp;quot; means: matching colour for the paint buckets, matching shape for the flags (shape on the flag has to match the shape of the animal enclosure), matching number for the letters, and matching food (honey for the bear, meat for the lions, lettuce heads for the elephants).&lt;br/&gt;If the tile drawn is a Dapdap card, the active player puts the Dapdap token to the next animal enclosure. Dapdap greets the animals in their language, so the player makes the corresponding sounds. For the correct greeting, they also get to keep the tile.&lt;br/&gt;After completing the task, Milly is given to the next player, whose turn then starts. Incorrectly completed tasks are put at the bottom of the task tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends either when Dapdap has returned to his enclosure or when all items have been distributed (players decide which of the two they prefer). The game is intended to be played cooperatively, without deciding on a winner (but it can be played competitively by counting how many tiles each player has earned).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced variant is played with all the food tiles and the players have to choose the tile showing the same number as food items as there are animals of that type, e.g. if Milly is going to feed the elephants, the player has to pick the food tile that shows three lettuce heads because there are three elephants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
