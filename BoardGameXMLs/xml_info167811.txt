			<description>The Neo Geo X is a handheld video game console manufactured by Tommo Inc., licensed by SNK Playmore and the latest console released as part of the company's Neo Geo brand. Information about the Neo Geo X was first reported in January 2012 and later confirmed in March. It is the first Neo Geo system to be released since the discontinuation of the brand in 2004 and the third Neo Geo handheld device, following the 1999 release of the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which was supported until 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system was released on December 18, 2012 as part of a bundle called the &amp;quot;Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition&amp;quot;, which includes a docking station, an arcade stick, and a bonus game card. The docking station is modelled after the original Neo Geo AES console and is used for charging the handheld as well as connecting it to a television. The arcade stick is a replica of the original Neo Geo AES arcade stick that can be used as a controller when the handheld is connected to a TV through the docking station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features games that were on the original Neo Geo AES/MVS hardware and comes built-in with 20 original Neo Geo games. Additional titles are available on game cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Neo Geo X&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
