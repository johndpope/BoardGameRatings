							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hostile Takeover</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the first section of the book.  This product is part of the Interface Zero setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USING THIS BOOK&lt;br/&gt;Hostile Takeover is divided into two sections: the first is for those intending to be players in an Interface Zero game that uses this text; the second is for the Gamemaster. Though the GM section isn&amp;rsquo;t strictly secret, players probably won&amp;rsquo;t find much of interest here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION HANDBOOK&lt;br/&gt;Membership has its privileges. Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find a guide to Corporate Culture, new Edges, Hindrances and Skills, and a sweet Expense Account, assuming you can keep and maintain your ever-changing relationship with the Corporation itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL&lt;br/&gt;Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find tools and rules suggestions to make your job of running a corporation campaign easier. There is some discussion on what to focus on and what to let run in the background, a system of Trappings to characterize the various corporations that will be involved in the ongoing campaign, a list of the major comgloms of 2088, and Murder in the Boardroom: how to use the Situational Rules from the Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition to describe the big events in a corporation&amp;rsquo;s year. Welcome to a world of high-stakes, winner-takeall power plays, where one wrong move can shatter dreams, legacies, and stock options. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
