							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faery Wedding Reception</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen Luella is ecstatic her son is getting married. The peace treaty she could give or take, but having her son tied to actual responsibility has been her goal for over two years now. She sees him as a good man who only needs a little responsibility to make him a great one. She has known Breena since she was a little girl and has always admired her spirit. She requested Breena as Prince Kheelan&amp;rsquo;s wife from King Orin because she knew she was a woman after her own heart. She sees Breena as a fitting replacement for herself more than she does her own son. She admires Breena&amp;rsquo;s willingness to marry for peace, and despises her son&amp;rsquo;s lack of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
