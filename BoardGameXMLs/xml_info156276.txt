			<description>from the Instruction page:&lt;br/&gt;The printableDM Encounter Manager assists you in tracking combatants (mainly monsters) during battle. By laying out the information you need in a clear and concise format, you can spend more time telling your players what happens, and less time trying to figure out what happened&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's remarks:&lt;br/&gt;After reading David Seah's &amp;quot;Printable CEO&amp;quot; blog, it occurred to me that some of the productivity philosophy he uses could be applied to the process of dungeon mastering. I've been running a fourth edition game for a while, so I took a look at ways I could improve the way I organize my combat forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result is the Printable DM, which aims to help clarify and organize your encounter's monsters so that it's easier to keep track of initiative order, monster health, status effects, who is marking whom, who is bloodied, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
