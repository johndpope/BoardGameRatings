			<description>Animal Freedom Force is a fast-paced race around the world game for 2-5 players that plays in around 15-20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the roles of Animal Rescue Specialists scouring the far corners of the earth for endangered species held in private zoos, often in appalling conditions.  Players must search for rare animals in the regions within each continent and once discovered they must return them to their home continent, to be cared for and released into the wild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using luck, deduction, memory and strategy, the game plays super-fast, as players search for their the precious animals and negotiate for passports that allow passage across international borders, but in doing so, they will often help their opponents find their animals more quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to successfully return all 6 of their animals to their home regions is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
