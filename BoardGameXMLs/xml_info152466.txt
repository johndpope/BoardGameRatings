			<description>The Crypt Crashers have found the pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s tomb and now the adventure begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crypt Crashers is a highly thematic cooperative board game. Players take turns moving their heroes around the tomb to collect clues. If the heroes select the right clues, they will reveal the location of hidden treasure. As the game progresses, mummies begin to awaken and the Eye of Ray symbols are revealed. If four of these symbols show at the same time the tomb will come crashing down. So, players must shift the tiles around to keep the Eye of Ra symbols covered at all costs. Time is running out. More mummies are waking up and huge webs are a foreboding sign of things to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crypt Crashers has nine levels of difficulty and 15 different expeditions. Each expedition introduces new elements to keep the game fresh and the players challenged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
