							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peter Rabbit&#039;s Puzzle Game</name>
									
			<description>A game for younger children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, each player rolls a regular die. The number they roll indicates which part of their Beatrix Potter character card that they can 'assemble'. Unusually for these sort of games, like Beetle, is that you need nine parts to your character. Number 1 represents each corner piece so you will need to roll a 1 four times to assemble each corner of your picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to finish their Peter Rabbit character picture, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
