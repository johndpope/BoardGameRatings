			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 2350 A.D... 274 years after Earth&amp;rsquo;s third world war, which became known as the Holocaust (Estimated Survivors 823,000,000). For many years now, civilization has reconstructed itself at vastly different rates across the entire planet's surface. A few areas grow rapidly, having discovered new substances and scientific elements. Technology thrives with many new concepts including cyber technology, hover propulsion, new medicines, weaponry, space research and even some new types of energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand 80% of the planet remains torn apart from the Holocaust. Having little technology (if any), no medical supplies, weak law enforcement and suffer from the spread of many new diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earth's surface consists of mostly desert, with a few large forested regions, jungles and lakes. The oceans still have huge bodies of water being reduced only 5%, but have been polluted beyond recoverable status. This is not to say that life cannot flourish within the oceans. Some species have adapted very well to the waters strange effects but most cannot survive for an extended period of time. Therefore the life cycles have dramatically increased. As for human involvement, many large underwater Aqua Stations have been built and a few underwater cities have been established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day to day, people in general live their lives as expected. Either starving on the streets or thriving off of another's downfall. Crime rates are through the roof while law enforcement is becoming more erratic with every day that passes. Lethal drugs and disease&amp;rsquo;s spread through communities faster than government corruption but most cities have local hospitals with the proper vaccines readily available, considering that if you still have a wallet or you can make it to the hospital in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transportation consists of hover vehicles and many salvaged pre-holocaust vehicles, at least in the cities. While in the wastelands areas, walking is most common. A few wasteland exceptions drive modified pre-holocaust vehicles, dune-buggies, motorcycles etc....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another great advancement is space research. With all the new technology coming about scientists have discovered new means of propulsion and agricultural growth. This has allowed for many explorations of the Moon, which eventually lead to the colonization of the Moon&amp;rsquo;s surface. Only a few hundred thousand live there but the Moon colony is quite vast, hosting some of mankind&amp;rsquo;s greatest inventions and minds. The moon is accessible to most seeking off world life but the price of getting there is outrageous for any newcomers. This limits the expansion of the colony to a few hundred a year. The colonies main existence is space research/exploration and military space construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
