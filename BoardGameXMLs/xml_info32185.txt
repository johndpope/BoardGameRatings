			<description>A game from the main creative period from Rudi Hoffmann.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a figure (hence the name of the game), made of 4 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;All the tiles are shuffled before game begins and are spread out over the orange squares of the 7 x 7 squares playing zone of the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;After the tiles have been turned up the players try to reunite the complete figure.&lt;br/&gt;Alternately the single tiles are drawn as far as the player chooses vertically or horizontically.&lt;br/&gt;When 2 or more tiles have been reunited, they draw as one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player who has completed his figure first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics are as usual in this period from Hoffmann himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
