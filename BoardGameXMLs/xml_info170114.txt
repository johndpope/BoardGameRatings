							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wushu Open Reloaded</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF Preface:&lt;br/&gt;Preface to the Reloaded edition&lt;br/&gt;I keep telling people that Wushu Open is a primer&lt;br/&gt;to help people write their own games. The reason it&lt;br/&gt;focuses on action is because that&amp;rsquo;s what Dan Bayn (the&lt;br/&gt;creator of Wushu) finds easiest to write. But that once&lt;br/&gt;you scratch the surface there&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot more to it.&lt;br/&gt;Then I go and link them to the Wall of Wushu as it&amp;rsquo;s often&lt;br/&gt;called with some example threads.&lt;br/&gt;Thing is, for a lot of people that doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it, and&lt;br/&gt;my exhortations are probably getting rather stale. So I&lt;br/&gt;decided to do something about it - write a Reloaded&lt;br/&gt;edition of Open with a more general, less combatfocused&lt;br/&gt;tone, and some additional wrinkles to address&lt;br/&gt;the potential shortcomings of Open from certain points of&lt;br/&gt;view.&lt;br/&gt;I hope I manage to achieve that goal&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip;what you will notice is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t renamed&lt;br/&gt;anything. Reason being I like the evocative titles, and&lt;br/&gt;coming up with generic ones is bloody difficult. Plus it&lt;br/&gt;means everyone who knows Open is on the same page&lt;br/&gt;as me with what this all means. If someone wants to&lt;br/&gt;come along later and change the names of things, be my&lt;br/&gt;guest. I won&amp;rsquo;t send the ninjas. Promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
