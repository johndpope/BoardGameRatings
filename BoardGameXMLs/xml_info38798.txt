			<description>Robo Rumble is a card game for up to six players. The cards are used to construct your robot champion, first by setting down a Bot Chassis card, and then by adding on Gears 'n Circuit cards. After the players have constructed their robots, the game board is constructed with another set of cards in a 4x6 rectangular layout. The game from there is movement and fire. The game also used Action Cards and Teleport Cards to give robots combat advantages . The game is played until a player gets at least 20 points, at which time they may call it. 20 points does not assure victory, since the other players get one last turn. After all player have finished with their turns, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
