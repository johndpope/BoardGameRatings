			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Issue of Delving Deeper you will find three different Skill Systems to use in you Labyrinth LordTM and other Basic Edition rpgs. The systems have been designed using existing mechanics so that they will fit seamlessly into your current gaming, offering the least interference and most potential gain, without disrupting the feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the Skill Systems (d6 Skills, Attribute Skills and Percentage Skills) utilize the same set diverse but broad set of Skills (Open, Movement, Athletics, Sleight of Hand, Concentration, Lore, Arcana, Nature, Detection, Streetwise and Persuade). However, Labyrinth Lord's can easily add to or take away from this list, adapting it to their own needs. Each of the three Skill Systems are briefly detailed and include sections focusing on Skill Ranks, Using Skills and the Advantages and Disadvantages of each Skill System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have been looking for a different method of resolving attempted PC actions, you've found it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
