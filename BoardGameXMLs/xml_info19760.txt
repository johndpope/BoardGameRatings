			<description>Clear all nine holes with the fewest number of strokes. Starting at the tee, roll the die to determine how well your shot did.  A good shot will advance you to the next spot on the fairway, while a bad shot puts you in a hazard.  Once on the green, roll the die to determine how many putts to add to your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes pegs for up to four players, a die numbered 1-1-2-2-3-3, and a pencil to keep score.  This game, along with others in Channel Craft's Vintage Game Series, comes in a small tin.  Progress is marked with pegs, which rest in a hole after each move, making it a very portable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
