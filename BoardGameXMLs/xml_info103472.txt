			<description>Power Eleven (パワーイレブン) is a football video game with top-down perspective, published by Hudson Soft for the PC Engine, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no fouls or off-sides. In the case of a draw penalty kicks are shot which decide who the winner is. Before the beginning of the 2nd half of each game there is a short cheerleaders show. At the end of the show their leader gives a message to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players have a number of attributes. These are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run (RUN)&lt;br/&gt;Dribble (DBL)&lt;br/&gt;Kick (KCK)&lt;br/&gt;Technique (TEQ)&lt;br/&gt;Power (POW)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a number for each one which can range from 1 to 10. The higher the number in one attribute the more skilled the player is in that particular area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power attribute refers to the amount of &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; the player begins the game with. During the match this amount is shown in the lower left or right part of the screen for the currently controlled player. When used the player can move faster and strike harder but it also causes the remaining amount to decrease. It is slightly replenished at the beginning of the second half and fully replenished after each match. The total amount of &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; each player can have cannot be changed. Goalkeepers use it automatically when trying to save the ball. The CPU player only ever uses it when shooting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Power Eleven&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
