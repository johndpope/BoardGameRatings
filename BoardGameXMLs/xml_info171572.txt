			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depth is an asymmetric shooter game where one team controls two sharks and the other controls a group of divers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game mode, the humans are attempting to escort an underwater robot back to their dive point after an expedition. Each side begins the game with a set number of respawns shared between their whole team. If either team can get enough kills to run the other out of spawns before the divers reach their objective, that team wins. Between spawns, each team can also purchase upgrades for their character using money earned from kills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
