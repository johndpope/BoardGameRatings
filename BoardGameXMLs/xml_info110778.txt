			<description>Not Under My Roof! is a fast-paced fighting game in which opponents battle their way through a building. Rather than sitting at a table, the cards you play knock your opponent from room to room until somebody is tossed through an exit. Some cards work better if an object like a lamp or TV is in the room with you. You will fight through the building until somebody throws you out and yells NOT UNDER MY ROOF!&lt;br/&gt;(From The Game Crafter page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
