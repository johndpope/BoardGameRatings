			<description>Angry Town: The Super Ultra Violent Children's Card Game For Adults is a Card Game made to simulate Fighting Games.  We give players the opportunity to build up a Meter to make attacks stronger, Chain together incredible combos, and Blast opponents away with the BLAST Attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mayor of Angry Town has caused a massive amount of chaos and anarchy all thoughout the Lovely Town of Angry Town.  However, amidst all of the unrest comes opportunity.  The citizens are now free to realize their dreams, but they need to get some people out of the way, namely the Mayor.  To realize their ambitions they will need the Mayor out of the way, or on their side.  But the Mayor is a tough sell, and many seek an audience with him.  How will the citizenry overcome this obsticle?  The only way to know is to jump in and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angry Town is a 2 Player game that is easy to learn and easy to play.  The game (or Match) is played in 4 Phases: the Attack Phase, Defend Phase, Draw Phase, and the End Phase.  One Player (or Fighter) is always on the Attack and one is always on the Defense and each Fighter will be switching between those Phases throughout the Match.  Fighters will draw 7 cards and use those cards for both attack and defense, and the only way to draw back up to 7 (or enter the Draw Phase) is to declare End Phase one after the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin a Match Players will choose one of 8 Fighters: a Ninja Howler Monkey, a Failed Martial Artist Bum, a Quack Doctor, an Angry Nerd, a Demented Girl Scout, a Baby Mob Boss, a Luchador Rabi, and a Nun, each with their own Ability that gives them a edge over their opponent.  As the game progresses Fighters will build up a Meter that can be used for a CCCCombo Breaker!!!, power up an attack, or fill it all the way up to FINISH the opponent with the BLAST Attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to test out the game then come to our website and download our 2 Fighter Print N Play Demo, and see for yourself what makes Angry Town so livid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 Modes of Play: &amp;quot;Classic Mode&amp;quot; (2 Player head-to-head), &amp;quot;Tag Team Mode&amp;quot; (2 Player head-to-head with 2 or 3 Fighters each), and &amp;quot;Chaos Mode&amp;quot; (a 3-8 Player Battle Royale!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come on in and play!
