							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The DragonSlayer</name>
									
			<description>The DragonSlayer is a free print and play game in which the player must enter seven lairs and slay each the beast that lives there. Each time a beast dies, the player can collect the weapon that the beast had in it's lair. The weapons are humorous and include such things as a double barreled bazooka, a rocket sword, and a tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is very simple. Both the player and the beast have a starting health which is decreased by modified die roll. Depending on your weapon and the beast's strength the damage may be a die roll + 2, a combination of four dice rolled together, or similar modifiers. Each lair and weapon has it's own modifier. Assuming that you survive combat, you're health is automatically reset for the next cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each beast is more difficult to kill than the last (culminating with the dragon in the 7th lair), but each new weapon is more powerful so the player's combat ability increases with the game's difficulty. The game is won by slaying the dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
