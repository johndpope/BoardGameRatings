							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oil Quest: The Game of Energy and Excitement</name>
									
			<description>A game designed for group involvement. The object of the game is to get your drilling rig on the board, drill for oil and if oil is struck, replace the rig with a pump jack. Each time you go around the board you get revenue from each pump jack you own. When all the lease sites are allocated the game ends and the player with the most pump jacks is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra wealth can be gaining control of a whole section of the board. If you land on a square called &amp;quot;Option to Auction&amp;quot; you can place sites up for auction and get a commission for each site auctioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on a Seismic Report he can drill for oil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a thousand games have been produced with hand made wooden pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
