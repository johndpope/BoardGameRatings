							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicago Scene</name>
									
			<description>A variation of Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose to be a different type of Chicago power broker. They can be a union leader, a lawyer, a politician, or the Chairman of the Democratic Party. In addition to buying and selling important Chicago properties and businesses, the players must bargain with each other to receive &amp;quot;Connection Cards&amp;quot; that will enable them to develop their properties. The game seems to try to simulate the raw and sleazy power politics of running Chicago in the immediate aftermath of the first Mayor Daly era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
