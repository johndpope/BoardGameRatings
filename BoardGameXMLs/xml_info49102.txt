							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhialto&#039;s Book of Marvels</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too long have the Dying Earth&amp;rsquo;s arch-magicians labored without a sourcebook to call their own. Now you can fully immerse yourself in the impossibly powerful milieu of the world&amp;rsquo;s most notable denizens. With new rules for competitive play, you can finally prove to your fellow wizards that you are the most quick-witted, fashionable, seductive, and pedantically obstructive of them all !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armed with the information in this invaluable tome (a bargain at treble the price), you can :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     dominate arch-magical politics, mastering the rules, regulations and customs of the Conclave!&lt;br/&gt;     construct elaborate manses, packed to the rafters with rare and expensive artifacts &amp;mdash; then animate them and send them into battle against each other!&lt;br/&gt;     uncover the quirks, secrets and foibles of 22 arch-magical colleagues!&lt;br/&gt;     cast aside wizardly robes to adopt a terrifying new role, as a horrifically mighty archwarrior!&lt;br/&gt;     delve into the forbidden secrets of the lackadaisical and omnipotent sandestins!&lt;br/&gt;     shudder at the slippery visages of your sworn foes, the archveults!&lt;br/&gt;     recoil squeamishly at the very thought of those distressingly female enemies, the witches!&lt;br/&gt;     curse the effrontery of rogue magicians, who reject the solemn majesty of the conclave!&lt;br/&gt;     contemplate schemes to enslave those most dangerous of entities, the gods themselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ignore these deathless pages at your peril. Your fellow players - that is to say, your opponents - doubtless have it already, and are studying up !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
