			<description>Decoder is so quick that you should think of it as a &amp;quot;warm up&amp;quot; game rather than a game to  entertain you for a whole evening. It's simple to play, quick to explain and is a good ice breaker to get everyone into a 'gamesy' mood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes fifteen images and the idea of the game is to guess the phrase depicted by the image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free game here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.amherstlodge.com/dirtycheats/fbg/downloads/games/decoder.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.amherstlodge.com/dirtycheats/fbg/downloads/games/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
