			<description>Tu dors au gaz, released as Qui dort d&amp;icirc;ne in Europe, is a party game to play during a meal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, three cards &amp;mdash; two blue and one red &amp;mdash; are visible to all players. One player takes the role of the master, and when the master does the action named on one of the cards, if the card is blue the first player to do the reaction named on the card wins one point and becomes the new master; if the card is red, the last player to do the reaction loses one point and names another player as the new master. If the master does the action of a blue card three times without any reaction, he wins this card (one point). The first player to earn three points wins the game and doesn't have to do the dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
