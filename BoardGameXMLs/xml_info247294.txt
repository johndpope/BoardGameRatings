			<description>I Am The Fourth Wall is an asymmetrical card game of Lovecrafian, Cthulhu horror set in jiving 1950&amp;rsquo;s suburbia. It focuses on tight teamwork and coordination, careful hand management, and the option to take on high risk/reward strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 4 ways to play, one player or an AI deck, takes on the role of the Wall, one of the many ancient beings hell-bent on driving the world into perpetual madness, seeking to five gates to the nightmare world beyond. They will face oï¬€ against the remaining 1-6 players, who become the Investigators: everyday people such as waitresses, detectives, and street magicians, who know that their only chance to save humanity lies in closing all of the gates, and thus banishing The Wall from their world... for a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wall acts between each of the Investigators&amp;rsquo; turns, using an action point system to hinder the Investigators, summon monsters, or use unique abilities, as they work towards tearing&lt;br/&gt;apart reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Investigators, with their diverse special abilities, use an elegant and streamlined symbol matching mechanic to destroy the nightmares plaguing the streets. Investigators can even draw upon the very essence of madness, gaining a powerful edge at the cost of providing an advantage to the Wall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
