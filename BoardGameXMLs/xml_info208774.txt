							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fitch&#039;s Game of Natural History</name>
									
			<description>This 1887 card game was designed to teach children the names and images of animals. The deck has 40 cards, each with the name and large ink drawing of an animal on top, and four small drawings and animal names underneath, forming sets of five cards to be collected. Each card also bears a number from 1 to 8 to identify the set. This is intended to allow children to call for cards even if they don't yet read well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a &amp;quot;go-fish&amp;quot; mechanism, with five cards initially dealt to each player. Players ask for another animal from another player, get another turn if they are successful, and draw from the top of the deck if they are not. Player collecting the most sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cover of the box notes the patent registration date of Aug. 23rd, 1887 and displays the price of 25 cents. The side of the box declares: &amp;quot;Natural History Made Easy and Amusing: Fun, Wit and Knowledge combined.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
