							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yellowstone Wit</name>
									
			<description>One of a series of Wit trivia games, Yellowstone Wit has 105 cards with questions about Yellowstone.  On the back of each card is a photo of something found in Yellowstone (Lower Falls, Old Faithful, brown bear, Mammoth Hot Springs, big horn sheep, Morning Glory Pool, elk, Castle Geyser, bison, a meadow, geyser, stagecoach and hotel, swan and mud pot) and a point value from 1-10 or 15.  On the front of each card is a trivia question and answer.  In turn, each player is asked a question.  If he gets the question right, they keep the card.  If he gets it wrong, all other players in turn (except the question reader) are given a chance.  If all fail, the card is placed in the so-called &amp;quot;stumper&amp;quot; pile.  After all cards have been asked, the stumper pile is revisited.  Then, all players add up their points and he with the highest points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
