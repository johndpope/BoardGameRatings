							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire Scion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among mortals, the dark, sensuous power of vampires is something to be envied as much as it is to be feared. But while the common folk envy their eternal life and unfading beauty, the more learned are jealous of their powers. In particular, they note how vampires gain a suite of special powers; but at the cost of having almost as many weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampire scions are those who emulate vampires in order to gain greater magical might. They drink blood, but instead of using it to sustain their existence as true vampires do, they instead use that power to augment their already-formidable spellcasting ability. As they become more like the twisted creatures they mimic, vampire scions slowly gain similar powers, but with almost none of the commensurate weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add this five-level Prestige Class to your game today to tap into the power of Vampires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
