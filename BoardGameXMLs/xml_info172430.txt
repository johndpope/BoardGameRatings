							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterball: Team Valkyries Arena â€“ Valhalla</name>
									
			<description>Valhalla Arena is a huge slaughterdome that includes home pits for both of Extraterrestrial Cruise Lines&amp;rsquo; Viking-themed teams: the Valkyries and Ragnarok. The ladies&amp;rsquo; arena, while brighter and cleaner, is both vicious and virtuous. Each Valkyries pit contains several Choosing spaces, which can be used to heal athletes in the Slaughter Box, or kill them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Valhalla is an arena board for Slaughterball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules:&lt;br/&gt;All athletes gain the following skills while in the Valkyries pits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chooser of the Living: While upright on a Choosing Space, take two special actions to remove all the injury tokens (if any) from one athlete in the Slaughter Box. Then, immediately relocate that athlete to any unoccupied Re-Entry space or starting space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chooser of the Slain: While upright on a Choosing Space, take two special actions to kill any one athlete in the Slaughter Box. That athlete is removed from the game. Unless using the optional Lasting Injury rule in League play, the athlete is resuscitated to full health for the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
