			<description>There are four different &amp;quot;patients&amp;quot; which can be put on a dentist's chair. Each one has a wide open mouth. Before the game, some teeth are inserted into the mouth. During the game, players try to pull the teeth with a mirror and other devices. When a player touches the rim of the mouth opening with a tool, the patient (electronically) cries in pain and it is the next player's turn. The player who pulls most teeth during the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
