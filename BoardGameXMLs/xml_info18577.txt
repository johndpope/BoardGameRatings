			<description>From the book cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Card Games For Two offers a feast of card games with something suitable for all the family. From children's favorites such as Old Maid, through classic games like Whist and Rummy, to the exotically named Julepe and Klob, or the fiendishly competitive Bezique or Spite and Malice, this book has something for everyone. There are more than 100 games (including variations), fully described and graded for difficulty. Neither you nor your friends will want to be without a deck of cards again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
