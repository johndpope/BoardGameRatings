							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curse of Enchantia</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Curse of Enchantia is an adventure game created by Core Design and released in 1992 by Virgin Games for DOS and Amiga systems. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enchantia is a fantasy comedy game based on absurd humor, using a point-and-click, icon-based user interface. There are several action-style segments that the player must beat in order to proceed further in the game, but there's no risk of the player's character to die in the game and thus all of them can be repeated again and again until they're completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very unusually for an adventure game, it is devoid of any in-game text, as all of the few short conversation scenes in the game are using a minimalistic system of pictograms in speech bubbles. The player character's communication abilities are limited to only saying &amp;quot;Hi!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Help!&amp;quot; to communicate and even this in very few situations: all hostile characters can't be interacted with at all, as they're either just blocking passage or are attacking immediately.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Curse_of_Enchantia,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
