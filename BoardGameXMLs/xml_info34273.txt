							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island Run: Put Your Feet in the Sand</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Based on the idea of traveling in the Caribbean, this game is targeted to families who might be planning to visit the area, and to cruise ships, hotels, resorts and travel agents looking for a unique item for promotional giveaways. Dubbed 'The game that brings &amp;lsquo;em back!' Island Run is intended to entertain families and encourage first time or repeat visits to the Caribbean tropics.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;With colorful seashells serving as engaging game pieces, the board shows game spaces weaving among the islands of the Caribbean.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include: playing cards, color-coded &amp;ldquo;sand dollar&amp;rdquo; money, instructions (printed on parchment with the feel of a treasure map) and a die for determining moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information about Ink Inc., visit &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.planetink.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.planetink.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
