							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hacker Rat! Card Game</name>
									
			<description>HACKER RAT&lt;br/&gt;This is a strategic hacker-powered version of russian roulette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an hacker RAT and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid blowing up by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the hacking RAT and blowing up computer devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
