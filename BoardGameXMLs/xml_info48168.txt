							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Railway Rivals Map D: New York and Chicago</name>
									
			<description>A map for use with the Railway Rivals game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers the Eastern USA, from Chicago and St. Louis in the West to New York and Washington in the East. The topography makes it a nicely balanced map with open spaces in the West, and hills in the East, although the starting points are all in the East, so beginners who make poor route choices early on could struggle to build a reasonable network through the hills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few special locations used in runs, such as the Southern edge of the map, and a few hexes in Canada. There is also an ability to build and use train ferries around Norfolk News and Newport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
