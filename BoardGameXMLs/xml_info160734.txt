			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protector: Reclaiming the Throne, also known as Protector II is the follow-up to Protector.  The gameplay remains the same, a twist on tower defence where you must defend a path against waves of enemies who seek to travel from one side of the map to the other.  The unit upgrade system has been amended from the first game, and your initial unit choice is now simply mage or warrior, with colour specialisation now chosen via upgrades.  The skill tree has also been enlarged and updated.  There are 22 levels of increasing difficulty to play through, these becoming unlocked as you progress through the game via a world map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
