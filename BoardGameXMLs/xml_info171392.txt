			<description>Vinegar Hill is a low complexity wargame covering the Australian Castle Hill Convict Rebellion of 1804. The game includes an 11x17 map, countersheet, and 3 pages of rules. The game is based on Peter Schutze's Eureka Stockade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has an objective that he or she must meet in order to win - either number of units destroyed or occupying certain hexes. Each counter can move one hex per turn. The combat is a simple system in which the players must roll greater than or equal to the number printed on the counter to achieve a hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
