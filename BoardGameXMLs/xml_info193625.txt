							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vejle-spillet</name>
									
			<description>Monopoly-inspired game about the Danish city of Vejle. The player pieces (small plastic cars) move along the track around the board according to a roll of two D6 dies. Each field of the track corresponds to a local Vejle firm. A player may buy a stock in a firm when ending his or her move on the field corresponding to the firm. Multiple (two) stocks are available for each field/firm. Firms are connected in sets for which the stocks belongs to the same series. Players pay each other when entering fields/firms with no stocks for sale. The players also get stock returns in various conditions. The game runs for a fixed time agreed upon by the players in advance. The player with the most money when time is up wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
