							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Appalachian Trail Game: Backpacking Edition</name>
									
			<description>Create your own adventure on the Appalachian Trail as you hike your way along the nearly 2,200 mile footpath from Georgia to Maine. GEAR, CHANCE, and CHALLENGE Cards define your journey along this Trail's map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 TRAIL MAP - On your turn, move your DIY game piece 1 space (unless the Chance card instructs otherwise) along this waterproof, fold out game board map of the Appalachian Trail. Each space has a color indicating which type of card play occurs: brown, blue, or green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 GEAR Cards - These cards are distributed evenly at the beginning of the game and are visible in front of each player throughout. If you land on a Brown space, you have the option to swap 1 Gear card with the player of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;50 CHANCE Cards - If you land on a Blue space, draw a Chance card and follow its instructions. Encounter opportunities to race ahead, hazards that slow your pace, or choose to stop and enjoy the trail. If you have a Gear card that helps you overcome a Chance card's emergency scenario and the Chance card has a point value, add it to your Trail Journal stack; otherwise, return it to the bottom of the main stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;75 CHALLENGE Cards - Always keep 5 of these cards hidden in your hand, drawing another after one is played. If you land on a Green space, receive a Challenge question from the hand of a player of your choice. Answer Trivia (39 cards) about hiking first aid, Trail history, LEAVE NO TRACE camping and backpacking skills, or identify Animals (27 cards) and Plants (9 cards). If you answer correctly, add this point-having Challenge card to your Trail Journal stack; otherwise, add it to the other player's stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Thru Hike Card - The game ends when the first player takes the 5-point Thru Hike card -- arriving at one of the ends of the Trail. All players then tally the points from their Trail Journal card stacks and the player with the most points is the Winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
