			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everbody knows, how hard it is to create true masterpiece. How much one has to put aside, what price has to be paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What price, exactly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens, when the Creator, genius, puts himself, his soul, his life, into his work? What happens to both &amp;ndash; Creator and his Creation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live in eternity? So sure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those genial artistic freaks, you know. They are jealous, they are insatiable, they are simply up the pole sometimes. And those people literally fuse themselves into what they do, granting life to their creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you expect those masterpieces to act like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about some Frankenstein golem. Words and images, nothing more. Nothing more needed. Nothing more dangerous never existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood.Lines. is a game, where the Creation of a true master rises against its Creator. You, as the players, don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily take sides &amp;ndash; but, as any play is senseless without an audience, that&amp;rsquo;s you, who make things happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood.Lines. is a submission to the Game Chef 2011 contest: Theme &amp;ndash; Shakespeare, ingredients &amp;ndash; Forsworn, Exile,&lt;br/&gt;Nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note:&lt;br/&gt;This mostly free-form narrative has players introduce twists to the story by flipping through poems in a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
