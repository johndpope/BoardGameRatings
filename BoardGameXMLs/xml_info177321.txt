			<description>Cazboin is a card game in which players try to collect as many points a possible. To do so, they draw and play cards that are worth points, including action cards that may affect opponents' points totals. To play a card, players roll a six-sided die to determine which cards they can play, based on a to-play cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game revolves around chance (drawing the best cards), strategy (knowing when to play which action cards), and math (knowing when a certain move is the most effective one to make).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards from a single deck and then play cards from their hands to create their own pile of cards, the Stack. At the end of the game, the total value of the stack is the points total for that player. However, by playing action cards players can exchange cards from their own stack with that of an opponent, thereby getting rid of bad cards or stealing good cards. Interaction with stacks is done by Action cards, which have a negative value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
