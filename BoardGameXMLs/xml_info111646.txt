			<description>It's a race up the mountain!  Beat the other players to various Mont-Royal landmarks.&lt;br/&gt;After rolling 4 dice, a player will choose two dice pairs and advance his coloured tokens along the paths available of the appropriate sums of the pairs.  As soon as one player has advanced their token to the last position along a path, they can claim that landmark and no other player may advance along that path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed and printed to be a give-away for all attendants to the 2011 Montreal 60 second film festival, M60, registration party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
