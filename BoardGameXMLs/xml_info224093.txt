			<description>Illegal winemaking is, in whatever age, the best way to make a fortune in the black market. It is also a crime that the police force is eager to solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now within a closed area, there's secret winemaking activity going on. Meanwhile, the police has found out about the activity and is waiting for the winemakers' arrest. Can the winemakers get away with it? Can they make a big fortune out of it eventually?&lt;br/&gt; In Moonshine Shutdown, players play the winemakers who try to brew as much wine as possible before the police lock down the area. Whoever makes the most wine earns the most points and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
