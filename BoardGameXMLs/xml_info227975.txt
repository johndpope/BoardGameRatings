			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paterson 1913 begins in late January 1913, starting the busy season when manufacturers are dyeing and weaving the silk that will be sold for the new spring fashions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mill workers, who specialize as weavers, ribbon makers, and dyers&amp;rsquo; helpers, have different grievances and different demands. However, they are exploring a united effort to improve labor conditions for all.  They know that a successful strike will bring the manufacturers to the table for negotiations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some workers have called in the national revolutionary movement, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), to organize and guide the strike effort.  The IWW seeks a general strike; that is, a complete shut down of all the factories in the silk industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended for collegiate-level academic use in a controlled setting; scoring (&amp;quot;grading&amp;quot;) mechanics are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
