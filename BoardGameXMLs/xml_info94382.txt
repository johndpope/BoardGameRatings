			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Man is a PC title in the franchise developed by Hi Tech Expressions. The game pits Mega Man against an evil computer designed by Dr. Wily. Crorq, the computer, has deployed three Robot Masters to cause mayhem, and Mega Man must track them down to get the keys to Dr. Wily&amp;rsquo;s Core Room. Hi Tech Expressions received permission from Capcom to develop this title, but completed the game independently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other titles in the franchise, Mega Man is a side-scrolling platform game. Upon defeating a robot master, Mega Man absorbs their weapon power as a new ability. There are three robot masters in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Dyna Man&lt;br/&gt;- Sonic Man&lt;br/&gt;- Volt Man&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
