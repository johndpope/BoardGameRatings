			<description>There are cards of three values - &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;three&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Three&amp;quot; is the strongest card and it trumps the other cards, and &amp;quot;two&amp;quot; card trumps only &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; card. It is clear for a while. Then the game is some more difficult. There are cards of seven colours or suits. Each colour is a one of magic branches, and each card is a witchcraft. Players fighting each other by casting spells and trying to repulse opponent's spells. You may repulse spells by head trick of the same magic school spell than the attacking one, or by any card of the opposit magic school (trump card). The cards of each colour are the trumps for cards of two other colours. To avoid getting entangled, on each card there are special symbols marking colours for which this card is a trump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has beaten off his opponents, he may take a turn. Played cards are putting to discard pile. In the other case player take cards to his hand and missing his turn. A game is going on until all players excepting the last player, staying without cards in their hands. The looser is announcing as Not very Smart Magician's Apprentice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
