							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winter Olympics VCR Game</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the Winter Olympics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have become an Olympic athlete! Compete in nine different events to score points and win medals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a board, videotape, cards, plastic medals, and pawns. On your turn you watch a 10-15 second random video clip of one of the nine events. At the end of the clip is a section with rapidly changing point values. You then pause the VCR and score whatever points are shown, double them if the space on the board you are on matches the event you just watched. You will then be given the number of spaces to move your token on the board which represents a mountain with three different ski trails down it and ski lifts back up. You can begin to collect medals by accumulating 500 points in a certain event and then landing on a special space for that event to collect the next medal. The first to do this in each event gets the gold for that event, the next the silver, and so on. There are also spaces on the board that can set you back or have you draw a card. The cards can add to your score, set you back or be a lift ticket, which entitles you to move back up the board at any time. After all nine gold medals have been won the game is over and the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great game for the whole family and the replayability of this game is very high. Even after going through the tape many times each game is still unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to win the gold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
