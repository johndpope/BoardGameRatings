			<description>Forgotten Floof is a competitive resource management and civilization building card game for 2-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast out by man in the wake of internet pug memes, nyan cats and doge, the once beloved (but now forgotten) guinea pigs of the world must look to build a new future for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts as leader of a faction of 30 outcast guinea pigs all looking for a home. Your aim is to end the game with the most sheltered guinea pigs, hence becoming the most prosperous tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To build shelters, players require resources. At the start of each round a number of resources are played to the centre of the table. Players mark the ones they wish to claim using their 3 action tokens and subsequently compete over them using their guinea pigs. The strongest guinea pig takes the spoils whilst the others are sent to the graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resources such as wood, rope, cloth and stone can be traded in to construct buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of building allows the player to provide shelter for a number of their guinea pigs. Additionally, hospitals allow you to revive those injured in battle, prisons can be used to capture enemy guinea pigs, mines generate free resources each round and temples award powerful miracle cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round players will see a number of their homeless guinea pigs succumb to a terrible catastrophe such as a comet strike, or being eaten by a fat cat - only those safely sheltered inside a building are safe. Eventually when there are no more homeless guinea pigs the game is over and only the player with the most sheltered floof will be declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
