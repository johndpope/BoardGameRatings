							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Random Encounters for on the Road or in the Wilderness (PFRPG)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether on the road or travelling through the wilderness, characters can encounter other people, creatures and oddities. Some may be friendly or helpful, some may be hostile or dangerous and some may simply be strange. Some could be used as ideas for side treks or adventures. Rather than glossing over treks between places, this list can be used to add random events to the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party finds an old tree stump. Carved into the top of it is a riddle that reads I am gone, but beneath my pining widow lies a treasure great. A DC 15 Knowledge (nature) check reveals this tree was once a twin pine, and there is another like it growing nearby. A DC 15 Survival check allows the party to narrow down the other pine trees nearby, selecting the one they want. Digging beneath the trees roots reveals a cache of coins (200 gp for each party member), as well as a faintly magical wondrous item for each member (+1 amulet of natural armor, +1 ring of protection, +1 amulet of mighty fists, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter and one the Open Game License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a system neutral version. The latter is a bit shorter and doesn't have the Pathfinder stats for some items. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
