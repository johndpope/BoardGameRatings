			<description>(from the introduction:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monitor vs Merrimack: the Battle of Hampton Roads is a simple two-player game of strategy based on the historic battle between the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia (also known as the Merrimack).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with rules and counters, no map. A standard 8 by 8&lt;br/&gt;checkerboard and a deck of cards are needed. The two ships are set up on the board, with edge squares representing shallow water. US moves and fires, then the CSA. Movement points are determined by card draws referenced against a different table for each ship, as are shots. Damage is accumulated except for Special Damage results which can lead to a Critical Hit table. Ramming can be attempted by the Merrimack while the Monitor can safely enter shallow water. Game is a draw if neither&lt;br/&gt;is sunk after 18 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
