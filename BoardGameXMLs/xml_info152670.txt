							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Periphery</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peripheral Developments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many of the major realms in the Periphery, the Jihad was just as devastating as it was to the Great Houses and Clans of the Inner Sphere. But as the tide began to turn against the Word of Blake, the fanatics withdrew from most of these fringe worlds first, leaving behind technology and techniques that further fanned the flames of technological recovery. Scrambling to rebuild, the industries of the Periphery have almost reached technological parity with the larger Inner Sphere states, and new weapons and techniques are appearing even among these disparate, often-overlooked realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Technical Readout: Periphery samples the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of the scattered realms of the local Periphery. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake winds toward its final conclusion. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;have yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
