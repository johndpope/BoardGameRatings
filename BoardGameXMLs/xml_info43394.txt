			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's been a rebellion on Earth's moon base! Starships have been scrambled by both factions in order to regain control. Your mission, destroy the enemy base ships and fighters; and, take control of the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when your enemy is either completely destroyed or unable to continue the attack. If neither side is able to attack, the player occupying the moon base wins. Should neither player occupy the moon base while both players are unable to attack, the winner shall be determined by the points awarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No dice!&lt;br/&gt;No spinners!&lt;br/&gt;Your skill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 tear-off trasparencies, game board, Moon-scape lunar playing field, 2 sets of 4 translucent playing cards (3 starships and 1 minefiled in each set), 3 felt tip markers (black, red, and green).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
