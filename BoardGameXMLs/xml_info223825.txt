			<description>Here is the football match Poland v Germany. Quite small size but has very high rank! The table becomes a stadium, cards&amp;mdash;turf and players&amp;mdash;team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piłka w grze is a simple pattern recognition game combined with very simple soccer match simulation. The game consists of deck of large cards with images associated with football and wooden ball token. Five of these cards laid on a table produce small board&amp;mdash;football pitch&amp;mdash;combined of five spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to score three goals. In order to score a goal the player have to move the ball to the utmost space in front of his or her opponent and win the decisive duel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To move a ball or win a duel players compete, one trying to identify pairs of common symbols faster than their adversary. Ball may be moved from its space to adjacent one only if a player recognizes and names the only image, which these two spaces have in common. Before each move new card is played on board, putting new symbols in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever scores third goal, wins the game. Teams may also determine that the game lasts until one team reaches a different, mutually agreed outcome or score more goals in the allotted time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
