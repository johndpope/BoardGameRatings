							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Waterloo: Hougoumont (1815 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Napoleon's stunning comeback from exile faced its great test when his French army fought the British near Waterloo in Belgium. The British line was anchored on the right at the walled farm known as Hougoumont.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The French started the battle with an attack on the farm designed to draw British reserves away from the center, where the main French attack was planned . . . Wellington, the British commander, credited the defense of Hougoumont with being the key to the victory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an alternative, free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Print-and-play walls are also available for use to recreate the boundaries of the farmhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules encompass ranged and melee combat, morale, charges, reserves, and breaking down doors and gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
