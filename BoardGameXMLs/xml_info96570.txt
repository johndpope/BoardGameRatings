							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buzz!: Mozak Hrvatske</name>
									
			<description>Buzz!: Brain of... is the eighth title in the Buzz! series of quiz video games. The game has 21 regional variations with the game's title being changed depending upon region, but the basic concept behind the game remains the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions in Buzz!: Mozak Hrvatske are specifically about Croatian general knowledge: Wildlife, TV, Sport, and so on. The versions of the game for other countries follow the same pattern except for being slanted towards general knowledge with a connection to that specific country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation 3 version of the game will feature online play and will also allow access to user created questions on the My Buzz! site as well as leaderboards that rank online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Buzz!: Brain of the World&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
