			<description>Pedigree - A Genealogy Game is a deduction game similar to Clue with an LDS religious theme and simplified rules for children. Players are looking for a missing genealogical record by identifying the name of the person, the type of record, and the building it is located in (a random card of each type is hidden under the board while the others are dealt evenly to the players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a spinner instead of dice and players guess if they will spin a high or low number before they can take their turn. As players move about the board, they question each other to determine which cards are under the board. The first person to do so is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
