			<description>Each round, players are dealt five cards that have a number on them.  They then take turns rolling the two dice.  If they roll a number that is on one of their cards, they turn that card over and collect the bets that are on it.  If they do not have the number rolled, the next person in clockwise order that does have that number gets to turn their card over and continue the turn.  When a 7 is rolled, the player antes another chip into the pot and hands the dice over to the next player.  The person with the most chips after three rounds of play is the winner. The board is covered with a fuzzy felt-like material.  It helps keep the cards in place when people are rolling the dice on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
