			<description>Players take turns drawing a card from a deck of 120 cards of Single and Double Water Balloons, Squirt Guns, Water Hose, Kiddie Pool and Treehouses. After drawing a card, the player may throw the Water Balloon(s) at another player or use the Squirtguns; place a Kiddie Pool or Treehouse in front of them to protect them; use a hose to get rid of a Kiddie Pool or Treehouse; or discard the card if it cannot be played. Once a player has been &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo; by 10 Water Balloons or Squirt Guns, they are out. The last player standing is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game instructions include 2-player and Strategic Play variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
