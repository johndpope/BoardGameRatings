							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pegs in the Park</name>
									
			<description>From the insert inside the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come take a fun visit to the Park with some happy, lovable little Pegs as they race and jump from hole to hole along the colorful tracks in the Park.  If you beat the other Pegs to the Ice Cream Car, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pegs in the Park includes a cheerful deck of 44 cards depicting the many happy sights and activities you will see in an eventful day at the Park.  But look out!  The stormy rain clouds or some hungry ants would like to ruin the Pegs day in the park and keep your Peg from reaching the Ice Cream Cart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pegs in the Park is both great fun and educational.  The lovable little Pegs will delight young players.  This child's board game goes beyond entertaining and challenges the youngster in an exciting learning adventure.  The young player will have opportunities to practice counting, learn the concept of forward and backward, come to understand plus (+) and minus (-) along with developing small motor skills and hand-eye coordination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
