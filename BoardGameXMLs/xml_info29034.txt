							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder of a Millionaire</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your 'traditional' murder-mystery, but run in not-so-traditional way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invite your guests to the will reading of the late Rick Rochester, a man worth millions.  Watch as they compete to see who can win the inheritance by searching out his killer, an individual that is destined to strike again at the party. Did the butler do it? Or is it the blackmailing sister who seems to be spending a fortune she hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet inherited?  There is always the jealous ex-wife who was left 20 years ago and may still have vengeance in her heart. Or could it be the gold-digging son-in-law that wants not only the millionaire's daughter, but his fortune as well. It is up to you and your guests to see if the murderer will be found guilty or go free...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The package includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Host Guide &amp;mdash; A complete how-to of throwing your party which includes directions on preparing the invitations, assigning characters and preparing for the party.&lt;br/&gt;     A Schedule of the Night &amp;mdash; A step-by-step breakdown of how the night will go.&lt;br/&gt;     An Introduction &amp;mdash; to be read to the guests upon arrival.&lt;br/&gt;     Designed Invitations &amp;mdash; that you can customize with the details of your party.&lt;br/&gt;     A Copy of a Memorium to Rick Rochester &amp;mdash; including background information on the deceased and the guest list.&lt;br/&gt;     18 Character Sheets&amp;mdash; full descriptions of the characters, including costuming and acting tips.&lt;br/&gt;     18 Character Objective Sheets&amp;mdash; this includes objectives for each character to try to achieve at each stage of the game in order to uncover evidence and find the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;     18 Name Tags&lt;br/&gt;     Fake Money&amp;mdash; to be distributed to guests and used in the party for scheming and bribery.&lt;br/&gt;     Evidence &amp;mdash; more clues that will be presented towards the end of the night. This evidence will help your guests solve the mystery and find the murderer.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;ldquo;Who Dunnit&amp;rdquo; Cards &amp;mdash; to allow your guests to guess the murderer, along with vote for the most animated character and best outfit.&lt;br/&gt;     Award Certificates &amp;mdash; to be awarded to the best costume, the most theatrical, the player with the most money at the end of the night and to each of the guests that solve the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FORMATTED FOR 10-18 GUESTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nightofmystery.com/Murder_of_a_Millionaire.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nightofmystery.com/Murder_of_a_Millionaire.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
