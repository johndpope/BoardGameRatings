			<description>Book Intro:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a Chronicles of Ramlar player, you&amp;rsquo;ve already discovered what a rich world Eranon is. (If you aren&amp;rsquo;t. . . why, order the Core Rules as soon as you can!) A big part of that uniqueness is the cast of personalities in the world. The blend of prominent figures covered virtually every walk of life and abilities. It is all&lt;br/&gt;too possible for an adventuring party to negotiate with the likes of the notorious buccaneer Jame Dupree one week, find themselves at the court of the Kasmarkn King Kalldur Talmount the next, and turning back&lt;br/&gt;great evil alongside the archmage Istolil Hune the one after. . . Or go off on any tangent that can put the adventurers face-to-face with any number of the myriad colorful characters. Will they be allies? Will they&lt;br/&gt;be adversaries?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is one question this book for the Chronicles of Ramlar RPG will answer, as most major personalities mentioned in not only the Core Rules, but the Redemption Trilogy of novels too, are included. Their history, appearance, disposition, likes, dislikes, motivations and more are now an open book for you to read, and to decide whether their agendas will bring them in allegiance or conflict with the player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following these entries is an expanded bestiary listing more than 30 creatures to beef up your Ramlar game. Several of the old favorites such as the troll and werewolf have been given a unique Ramlar twist, so&lt;br/&gt;they aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly the same ole monsters you know. This, on top of exotic new beasties like the aquandix, shree&amp;rsquo;oc, and slerass, should present new challenges to the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, we wrap up the book with brief guidelines for creating animal allies, plus statistics for both common animals and those found only on Eranon. Merthwargs will sure find this section interesting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now then, start unraveling the mystery behind each mover-and-shaker of the world, and reveal. . . will they be allies, or adversaries?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
