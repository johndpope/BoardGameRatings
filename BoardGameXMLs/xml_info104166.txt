			<description>From the back of the gamebox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beach Life is a business management sim in the same vein as Theme Park and Rollercoaster Tycoon, to which it has been compared. The twist is that the player manages an Ibiza-style holiday resort, complete with themed clubs and holiday reps. Through learning what their guests want from their stay, different kinds of attractions and food and drink establishments can be built to satisfy their needs and make more money. Staff can be hired to help facilitate this, such as cleaners, mechanics and security guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay options themselves come in two forms: &amp;quot;The Scenario mode&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Sandbox mode&amp;quot;. In Scenario mode, the player works their way through island after island, completing a number of set objectives in each. Their progress on a resort can be hampered by hazards such as shark attacks and thunderstorms, all while they build attractions and cater to the needs of the guests. Once they have beaten a level in Scenario mode, they can unlock it in Sandbox mode. Sandbox mode is essentially a &amp;quot;free-play&amp;quot; mode, where there are no objectives, unlimited time and more building options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
