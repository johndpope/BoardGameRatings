			<description>There are two teams (explorers and native africans). Each team has 16 chips. The chips are moved by flicking them with a small disk from one area of the game board to another. The players start in their own camp and try to get their chips into the opponent's camp. Chips which are flicked beyond the board are eliminated from the game, same as chips which are hit by opponent chips. Some areas of the board and some chips have special meanings which are explained in the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when one team can't move any chips. The team with the most points (for reaching the opponent's camp, crossing the river and chips left on the board) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an early Swiss merchandizing product of the 1940s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
