			<description>The protagonist, &amp;quot;Me&amp;quot;, lives on the outskirts of the city of Ishana with her little sister in idyllic peace. However, that peace is shattered when &amp;quot;Me&amp;rsquo;s&amp;quot; sister disappears without a trace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As panic begins to take a hold, &amp;quot;Me&amp;quot; starts running through increasingly more horrible scenarios in her mind: was she kidnapped? Or is her father, who performed dangerous experiments on his wife and eldest daughter, somehow behind it all? Rushing to her father&amp;rsquo;s workshop only served to confirm her fears, as the same strange azure light that appeared when her mother died was leaking once again through the cracks of the door...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xblaze%3A_Lost_Memories Xblaze: Lost Memories]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
