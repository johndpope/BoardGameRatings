							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Terror of the Machine</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For almost a year now the city of Majentic has lived in a colossal shadow. A mountain sized machine has descended upon the city in middle of a religious festival, slaughtering dozens before returning to its inscrutable slumber. Every few weeks, the machine wakes again, wreaking havoc on the city. The esteemed governor, Lordan Ironwolf, has issued a call for heroes, knaves, and mercenaries willing to put their lives on the line for a reward beyond imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dungeon crawling adventure, for a party of level 8-10, ramps the difficulty up to eleven! No room or encounter is what it seems, and they all require thought, luck, and guts. The Terror of the Machine is built in a modular way, so not only can you mix and match which challenges the players will face, but each challenge is itself presented with several options for modifications, as only the DM knows best what their players would enjoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
