							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystery Case Files: 13th Skull</name>
									
			<description>Shortly after moving into a mansion in Louisiana, tragedy befalls Sara Lawson and her daughter after her husband, Marcus Lawson, mysteriously disappears. Sara contacts you, the Detective, to search for her husband and discover the secret of the 13th Skull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before Marcus was kidnapped, he became obsessed with the curse and the treasure after finding a map of the estate. His daughter Magnolia believes her father was kidnapped by the ghost of a vengeful pirate named Captain Crown, seeking to protect his lost fortune and stop those who try finding it. With the locals all talking about the curse of the 13th Skull and their belief that Crown lived and buried his treasure in the mansion, Sara despairs of finding her husband.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysterious strangers around the town and swamp share valuable information. The Detective must look for skulls, map pieces, cannons and other clues, both hidden-object and logic, in order to solve the mystery. The Collector's Edition includes extra plot twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mystery Case Files: 13th Skull&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
