							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>Local law enforcement is locking up any adventurers around town because they fear an outsider is raising the dead, but when a crazed, undead ogre rampages around town, it falls to the bravest heroes to stop it, to find out who's really behind it, and why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad Alchemy is a short story about intrigue and familial love for characters levels 1 - 4. It is designed as a side adventure you can tell in one night while characters travel from point A to point B. It takes place in the fictional town of Larkin that can be put anywhere along the character's path to give them a place to rest, recuperate, and have a little fun before they return to pursuing the big bad guy. It focuses on telling a good story, but has ample opportunity for combat and role-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
