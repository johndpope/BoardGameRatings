							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bootleggers: Smuggling Run</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bootleggers is about a gang of criminals smuggling alcohol during prohibition in Seattle, Washington in 1930. Roy Olmstead, the so-called &amp;ldquo;good bootlegger&amp;rdquo; and ex-cop, runs 90% of the city&amp;rsquo;s illegal alcohol business and has bribed almost every police officer and city official to support his operation. The remaining scraps of booze trafficking, still worth a small fortune, are fought over by independent operators like you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first set, Bootleggers: Smuggling Run, covers your gang through their first six levels as they establish a reputation as daredevil smugglers supplying the speakeasies of the Emerald City. The follow-up set, Bootleggers: Turf War (coming soon) covers levels seven through twelve as the gang sets up their territory and runs their own smuggling fleets, speakeasies, and stills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is released under a Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share-Alike license (CC-BY-NC_SA) so you can use it as the basis of your own free RPG hacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
