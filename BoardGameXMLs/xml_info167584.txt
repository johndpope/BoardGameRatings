							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hel Rising</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rough mountainous region of Ormr, the earth groans, turned this way and that by forces beyond understanding. The tremors send shock waves across the Nine Worlds, jolting the local kingdom of Eucia terribly. People, high and low, turn to their King, as is their right. But King Hrolfr is in the dark, as are his seers; so he must look beyond his wooden halls, calling to the stalwart heroes of his realm, brave adventurers to venture forth in his name and conquer the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little does the King know that the quakes are brought about by a menace sent from the dismal world of Helheimr far below. Raiders carried by dark longships on ghastly winds have come with evil intent, but their goal here goes deeper than anyone could possibly imagine. The adventurers must search out what is going on in the kingdom of Eucia, but to do that, they'll find more than they ever bargained for, because Hel has her fingers planted deep in the roots of all things. Before they can end the quakes they'll see this and so very much more . . . or die in the trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
