							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shell Out</name>
									
			<description>The game is played on a hexagon board composed of 6 blue triangle fields known as Playing Fields. The Playing Fields are divided by rows of red playing spots running toward the center of the board known as Alleys. These Alleys may be traveled from one end to another in a single move if desired. In each game there are 30 shells divided into groups of 5, each group has a different  color. There are also 6 counters numbered 5,10,15,20,25 and 50. At the beginning each player draws a counter, looks at it and then places it beneath one of his shells so that no opponent knows under which shell the counter is.  . The object of the game is to move a shell into the SHELL OUT area of an opponent. You may attempt to capture a shell of your opponent. If you are next to a opponents shell you simply jump on it. Most shells have nothing under them and simply result in your losing your shell. If you find the shell with the scoring marker under it you score it. The hand is over when someone moves a loaded shell unto the opponents SHELL OUT area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
