			<description>The Menacer 6-game cartridge was the title Sega bundled with the Menacer for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. As the name suggests, the cartridge contains six games that require the Menacer to play. Comparable to Wii Play, the games mostly aid the player in the process of learning how to use the controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All games were conceptualized by Mac Senour, the producer for both the hardware and the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontline : A rail shooter where players engage in combat with enemy vehicles in the desert (probably a reference to Operation Desert Storm).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pest control! : A shooting game where players defend a pizza from insects while in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! , tomato shooter with ToeJam and Earl in which players assume the role of ToeJam who is shooting tomatoes at many of the enemies from ToeJam and Earl, including boogeymen, mad dentists, and even a batallion of chickens who use a tomato cannon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rockman's Zone: another rail shooter which players shoot at cutouts of criminals while trying to avoid shooting cutouts of innocent civilians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Station Defender: a sci-fi shooter where players fight against extraterrestrial aliens which appear in pods. This game is notable for allowing players to select whether they want to play the game using a fixed pattern or a pattern where the aliens appear randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whackball! : The only game in the Menacer 6-game cartridge where shooting is not involved. Instead, the player uses the menacer as a mouse to strike a ball in an attempt to change the color of the tiles before time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Menacer 6-game cartridge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
