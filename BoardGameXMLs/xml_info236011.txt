			<description>Have you ever hooked up with someone within an hour of meeting them, or blacked out before 9 p.m. because you were too drunk?&lt;br/&gt; Unlike most of the party games you have played, THIS ONE TIME, I... provides an explicit, hilarious opportunity for friends to relive their funny, dirty and downright crazy life experiences. We have probed deep into the dirty pasts of people to compile hundreds of ludicrous life choices that we can all relate to.&lt;br/&gt; The game is played with Confession Cards, which are examples of ludicrous life choices, and Rule Cards which tell you how to play each round - that make it easy and fun to learn who&amp;rsquo;s the craziest, dirtiest, wildest friend of the group!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, a player selects a Red Rule Card from the top of the pile, reads the instructions aloud and must then do as the Rule Card says.&lt;br/&gt; If you are guilty of an act detailed by a Blue Confession Card given to you, you must add it to your losing pile (face up) in front of you until the end of the game, so that everyone can enjoy reliving your bad decisions. If you are not guilty of a Confession Card, you must scrap it.&lt;br/&gt; The first player to have 10 Confession Cards in their losing pile loses the game. There are no winners in this game, only losers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
