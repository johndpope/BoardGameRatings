							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slimeling</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The slimeling is a class focused in developing the abilities you would expect from a creature of its nature. Slimelings are highly resilient; they can take a great deal of damage on par with a fighter and they are immune to diseases and poisons. Slimelings are also good at squeezing through tight spots, seeing in the dark, storing items inside their bodies, don&amp;rsquo;t require to sleep or breathe, making them ideal for underground adventuring. Depending on your background choice, you could be a competent defender, dungeon infiltrator, or have a move connecting you with a more civilized past. As you progress in levels you will be able to steal items from creatures as you hit them, stick to them like glue, crawl on walls and ceilings, consume your enemies as delicious treats, hide in plain sight, stalk your enemies from above, and serve as food to your comrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 19 page playbook containing over 20 moves, new magic items, and GM section with stats for some ooze monsters and a simple mechanic on how to handle diseases in DW&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
