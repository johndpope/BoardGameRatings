			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase. Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curious Case is a generative crime story game set in the Roaring Twenties of Berlin. As a chief inspector of the homicide department, the player's goal is to solve numerous murder cases. The gameplay consists of investigating crime scenes, interrogating people, combining clues and traveling to various locations all across Berlin to eventually find enough evidence to identify and convict the murderer in a trial at court. Each crime case is taking place in Berlin during the time of the first German democracy. The political system has broken apart and on the streets armed forces of extremist left and right wing parties fight for superiority. The third largest city of the world is caught in between existential angst and the buzzing lights of the night. In the center of this intense and varied setting the player seeks to uncover a hidden web of entanglements and crimes. Taking a strong influence from David Lynch&amp;rsquo;s Twin Peaks, the player's experience is riddled with mysterious characters and subtle supernatural happenings that infuse each crime case with a dark and in some places almost surreal tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Presskit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
