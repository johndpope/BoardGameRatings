			<description>Translated from the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Am I ambitious, spontaneous, shy, or even gut-centric? Of course I am! ...somehow ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But do the others think similar about me?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychometer has the final answers for these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose from 560 attributes. Three randomly drawn cards are placed side by side. Arrows on the outer cards will point on two attributes on the center card. The player whose turn it is chooses one of these attributes and asks the other players how they rate himself in regard of this attribute (like: &amp;quot;I am funny&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I make friends easily&amp;quot;). All players (including the active player) secretly rate how much they think that the chosen attribute is correct. The players have numbered cards from 1 to 3 (4, 5 - depending on the number of players) which they play face-down. All cards are then flipped face-up. The numbers are added up, the sum is looked up in a table which will tell which number will grant its player a point. The more the player's ratings are off, the fewer players (if any) will score points. Then it is the next player's turn. Whoever scores eight/ten/twelve points first (depending on the number of players) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;28 attribute cards (560 attributes)&lt;br/&gt;30 scoring cards&lt;br/&gt;2 cards with scoring tables (depending on the number of players)&lt;br/&gt;30 scoring tokens&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
