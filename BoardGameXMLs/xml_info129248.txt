							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Charlaine Harris: Dying for Daylight</name>
									
			<description>Charlaine Harris: Dying For Daylight is a single player interactive adventure with both point and click puzzle solving with hidden object elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a world where vampires live openly amongst humankind. It starts with Dahlia being tasked by an older vampire to investigate an incident in New Orleans where a vampire crashed a wedding party in broad daylight. The only way a vampire can exist in daylight is if they have the mythical sun potion. Dahlia goes to New Orleans only to find that she's not the only one interested. Other vampires are already on the trail and the vampire wars have begun. Despite the vampire wars featuring early in the story there is no fighting in this game at all, it's point and click all the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four episodes to the game and as the player moves through them solving puzzles they collect trophies and achievement cards. There is a built in hint system which assists with both the puzzle and the hidden-object elements and when the player encounters something new the game displays a tutorial window explaining the new feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played entirely with the mouse and automatically saves the players progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
