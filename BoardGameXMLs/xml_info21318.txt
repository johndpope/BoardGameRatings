			<description>Each player owns a farm.  The goal of each player is to expand their farms after making money at the hog auction.  To do this, farmers must buy pigs one round and sell them when they get back to the auction.  On the way back to the auction the market could fall and a farmer could lose money or a natural disaster could hit a player's farm an he could lose a barn.  There are all kinds of questions that each farmer must ask him/herself during game play.  How much should I bid on pigs?  Should I buy insurance risk it?  Can I afford to expand my farm right now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
