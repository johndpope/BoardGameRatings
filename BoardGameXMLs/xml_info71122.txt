			<description>&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lunar: The Silver Star (ルナ~サ・シルバースター)  is a role-playing video game developed by Game Arts and Studio Alex for the Sega CD console. Originally released in Japan on June 16, 1992 to critical acclaim, the game was translated and released in English by Working Designs the following year. Designed as a &amp;quot;different kind of RPG&amp;quot;,  Lunar: The Silver Star made use of the up-and-coming disc format by featuring CD-quality audio, video playback, and voice acting to narrate a fantasy  story set in a magical world. As the number one selling Sega CD title in Japan, the game sold nearly as many copies as the system itself, and remains the second highest-selling Sega CD title of all time.  The first game in the Lunar series, it set the standard for other follow-up titles, and was followed by a direct sequel, Lunar: Eternal Blue in 1994.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centers on the exploits of Alex, a young boy from a small town who dreams of one day becoming a great hero like his idol, Dragonmaster Dyne. When a childish adventure later turns to discovering an ancient dragon, Alex and his friends must journey across the world to gather the necessary power to become the next Dragonmaster, and save the world in the process. Since the game's original release, three enhanced remakes have been produced for various systems: Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete in 1996, Lunar Legend in 2002, and Lunar: Silver Star Harmony in 2009&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Lunar:_The_Silver_Star,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
