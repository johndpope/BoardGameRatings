			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Smelly Seth?&lt;br/&gt;Smelly Seth is a fast paced and easy to learn card game. Your goal is to get the other players to &amp;ldquo;+11 Smell&amp;rdquo; and knock them out of the game. It&amp;rsquo;s great for warming up gaming night or at your local watering hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many friends can I play with and how long is an average game?&lt;br/&gt;You can play with 2-4 people, but 3-4 is best. An average game lasts between 15-20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do I play?&lt;br/&gt;Every player starts with 3 cards. Each turn you will draw a card and then play  a card.  There are 3 types of cards: smell, clean and action. Smell cards can only be played on your opponents and clean cards on yourself. Action cards provide a fun turn of events in your favor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
