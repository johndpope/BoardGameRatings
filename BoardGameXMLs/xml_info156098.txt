			<description>A quick paced game where players are seated around a battery powered electronic timer device. They collectively decide how many rounds to play (the rules don't specify a number). A reader then picks a card from the category deck and reads a category of things that the players must all name. Repeating a thing already named means you are out. The reader is final arbiter of disputes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device has a color for each player and once the reader presses the start button, it randomly flashes a color (lighting up their light and playing tense, accelerating music). That player has a few seconds to name something from the chosen category. The time shortens as play progresses. If the player can't name something before the timer flashes the next light that player is out. Once someone is out they press their assigned button and the timer stops. The reader gives the player who just went out the category card. A new round then starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the predetermined number of rounds are completed, the player with the fewest cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
