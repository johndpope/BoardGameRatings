							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flop Rocket</name>
									
			<description>Flop Rocket is a physics-based space-cave flight-simulator evasion-arcade RPG (totally a real genre). It's what you'd get by smashing Flappy Bird and Asteroids together, only WAY better than that sounds. Pilot your way through a massive cave system in hopes of making it to space, all the while blasting Space Ducks, nuking Space Worms, avoiding Space Stalactites and Stalagmites (sensing a theme here?). Upgrade the crap out of your rocket to become the most badass space-cave rocket-pilot there ever was!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest update includes full BscotchID integration and cross-game Perks, along with eight completely new ship upgrade tracks (including an auto-cannon for destroying Space Ducks!). Try it for free, then buy the game once and be done with it (none of that in-app purchase crap)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
