							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warfare in Western Europe, 1050-1300</name>
									
			<description>A set of rules for fighting large scale medieval battles. Each figure represents 50 men and each inch represents 25 yards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troops are divided into two types, mounted knights and infantry. Infantry can include bowmen and crossbowmen. The opposing armies are divided into divisions (consisting of 20 infantry figures or 10 cavalry figures) each of which has a division commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The command and control rules require written orders. Division commanders have a randomly determined character rating which reflects the reliability in which orders will be carried out by the commander's division. The rules also encompass morale and unit disruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
