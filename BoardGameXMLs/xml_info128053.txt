			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gene Effect is a mining/exploration game set on Mars in the 2060s. The backstory to the game centers around an ancient alien race, the Na'rul. Remnants of Na'rul technology are found on Mars in the 2040s, and soon humans are able to reproduce advanced metal alloys based on a rare ore called koronite. Humans also discover Na'rul jump-gates, and use this technology to explore space and locate valuable resources. In Gene Effect, the player pilots a small mining craft and explores dark caverns filled with exotic and sometimes foreboding vegetation. The goal is to locate and mine several types of ore, depositing it at depots before exiting via jump gate. The craft is sensitive to collisions and other threats, but its nano-hull slowly regenerates. A sonar tool allows players to clear debris such as stalacites, and also to expose hidden ore deposits. On occasion, the craft is equipped with a missle-like &amp;quot;T-drone&amp;quot; as well. Gene Effect scores players performance in numerous categories, including damage to craft, time, ore collected, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
