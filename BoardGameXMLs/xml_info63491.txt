							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pent: The First Gospel of Pandemonium</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first victim was found, mutilated beyond recognition, inside a bathroom. The door was locked from the inside. The second victim was torn to pieces, and the damage was so severe that the body was initially thought to belong to two victims. The coroner's report indicated that cause of death was suicide. As if that weren't bad enough, two members of City Council have turned up dead in the past week. The papers won't say what was done to the bodies, but your sources tell you that it was pretty horrific. All you know is that both victims were found in a similar position: nailed to the side of a church, at least forty feet off the ground. No one has a clue how it was done. Except you, of course. This is the work of demons, and you're the only ones who can put a stop to it. It's going to be another one of those days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pent: The First Gospel of Pandemonium is a sourcebook for Dread that includes five ready-to-run scenarios (each of which features thoroughly fleshed-out locations, characters, evidence, and hostiles). This supplement also includes eight short scenarios, six adventure hooks, stats for dozens of hostiles, and an updated weapons list.
