			<description>Do you like stories about happy, functional, well-adjusted people who fall in love with the right people, say the right things, and live happily ever after? If so, this is definitely not the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Complicated is a game about personality quirks, secrets both dark and embarrassing&amp;ndash; but most of all, it's about convoluted, messy, compelling, and occasionally one-sided relationships. This game is designed to facilitate play in the style of movies like The Royal Tenenbaums, and television shows like Ugly Betty and Pushing Daisies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
