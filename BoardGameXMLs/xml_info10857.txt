							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doquin</name>
									
			<description>Doquin is played on an unusual &amp;quot;board,&amp;quot; namely a cube with a 4x4 grid of holes on three adjacent sides.  These holes go almost all the way through the cube, and players insert wooden rods into them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn you simply insert one of your rods into a hold as far as it will go.  You can capture an opposing rod by touching it with the ends of two of your pieces (after which they slide in as far as possible).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has used all 10 of his rods.  A player scores 1 point for each rod inserted fully into the cube and 1 point for each captured rod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
