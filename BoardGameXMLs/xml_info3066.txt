			<description>&amp;quot;Two Players - Zone Maker &amp;amp; Zone Breaker&lt;br/&gt;In Zone X the players alternate in fixing a hidden target point &amp;quot;Zone X&amp;quot; on the Marker Grid. The opponent (Zone Breaker) attempts to zero in on the target using his search board.&lt;br/&gt;The Target Point is picked by the Zone Maker who then draws two intersecting lines on the Marker grid. This creates 4 Zones that are color-coded...&lt;br/&gt;The Zone Breaker calls Zone keys using his search board. The Zone Maker responds by stating the Zone color in which the key called lies. The Zone Breaker places a corresponding color peg into his search board and, using logic and luck, zero's in on the target using as few pegs as possible...&lt;br/&gt;Zone X can be played at 3 levels of challenge related to: 1.Straight line zoning 2.Curved line zoning 3.Random shape line zoning&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- from back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is in the same style of game box as Mastermind. i.e. Two interesting and unusual people on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
