							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">San Guo Sha: Beginner&#039;s Edition</name>
									
			<description>The beginner's edition (初出茅庐) released in 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targeted to simplify teaching, it contains only 64 cards in deck instead of 108 in a standard one, 4 heroes (Guan Yu, Gan Ning, tweaked Lv Bu and tweaked Zhang Liao) instead of 25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has no box, just a big envelope with a page of rule sheet and 4 sheets of uncut cards inside. You need to cut out the cards by yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends of the Three Kingdoms (a.k.a. San Guo Sha) is a card game based off the Chinese classical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which shares many rules with Bang!, the differences are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.&lt;br/&gt;2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.&lt;br/&gt;3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.&lt;br/&gt;4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.&lt;br/&gt;5. Peach (Beer) may be played by any player when someone loses their last life; there is no exemption of using Peach when there are only 2 players left.&lt;br/&gt;6. The game proceeds counter-clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
