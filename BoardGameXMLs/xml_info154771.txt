			<description>Divinity is a cooperative turn-based card game for 2 to 4 people, in which each player assumes the role of a deity trying to forge the universe as it is eaten away by powerful disasters of mysterious origin. As players work together, the universe either succumbs to the calamities or is saved by the grace of the gods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the players in Divinity is to accumulate points by creating various objects in their galaxies. The divine cards are used by players to achieve their goal, while calamity cards are force-played through to game, undermining the players' efforts. Depth is created through the interaction of all these cards, creating new situations every game and requiring players to consider card abilities carefully in order to master the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends, players add all their points together to judge the fate of all they've built. Players must play wisely, as both divine and calamity cards can cause the game to end. Control of both points and when the game ends is critical to success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divinity is inspired by cooperative games heavy in strategy and planning, as well as light and chaotic party games. It's made to be quick to set up, easy to learn, but full of endless wonder. Why not try being a god today?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
