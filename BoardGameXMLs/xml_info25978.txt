			<description>This French cycling game dates back to the 1930's (exact release-date unknown). It's a wooden box of 18x38cm. that should be clapped open to play. Inside there is an oval v&amp;eacute;lodrome. There are 8 wooden cyclists (each forming a team). Movement is decided by a die. Players should decide how many laps the race will be. The winner is the one who crosses the line first in the final lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
