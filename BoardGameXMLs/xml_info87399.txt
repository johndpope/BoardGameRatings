			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flickering lights. Showering sparks. Drifting silently through space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've discovered the Kapteyn, a ghost ship lost in deep space. Inside this 29-page PDF your crew will encounter a starship unlike any other yet released by the Ronin Arts shipyards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed as an adventure location, this drifting starship includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Information on the Kapteyn, including its history and game statistics.&lt;br/&gt;     Information and game statistics on the robotic crew.&lt;br/&gt;     A key for the 100+ areas inside the ship and two forms designed for customizing the ship to fit your exact needs.&lt;br/&gt;     Advice on customizing the ship and introducing it to your campaign including notes on the condition of the ship and encountering the ship.&lt;br/&gt;     Scenario suggestions that assist the GM in fitting the ship to his needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure toolkit also includes the deckplans, recognition sheet, and a bonus tile from SkeletonKey Games. To construct the ship for use with miniatures you will need SkeletonKey Games' complete line of starship-related e-Future Tiles. See below for the complete listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
