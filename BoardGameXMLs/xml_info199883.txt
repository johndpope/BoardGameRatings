							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orc Assault</name>
									
			<description>Once upon a time all was peaceful and serene in the far off land of Camalon, but the silence has been broken as the orc hordes have returned to the peaceful kingdom to claim the land that they once held most sacred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing stopping them from conquering the innocent people of Camalon is your arsenal of weapons and advanced research towers.&lt;br/&gt; Progress through various waves and stages of invasion on both paths and huge open battlefields, all along developing an increasingly sophisticated tower system to take down even the most powerful of orcs. If you're losing the battle, get behind the trigger of a machine gun and start taking on the invasion head on in first person mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This game requires a VR headset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
