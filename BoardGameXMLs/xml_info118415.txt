			<description>&amp;quot;A Game of Quick Wit &amp;amp; Repartee&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 sections: Objectives and Performance.&lt;br/&gt;The Objectives section is divided into 3 areas. The player must correctly answer a multiple-choice question from the area in which they land. They move forward one space for every correct answer. A player's turn ends when they answer incorrectly, or when they move out of the Objectives area.&lt;br/&gt;The Performance section is divided into 3 areas. The player must perform one of the 3 area-actions: Connections, Puns, or Retorts.&lt;br/&gt;Connections - player is given 5 topics in 15 second intervals and must speak for 15 seconds on each topic, connecting it to the one before.&lt;br/&gt;Puns - player has 15 seconds to respond to a pun read out by another player.&lt;br/&gt;Retorts - player must respond to an insult read out by another player.&lt;br/&gt;In the Performance section the player's performance is voted on by the other players [1,2,3] and their marker moves forward on the board the average of the sum.&lt;br/&gt;To win, the player arrives at the centre of the board, the 2nd place player picks an Objective card and reads out from one of the 3 multiple-choice questions. If the player answers correctly they win. If incorrect, they move back one square and the game continues. Note: if the player is making a second attempt at winning by answering the question, and fails, they move back 2 spaces, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
