			<description>Statistical sport game. Amazing theme taken, a very early British Football League season - and he is Swedish!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual with these games, dice are thrown and cross-checked on various charts and tables. You can easily play the whole season in an evening (there were only 11 teams in those days).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
