			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Cross a gun with a space ship, then attach a stick on top of it - and you kinda have the design of the Sting-ray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blue joystick have a pistol grip in the bottom of the shield-formed base. On top of this the black stick sticks up. In front of the stick there is a switch and the space ships two red &amp;quot;jet engines&amp;quot; are buttons as well. The pistol grip has a black &amp;quot;trigger&amp;quot; button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sting-ray were reviewed at least three times; in April 1991 by CU Amiga who also reviewed it again in May 1992 where it was also reviewed by Atari ST Review&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
