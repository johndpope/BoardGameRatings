							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Water Temple of the Elder Elemental God</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Theleb arrived at the temple dedicated to the Element of Water, he found only a few inhabitants. Only 3 Sahuagin clerics worshiped here and a few minions that were enslaved to do the Elder&amp;rsquo;s bidding. After yet another defeat of one of the Elder&amp;rsquo;s Temples, Theleb has become quite concerned with the readiness of this temple. Theleb&amp;rsquo;s ability to free his twisted master is becoming a near impossible task. Since all of the precautions that have been taken at the other temples don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be effective, Theleb is taking a different approach in how he defends this temple. Instead of putting his clerics in harms way, he has replaced his clerics and followers with charmed monsters and undead. Theleb left one minor cleric to oversee the entire operation along with the help of the Alu-Fiend Pandemonia. His goal is to use these creatures as a delaying tactic so he can fortify the real seat of power, Theleb&amp;rsquo;s personal tower. Because three of the four temples required in the ceremony to link all 4 Elements together have fallen, Theleb has researched the possibility of combining all 4 powers in one area. With limited success, Theleb has been able to draw some of the Elder&amp;rsquo;s power to this point in his tower. With time and help from the other remaining clerics from the different Elements, Theleb hopes to bring forth the Elder from his prison Demi-Plane in the Deep Ethereal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 10th - 14th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
