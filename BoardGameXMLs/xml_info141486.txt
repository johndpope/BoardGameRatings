			<description>Children's game intended to teach road safety, particularly for young cyclists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board reflects a ride through town and ends where you started from. A dice is used for movement but has some choices if you are lucky. If you roll an arrow, you can advance up to 4 spaces. If you roll a card, you draw a card and another player asks you the question. If you are correct, you can move up to 6 spaces. If you roll the pedestrian, you can move him. He is an extra piece on the board and can 'walk' from zebra crossing to zebra crossing. If he is on a crossing when your piece arrives before it, you cannot go over the crossing until the pedestrian has been moved elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to arrive home, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One nice touch is that the question cards can be sorted in to four levels of difficulty, so the game can happily be played by various age groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
