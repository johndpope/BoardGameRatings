			<description>Manx TT Superbike is a 1995 arcade racing game developed jointly by Sega-AM3 and Sega-AM4. It was later brought to the Sega Saturn by Psygnosis and Tantalus Interactive and then ported to Windows by Perfect Entertainment. It was the first motorcycle racing game built for the Sega Model 2 arcade board. Up to 8 players can race in this game if enough cabinets are linked together, following the similar mechanisms as Daytona USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's setting is the Isle of Man TT - the world-famous and demanding motorcycle racing event held on the Isle of Man. There are two courses to race on; the Laxey Coast course for novices and the more difficult Time Trial course for veteran players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Manx TT Superbike&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
