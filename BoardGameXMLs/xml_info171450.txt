			<description>Like the tide into a breach: the Battle of Neville&amp;rsquo;s Cross is a simulation of the battle that took place between the armies of England and Scotland in 1346, during the Medieval period. The battle forms part of both the Hundred Years&amp;rsquo; War and the Second War of Scottish Independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over ten turns. Chronologically, a turn corresponds to about half an hour. At the end of the 10th turn the battle ends and the situation will be assessed using a scoring system. The resulting score will determine the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat results are resolved by the rolling of two six-sided dice, with various modifiers applied as detailed in the rules. Different types of unit have different characteristics, with terrain affecting how far a unit can move, how easy it is to break and its ability to either engage in melee or attack using archery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
