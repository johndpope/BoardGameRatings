			<description>Rakion is on-line &amp;lsquo;strategy action game'&lt;br/&gt;The game focuses on intense sword on sword battles with RPG style characters and settings, along with the strategic battle plans to provide the ultimate battle experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like any good console games, Rakion delivers video game quality action.&lt;br/&gt;You can now experience the palm sweating battles of console games online. Gamers can improve their combat skills and work out several strategies to win the battle alone as a team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like a MMORPG, the concept of gaining experience points and leveling up exists in Rakion as well.&lt;br/&gt;Through the level-up system, you can upgrade your character&amp;rsquo;s skills and equipment as well as your summons. Summoned creatures will become much stronger as you level up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
