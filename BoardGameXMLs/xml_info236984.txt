			<description>A Two-Round Team Event&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The howls still echo in your minds as you find yourselves pounding up the stairs toward the door to the circle's Solarium, dressed in your night wear. It is from the Solarium that the sounds, first of shattering crystal, then howls and screams, finally stone cold silence, came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you reach the top of the steps you see that there are already nearly a dozen of the house guard at the copper fronted Ironwood door to the Solarium. Several of them are battering ineffectively at the panels with the hilts of swords and axes. As you approach, a sergeant is attempting to organize a few of his men to remove the stone bust of an ancient Keeper from its pedestal for use as an impromptu battering ram.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four dogs, lean of body to the point of emaciation lie, together with one of the armored house guard, in a heap on the floor. Several of the other soldiers show gashes in flesh AND in armor alike, mute testimony to the ferocity of these beasts ere they were dispatched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
