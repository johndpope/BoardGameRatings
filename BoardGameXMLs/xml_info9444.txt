			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card game in which players will find themselves fighting against each other, as powerful landlords of the middle ages, to expand their dominions. Your army may not be the only way to lead you to the victory, your skillful merchants and the loyalty of your townsfolk may be the key to achieve power. A difficult game for hard-core gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a card game. It's more difficult (not for beginners!). The cards are Tarot-size. Each player is a Noble trying to take control of new territories. The Land cards have to be explored and each player must send Farmers, Merchants, Soldiers, Hunters and Artisans to have influence on the territory. Then, at the proper time, each Noble can try to take control of one of the territories provoking an Event (a War, a Market or so on). If he wins the Event he takes control of the territory and he scores points. When all territories have been controlled the game is over. It's more difficult. It requires good memory, good strategy and almost no luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
