			<description>This 1899 card game has a Happy Families mechanic. The cards are organized in sets of four. They are dealt out evenly among the players. Each player in turn asks another player for a card that matches one of his own: if successful, he gets the card and another turn; if not, the turn passes. The winner is the player to collect the most complete sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes this game unique is that its cards feature actual early photographs of 13 U.S. cities: New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, New Orleans, Pittsburg (spelled this way), Buffalo, Richmond, Savannah, New Haven, Los Angeles and Honolulu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each set of four cards shows the same photograph, with the cards representing the city and three of its primary products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
