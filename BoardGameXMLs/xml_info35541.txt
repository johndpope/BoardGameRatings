			<description>This game was distributed as an item promoting recruitment for the Republic of Singapore Navy. It was sent in the mail to young people who were completing school and starting working life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game actually has two games in one: one version is set in the corporate world, where landing on a brown nose, licked boot or kissed butt square sends your briefcase piece forward, but blackmail, back stab and tie squares send you back. The other is set in the Navy and landing on medal, badge of rank or targeted submarine squares are advantageous, and enemy subs, mines and torpedoes are bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamentally, the games are Snakes-and-Ladder clones, but with themes contrasting a career in the navy with working in an office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
