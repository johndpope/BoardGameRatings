							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Streets of Commonville</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commonville. A dangerous place to be. Especially since a callous murderer has gone into hiding within its maze of streets. With a warning given to police that if they don&amp;rsquo;t call off their manhunt within an hour, another innocent civilian will pay the price. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you and your team to discover which of the 12 suspects is the offender, where they are hiding, which weapon was used on the victim, and arrest him/her before the time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each member of the team gets to play as one of Commonville's finest, exploring the city, consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round, each player will roll a varying amount of dice up to 3 times. You may then use the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). Donuts can be used to perform special dice actions (such as passing a die to another player). There is also a special blue Investigation die that can be used to perform actions rapidly (but only by the lead detective). After performing any actions, the team must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 11 of them (and found the weapon that was used on the last victim), you must collect an Arrest Warrant from the Police Precinct and arrest the remaining suspect. If you can do all of this before time runs out, the team wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
