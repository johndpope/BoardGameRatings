			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adaptation of commercially-published setting materials for use with d20 System.  This fan-created item uses illustrations and intellectual property in a copyright-infringing way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaiman is a continent on the planet Kulthea, which is circled by two moons, one white; Orhan, the other black; Charon. Powerful ley lines cross the world of Kulthea; concentrations of ambient magic which wizards and their ilk gather and shape into powerful enchantments. These ley lines increase the power of magic and so attract wizards, outsiders and summoners like bees to honey. The lines are dotted with mages&amp;rsquo; towers, hedge wizards&amp;rsquo; cottages and ancient way houses that provided shelter when the land was experiencing a golden age. This age is ended and the way houses have fallen into disrepair and many have been forgotten. Even the greatest creation of the first races; the Essaence Gates have fallen into disrepair and disuse. Only the secretive Navigator Guilds hold the knowledge of their use but most people go their entire lives without seeing a Navigator so they can hardly be called prolific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
