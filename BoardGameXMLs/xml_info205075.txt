							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Dream of Galastaire Campaign Setting</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dreams are the raw stuff of the creation. When a few lingering concepts sought shelter from the inconsiderate madness of potential? They realized that they lacked the means to craft a barrier. Nightmares are impossibly vast, infinite in possibility, and defiant to all attempts at rules. Stability is built out of need and limits, by the limited beings who share them. As they were, mere lonely ideas? They were just too vague to last. So? The Muses learned to share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time began as they experimented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
