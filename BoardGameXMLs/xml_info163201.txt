							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Djinn of the Deep</name>
									
			<description>The newest adventure, hot off the electronic press from Silver Gryphon Games, the Djinn of the Deep has been released! Get into this pulp adventure set in 1923, see what's in store for your pirate PCs in the Arabian Sea, and survive! Inspired by Discovery Channel's Shark Week (we're not affiliated with them, they're not affiliated with us, but we do love Shark Week!), this adventure is Savage Worlds specific, with not one, but two maps, amazing illustrations by up-and-coming artist, Alberto Tavira, as well as several other illustrators!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to read the special note from the author on the copyright page so you can see why this adventure is such an amazing feat to have accomplished for us, and why it's going to be so much fun to run at your game table! Set up as a one-shot that is perfect for convention or game day play, or even for a single-shot game with your normal gaming group, this adventure can be just the beginning for your characters as they travel though a world still haunted by superstition, ancient gods, and divine retribution...and really, REALLY big sharks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the publisher)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
