			<description>Ice3 is a game played with ice cubes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with some cards and an ice cube, which is placed on a plastic stand. The cards are placed on the table to create the path on which the ice cubes will progress. Some cards make it possible to attack another player's ice cube &amp;ndash; dipping it in a glass of cold water, warming it with your hand, blowing on it, putting a pinch of salt on it, etc. &amp;ndash; to make it melt a little. Other cards allow you to defend yourself &amp;ndash; well, your ice cube anyway &amp;ndash; by preventing an attack. If your ice cube melts completely before the end of the game, you're eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to bring his cube to the 25th card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
