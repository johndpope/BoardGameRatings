							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A platform computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace) as a sequel to their 1985 title Cauldron. It was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control a bouncing pumpkin that aims to take revenge against the &amp;quot;Witch Queen&amp;quot;, who ascended to power in the previous game. Inspired from an element in Cauldron (a bouncing pumpkin), Brown decided to base the title on this aspect. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers, and they were unable to perfect the design. Technical limitations prevented the implementation of animation elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64, which was followed by other system releases and re-releases. The game received praise from video game magazines, mainly directed at the audio-visuals. Difficulty navigating the bouncing pumpkin was a common complaint, though reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cauldron_II:_The_Pumpkin_Strikes_Back,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Steve Brown: design&lt;br/&gt;Richard Leinfellner: program (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Stan Schembri: program (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Richard Joseph: music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
