			<description>Source: The Developer's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treading a lush path between video game and animated cartoon, DOFUS brings a whole new dimension to online Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its manga-inspired graphics, gripping tactical game play and wild humour, DOFUS has created a unique style of its own for other MMORPGs to follow. Experienced players are seduced by its strategic turn-based fighting system, which is a rare feature in MMORPGs, while casual players are drawn to the game's accessibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And to top it all off, in spite of the dense diversity of the game world, DOFUS is no bigger than 150 Mbs in size - not many MMORPGs can boast such a lightweight download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can create a character from one of 15 races, each with its own spells. You advance in level by fighting monsters in turn-based tactical battles and doing quests. You can also learn professions to create magic items and earn money by trading with other players. As you increase in power you can focus on different characteristics and learn new spells or improve existing ones. Each race thus has many different paths to develop along depending on the player's preference and together with a huge variety of equipment, pets and mounts this means no two players are the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can fight in teams, link together with friends in guilds, and fight other players in an alignment based player vs player system. There is also a &amp;quot;Kolosseum&amp;quot; in which teams of 3, in theory of roughly equal strength, battle it out with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
