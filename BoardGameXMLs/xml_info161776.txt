			<description>Nice action game and beautifully designed. It is intended to be portable and the over-sized box houses a neat container. When you open the container you can see the mechanisms. You can stand them up and you have a basketball game, with the net at one end and the ball launcher at the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can agree a pre-set number of attempts at 'baskets', the winner being the one with the most at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game linked to Shaquille O'Neal and his picture is on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
