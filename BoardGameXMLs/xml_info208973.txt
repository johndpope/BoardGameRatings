			<description>This is a Monopoly-style election game with some add-on trivia. Each player starts with $5.5 million and rolls dice to move around the 62-space track. A player landing on a state space may pay $20,000 times its electoral votes to win it. If he doesn't want to or can't pay, the state goes up for auction. And if the state is already owned, the player pays $10,000 times electoral votes into the Campaign Fund Treasure Chest. Any player landing on that space collects all money there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three kinds of random event cards and spaces: National Election Commission, National Party Headquarters and Press Conference. Each may grant or cost money or votes, and may offer the opportunity to answer a trivia question from a Presidential Seal card. Each card has two questions, one of which is chosen and read by an opponent. Answering correctly provides benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first candidate to 270 electoral votes wins, but a player may win sooner if all opponents go broke. There is a time-limit elimination process for more than two players. After 60 minutes, there is a ballot, and the player with the lowest EV total drops out and returns his states to the banks. Further ballots are held each 15 minutes until the game is down to 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
