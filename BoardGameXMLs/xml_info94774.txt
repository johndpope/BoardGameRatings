							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jhadara</name>
									
			<description>From deity &amp;quot;Description:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jhadara is most often portrayed as a beautiful, sensuous woman dressed in diaphanous robes, but given this deity&amp;rsquo;s nature, it can appear in virtually any form it chooses. Jhadara is the patron of those who live their lives in the pursuit of self interest and self-indulgence, or who find themselves subject to the whims of the cosmos. Her philosophies and priests, called Revelers, are not evil, but many kingdoms and organizations do not look upon them favorably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jhadara and the spirits of her faithful make their home in the Gardens of Balymorrah in the midst of Magannwyn. Balymorrah is like a huge, sprawling palace constructed in a completely chaotic fashion. It is filled with illusions and traps for the unwary, but for those who belong there, it is a place of depraved delights and wanton pleasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
