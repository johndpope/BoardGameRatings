							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Life is Feudal: Forest Village</name>
									
			<description>Forest Village is a feature-rich, town building simulator strategy game with engaging survival aspects set in the unforgiving Medieval era. Lead your people: a small group of refugees who were forced to start again on an unknown island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terraform and shape the land, expand your base, forage in the forest, hunt for prey, grow crops and domestic animals for food, and prepare for harsh weather, disease and natural disasters! You can oversee your village from a birdseye view or occupy one of your villagers to control and perform tasks in first person, or to simply explore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
