							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It&#039;s Raining Highlanders!</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Jacobite Uprising: Falkirk (1746)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Lt. Gen. Henry Hawley took command of the British army after the disaster at Presontpans. He marched into Scotland to try and break the Jacobite siege of Stirling Castle. He brought the Jacobites to battle near Falkirk. He thought he was in a good defensive position, but the Jacobites outmaneuvered him.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A pouring rain soaked the battlefield, and the powder. The Royal artillery got stuck in the mud and never made it into battle. The English tried to break the Highlanders with a cavalry charge, but this ended in disaster. The Highlanders won a victory, but it would be their last of the campaign.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using miniature figures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules account for the historical weather conditions, as the heavy rains reduced the effectiveness of musketry. Thus the players can't count on their units always being able to fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
