			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Adversaries Awaken! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Egypt contains an assortment of amazing adversaries for your heroes, ranging from CR 4 to 17, starting with a squadron of sphinxes to confront your adventuring heroes from the hungry hunting hieracosphinx to the crass but clever criosphinx and the proud and noble androsphinx. Not all Egyptian monsters are adversaries, as honorable characters may find allies in the winged maftet and the wise two-headed uraeus. Others are every inch a menace, from hateful werecrocodilesand sinister sha and sacred sha carrying plagues in their wake to deadly scavenging scarab swarms and giant scarabs. Of course, much of the Egyptian legendarium in popular and fantasy culture centers around tombs and ruins, and mummies are far from the only inhabitants of the necropolis, as elemental ahkhats are literally a part of the buildings they guard, while mummified cursed kings and eternally vigilant pharaonic guardians guard their domains with jealous and zealous care. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the vicious corpse-eating ammuts sit in judgment on the dead and the damned. For heroes that want to embody that Egyptian vibe for themselves, this book also provides a mythic version of the treasure-hunting archaeologist bard and the legendary living monolith prestige class, anointed with a sacred stone by the ancient sphinx to serve as guardians extraordinaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
