			<description>Designer description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A taste of things to come...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After defeating the Warbling Zizifrex of An-Emhavla III, the crew of the Starship Lobosa feel they have earned some down time. After contacting their superiors at the Galactic Amorphous Space Patrol, they have been granted shore leave at the closest planet in the system, Mabrox V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mabrox V is know for its delightful spas, spacious hotels, and gourmet sandwiches. Travel time from the crew's present location is two days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two uneventful days pass. The crew can almost taste the sandwiches. And then the ship lands in the stellar parking lot. As the team leaves the ship and locks it, they notice a few issues. The parking lot is strewn with red tape. There is a crowd of irate patrons milling around. And several overworked security guards are hurrying in their direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I'm sorry, but we'll have to ask you to leave, the Gastronomic Glitterati is closed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unwilling to leave before knowing what has happened, the crew shows their credentials. The change in the guards is immediate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;GASP is here! We're saved!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somehow the crew no longer thinks this vacation will be as easy as pie...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Amoebas in Space! Episode 23: My Spaceship for a Sandwich.&lt;br/&gt;A Build Your Own (Sandwich) Adventure! &lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the party is to get a sandwich.  However, this is not as easy as it appears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hotel, cabins, spa, and restaurants are shut down.&lt;br/&gt;They are overrun with all manner of creatures run amok.&lt;br/&gt;There are no completed sandwiches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means the party will have to collect the items necessary to make up a sandwich.  After they have collected the items, they can make a sandwich.  Good luck!  And good eating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
