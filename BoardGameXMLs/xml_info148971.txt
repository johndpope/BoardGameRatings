							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">X-3: Jeu de DÃ©s Tri-Directionnel</name>
									
			<description>X-3 is played on a hexagonal board of 61 spaces. The spaces are designed so that dice can fit into them with three faces showing, one along each axis of the board. The playing pieces are dice in two base colors (black and white) with six differently-colored faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules for two games in the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Morpion/Triplets/Ensembles&lt;br/&gt;        A placement game; players alternate placing dice in an effort to form patterns. If using the &amp;quot;Morpion&amp;quot; rule players try to get four faces of the same color in the same direction in a row (or five for a more challenging game). If using the &amp;quot;Triplets&amp;quot; rule players try to create groups of three dice with matching-colored faces touching the same point, and if using the &amp;quot;Ensembles&amp;quot; rule players try to create groups of four dice where the center die matches a face to each adjacent die. (It may be that players are intended to use all three scoring methods together; the rules are rather short and not clear in all respects.)&lt;br/&gt;    Dames de Couleur (Color Checkers)&lt;br/&gt;        In this game players start with 18 dice in the three rows closest to them (facing determined randomly) and on each turn move one diagonally forward. Opposing pieces can be jumped, but only if the adjacent dice faces match. The players can turn dice to different faces instead of moving them. The goal is to capture the most dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
