							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wellstone City Chronicles Encounter Deck</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give your Wellstone City Adventures more punch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This concept, designed to run with the Wellstone City setting for the Savage Worlds system, adds extra dimension to your games in Wellstone!  It gives the GM a much needed tool to generate random encounters within the setting that can be slipped into any of the existing Chronicles, or any of the adventures that the GM has created.  Capturing the essence that Wellstone City is a vibrant, alive, and evolving setting, it lets the players know that they are not alone and that their actions have consequences and allow them to make many contacts, allies, and of course, enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is only the rules for interpreting a second deck that is used by the GM, kept separate from the intiative deck.  No PDFs for cards are included at this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Useable with the &amp;AElig;ther System as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though it represents an alternate mechanic and doesn't focus on the D100 roll that made the &amp;AElig;ther System so popular, it can be used as-is with the &amp;AElig;ther system, and it can be used to its fullest potential with the rules as presented in the 8 pages of text and table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
