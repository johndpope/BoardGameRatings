							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Plume Mountain Dungeon Tiles</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cited as one of the best adventure modules ever, White Plume Mountain is brought to life like never before with these beautifully rendered dungeon tiles!  Every room and encounter area is depicted in fantastic detail, with furnishings, hazards, and fold-up 3-dimensional doors and openings, all in 1&amp;quot;=5' scale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No need to fumble through stacks of generic tiles or handle messy dry-erase markers, just print and play!  Though designed with fantastic detail, these tiles are printer friendly and offer superior clarity for ease of use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of the adventure module is needed to fully utilize these tiles.  They were designed using the free version available from Wizards of the Coast.  Though these tiles may be compatible with newer versions of the adventure, Red Pub Games does not guarantee this.  Get your free copy of White Plume Mountain at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.wizards.com&lt;/a&gt;  Thank you and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
