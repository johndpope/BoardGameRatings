			<description>The object of This or That? is to discover fun and interesting things about the other players. Each token in the game bag has two questions &amp;ndash; one on each side, and each question has two options &amp;ndash; This or That. Most of the questions give you a choice between things you might like, such as &amp;ldquo;Pumpkin Pie or S&amp;rsquo;Mores?&amp;rdquo;. Other questions might give you a choice between things you might not enjoy, such as &amp;ldquo;Smelly or Slimy?&amp;rdquo;. In either case, you might really like both of the answers, or neither of them. That&amp;rsquo;s the catch &amp;ndash; you HAVE to pick one answer!&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing tokens from the bag. Silently read your token and decide which side you want to answer. Read that question out loud. Decide what your answer is but don&amp;rsquo;t say it out loud! Each players guesses what they think your answer is. After all the players have guessed, reveal your answer and be honest! If you draw a black All Play token, read the question out loud, and everyone takes turns sharing their answer to the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep the token you drew and pass the bag along to the next player. The game ends when everyone has five This or That? tokens in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
