							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kampfgruppe Drei</name>
									
			<description>The third in the Kampfgruppe system series, this volume covers weapon systems such as mortars, which provided infantry units with their own integral 'artillery' support (down to platoon level in most armies). It also considers rockets, which were frequently employed in the close support role during street fighting and 'bunker busting' operations along with various other weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ready reference section is provided to maintain the flow of play when major aspects of the various procedures need to be confirmed. A section is also presented dealing with defensive works along with scenario ideas and tactical information relating to attacks made against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
