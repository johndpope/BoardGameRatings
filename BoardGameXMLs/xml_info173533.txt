			<description>Civil War 2 is the definitive grand strategy game of the period. It is a turn based regional game with an emphasis on playability and historical accuracy. It is built on the renowned AGE game engine, with a modern and intuitive interface that makes it easy to learn yet hard to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  historical operational strategy game with a simultaneous turn-based engine (WEGO system) that places players at the head of the USA or CSA during the American Civil War (1861-1865).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take the part of the military and political leadership, trying to lead your nation to victory, in the midst of some of the toughest operations of the Civil War.

There are a host of real military leaders to appoint with their own strengths and weaknesses and choosing the right man for the job is crucial.
