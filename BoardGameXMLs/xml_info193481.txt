			<description>A Cards Against Humanity style game targeted at veterans and members of the military. The game is composed of 100 black Prompt cards and 285 white Response cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUBAR can be played by 4-20 people, and is compatible with the Cards Against Humanity base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck was designed for all four real branches of the military and the Coast Guard so there&amp;rsquo;s enough hate to go around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You guys know how this works. Prompt (black) and response (white) cards. Every player starts with a hand of ten response cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player draws a prompt card and reads it aloud. The others each play a response card(s) they think is the most appropriate, amusing, or horrible. The player reading the prompt card shuffles the response cards, and chooses the one they like the most. The winner of the round takes the prompt card for a point, the answers are discarded, everyone draws to fill their hands, and the person clockwise reads the next prompt card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your cards suck (unlikely), or you&amp;rsquo;re not funny enough to win a round (more likely) and you&amp;rsquo;d like to redraw, just swap a prompt card for a new hand. If you&amp;rsquo;re really hurting for wins you can also swap a prompt card for the opportunity to play two answers cards at once during the next round. If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t score a point then maybe you consider stamp collecting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most prompt cards at the end, or is the last one conscious wins fame, fortune, and everlasting glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
