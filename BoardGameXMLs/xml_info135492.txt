			<description>This satirical card game features 24 minorities structured in 6 groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minderheiten-Quartett is a variant of a Quartett game, with a splash of Top Trumps and some unique mechanisms thrown in. There are two types of cards. First, the traditional Top Trumps style cards with minorities and their statistics rated from 1 to 5 stars, such as share of population or affluence. Second, there are Action, Booster and Community Cards which helps the players complete their groups or stopping other players from reaching their goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player receives two minorities cards and a third card which could be a minority- or an action-card. One round is played in two phases, in the first phase another player is challenged. Both parties select one statistic and a card, the player with the higher total ratings wins the cards and puts them on his victory pile. In the second optional phase action cards can be played. Players then restock their hand to three cards. The game ends when no more challenges are possible. The player with the most minorities wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
