							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cure for Evil</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters arrive at the Imperial Capital at night to find an outer district under attack by undead minions. After cleansing the district alongside other heroes, they are honored with a banquet. During the banquet the heroes meet Gensai, a dwarf Scout and questor of Twoo who enlists the aid of the heroes. He explains events leading up to their nightmarish battle with the undead, but also informs them that the person&lt;br/&gt;responsible for this evil, Jurou Urameshii, is currently on the run. Making matters worse is the fact that he escaped taking his child prisoners with him. Gensai is familiar with the lands and knows that Urameshii is taking a route around and into the mountain towards a hidden airship dock. If he is not apprehended prior to arriving, he may never be found again. Having already lost precious time, Gensai proposes a journey through little known paths over the mountain as opposed to traveling around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After facing many dangers, the player characters finally arrive at a small village in the mountain peaks. There they learn a unique and dangerous way of travel that will allow them to cover great distances at incredible speeds. Arriving at the port only moments after Urameshii&amp;rsquo;s departure, the player characters learn of his hidden retreat in the mountains. With renewed determination, the characters storm his retreat, facing hideous and dangerous creatures to exact justice on the mad Wizard. During the encounter, at least one, but possibly several of the player characters suffer terminal illness after confronting the alchemically altered ghouls guarding the stronghold. Urameshii then forces the player characters to choose the cure in exchange for his freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher: This scored Second Place in the Earthdawn Adventure Resource Contest of 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
