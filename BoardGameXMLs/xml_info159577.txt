							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Bands: World Tour Edition</name>
									
			<description>The premier Rock and Roll Card Game is back...but now it's taking over the world! Battle of the Bands: World Tour Edition, the game where you are the star of your own music group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new edition represents the natural evolution of the original Battle of the Bands game and its expansions.  The game mechanics have been streamlined, tightened, and improved over many years of play. New cards have been added that reflect the changes in music and the industry since the first Battle of the Bands incarnation. Famous cities and venues have been added to truly make this the &amp;quot;World Tour Editon&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With new cool and crazy band members and instruments, reputations that will elevate or cripple your band...you will be armed to the teeth when you hit the stage! Perform Hit Singles, work the Music Biz and ultimately blow your competition off the stage as you fight for Gigs all over the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally the basic game had a 13+ age level, now it's all ages friendly. BUT if you don't want to play Radio Disney you can add the Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll expansion for the real band experience! With the Back Stage Pass and Front Row Center cards, you will expand your gaming experience to new heights and depths, just like the the music business. Pop, Rock, Metal, Punk, Funk, R&amp;amp;B, Country (and Western!), Thrash, Swedish Black Metal, Jazz... even the questionable sounds they call &amp;quot;music&amp;quot; today! It's all here for your gaming enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great gateway game for folks who love music but aren't into games...yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
