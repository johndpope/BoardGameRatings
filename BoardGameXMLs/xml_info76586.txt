			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcade Pool is a pool simulation game developed and published in 1994 by Team17, initially for the Amiga home computer system. The game was later ported to the PC, and a special CD32  release soon followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is essentially a simple top-down pool simulator. Although simple, the physics were surprisingly accurate. The game featured many UK and US variations of pool as well as two variations of ball set (standard UK red and yellow, and standard US circles and stripes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game doesn't feature any popular names from the world of pool. Instead, computer-controlled players are named after members of Team17 staff (with Creative Director Martyn Brown being the most difficult computer-controlled player). The computer-controlled players with the lowest difficulty are all named after staff of Future Publishing-owned Amiga gaming magazine Amiga Power, adding more fuel to the fierce rivalry between the two companies (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
