			<description>A children's game themed on Jonathan Swifts &amp;quot;Gulliver's Travels&amp;quot;, specifically on Gulliver's encounter with the Lilliputians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is head of a Lilliputian family clan, consisting of four members. The aim of the game is to tie down the sleeping Gulliver while gaining as few points as possible. Players take turns taking one of the Lilliputian figures, each of which has either a number from 0 to 5 or a rope symbol on its base (not visible when players choose which figure to take). The active player announces the figure's value and decides if they want to put it on their own family card or return it. If a rope symbol is drawn, the player must exchange two of their family members (they may choose to exchange for a member of a different family clan), announce the new values and tie Gulliver down on one arm or leg. A Lilliputian with a rope symbol is worth ten points.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when Gulliver has been tied down in all four places. The player whose family clan has the lowest total value (all family members added together) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
