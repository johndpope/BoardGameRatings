			<description>From casse inlay (Alternative Software re-release)&lt;br/&gt;Percy is a first class wally! Whilst out for his morning stroll, like the wally of a penguin he is, he falls through a hole in the ice finding himself trapped in an underground maze of ice caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order for him to leave his unwelcome new home, he must face the dangers in the cavern such as deep crevasses, flying ice blocks and moving icebergs to reach the exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you rescue Percy from an ice fate or will you become a wally trying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
