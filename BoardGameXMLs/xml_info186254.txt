							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into The Remnant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast, Furious Fun&amp;hellip; in the Far Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A great little sci-fi dungeon crawl. A water-logged thriller in an ancient alien research station, where potential riches are outweighed only by an eons-old terror! Lot&amp;rsquo;s of fun&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who stayed behind in the Altitude bar turn towards Remnant-0C7 when the FTL core of the Daliance ruptures as begins landing on the surface... just after an unexplained EMP blast scrambled the sensors of every starship in orbit. The core rupture bathes Euphoria in an intense white light... and then the Remnant begins to move... a new shift in the Remnant&amp;rsquo;s already unstable Verdan plate. The planetoid&amp;rsquo;s tectonic slices, interlocked like the pieces of an intricate spherical puzzle, tilt and slide past each other in new, unexpected directions, some receding into the Remnant&amp;rsquo;s soil, others breaking through the regolith towards the surface. This could be precisely the event that the scavenger crews, artifact hunters, jump-miners, scientists and U.R.C. officers have been waiting for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a rush towards the hangars as soon as the alarm sounds. Any ships not already en-route to the Remnant are on their way now! The station intercom announces the biggest tectonic shift on record, pushing what appears to be a large, long-buried land mass to the surface. The announcement indicates a likely exposure of between four to six hours; enough for a skilled crew to make a quick sweep for artifacts and a safe getaway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features everything needed to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed adventure set in an Alient Confederacy Complex&lt;br/&gt;    The secrets of the anchients!&lt;br/&gt;    War Master and Player Schematics&lt;br/&gt;    Printable battlemaps&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot;Deep Blue&amp;quot; Card Stock Figures - put your heroes into the depths&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
