			<description>In the near-distant future, after years of war and famine, a global pandemic kills most of the world&amp;rsquo;s population. Those that survive are transformed by the virus, unlocking a latent genetic code. Now, the world is ruled by the three original species of planet earth: Vampires, Werewolves and super Humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BANE is a three-suited competitive card game, where the suits represent powerful races (humans, vampires and werewolves), each hunting another, locked in a conflict for dominance. The Order of Prey (who hunts who) is similar to rock-paper-scissors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Humans hunt Werewolves&lt;br/&gt;     Werewolves hunt Vampires&lt;br/&gt;     Vampires hunt Humans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played to a board in what is called an engagement. Similar to a trick-taking game, once all players put a card into play one winner is determined using the Order of Prey (described above). Cards also have a ranking, called Speed. Unlike other trick-taking games (such as Spades) a player may not play a card whose speed matches that of a card already in play - thus allowing players to 'speed block' other players. There are eight speeds, represented by numbers in the upper-left corner of each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: After all cards are played during an engagement, Bob sees that his Pack Alpha (Werewolf, Speed 1) is the fastest. He will thus be able to take a trophy from another player, as long as there is a Vampire in play (because Werewolves hunt Vampires).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a trophy means that the player may choose from a pool of face-down cards in front of another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round (Hunt) ends when one player is out of cards or trophies. At that time, the deck is shuffled and a new Hunt (round) begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;Each player tracks their individual score. A Player wins by reaching the MASTERY space on the score track and having more trophies than opponents also in the MASTERY space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are other elements to the game that add flavor (Special Power cards, a BANE token).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
