							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The People of the Pit</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The People of the Pit is an excited adventure module for 4-6 player characters of levels 5-7 and has been designed for OSRIC(TM), but is easily compatible with the Advanced Edition rpgs. The module was written by Alphonso Warden and features art by John Bignham. 'People of the Pit' was designed to be run with a minimum of preparation, and can be integrated into the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s home campaign with little effort. Even though the adventure is designed for 4-6 players of levels 5-7, it can easily be modified to suit lower and higher level parties with the NPC tables in the appendix. It contains 41 pages of text, 12 pieces of original art, 4 new monsters and 5 pages of maps.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
