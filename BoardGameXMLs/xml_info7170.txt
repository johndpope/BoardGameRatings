			<description>TerraTopia was released by The Nature Company chain of stores as a product for their children's group, Kids' Club for Nature.  There was a comic book about the characters used in the game, a group of five kids who each had the ability to turn into a different animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is cooperative.  The kids have been placed on the planet TerraTopia and have to each find their colored stone before the planet's three moons meet (or something along those lines).  The players can choose to travel around the board together or separately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by Peter Olotka, one of the Eon Products team, and his son Greg.  The game definitely shows some of the Eon originality in the mechanics.  The players have to recover their stones by overcoming challenges at various locations on the board.  There are a large number of possible challenges, generated by randomly placing generic challenge markers (e.g., &amp;quot;Fog&amp;quot;) at the various locations and having a booklet which describes exactly what Fog means at each location.  The players have to be able to explain to each other how they would use their character's &amp;quot;powers&amp;quot; (shape-changing and normal talents) to overcome the challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
