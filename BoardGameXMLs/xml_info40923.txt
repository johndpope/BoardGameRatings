							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beneath Cragmist Castle</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;It is oft said that lying beneath the towering stronghold of Cragmist Castle a complex maze of underground dungeon chambers exist&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath Cragmist Castle is a dungeon race game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player's take turns to progress through a maze of disorientating catacombs, building up their inventory as they do so, to reach a secret entrance into the dungeons of Cragmist Castle. Once here, it is the Mercenary's job to rescue a Prisoner and then both Mercenary and Prisoner escape from their captors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the game unique is the mechanic that enables the player's pieces (a 'Mercenary' and a 'Prisoner') to move through the dungeons. To pass through passageways players must have a Skeleton Key in their possession that matches the door they are passing. Beware though, because not only must players avoid the ever present dungeon Guards, they must avoid traps that have been set within the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's Prisoner begins the game in a locked cell, within the dungeon, that must be opened to free him. It is the Mercenary's job to assist the Prisoner in his escape attempt. The first player&amp;rsquo;s Mercenary and Prisoner to escape from the dungeons wins the game. An escape is made when a player&amp;rsquo;s pieces enter the Guardhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
