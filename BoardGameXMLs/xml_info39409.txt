							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pride of Pasadena</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The idea for The Pride of Pasadena was conceived by the Adult Vocational Staff at Villa Esperanza to provide work for the developmentally handicapped adults in their workshop.  As the idea developed and solidified many staff and board members contributed to its final format and design.  The game pieces were painted and packaged by workshop clients.  With training and supervision, they also collated and packaged the Landmark Cards, Investment Cards, and money.  The final product was then assembled and put through a shrink wrap machine.  It is the hope of Villa Esperanza that &amp;quot;The Pride of Pasadena&amp;quot; will provide ongoing and meaningful work for the handicapped adults, along with representing our city in an entertaining and aesthetic way.  We at Villa Esperanza are proud of Pasadena and our contribution to the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object:  The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through purchasing the controlling interest in cultural and historical landmarks of Pasadena.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A monopoly variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
