							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Angry Monster Machine</name>
									
			<description>This game is designed to help children find constructive ways to express anger.  At the start of the game, each player creatures four monsters from Play-Doh modeling compound using the provided mold and places them at different locations: School, Community, Playground and Home.  The players then roll dice and move plastic trucks around the board in an effort to capture the monsters and return them to the monster machine at the center of the board.  When a player returns a monster to the machine, he or she talks about something from the monster's source that causes anger, then chooses a &amp;quot;Transformer Card&amp;quot; featuring an appropriate resolution to the anger.  The card directs the player to reform the monster into another shape.  The first player to transform all four of his or her monsters wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
