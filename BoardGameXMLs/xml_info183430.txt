			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halls of Blackstone Tomb Lay Desecrated, and Haunted&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the depths of Black Mountain there&amp;rsquo;s a secret. Hidden for a generation Castle Blackstone&amp;rsquo;s Tomb lies waiting for redemption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years ago a dark wizard used the tomb to practice his evil magic. He desecrated the resting place of Castle Blackstone&amp;rsquo;s heroes and used their bodies, practicing spells to reanimate the dead. When his crimes were discovered, Southern Realm soldiers captured him, but not before many of them died. The few who survived worked to seal the tomb and keep it a secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s up to your adventurers to discover the secret, bring the tomb back to light and restore the honor of those who still rest there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackstone Tomb is a full-length adventure written for five level one characters using rules from the fifth edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular role playing game. It features numerous encounters with rich narrative descriptions, secret codes to decipher, riddles to solve and a story line that leads to the tomb itself. There are also a number of detailed maps included to add a rich visual experience for the players and assist the game master in setting up player grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure takes place in a small corner of a country called the Southern Realm in a campaign setting of our own design, a continent we call the Lands of Arvum. The continent is home to diverse landscapes, countries with rich histories, people of varied races and many fantastic creatures. And for those with a stout heart, it&amp;rsquo;s a place that promises to be a land of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
