			<description>In Taking Food From Bears, 3-4 hikers will play a bluffing game to see who can take the most food from the bear. But, you must be wary of your hiker companions because they might try to startle the bear with their whistle and cause you to be wounded during your daring heist. You have a trap to keep the bear at bay, but you only get to take one food. How will you out bluff your fellow hikers?Who will live to tell the tale of Taking Food From Bears?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion allows for play up to 6 Hikers. Also in this expansion, the bears will fight back using cards unknown to the Hikers who are trying to take their food. Will the Hikers be able to bluff their way into taking all the bear's food? Will the bears make the hikers wish they had never thought of this stupid game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
