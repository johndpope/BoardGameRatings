			<description>Where's Wilson? provides playful practice in identifying and plotting ordered pairs, an essential skill in algebra! The first quadrants of the coordinate plane enhance the understanding of integers. The distinctive starting board offers eight tracks for placing dominoes. Players match each ordered pair with one of the 16 locations where Wilson is hiding. The winner is the player with the fewest remaining dominoes.&lt;br/&gt; Wilson takes pleasure hiding in various locations in the first quadrant.  Players match hiding places with ordered pairs such as (2, 5) and (4, 3), building an octopus-like pattern outward from the octomino starting board.  Where&amp;rsquo;s Wilson? is self-checking! If the 44 dominoes are placed correctly, open ends of those on the octomino tracks and those yet to be played can be paired. Game variations make it possible to meet the needs of a wide range of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
