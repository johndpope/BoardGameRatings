			<description>Rustle: the Card Game is a card drawing farm animal themed game where the goal is to possess the most points by the end of the game. There are two decks - the Animal Deck and the Action Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Animal Deck contains only cards that give you points. The Action Deck contains cards that let you draw more Animal cards, steal Animal cards from other players or remove their Animal cards from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with two animal cards in their farm (in front of them) and four action cards in their hand. Each turn players draw an Animal card and an Action card. The Animal card is played in front of them straight away. Players then choose to play one of their Action cards or discard one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are earned through collecting farm animals which are all worth different points. Game play ends when no more cards can be drawn from the Animal Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
