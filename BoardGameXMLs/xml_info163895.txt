							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doozy</name>
									
			<description>Doozy is a life-sized board game that encourages players to move, interact, and create with one another--away from a screen. It's a great way to meet strangers, get to know new friends, or just be silly with old friends! You can play Doozy outdoors, at a party, or for your office icebreaker!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is simple. You take the circular spaces and create any closed loop of your choice. You roll the die. You go to the next space of that color. You draw a card, and you do what it tells you to do! The goal is to go all the way around the closed loop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
