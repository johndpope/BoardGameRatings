			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exhibit Room is a full-color, 24 x 20 inch, floor plan of an Exhibit Room, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A fine collection from antiquity. Be careful to preserve it lest it return to such.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is a map of a single room of an exhibition hall displaying various pieces of art including sculptures, paintings, and an ancient vase and chariot. The art on display is Greco-Roman in appearance. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the exhibit room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is suitable for use in pulp adventure or modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple of adventure hooks for the included map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Blast from the Past: An archaeologist returns from a trip from Europe bringing several new pieces of ancient Greek and Roman art he recovered with him. After a week of exhibition, another rival archaeologist appears claiming that he found the art first and it was stolen from him. The first archaeologist refutes the claims and continues the show. The next night, the second archaeologist visits the show and plants a nasty surprise in the walled off back room exhibition area. The group could be students of the archaeologist visiting to support their mentor and the show or security guards and notice the second rival archaeologist behaving oddly at the show. They could catch him in the act of planting the bomb or find the planted bomb. It&amp;rsquo;s a race against time to evacuate the exhibit hall and/or disarm the bomb before it explodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight Chariot Ride: A local fraternity decides on a unique way to haze new members to the group. They want them to get two horses and steal the chariot from the art department for a midnight chariot ride throughout the university and then return the chariot to the art department. The group could be involved as another fraternity that finds out about the plot and wants to one up the other fraternity and do the deed themselves. They could also be security guards or on campus police who need to stop the theft or the chariot prank leading to a chase on horseback, motorbike, or car versus a chariot on a rampage throughout the campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
