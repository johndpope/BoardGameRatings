			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are called &amp;quot;Vulcans&amp;quot;, and they have assumed the role of humanity's protectors.  The game supposes that all game sessions will involve significant combat between the Vulcans and humanity's foes; character life spans are presumed to be fairly short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Spheres of Influence (Attributes), including Blood, Mind, and Soul.  Each Sphere has an associated dice pool of d10s.  Characters also have Traits (a fusion of Attributes and Skills), with values of 1-10.  Characters also have Skills with values of 1-10.  During play, a character's Sphere dice pool may be reduced due injury, stress, or exhaustion.  Actions in the game are either simple (automatic), difficult, or opposed.  Difficult or opposed actions are resolved by a fairly tedious process of rolling and summing a large dice pool, applying modifiers, and comparing to an action table to determine number of successes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
