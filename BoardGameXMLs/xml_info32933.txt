			<description>&amp;quot;Buying, Selling and Trading Horses - From the Horse People&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed and published by Paul Burnham, American Saddlebred Training Stables, Jonesboro, GA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game provides players with an understanding of what horses and their breeders go through and deal with in the showing of horses - a sense of realism is hoped in case you want to know what it's really like owning a horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a player must have a complete show string (one 5-gaited, one 3-gaited, one road horse, one fine harness, one pleasure horse and one risk horse) and a total of 500 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
