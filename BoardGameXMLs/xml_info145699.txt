							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master of the Citadel</name>
									
			<description>For 1000 years the two rival citadels of the lands were at war with each other. Each citadel was ruled by a mighty master who marched their armies to battle for control over the vast magical pools known as Esper. The Esper imbued their great civilisations with magic, miracles and power. Decade after decade the violence and bloodshed escalated and the increasingly desperate masters performed cursed rituals to gain the advantage. Successive masters and their courts performed dark blood magic and offered tainted Esper to the gods of the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then one night at the sign of the Dread Moon a meteor crashed into the realm and obliterated nearly all life. The Esper turned into fiery Embers which cursed and twisted the lands and its inhabitants beyond imagination. Now nothing remains. Vile Phantoms, deformed creatures and shadows stalk the few remaining survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been another 900 years since that fateful impact. The old masters have suddenly been bought back to life having been reanimated by the cursed Embers. They are but mere shadows of their former selves. Their only memory being the wars, anger and hate for each other. Both masters seek to resurrect their long lost champions, drain the lands of its few remaining resources.  Their quest is to rebuild their fallen citadels, summon elemental servants and raise Warbands from the dead. You are the master of the citadel! War will come again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Master of the Citadel (MotC) is to create powerful Warbands capable of laying siege to your opponents citadel gates and destroying their city. You begin the game with a champion who you must advance into a powerful character capable of defeating powerful creatures summoned from beyond the spirit realm. Victory in these battles will reward you with the resources you need to scavange legendary weapons and armour, summon elemental servants to do your bidding, develop your citadel and construct deadly warbands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotC uses a unique battle system in which your champion summons the spirits of fallen enemies to fight in deadly combat. By performing a cursed ritual you set the difficulty of the encounter and the rewards you get scale accordingly. Victory may yield fate cards that provide hidden bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summon elemental servants to boost your champions equipment when needed using MotC&amp;rsquo;s unique flexible battle system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build paths, activate mysterious obelisks, explore abandoned keeps and harvest resources such as wood, stone, gold and cursed embers. &lt;br/&gt; Map tiles are colour coordinated and randomised meaning the available resources and strategic locations vary with each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your citadel board to enchant your champions' equipment. Build warband training grounds, citadel buildings and manage your resource pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accumulate vast resources to build dreaded Warbands of wretched knights, dark mages and undead rangers. Use these warbands to fortify strategic locations, build mines, scout for stat boosting relics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then once your powers are at it's peak you are ready to siege and destroy your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
