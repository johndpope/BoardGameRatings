			<description>Subtitle:A dice game of bloody vengeance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;For those who&amp;rsquo;ve come in late...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aleena and Bargle were introduced in the 1983 edition of the original, classic DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Game. Presented in a bright red box, this set was many millions of players&amp;rsquo; first introduction to D&amp;amp;D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Player&amp;rsquo;s Book was a short &amp;lsquo;pick-a-path&amp;rsquo; style adventure designed to teach you the basics of the game. Taking on the role of a brave warrior you set off to explore a dark and dangerous dungeon. But it was not long before you found yourself in trouble and were wounded after a brief battle with a nasty goblin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just when things were looking grim you met Aleena! The beautiful and kindly cleric (wonderfully illustrated by legendary artist, Larry Elmore) gladly used her powers to heal your injuries. With Aleena now by your side you continued deeper into the dungeon, only to encounter the infamous magic-user, Bargle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest, as they say, is history...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Kill Bargle is a dice game offering 2-5 players the opportunity to exact their revenge upon Bargle.  The only requirements are the free rules, some players, 6 rusty nails and a set of polyhedral dice.  This game was web-published as a 2 page PDF and was subsequently published in the Finnish role playing magazine Roolipelaaja.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
