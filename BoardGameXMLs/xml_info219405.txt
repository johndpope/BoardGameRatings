			<description>In Memo-Palace, players will first hide the animal tiles in the castle, but they won't just place the tiles and leave it at that. No, they must tell a story about each animal as they place it, with all the players paying attention to the stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the animals have been placed, players must then attempt to find matching pairs of animals in the castle, but they also need to combine the two stories for the two tiles that they find, and if they don't remember the stories, then they must return the tiles. Thus, Memo-Palace combines storytelling and memory in a new way to create a fresh challenge and experience for young players each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
