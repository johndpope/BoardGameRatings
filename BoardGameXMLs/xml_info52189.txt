			<description>From the catalog description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Would you rather face a roomful of bloodthirsty monsters alone, or with a 500-pound grizzly bear at your side?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Fantasy 5: Allies has all the information you need to bring various types of supernatural help to your Dungeon Fantasy game. For druids, this book contains more than a dozen useful animal companions, from anacondas to wolverines. For clerics and holy warriors, there's the divine servitor waiting to be a faithful friend, plus lenses and more than 20 elements that can be used to define its mighty abilities. (Who couldn't use the assistance of a winged divine servitor who serves War, Fire, and Light?) For spellcasters, support is little more than a ritual away, in the form of familiars. These helping hands (or whatever) range from common creatures such as cats and hawks to more exotic choices like hellhounds and shoulder dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Fantasy line for GURPS is about gathering friends for fast, fun fantasy fighting. With Dungeon Fantasy 5: Allies, it's even easier to summon more friends to the battle!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
