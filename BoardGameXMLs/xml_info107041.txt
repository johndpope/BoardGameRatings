							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartels &amp; Cutthroats</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a business game made exciting and playable because of its realism - which also makes it ideal for educational use.  This is your chance to make all of the executive decisions necessary to manage a multimillion dollar business.  You may even decide to form price cartels or engage in cutthroat competition.  In C&amp;amp;C your decisiveness will be tested.  Can you react to a competitor's advertising &amp;quot;blitz&amp;quot; before you lose the competitive edge?  Will you decide to automate your factories in order to cut production costs?  How will you handle labor demands during profitable years or productivity declines during recessions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed by two professionals (one in systems simulation and the other with a master's degree in business administration), C&amp;amp;C provides a full range of options - from an easy to play game for beginners to an advanced version that will stump even experienced businessmen.  Designed for one to six players - with the computer playing up to five positions if you so desire - CARTELS &amp;amp; CUTTHROATS will prepare you to tackle the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
