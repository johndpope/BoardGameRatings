			<description>From the FFG Announcement Article:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Maneuver Dial Upgrade Kit provides three sculpted plastic dials that proudly display the affiliation of your current squadron with one of the three X-Wing factions. To use one of these plastic maneuver dials, simply take the cardboard dial token showing a ship&amp;rsquo;s maneuvers and insert it into the secure plastic housing. Once situated, you can place the plastic maneuver selection marker into place, and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to fly your ship with style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, these plastic maneuver dials provide an easy way for you to differentiate between your dials at a glance. Each maneuver dial includes a space on the back for you to insert a dial ID token that displays a silhouette of the corresponding ship. A pack of maneuver dials includes three dial ID tokens for every ship from the T-65 X-wing and TIE Fighter in the original X-Wing Core Set, up to the T-70 X-wing and TIE/fo fighter from Star Wars: The Force Awakens&amp;trade; Core Set!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon, every X-Wing expansion will include a dial ID token for you to use with your plastic maneuver dials if you so choose. These will begin with the Ghost Expansion Pack, the Mist Hunter Expansion Pack, the Punishing One Expansion Pack, and the Inquisitor&amp;rsquo;s TIE Expansion Pack. Standard cardboard maneuver dials will still be included in each expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
