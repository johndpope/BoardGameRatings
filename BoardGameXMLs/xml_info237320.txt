							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Baker&#039;s Dozen of Dungeon Rooms</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially produced classic dungeons and megadungeons often have rooms that aren't detailed. These may be intentionally left blank, or for the GameMaster to flesh out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of thirteen different rooms that can be dropped into such a dungeon, or used to help build your own. Each is described in detail, and some have threats or potential threats listed. The rooms are system neutral so that they can be dropped into any game system. Although each room's dimensions are given, these can be changed to make the room fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rooms vary in size from a simple staircase to a corridor to a large domed room. Many of them lack occupants unless wished; in some cases examples are suggested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a brief overview of a room:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Library: This 30' wide by 60' long room looks like it used to be a library. Damaged wooden bookcases or scroll holders line the walls or lie in pieces on the ground. There are heaps and drifts of mouldering books and scrolls on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
