			<description>Despite its name (&amp;quot;die lotto&amp;quot;) this children's game may be considered more like a distant relative of Go Fish than regular Lotto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a given a picture board with spaces for tiles, and the corresponding tiles are mixed and placed face down, displaying only a number from 1-6. Players roll the die and try to collect their own tiles by picking them first from the shared pool, and when this is exhausted, from tiles picked up by other players. The winner is the first player to obtain all their tiles and complete the picture on their board. The rules as printed actually contains several incongruities and ambiguities leaving important aspects up to extrapolation or guesswork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no date of publication, but the 70s is a decent guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
