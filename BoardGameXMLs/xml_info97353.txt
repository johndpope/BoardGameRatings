							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Janiel</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few agents of Samael have proven as useful to the organization as the Sylvain Janiel Ul Del Valiem. Young even by the standards of her race, Janiel is both an incomparable spell caster and an unequaled martial artist in the service of the Fallen Angel Dinah. Her mystical abilities allow her to invoke into the world a guardian spirit named Enjeil, who takes the form of an enormous eagle made of energy, through which she manifests her powers. Any obscure power that underestimates her will meet its end in a flurry of feathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior / Mystic - Samael - Level 40&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einjeil Eyes (Magic, Seek) - This ability gives +8 inches to Janiel's Control Zone and +1 to the success roll of the Seek Control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mark of Einjeil (Magic, Effect) - Choose an enemy unit within 20 inches.  Until the end of the turn, all Ranged Attacks of any friendly unit against that enemy gain +2 Attack.  Effect 16.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feathers Storm (Magic, Ranged Attack) - Distance (20 Inches), +2 Damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feathers Slash (Ki, Attack) - +2 Attack / +2 Damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Healing Breath (Magic, Effect) - A friendly unit inside Janiel's Control Zone gains Lv 2 Healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
