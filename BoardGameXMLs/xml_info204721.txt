			<description>Striker! is a set of easy-to-understand rules for playing realistic miniature soccer / football matches on a tabletop. Each match plays just like a wargame, using Subbuteo sized figures or cardboard markers to represent players, and a couple of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Striker can be enjoyed by two players, groups of players or completely solo! All you need to experience the game is a table. Fans of Subbuteo already have almost everything needed to enjoy Striker! tabletop soccer / football. &lt;br/&gt; The rules can also be used by soccer / football coaches as a teaching tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written and created by an experienced football coach (and an experienced wargamer) these rules let you enjoy the thrill of every big match&amp;hellip; in your home&amp;hellip; in miniature!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key to Striker is in the way the ball is passed from player to player. In Striker! there are 3 possible passing options: 1) The ball misses its intended target. 2) The ball arrives to the target player imperfectly (meaning it must be controlled) 3) The ball arrives as a perfect pass and play can continue without delay.&lt;br/&gt;Challenges, passes and shots on goal are resolved through dice probabilities, and every tactic employed in a real football match applies to this game: midfield pressing, tiki taka passing, switches of play... if you can do it on a football field, Striker allows you to do it on the tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Striker takes about 90 minutes to play (the same length as a real match) and can be played solo. Just like the real game there are red cards, yellow cards, and shots on goal. Each phase of play is broken into stages: the attackers move their players, or pass, or dribble etc, and then the defenders get a phase to counter, and cover the attacking runs. Players move specific distances, just as in a standard war-game. Movement is measured in inches or centimeters and are incredibly simple to apply. The game lasts 60 phases (30 attacking and 30 defending phases for a half of football) with each phase ending after the defenders finalize their moves, or when a pass goes astray and possession is turned over to the defenders through a tackle or wayward pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
