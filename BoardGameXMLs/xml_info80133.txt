			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome back, oh gentle readers! With the fourth release of the V&amp;amp;V internet freebies, we decided to take a slightly different route and toy around with the concept of a &amp;ldquo;role playing game playset&amp;rdquo;. This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about adding to the role playing experience for the last few years, but never really had the chance to give much of a serious thought. My idea for role playing game playsets came from the days of my youth when it was possible to purchase dozens of different toy playsets for a wide array of action figures. Such toys provided a colorful location and a few extra accessories, you supplied the action figures and the plots from your own imagination. I personally wanted to see a potential experiment like that for V&amp;amp;V, where we supplied the location and a few extras, and the GM and players provided the adventure plots and the main characters. Unlike a typical adventure module, the &amp;ldquo;playset&amp;rdquo; setting would be built with the intention that it could be reused in the campaign over and over again. The playset would also be different than the regular action maps that we offer in the sense that it would be more geared towards the ownership and general use of a super powered character (or characters).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamantes is the first of such planned playsets for V&amp;amp;V and may be a bit different than some (but not all) of the other playsets to come in the sense that it also offers the seemingly mundane business setting that is to found with the typical action maps. Although we plan to release more of these playset settings in the future, it is important to note that they will not be replacing the action maps. In fact, unless various needs or interests sway us otherwise, we are currently considering the prospect of keeping this 3 to 1 ratio trend that we have now. In other words, for every three (or so) action maps you see released, you can also expect to see one playset setting map released as well. &lt;br/&gt; So what is Diamantes? Imagine a posh, jazzy night spot that features elegant live entertainment and gourmet old world cuisine. This is the sort of place where people go to see and to be seen and to look extremely casual and unconcerned that they just ordered a $200 bottle of wine. Imagine that tucked away below this restaurant there&amp;rsquo;s an illegal casino, run by the same owner as the restaurant, where a mixture of the city&amp;rsquo;s wealthy and corrupt come out to play. Now imagine that just beyond the walls of this casino there&amp;rsquo;s an underground base of operations that caters to the needs of the criminal mind that controls all that is Diamantes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So just who is the boss? The boss can be any villain you like. It can be one that is supplied by an existing V&amp;amp;V product, a pre-existing character of your own design in your campaign, or perhaps even a brand new criminal threat that you may be planning to unleash on the unsuspecting heroes. The choice is yours. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy! &lt;br/&gt; Dave Woodrum &lt;br/&gt;FGU Designer/Writer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
