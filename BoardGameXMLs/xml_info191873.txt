			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game one player is the  Witness (game master), though the role is atypical inasmuch as the Witness typically does not participate in the game but acts as a judge once it is complete.  One player is an old soldier, about to die.  The remaining players are people who know or once knew the soldier.  The game proceeds along a narrative action of the old soldier talking with or remembering scenes, seeking absolution.  When the game ends, the Witness determines whether or not absolution was achieved.  The game is particularly free-form and has no established mechanism for resolving narrative disputes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
