			<description>Cribball is a sports action game for Cribbage players, involving the strategy of Cribbage and the competitive action of Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, all that is needed is a standard deck of playing cards and a basic knowledge of Cribbage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game played in two timed halves, of 30 or 60 minutes. Each player receives 3 time outs. The board is an illustrated football field, 50 yards in length, with an end-zone at each end of the field. Special deck cuts are used to determine kick-offs, kick returns, punts, field goals and extra point attempts. The players play a hand of Cribbage. The difference between the hand scores is the total net yardage gained or lost by the offensive player. The football peg is then moved the appropriate distance on the field. If the ball advances over the end-zone, the offensive player scores a touchdown. At the end of the regulation time, the player with the higher score is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
