							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Necromancers: Brotherhood of Death</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here me, for I speak true! They are coming and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them. They are the Mortis-Fraternas, and they are coming. They are Death! Its harbingers, its keepers, its master! While we endlessly squabble over the ashen remains of Anhelm, they are gathering power. For every wizard that falls, one more is added to their legions. They are coming! They are going to kill everything. They claim that Anhelm is the realm of Death, and they are the rightful keepers! By the Power, They are coming! We are all going to die&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-Final words of Magnus the Mighty after his return from Mount Necronus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the bowels of Mount Necronus, resided the Mortis-Fraternas, the Brotherhood of Death. They are more commonly known as Necromancers. The Brotherhood is a loosely allied enclave of death wizards whose sole purpose to transform Anhelm into a mass-graveyard filled with only death and the undead. To&lt;br/&gt;achieve this goal, the brothers pour over forbidden tomes and demon-lore to uncover dark secrets hidden away long ago. To achieve the Brotherhood&amp;rsquo;s goals, no ritual is too dark, no demon too evil, no price too high. For the Necromancers, Death is the only path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
