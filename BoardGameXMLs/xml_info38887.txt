							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The School Shooting Game That Really Doesn&#039;t Have a Name</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They've called you a lot of things over the last three years, and now they're going to pay. You have a semi-automatic rifle and a death wish. They have a detailed building evacuation plan and a history test after lunch. It's schoolin' time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wander around school mowing down your classmates. Whoever has the most kills at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
