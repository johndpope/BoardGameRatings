			<description>F1 Pole Position - known in Japan as Human Grand Prix (ヒューマングランプリ) -- is sixteen actual race courses from the 1992 Formula One season are used in the game. The game was developed and published by Human Entertainment with co-operation with Fuji Television and FOCA. The game was strange in that the opposition cars where able to pass through one another without crashing. There was also a bug in the circuit used in the Canadian Grand Prix where at the hairpin, the barriers had a gap enabling one to drive through and onto the grass. Michael Andretti was used in the game instead of Ayrton Senna because his contract was secured with Sega for their Super Monaco GP II video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicles can be customized to adapt to the different race tracks. Everything can be changed; including the steering, gears, brakes, and even the suspension. There is an option for pit work to be manual or automatic along with the option for automatic/manual gear shifting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F1 Pole Position (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
