			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within a hidden stronghold, far from the mundane world, the powerful lord of the land has collected some of the most powerful relics in history. Each of these relics has shaped the destiny of nations, turned the tide of battles, and been present at pivotal moments of history. They are the most powerful artefacts of this world, each imbued with an immortal rune spirit, each getting bored with their decades of isolation in a hoard of gold. Rarely, a thief manages to penetrate the inner sanctum of the stronghold...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...this is one of those times, and the relics grow restless. They each reach out with eldritch powers and psychic penetration, trying to get the thief to steal them. They long to return to the outside world, once again to forge the destiny of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
