			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Winning Drive Football allows you to quickly play a game between two teams while capturing the entire ebb and flow of football. With Game Winning Drive, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; teams grind it out on the ground, or throw all over the field for scores. The defensive side of the football is not neglected in Game Winning Drive, as you&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; great defenses in action, and directly impact the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in real football, special teams play and turnovers have an impact in Game Winning Drive Football. You&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; the impact of a short field for the opposing team after an interception or fumble. The dangerous Kick Returner&amp;rsquo;s and Punt Returner&amp;rsquo;s are a factor in Game Winning Drive. No other quick-play game covers all of the elements of football like Game Winning Drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While other quick-play games give you a final result, Game Winning Drive tells the &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; of the game. You&amp;rsquo;ll know precisely why a team wins or loses a contest. Also, unlike other quick playing games, Game Winning Drive adds many strategy elements to add to the realism and excitement of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you go for it on 4th down? Do you go for the 2 pt conversion for the win, or kick the PAT for a tie? Do you try for an onside kick, or hope that your defense can shut down the offense for one final drive? With Game Winning Drive, the decisions are yours. There isn&amp;rsquo;t another quick-playing football game in the market that allows your coaching decisions to impact the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While your decisions may impact the game, your players on the field will ultimately determine the success of your team over the course of a season. Game Winning Drive Football factors each team&amp;rsquo;s offensive and defensive strengths and weaknesses. Each team is rated for scoring, Rushing, Passing, Kicking, Punting, Fumbles and Interceptions on the offensive side. On the defensive side of the ball, each team is rated for Overall Defense, Rushing Defense, Passing Defense, Fumble recoveries, and Interceptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
