							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game â€“ 10 Year Anniversary Edition</name>
									
			<description>Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game is a survival horror board game that pits small-town heroes head-to-head against a horde of zombies. A team of four heroes is chosen by one set of players, with each hero having its own special abilities; the zombies are controlled by one or two players. The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero. The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie. All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game &amp;ndash; 10 Year Anniversary Edition includes a complete and updated version of Last Night on Earth as well as several new additions. The Experience System and Fire Rules, first introduced in the Timber Peak expansion, have been integrated into the original game, as well as new zombie cards, hero cards, a new set of upgrade cards, and a brand new scenario, &amp;quot;Broken Down&amp;quot;. The game includes a new comprehensive rulebook, featuring an updated version of the rules, as well as all of the web scenarios and expansion rulebooks released to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release features plastic miniatures for most counters, including wounds, XP, fire, Old Betsy, spawning pits, gas markers, and even the classic old truck. The CD soundtrack of original thematic music has been remastered and expanded, with new songs being added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the classic heroes are included, plus four new playable hero versions of townsfolk from the original game. Everything comes packaged in a numbered collector's box, and everything in Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game &amp;ndash; 10 Year Anniversary Edition is compatible with all previous expansions for Last Night on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
