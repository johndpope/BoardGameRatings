			<description>A children's roll and move game with memory game elements, based on the Moomin characters of Tove Jansson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moominpappa has lost his black top hats, and the players must help him to find them. The task is not easy, since the Moominhouse is suddenly full of black hats, not all of which belong to Moominpappa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice to move their coloured, hat-shaped playing pieces on the track around the Moominhouse. When a player reaches a Moominpappa-circle she can take one of the hats from the Moominhouse and try it on her playing piece; if it fits, she can keep it (some of the hats are duds and will not fit on the playing pieces). Players can also steal hats from other players if they land in the same circle, and landing in the Hattifatteners-circle means that hats in the Moominhouse must be reshuffled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach Moominhouse with 2 or more hats is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
