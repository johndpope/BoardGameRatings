			<description>Eyegamer &amp;mdash; The Ultimate Board Game To Have Fun And Train Your Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Eyegamer, the goal of the game is simple. The player&amp;rsquo;s task is to collect as many pairs of cards as possible in the shortest period of time.  Eyegamer is a re-implementation of the classic memory game, with a minimalist, black &amp;amp; white card design.  The minimalist design of the cards is designed to make it harder for you to match cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, shuffle and place the entire 40 card deck in a 10x4 (4 rows of 10 cards each) layout.  The cards should be placed so that the patterned side of the cards are face down, and the &amp;quot;Eyegamer&amp;quot; card backs facing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, simply pick any two cards and turn them over, showing the patterned sides.  If they match, remove them from play.  Each matched set should stay with the player/team that matched them.  If the chosen cards do not match, flip them back so that the &amp;quot;Eyegamer&amp;quot; card backs are facing up.  They remain in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, each matched set is worth 1 point.  The player/team with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three modes of play included in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Solo - a 1 player challenge&lt;br/&gt;     Challenge - a 2 player challenge&lt;br/&gt;     Team Deathmatch - Up to 8 players (team sizes of 2 and 4 per team) with team members alternating turns choosing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also purchase multiple Eyegamer decks to create larger grids for the game, thus making the game more challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
