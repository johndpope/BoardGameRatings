			<description>Build a party of heroes, explore rooms in a dungeon, slay monsters (or be slain...) and grab the loot.  Improve your survival chances by using your heroes' special abilities and/or some of the cool stuff you grabbed off the monsters you've dispatched.  Make it through seven rooms and you've survived the dungeon - now tally up the gold value of the items you've escaped with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is simple:  take the attacker's attack value, subtract the defender's defense value and then add in a 20-sided die roll (die included!).  If it's over 10 it's a hit, and you subtract the damage.  Or you can use your Special Ability, or one of the items you've picked up from a prior room.  Repeat until there are no monsters or heroes alive in the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play cooperatively, solo or semi-competitively - all in less time than it takes to convince your gaming buddies that playing an Elven Hunter is not cliche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
