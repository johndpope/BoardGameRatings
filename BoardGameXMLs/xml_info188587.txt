			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Van Buren was the codename given to what would have been Fallout 3, that was being developed by Black Isle Studios before the parent company, Interplay Entertainment, laid off the PC development team on December 8, 2003, effectively cancelling the game. Prior to its cancellation, Van Buren was set to carry on the Fallout series, but was not a sequel to Fallout 2. An official Fallout 3, unrelated to the abandoned Van Buren project, was developed by Bethesda Game Studios after Interplay sold the single-player rights to the franchise to Bethesda Softworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the complete story of Van Buren was never revealed, many important details were divulged prior to its cancellation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's character would start the game as a prisoner; whether the character was wrongfully imprisoned or guilty was to be determined at character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Van Buren (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
