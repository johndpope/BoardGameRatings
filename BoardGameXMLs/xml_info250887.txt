							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pocket Air War: Western Front</name>
									
			<description>Pocket Air War is a fast and lean aerial combat game you can play on a flat surface even of small size. It doesn't need any board to play, but just the pieces included in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this base game you can simulate the epic duels on the Western Front from the Battle of Britain, to the bombing campaign over Germany. &lt;br/&gt;Missions include dogfight, close air support, dive and level bombing anti-ship and anti-subs ops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects one or more planes and collects the specific ruler to move and combat. During your round, basing on your initial speed, you can move your plane using its ruler or turn using the specific protractor your speed dictates. At the end of all movements you can combat using the ruler itself. Planes stats summarized on the rulers are historically accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
