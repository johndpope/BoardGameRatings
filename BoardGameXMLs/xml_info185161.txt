							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strange Shelter (d20)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mini-adventure for four 4th to 6th-level player  characters...The PCs are traveling and are some distance from the nearest settlement. The only signs of civilization are the occasional frontier-style farmstead; moreover, even one of those hasn't been sighted for some hours. As the overcast, dark day is drawing to a close, suddenly a loud peal of thunder booms overhead and drops begin to sprinkle the characters. It is apparent that the sky is preparing to unleash a deluge; the cold wind will make it considerably unpleasant for the heroes to be out in it. But there seems to be no place to find shelter. Then, up ahead, the group sights what seem to be the remains of a medium-sized farmstead, made from logs. Apparently deserted, it shows the marks of a fire because only half the roof remains. All the walls are standing, though, and the place will afford surprisingly good shelter from the brewing storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
