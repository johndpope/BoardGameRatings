			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beast Lord is Hobby Japan's computer game version of Avalon Hill's  Titan board game. This Japanese-only game was released for the NEC PC-9801 series of computers. Many of the icons in the game are taken from Dave Trampier's original artwork for the Titan game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to four players may play together in &amp;quot;Multi&amp;quot; mode or one player can play against up to three computer players in &amp;quot;Campaign&amp;quot; mode. Eight different types of AI are available to choose from in Campaign mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players muster stacks of &amp;quot;Characters&amp;quot; while moving on the &amp;quot;Main Map.&amp;quot; These Characters have the same stats and names as those from Titan (except the Titans; they are renamed Beast Lords). When two opponents have stacks on the same space, they battle on a small hex grid &amp;quot;Battle Map.&amp;quot; Battle Map terrains include Tower, Brush, Plain, Desert, Tundra, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
