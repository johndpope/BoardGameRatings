			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perdition is a story roleplaying game about life on the frontier, specifically the American West. Characters are members of an extended family of settlers, staking their claim on the new land, while dealing with the fears of the unknown. Told over many years, Perdition is the story of prairie life&amp;hellip; and its hardships. Bleak conditions take their toll on the settlers, leading to disease, starvation, and even death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perdition is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
