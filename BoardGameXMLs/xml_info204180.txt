							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bankers &amp; Brokers: The 3D Board Game</name>
									
			<description>It's a race to the top of the corporate ladder in the fast paced family game! Players must use strategy and their wits to accumulate the most money before they retire. Scheme your way to the Chairmen of the Board and then force your friends to pay your debts. But watch out, they might gang up on you and force you into early retirement! Big money, big risks and backstabbing; it's all in a day's work for big business. WILL YOU SURVIVE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the poker variant of a similar name, players compete to have the best hand, betting on each round based on their position on the 3D board. Each position limits the players hand size as well as betting minimum, with loss causing the player to incur debt.  When a player reaches the chairman position, they can pass debts they incur onto lower ranked players. Highest ranked player at the end of the game, who has not been forced into retirement, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
