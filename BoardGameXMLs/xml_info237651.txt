			<description>This is a game of people pushed to the edge and forced to do things they have promised or resolved not to do anymore. There reasons for not doing them as well as the things they can do are known only to them and perhaps the Gamemaster at the start of the game. For most of them, keeping their &amp;ldquo;forbidden&amp;rdquo; knowledge a secret is important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, they are about to be pushed to the edge and those secrets might be the only thing that can save their way of life&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
