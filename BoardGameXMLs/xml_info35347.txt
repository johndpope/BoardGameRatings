			<description>The game consists of 50 cards comprising 22 service cards and 28 play cards. The service cards dictate whether the service is to the backhand, forehand an ace or a fault. The play cards are made up of 5 each of the 4 combinations of backhand/forehand to backhand/forehand and 4 smash and 4 lob cards. Scoring is the same as in lawn tennis. The two packs (service and play) are shuffled and both players receive 4 play cards to form their hand. The server then places the top service card face up to show the type of serve. An ace is a point immediately won and if a fault is drawn then another card is immediately drawn and if this is another fault, the point is lost. If it is any of the other service cards, the opponent can return it only if he has a corresponding card that allows him to play the return type or he can play a lob card. A lob card can only be returned by another lob card or a smash card. A smash can only be returned by a lob. If a player cannot return with the appropriate card then he loses that point. Players replace cards as they are played from the draw deck to make a 4 card hand. Play continues until the correct number of sets (predetermined at the start) is won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
