			<description>&lt;br/&gt;     Game components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Wooden board with two concentric rings of 10 round notches&lt;br/&gt;- 10 small red balls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two games can be played with these components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Fiore: A puzzle game for one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game begins with all 10 balls placed in the internal ring notches. The goal is to move nine of those balls to the outer ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ball is moved four steps to the left or right and, after landing in the destination notch, is moved to the corresponding outer notch. Another ball is then chosen and moved four steps right or left and then outwards. The counting begins always in a occupied inner notch. Empty inner notches must also be counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) Peccato:  a game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game all balls are placed in the outer ring of notches. The balls are moved from the outdoor fields to the internal ones. The player who moves the last ball is the loser of the first round. The starting player may moved none, one or two any outer balls to their corresponding inner notches. Then, players alternate moving one or two balls. Only adjacent balls or else balls laying in opposite notches can be selected to be moved simultaneously in a player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;A number of rounds are played until one player has lost four rounds. The loser of a round is the start player of the next round and decides if moving the last ball will be the winning or losing condition of the new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
