							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ogres of the Fen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of the expansive fen south of Lorview, Stonefar the chieftain rules the ogrish community of Gaundelfen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great goblin army in the southern mountains plague the Gaundelfen and the surrounding hills defending their mines. The ogres maintain a sense of protection for the humans between the unpredictable goblin horde and their village. An unsettling symbiotic relationship has emerged from the precarious situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The residents of Lorview take a little solace in the idea that their southern border is protected when they hear the heavy ogre drumming on the fen. Little thought is given to the Gaundelfen sacrifice or struggles, only that Lorview can rest easy without ogres or goblins razing the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the ogres have come to Lorview, fleeing in terror from their fen. Smashing barns, eating sheep and spilling blood! Horror has struck Lorview as much as it has the Gaundelfen tribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will stop this plague and find out why the ogres have come to Lorview?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What can possibly be happening in the fen when powerful ogres flee in terror from their marsh at night?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
