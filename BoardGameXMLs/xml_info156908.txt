							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basement Crawl</name>
									
			<description>Basement Crawl is a maze-based action game with some strategic elements. Bloober Team's main inspirations were old classics like Spy vs. Spy and Bomberman, and gameplay revolves around setting up traps (self-detonated or activated by characters approaching it or stepping on it without noticing) to hurt other players. It&amp;rsquo;s focused on multiplayer, but basic single player campaigns with bots to fill in for missing characters will be available too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basement Crawl is a 2.5D game with dynamic cameras &amp;ndash; to the game modes, characters and mechanics. &amp;quot;We felt that many games nowadays are dependent on character development or luck and randomness, so we designed Basement Crawl to exclude the luck factor and remove the dependence on leveling-up characters. We want to make Basement Crawl as skill-based as possible and focus on hardcore players instead of casual or &amp;lsquo;middlecore&amp;rsquo; players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basement Crawl supports both 4 player hot-seat and 8 player online play, as well as combinations of both. At the beginning, players start with a selection of 4 available characters, all with their own unique skills balanced carefully against each other. The first three characters are a midget clown, a crash-test dummy, and a girl with a bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basement Crawl was originally rated by the ESRB as &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot;, but was then changed to a &amp;quot;Teen&amp;quot; rating upon release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Basement Crawl&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
