			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wrote your resume, you nailed the interview and now you&amp;rsquo;re a manager at your new company. There&amp;rsquo;s just one thing, the only way to earn your seniority is by trading for it; with office supplies. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to recruit a team and search through desks on your break to find the supplies you need. Trade the supplies in the break room to the department requesting them and try not to break any drawers in the process. You have one work week to get your seniority and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get it by any means necessary or lose your job!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cubicle Raiders consists of 5 Days(rounds) and each Day there will be a number of Breaks(turns) determined by the Department card for that day. During their turn, each player will be able to pick 2 of 3 actions: Search, Trade or Recruit. To Search, a player will move their meeple to a drawer on one of the desk cards that has a supply they need. They will then roll the Search Die to determine if they successfully found the supply, did not find it or broke the drawer. If they found the supply they add the amount to their supply tracker, if they broke the drawer that drawer is no longer searchable. If more than 50% of a desk&amp;rsquo;s drawers are broken that desk is no longer searchable, if 2 desks are no longer searchable the day is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Trade, a player moves their meeple to the breakroom and trades only the supplies the current department is looking for. Each supply is worth so many seniority points determined by the trade ratio on the players supply card. Each player can trade up to 5 Seniority Points worth of each supply during their trade action. To Recruit, a player must move their meeple to the breakroom, they can then recruit another employee by paying the recruit&amp;rsquo;s seniority point cost, this is identified on the recruit&amp;rsquo;s card. These recruits add special abilities to help the player in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the last day is over the player with most Seniority Points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
