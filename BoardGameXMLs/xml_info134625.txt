							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farewell, My Dear Post-Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farewell, My Dear Post-Apocalypse is a one session RPG built for one to four player and one more person to run the game (a GM). The GM will design a game using the brief rules here. Although the game is occurring in a bitter, post-apocalyptic wasteland, it&amp;rsquo;s best to think of the genre as Dark Action Tragecomedy. It&amp;rsquo;s a game about tender humanity and facing one&amp;rsquo;s inevitable death, yes. But it&amp;rsquo;s also about killing diabolical coyotes, hiding beyond quasi-magical lanterns, getting rewarded for being Awesome, and using guns that can explode in your face. It is a game that is just as much about forging new relationships and rekindling old ones during those last few moments. It is a game about slaughtering evil replicant aliens and confronting rogue caravans of thugs and murderers in an attempt to bring about some violent, blood-drenched justice before the bombs go off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
