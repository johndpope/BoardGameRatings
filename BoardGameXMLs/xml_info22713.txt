			<description>&amp;quot;Paying Your Way is a board game where each player is 'employed' in a position from one of twelve different occupational areas when he or she randomly selects a career card. These cards also include descriptions of each career area and a hierarchy of jobs in each area to which they may seek promotion. The board represents various incomes and expenses associated with 'making it' in the real world. Players advance markers around the board according to the throw of one die. Each player keeps track of his or her own financial records and calculates his or her own net pay. The first player who buys all items on an established shopping list is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(This game description appeared in the &amp;quot;Newly Available Simulations&amp;quot; column of the journal Simulation and Games, volume VII, number 3, September 1976, pages 339-340).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
