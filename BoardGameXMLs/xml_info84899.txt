							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blackwell Legacy</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blackwell Legacy is the first case in a miniseries of games that stars a medium named Rosangela Blackwell and her spirit guide Joey Mallone. Their mission, it seems, is to assist tormented spirits and investigate supernatural goings on. They don't understand why they are thrown together, but they do the best they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The duo's first case will involve a series of suicides at a local university. Something unnatural has forced these students to kill themselves, and nobody knows why. Rosangela, who is just coming to terms with her new status as a medium, finds herself cast as the unwilling detective in this gruesome mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
