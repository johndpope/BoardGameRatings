			<description>Color Sheep is a fast-paced arcade game in which players change Woolson&amp;rsquo;s color to match oncoming wolves by mixing different intensities of red, green, and blue light. An intuitive swipe-based interface makes forming combos a breeze. When Woolson is charged, tap him to release an incinerating laser blast! Magical items dropped by enemies summon fantastical nature spells to protect Woolson and smite the evil lupine invaders. With adaptive difficulty, over twenty color combinations to master, and Facebook integrated leaderboards, Color Sheep is easy to learn but hard to put down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Mix red, green, and blue to master the power of light!&lt;br/&gt;     Discover Woolson's arsenal of spectacular spells!&lt;br/&gt;     Climb the leaderboards and best your friends and family!&lt;br/&gt;     Works great and looks amazing on your phone and tablet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Color Sheep requires players to perceive a wide range of colors and is not recommended for those with color blindness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
