			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grey Duck is a lively, fast-paced game. The custom pyramid deck structure is a unique break from the 52-card deck paradigm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grey Duck is played in tricks where players follow patterns of sets of cards (forms). Grey Ducks are cards that can be played out of turn to extend previously played forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored based on the order in which players plays all the cards from their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person with the highest score after 12 hands is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
