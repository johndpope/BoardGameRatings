							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tavern Battle</name>
									
			<description>This game begins when most of the role playing game ends.&lt;br/&gt;The heroes are coming back from their adventures fighting monsters and gathering treasures. But still, the dwarf is missing his axe, the magician is looking for his book with new spells, the Elf wants his enchanted lantern back. So every character is looking for something important to him.&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase of the game each player tries to get the item he wants back by negotiation. If that fails, well, then we will have a hefty battle in that tavern and one sure thing we know is that there will be not a single chair left intact after that fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game consists of 110 cards (12 different characters like Trolls, Goblins, Paladin, Orc etc. and lots of items), dice and a rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
