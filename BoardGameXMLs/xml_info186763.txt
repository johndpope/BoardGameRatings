			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation involves establishing a name and personal history and then selecting three Skills and three Items.  Skills and Items may be anything agreeable to player and GM, though Skills should be concise and easily understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-trivial task resolution uses a die or dice pool rolled against the GM's or opponent's die or dice pool.  The single highest die from each is compared and the highest one wins.  Ties indicate a round of ineffective action.  Generally, a single die is rolled.  Appropriate Skills or Items add an additional die to the pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters begin each game session with three or more &amp;quot;Experience Dice&amp;quot; which may be added to the pool on any roll.  Once used they are discarded for the remainder of the game session and are replenished on the next session.  Characters that do well during a session are awarded an additional Experience Dice for the next session forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat involves grid movement and initiative.  Combat is resolved in the same way as any action.  Characters sustain three levels of hits; a fourth hit is lethal.  The rules include the nice touch of a single-sentence option for Fantasy, Horror, and Space Opera genre implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules typically are distributed with a dozen or so pre-generated characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
