			<description>The player will be able to identify the nationality of a person based on social interactions which include visual or written information about that person's country or culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player attempts to be the first to determine the nationality of the person described on the situation card and place a corresponding nationality card on the table. Each player must place a nationality card on the table OR forfeit one card to the discard pile. (Discarded cards remain out of play for the rest of the game). If two or more players place cards on the table simultaneously, then all cards for that play remain on the table and a second situation card is dealt over the first and players must attempt to match the second situation. Whomever wins the second play gets all of the cards on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GAME IS OVER when every situation card that can be correctly matched to a nationality card has been played. If a player runs out of nationality cards, she is out of the game until points are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;61 cards&lt;br/&gt;- 25 Situation Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 36 Nationality Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
