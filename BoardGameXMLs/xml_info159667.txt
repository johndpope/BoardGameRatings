							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Light Speed Cup</name>
									
			<description>A high speed death race against the clock. Drivers have a limited time to out wit, out manoeuvre and out pace the competition. Their fission powered Skimmers speed along future highways ramming each other and firing dangerous energy weapons to try and secure a win in the controversial Light-Speed Cup. When the race starts the clock starts and players have until the time runs out to wipe their opponents off of the track. They can aggressively pursue the other racers and try to destroy them, they can speed ahead and try to force the other vehicle off of the end of track or they can duck and dodge allowing the other Skimmers to tear each other apart before speeding home to victory. Which ever player&amp;rsquo;s Skimmer is in the best condition when the clock reaches zero wins the Cup. This game is a thrill packed adrenaline ride where mayhem reigns and there is never a dull moment!The LSC moto is Action Not Protraction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This games puts 2-6 players in control of one Skimmer (futuristic race car) each. They race each other along an never ending  treadmil like race track that is made out of 4 rolling tiles. When the race starts an electronic timer is started, it has between 10 and 15 minutes on it per player, and when the timer runs out and the buzzer souds the game is over. Durring the game players have to ram and shoot at each other to try and destroy the enemy skimmers before the timer runs out. Each skimmer has different strengths and weaknesses and players get to choose their own drivers which also have unique talents. There is another way of destroy other skimmers and that is to get so far ahead of them that when the track is rolled they fall off of the back of it. In this way the lightly amoiured fast skimmers can win the game aswell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
