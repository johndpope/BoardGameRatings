			<description>(Publisher's Blurb)&lt;br/&gt;Pointman Hacker Thief is a quick, lightweight roleplaying game that allows a group of players and a game master to participate in epic espionage missions spanning the entire globe, from Hong Kong to New York City. This book has everything you need: A complete game system, including character creation, combat, hacking, equipment and NPCs, as well as a multiple modern spy settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat in the world of PHT is quick and brutal, as it is in real life. But, as they say, if you&amp;rsquo;ve been spotted, perhaps you deserve to be gunned down; you are a spy, after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHT doesn&amp;rsquo;t make use of classes, like in other RPGs. Players are encouraged to create their characters freely without having to fit them into archetypal roles. Pointman, Hacker and Thief are the character&amp;rsquo;s basic attributes, which measure their capabilities in combat, academics and stealth, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game more than 6 years in the making, Pointman Hacker Thief is the perfect lightweight modern RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
