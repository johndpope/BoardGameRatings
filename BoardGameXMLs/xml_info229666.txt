			<description>A card game based on Galaxy of the Guardians Movie and Comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 Decks: &lt;br/&gt;-    The Guardian Deck.  Each Guardian card will have one or more Traits: Hero, Ship, Gear, Tactics, Star Lord, Pirate, Nova Corps, etc. Guardian cards generate force points which are needed to capture Adventure cards. Guardian cards have a base force between 1 and 5. In combination some Guardian cards will generate additional Force. &lt;br/&gt;-    The Adventure Deck.  The 12 Adventures have a force between 17 and 25 requiring multiple Guardian cards to be melded to complete them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start flip over the top card of the Adventure deck and deal 5 Guardian cards to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 5 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Peril Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     If an Adventure was completed last turn, flip over the top card of the Adventure deck. Normally there will only be 1 face up adventure card at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Hero Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    If your hand is less than 7 cards fill it to 7.  Otherwise draw 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard a Tactics card to draw 2 cards (max once this phase). &lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard a Pirate card to look at one of your opponents&amp;rsquo; hands and steal 1 card. &lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard a Place card to discard your hand and draw 7 new cards. &lt;br/&gt;-   You may discard a Ship card to look at next Adventure card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.    Adventure Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may play cards to make a meld. &lt;br/&gt;-   The combined force of all cards in the meld must equal or exceed the force of the current Adventure in which case you complete it and put it in your Victory Pile. Then discard all cards in the meld.  When making a meld, you can only use one card representing an individual Hero, or Ship, or Thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.    End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Max hand size is 8 cards. Discard excess cards. You may also discard additional unwanted cards as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all Adventure cards have been completed.  The player with the most force points worth of Adventure cards in your Victory Pile at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
