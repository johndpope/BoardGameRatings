			<description>Like its previous game, the player takes a short &amp;quot;personality test&amp;quot; to determine his starting deck and then can win additional cards by defeating opponents as well as new monster cards by defeating dungeon bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player's deck consists of three monster cards and an additional fifty attack/defense/support cards. Monster cards start in play, have HP, and a type (either ground or air). Attack are always specific to one monster breed, defense cards can be specific to one monster breed, and support cards. To use these cards, a player usually has to pay an activation cost in the form of a resource called &amp;quot;guts&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Monster Rancher Battle Card Game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
