							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rules for the Greatwar 1914-1915</name>
									
			<description>A booklet with tabletop rules. It contains all necessary rules and tables to simulate actions from early World War I with 15mm miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various chapters of the booklet contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game scale: 1 figure represents 50 infantry men; 1 MG with crew equals 1 MG with crew, and 2 ordnance pieces equal 1 battery consisting of 12 men and 4 horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement rules cover all kinds of hindrances, chances of mechanical failure when moving motorized units, and unit formations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morale rules cover all kinds of movement under fire, behaviour under fire and regrouping; every possible situation is handled by employing various dice roll modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat covers basically two situations: fire combat for rifles and MGs and artillery. Both types of combat are handled by rolling 2 dice and employing various modifiers for movement, cover, unit quality, etc. Damage is then determined by a dice roll on a table using the result calculated above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melee combat covers special actions between infantry vs. infantry as well as infantry vs. cavalry and cavalry vs. cavalry. Retreats and advances are possible in melee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last pages of the book show the organisation of the British Expeditionary Force and the Imperial German Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center of the book contains a removable sheet with all necessary tables and modifiers for easy reference during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
