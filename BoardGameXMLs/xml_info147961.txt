							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Border Wall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a Border Wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, Hex and No Ovelays and includes the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The border wall is built into a mountain, making it hard to destroy. Some of you say it&amp;rsquo;s impregnable. I will prove you wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is a map of a border wall and fort built into a mountainside. The main border wall is the road to along the north edge of the map built into the mountainside. Three stairways descend down to the ground level. The second level down has a watchtower on it used for signaling other border wall areas of an impending attack. The ground level is a rocky surface surrounded by high fortification walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is intended for fantasy settings. The gothic-style archway architecture makes it fit well in a Greek or Roman-themed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The border wall is an excellent location for a major fantasy battle between two countries or the forces of good and evil. Enemies scramble to get over the southern and eastern walls climbing with grappling hook and rope or massive ladder towers, or charge down the northwestern road (or both) as the defenders struggle to light the signal fire and fight off the enemies. The rocky ground level could be used as an area for catapults or other arcing siege weapons to deter enemies from the east or south. Infantry are used to protect the northwestern road instead. Archers on the fortification wall provide support to both sides. Can the group break through the border wall or survive the onslaught?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
