			<description>Nurkanvaltaajat is a Finnish economy game where you're supposed to gather a certain amount of property as soon as possible by buying and selling shares of companies. An unlucky situation can lead a player to bankruptcy and out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prices of the shares vary randomly according to share price cards and a player can sometimes be offered with cheap shares. Players use pencil and paper to stay on track with their stock portfolios because the amount of shares isn't limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is decided by the players so its playing time may vary a lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
