							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earth Encounters</name>
									
			<description>Earth Encounters is a board game fueled by the concept that conversations among friends ignite big ideas that not only impact our world, but make it a better place as well. Earth Encounters brings the Einstein in all of us to life. It&amp;rsquo;s not only fun to play, but it sparks dialog among friends, brings value to our community, and perhaps can even change our world for the better! Earth Encounters is anti-trivia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the Timeship Encounter. An alien creature escaped the timeship and is hiding somewhere in the Eastern Time Zone. Encounter launches an elite team to recapture the alien creature. Players travel across the U.S. and the seven continents, competing to be the first to locate and capture the powerful yet invisible alien before it awakens and consumes all the knowledge possessed by Earth&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. Throughout this adventure, each player learns about the states and continents as they collect as many states and continent deeds as possible &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;ll be needed when you come face-to-face with the alien creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can only advance by correctly answering a question from the Q&amp;amp;A Deck or successfully completing a thought experiment from the Challenge Deck.   In doing so, if they are the first to land on that particular state or continent, they are awarded a State Deed of Trust.  That means the state or continent is now under the players protection from the alien. The player who protects the state where the alien is hiding is considered the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
