							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypts of Indormancy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tomb of Thuuz, Lord Nanifer, Elven General of the Western Isle, has been found. The Islanders he once exploited and terrorised would gladly hurl his bitter carcass back into the ocean. Others, hearing of an untouched crypt in the mountains, no doubt filled with all the pomp and pride of an aristocratic burial, arrive with less ideological motives for defilement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crypts of Indormancy is a location-based adventure possessing ecumenical compatibility with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and its descendants. Appropriate for any number and level of players, all who enter the tomb of Tuuz without their wits ready will likely come undone. For Thuuz&amp;rsquo;s heirs did not leave his bones helpless and unguarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crypts of Indormancy is written with the relentless wit of Ezra Claverie and illustrated by Andrew Walter&amp;rsquo;s unbidden alien hands. Never before has such a conjunction occurred and for all our sakes pray it never does again lest our feeble minds slough away like wet cake in a rainstorm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
