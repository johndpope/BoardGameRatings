							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Space War Campaign Game</name>
									
			<description>Despite the name, The Space War Campaign Game devotes more than half of its length to rules for tactical space combat. These rules, which are designed for use with spaceship miniatures on a tabletop, use written orders. The system is fairly detailed, with rules for several different types of weapons, tractor beams, tanks  firing from planetary surfaces, boarding combat, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a campaign game, which uses the tactical rules to play out combat that may occur. This too uses written orders, submitted to a moderator who creates the game map (a sample is provided) and adjudicates. Players can build factories and conduct research to improve their technology in various areas. Optional rules allow for players to create their own ship designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
