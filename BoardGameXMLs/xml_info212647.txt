							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Klondike Gold</name>
									
			<description>Players start out from Skagway with a &amp;ldquo;stake&amp;rdquo; of 1000 ounces of gold. They make their way, with many adventures along the road, to Dawson City and the Klondike Region. Along the road they may be caught in a blizzard, or lose their way along the trail, or they may be attacked by snow blindness, wolves, or chance upon various other adventures and hazards of the trail. At Dawson City players may speculate in various concessions, or they may continue on to the Klondike Region and try to make a gold strike. Once the gold strike is made a player must continue on the trail to the Land Claim Office (with adventures good and bad on this trail, too). Once he has successfully registered his claim and made his way back to his mine he searches for Nuggets of great value. When one of the players has earned his second Nugget the Klondike Adventure is over and players tally their gains from all sources. The prospector who has gained the most gold on his trip is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
