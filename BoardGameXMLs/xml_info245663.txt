			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown Armies Campaign Starter Kits help you get started running your Unknown Armies campaign quickly. Each kit features the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Five characters, broken and damaged and ready to go&lt;br/&gt;    One group objective for the cabal to pursue&lt;br/&gt;    A first session scenario to get things moving quickly&lt;br/&gt;    GM hooks, additional objective ideas, GMCs, and suggestions for the antagonist phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this campaign starter kit, you have all that you need to fuel your imagination and get things moving. The kit takes the place of the initial planning and collaborative character and setting creation system provided in Unknown Armies. Players select a character, choose one or two additional relationships with the other player characters, and make these obsessed individuals their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Young Practicals, the PCs are a cabal of upstarts in the occult underground, each of whom is guilty of some horrible deed that could ruin them. During the campaign, these aspirants to the inner circle of the magickal community confront their pasts and fight for their futures, seeking to avoid a fate much worse than death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
