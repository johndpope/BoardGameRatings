							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero: Tales of the Tomes</name>
									
			<description>Hero: Tales of the Tomes is a multiplayer card game in which each of the players takes the role of a legendary hero and battles it out until only one is left standing. The gameplay is fast and exciting. With all the potential for twists and comebacks, you'll never truly feel out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most unique aspects of Hero compared to other card games is that all of the players play off of one shared deck. No prior deck building or collecting is required. You can just grab a few friends, sit down, and play a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
