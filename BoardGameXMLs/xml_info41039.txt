			<description>Splatch, Katch, Shlak!&lt;br/&gt;It's a collectible game similar to pog but it uses larger discs made of metal. Each player put on the ground a pile of the same number of Shlaks (the metallic discs). With the use of a Splatch (a sort of giant plastic hand) the pile is hit and shuffled around. The player, in their turn, try to catch as many shlaks as possible using the &amp;quot;Katch&amp;quot;, a sort of monstrous head with a magnet at its bottom controlled using an elastic cord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
