			<description>&amp;ldquo;Cribbage - The Board Game&amp;rdquo; is a simple, fast game for anyone who enjoys playing the traditional cribbage card game. Unlike the traditional card game, the board game can only be played with two teams and therefore cannot be played by three players. Fortunately (and uniquely) this cribbage game can be played very well with six players forming two teams of three. Each team alternates play by placing a card on the board from their dealt hand. The board is a five by five grid with a face down card in the center revealed only after all cards are played. At the end of each round one team will score the cribbage &amp;ldquo;hands&amp;rdquo; that form the &amp;ldquo;rows&amp;rdquo; while the other team scores the cribbage &amp;ldquo;hands&amp;rdquo; that form the &amp;ldquo;columns&amp;rdquo;.  Every card placed will become a card in one of your cribbage &amp;ldquo;hands&amp;rdquo; on the board but will also be a card in one of your opponents &amp;ldquo;hands&amp;rdquo;. The trick therefore is to strategically place cards in such a way to help yourself but hinder your opponent. The board also has card values printed on some spots for instant scoring. Placing a queen on a spot on the board with a queen printed on it will score an instant two points - just as matching a pair during regular play would in a traditional cribbage game. Placing a five on the same queen spot would similarly score an instant two points for the fifteen. Final scoring is done after all spaces are filled using the same procedure one uses for a traditional cribbage hand. First team to 121 wins. If you like to play cribbage, especially with a group, this is a fun twist on one of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
