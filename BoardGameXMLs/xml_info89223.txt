							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: Cranston Snord&#039;s Irregulars</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo; Cranston Snord's Irregulars have widely different reputations, depending on who you ask. Katrina Steiner thinks of the unit as one of the most effective, if unorthodox, units in her employ. House Marik would like to rid the Inner Sphere of the unit and has been trying for many years. Jaime Wolf sees the unit as a band of looters who have made good. One way or the other, the Irregulars are probably best known for their ability to get into and out of tight spots created by their never-ending quest for the lost artifacts and/or treasures of Mankind's past. Whether called looters or not, they are still a unit to be reckoned with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario set details the history of Snord's Irregulars, profiles the statistics and conditions of it members and the company 'Mechs, and includes 14 scenarios pitting the Irregulars against the wide variety of opponents they have fought throughout their colorful past. Also described are some of their more memorable treasure hunting expeditions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
