							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cockpit of Europe (Miniatures Wargames)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Being a game of genteel warfare for two players desirous of campaigning in the manner of the 18th century.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cockpit of Europe was published as an article in issue No. 49 of Miniatures Wargames magazine in May of 1987. Despite its source this is not a set of miniatures rules, but a paper-and-pencil game of conducting campaigns and sieges in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. It allows two players without a referee to re-create the &amp;quot;limited&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;scientfic&amp;quot; wars of the period dominated by methodical sieges and maneuvering armies against the enemy's line of communication instead of pitched battles. While not detailed, it is rich in historical flavor, not in the minutiae of weapons and tactics but the general's big picture of moving armies within the constraints of supply and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games consiste of several campaign seasons of twenty weeks. Armies must return to winter quarters each year, so only fortresses captured will be retained from season to season. Collecting intelligence is key, or you won't know if your siege train can reach the enemy and create a practicable breach before their supplies run out, or winter sends you home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the warfare of Marlborough and Vauban!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
