			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CREATION of the world&amp;rsquo;s preeminent Fantasy Role-Playing Game (FRPG), Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;reg;, is one of the most fascinating tales to be told in all the shared histories of entertainment, play and game design.  Two very different men, David Lance Arneson and Ernest Gary Gygax, undertook an unprecedented collaboration which gifted us &amp;mdash; as their shared legacy &amp;mdash; with one of the most intriguing games the world has yet experienced.  Their game did not just simulate one isolate corner of reality; it dared to encompass the entirety of all realms of adventure, the consensual playground of the human imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAWK &amp;amp; MOOR tells the story of Dave and Gary, and the many other people whose efforts gave first life to the game we know and love today.  Arneson had spectacular ideas, but Gygax knew how to refine them.  Collaboration soon turned to conflict as Arneson believed his game was being taken from him, and Gygax crystallized systems where incomprehensible riddles had stood before.  Both men were creative geniuses, but the game they created from Gygax&amp;rsquo;s Chainmail (1971) was the end result not only of their teamwork, but also of their clashes and disagreements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAWK &amp;amp; MOOR Book Two:  The Dungeons Deep tells the tale of all that came after Blackmoor in the World of Greyhawk.  Herein you will find the adventures of Robilar, Tenser, Terik, Murlynd, Lessnard, Quij, Otto, and Zagyg the Mad himself.  Mysteries such as the Old Guard Kobolds, the orc hordes, the Thouls, the Black Dragon Labyrinth, the Great Stone Face, the demon lord Fraz-urb&amp;rsquo;luu, the Jeweled Man, the Nine Demigods, the Isle of the Ape, and the slide to Cathay are all explored as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAWK &amp;amp; MOOR Book Two:  The Dungeons Deep includes 86,500 words on over 370 pages, supported by over 470 footnotes and annotations.  The adventure continues as we delve into the sinister and wondrous dungeons beneath Castle Greyhawk.  Prepare yourself, take up torch and sword.  Come along and experience an unprecedented journey into the Golden Age!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
