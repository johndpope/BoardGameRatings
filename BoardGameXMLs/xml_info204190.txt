			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is based in a town called Benden, which is directly off a major trade route and is a major support to the trade route. There is a Merchants Guild in the city that is responsible for holding funds for passing merchants, finding good guards for merchants, and providing safe places for merchants to store their goods. The town has just over 2,000 permanent residence with sometimes twice that amount passing through and saying each week. Benden was raided twice by ten goblins in the past month, the first time about four weeks ago and the second a little over one week ago. Both times the southern most end of town, which is where all of the merchants live, is where the raids where conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 2nd level characters.  Usually distributed with a GIF image (map).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
