			<description>Quote from instruction booklet (1976):  &amp;quot;America has finally made the commitment to change its weights and measurement system from the Anglo-American system, which we now use, to the metric system.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents (from box lid):&lt;br/&gt;1 instruction sheet&lt;br/&gt;1 reference booklet&lt;br/&gt;50 playing cards&lt;br/&gt;9 game boards&lt;br/&gt;60 miniature metric rulers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:  One person is selected to be the caller, and takes charge of the deck of cards.  The rest of the players get different game boards depicting 9 objects or people and corresponding US measurements such as &amp;quot;7oz bottle of soda&amp;quot;.  The caller reads off a metric measurement, and then players say if they believe they have the matching US measurement depicted on their card, they get to cover that picture with a miniature metric ruler.  The first player to cover all of the pictures on their cards wins the game.  If answers are disputed, players can refer to the reference book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
