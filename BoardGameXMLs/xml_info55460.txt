			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dance and the Dawn is a romantic fairy tale game wherein you play Ladies as they attempt to discover their One True Love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays the part of the Narrator (and will control the Duke and Queen, as well as several Lords), and the other players will each control one of the Ladies. Each Lady is trying to determine the character of the various Lords, and must pick one as their One True Love at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is inspired by the imagery and symbolism of chess: each character is represented by a chess piece, and each piece has its own characteristics and implications. There&amp;rsquo;s a light setting with plenty of room and guidelines for you to fill in the rest; the text also includes some suggested settings and pre-created characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flow of gameplay is structured: there are three dances (with duels being held as an interlude between the dances). Within each dance, the players move their Ladies and their chosen dance partners around the board. The Ladies exchange questions and answers with their partners, attempting to gain a Lord&amp;rsquo;s favor while understanding the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will dance until dawn, when each Lady will select one Lord. If they select their True Love, they will find a happy ending. (If they select someone else, their outcome will be less pleasant.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dance and the Dawn is suitable for 3-5 players of all ages. It plays in 1-2 hours. All materials necessary to play are included, though having an actual chessboard and pieces on hand is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
