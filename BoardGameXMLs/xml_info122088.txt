			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long awaited sequel to Is This Seat Taken? Only it's not really got anything to do with that, except that it uses an NPC as one of the PCs... and it was actually written before &amp;quot;Is This Seat Taken?&amp;quot; anyway. Confused yet? Then read on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cult comic creator Wilbur Fields has been invited as guest of honour to a convention held on the Mediterranean island of Al Amarja. His agent is there with him to make a movie deal with the representative of a local company and the fans have turned up in force for the Q&amp;amp;A session. Some of the questions that will arise, however, are things that should never have been asked and no-one is going to like the answers&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt; Another Over the Edge party game for 4 to 8 players, plus a GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
