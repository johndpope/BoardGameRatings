			<description>Rover Rummy consists of a deck of 51 cards, divided into dog &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot; - fronts, rears, bodies, heads, legs and tails. Each set of parts (except the tail) is divided into colors which denote the correctness of the body parts. Green being poor, then Yellow (fair), then Red (good), with Blue being the best (excellent). Each player is dealt 6 cards per hand. Play progresses by a simple &amp;quot;draw and discard&amp;quot; method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to win the required amount of points to obtain a Championship on your &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;. A Championship is obtained by accumulating 15 &amp;quot;points&amp;quot; (based on the combined values of the colored body parts forming one &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;) over the span of several hands, and 2 major wins ( A major = a hand of 3, 4 or 5 points). The rules of winning a Championship in this game are the same pointwise, as winning a real Championship. The first player to lay down a complete &amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; wins a hand. The hand is counted by adding up the point value of each of the body parts, or in the case of a complete &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; dog, the point value assigned to that dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
