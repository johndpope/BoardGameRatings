			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Two hundred years in the future, Earth is a deadly wasteland, ravaged by nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.  Humanity lives in exile, clinging to life on a multitude of space stations in the Solar System.  These stations are the High Colonies, the last hope of mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;High Colonies is a role-playing game set in 2188.  Players assume the rules of men and women struggling to succeed in a dangerous society.  They face threats from alien creatures, bio-engineered renegade soldiers, fanatical tyrants and desperate pirates.  Only the bold will survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;High Colonies is an easy to learn, playable and realistic game.  Everything from character generation, to rules for robots, is designed to maximize ease of play without sacrificing realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;High Colonies includes extensive background material as well as a detailed future history.  This provides a fascinating environment for players to explore, and gamemasters can be sure that they are dealing with a consistent and intelligently planned science-fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Also included is `Hard Times at Lyric 3,' a ready to run adventure scenario that enables you to begin playing High Colonies almost immediately.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
