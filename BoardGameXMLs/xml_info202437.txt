			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The president has recently signed the Professionally Accountable Positivity Act, a law that authorizes a national database that can track negative people who undermine economic growth and social progress with their negative attitudes. The Profound Positivity movement has already had great uptake in the software industry, and expanding it to cover everyone can only make things better. The company you work for, Sunshine Solutions, has just landed a government contract to expand your proprietary database service to implement nationwide coverage. Management knows that completing this project on schedule will prove challenging, especially given how short-staffed your division is, so they've brought in a positivity consultant from Blythe Associates so you can get the maximum benefit from the power of positive thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the players will play software developers employed by Sunshine Solutions, one of them will also be the project manager. Another won't play a specific character but will be the GM who is responsible for playing the rest of the world, preparing some things before play begins, and generally managing and coordinating the flow of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
