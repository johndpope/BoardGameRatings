							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Big Show Prelude: In the Service of the King</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nazis have you, dead to rights. The air in the tramp freighter&amp;rsquo;s cargo bay is hot and steamy, a sure sign of a failed life support system and a ship on its last reserves of breathable air. Hauptmann Abendroth and his soldiers surround you. The triumphant looks on their faces are visible through the armored glass faceplates of their pressure suits. It would be nice if you were similarly attired. The professor, Wang Bao Li, lies collapsed on the floor in front of you, probably already dead. The British will not be happy, but at least you have his files secured in your backpack. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably still get paid. Or, at least, your next of kin will.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;ldquo;You vill drop your veapons unt hand over the professor mit his papers,&amp;rdquo; Abendroth says, his voice tinny over the pressure suit&amp;rsquo;s intercom. &amp;ldquo;I assure you, the German Star Empire vill deal mit your crimes justly.&amp;rdquo; You don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s the Death&amp;rsquo;s Head insignia on the front of his helmet or the ridiculousness of the situation and his statement, but holding back the laughter is quite a chore.&lt;br/&gt; Welcome to The Big Show. The heroes are assumed to be agents for hire in the employ of the British Special Service. Their mission, or rather the end of their latest mission, is at hand. Commissioned to retrieve the Chinese industrial scientist Wang Bao Li from the German freighter Blaubrandt, the heroes have reached a crisis point. With the ship failing and the group surrounded by Nazis, they may feel a bit overwhelmed. Pointing out that their characters are in the center of a standard Pulp dilemma, in media res, hopefully should assure them that their characters aren&amp;rsquo;t dead before the adventure even starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
