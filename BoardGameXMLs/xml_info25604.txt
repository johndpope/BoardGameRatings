			<description>Elemental Warriors II is an abstract dueling game for two players with an elemental magic theme.  You start the game with a standard poker deck, an Elemental Warriors II play sheet, and a limited number of coins.  The play sheet is divided into 10 columns (number 1 to 10) and 5 rows (labeled Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Combat).  Before the game begins, you allocate your coins to spaces on your play sheet.  During the game, you draw and play cards to activate columns on your play sheet.  Your combat value and any effects you generate are determined by the coins in the column you activate.  Earth effects tend to prevent damage.  Water effects tend to add coins to your play sheet.  Fire effects tend to deal damage to your opponent.  Air effects tend to let you move the coins on your play sheet or draw extra cards.  These special powers enable you to change your strategy during play and adapt to your opponent's behavior.  When you take damage, you lose coins from your play sheet.  If you surrender or run out of coins, you lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
