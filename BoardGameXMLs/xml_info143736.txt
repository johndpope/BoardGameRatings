							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hughesville High</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hughesville (not to be confused with that town where Christmas was almost stolen) is a happy little suburb of Chicago sometime during the 1980s. Home to Hughesville High, Hughesville is that town you see in most every 80s teen movie, especially those by John Hughes. It&amp;rsquo;s a content little place during a content little time when Reagan was president, America was the most totally excellent nation that ever was, and all was good and right with the world, at least to the extent that anyone in America cared to pay attention. Greed was good, communism was bad, and music videos were starting to become &amp;ldquo;a thing&amp;rdquo; thanks to some no-name cable channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hughesville High is a roleplaying game about high school kids in the 80s. High school kids with unusual powers and abilities, sure, but high school kids nonetheless. It&amp;rsquo;s a lighthearted game intended to evoke the classic teen movies of the 80s, with the modern-day teen-monster shtick and other weirdness thrown into the mix for good measure. Unlike today&amp;rsquo;s teen-monster genre, however, Hughes isn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be taken even slightly seriously. Hughesville High is much more Weird Science and much less Twilight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters in Hughesville High are ordinary teens living through the strange days of the 1980s, trying their best to live normal lives while dealing with the abnormal situations that keep coming their way. They may be aliens, monsters, robots (yes, robots), or whatever else, but more than that, they&amp;rsquo;re teenagers, looking to survive high school, score a date for the prom, and avoid doing anything that could end up on their Permanent Record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powered by the rules-light and narrative heavy TNT game engine, Hughesville High is a fast-playing almost no prep time game.  If you have an hour or two to play and nothing ready, if you want a break from dungeon crawling and running through shadows, if you just want to have some fun in a roleplaying game that doesn't involve killing your way across an entire continent, come try Hughesville High!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
