			<description>Ever play a game of chess and say &amp;quot;I wish I hadn't made that move&amp;quot;? This chess variant allows you that possibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction, by G K Gifford:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;...A standard 8 x 8 chessboard and 32 piece set are used. But you may need two extra Kings for each side (or markers to represent them). To play face-to-face, i.e., over-the-board, you will need 5 score sheets for each player. Some of the sheets may go unused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to checkmate your opponent, or to win by having one of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Kings (or King) &amp;quot;Lost in Time&amp;quot; during his time traveling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play Time Travel Chess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move as in western chess. The difference is that they can travel forward in time up to 10 moves. In addition, the King can travel back in time up to 5 moves...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
