			<description>The last of four wargames introduced in 1898 by Parker Brothers themed around the Spanish-American War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All four games were action based and involved the players shooting wooden bullets at die-cut soldiers using hand-held spring-loaded cannons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although not a commercial success, the series of four games contributed greatly to Parker Brothers image as a patriotic American company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first three games in the series were The War in Cuba, The Siege of Havana and The Battle of Manila.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
