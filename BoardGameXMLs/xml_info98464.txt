			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! Race to scoop up as many gold doubloons as you can carry, but watch out! The pirates are on your trail! How much of the treasure can you collect before Long John Silver collects you! Score points for every doubloon and treasure chest you can steal from the pirate crew! A frantic, fast-paced game, and the action never stops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're searching for treasure on the golden sands of Pirate's Island. The beach is literally covered with gold doubloons.  But the treasure is cursed! It is guarded by a hideous skull and crossbones which follows you around and attempts to destroy you. Race to scoop up the treasure and escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the skull and crossbones (the spirit of Long John Silver!) guards the precious treasure very closely, he will occasionally get careless and move away from it. This is your chance to move in with the joystick and steal it from him. He will pursue you all over the island, so you will have to move quickly to elude him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have picked up the last piece of gold in the sand, another entire screen of treasure will appear. The value of the treasure will increase and you will also get an extra turn. But, be forewarned, the more gold you steal, the angrier you will make the spirit of Long John Silver. He will pursue you more rapidly than ever before - so run fast or you will not survive for long!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
