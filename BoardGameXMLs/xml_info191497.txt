							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paladin&#039;s Secluded Citadel Map Pack</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this the starting point for your Paladin's crusade, or will it be the bloody ending? Have you come to spread your god's message in a foreign land, or are you defending against the savage heathen invaders? Will this sanctuary that's stood in the desert for generations serve as a base for your new mission? With D20 Cartographer, the story is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paladin's Secluded Citadel is the seventh in a series of One Dollar Dungeon maps, which represent convenient starting locations or class-specific adventure locals for each traditional RPG character class. Paladin's Secluded Citadel is an onion-domed fort in the desert with an Arabian Nights flavor: a perfect setting for crusaders! Three stories tall and a rooftop level, the citadel fort is mapped out in typical 1 in. = 5 ft. map format.&lt;br/&gt;Included for your convenience are several different formats including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Full color map in a single .jpg (versions with and without grid)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; High contrast black and white map in a single .jpg (great for printing on parchment textured paper)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; PDF of the sliced images for your home printer, compatible with US Letter and A4 size paper&lt;br/&gt;D20 Cartographer also supports Virtual Table Top systems and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 100DPI gridless .jpg with objects removed&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; An object file folder with over 18 new .png objects for private reuse in other maps&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A MapTools .rpmap VTT file with vision blocking and objects set up for you. The Maptools file requires version 1.3b84 or higher to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print Guide for the sliced PDF: When printing in Adobe Acrobat, remember to turn &amp;lsquo;page scaling' to &amp;lsquo;None' and uncheck &amp;lsquo;Choose paper source by PDF page size.' This will ensure the appropriate size and scale of the map and 1-inch grid. Previously, we released a separate A4 and US Letter file. This version and printing practice now prints properly to any page size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
