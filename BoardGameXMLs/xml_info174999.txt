							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One-Minute Waterloo</name>
									
			<description>This year will mark the 200th anniversary of the Waterloo Campaign. This struggle has been depicted by numerous conflict simulation games; it is certainly one of the most popular subjects in the wargame hobby. One-Minute Waterloo is a microgame attempting to portray the battle of Waterloo with a small map and a handful of counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Minute Waterloo is a solitaire challenge. The entire battle only takes about 60 seconds to play. However, the game offers a player most of the tactical choices available to Napoleon in 1815. The player represents the Emperor with historical factors like defensive terrain, Prussian reinforcements, support from reserve formations, and the Imperial Guard contained in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1815 Napoleon said the chances for a successful outcome were 6 in 10. During a typical One-Minute Waterloo session the player faces similar odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This companion game to the previously released One-Minute Bulge is a free Print &amp;amp; Play game with a single 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; map, eight playing pieces, charts, rules and a few markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
