							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chyrefal Castle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chyrefal is the principal settlement of the island of Ikom and shire moot of Melderyn&amp;rsquo;s Ikoshire. The majestic castle town is home to H&amp;acirc;rn&amp;rsquo;s premier Odivshe chantry, an ancient megalith circle, and a gigantic haunted burial tumulus. The sheltered harbor is home to a large fishing fleet and the annual spring seafarers&amp;rsquo; fair attracts boats from all over eastern H&amp;acirc;rn. Chyrefal is held for the king by Sheriff Balsen Torele. Communication with Cherafir can be difficult and the crown leaves Ikoshire very much on its own. The sheriff holds moots irregularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chryefal Castle article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of its craftsmen and other locations. Included are GM and player local maps as well as interior plans of the castle and the nearby chantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics release. Portions of this article were originally published in 1992 as part of Hârnlore 11. The article has been upgraded new color artwork, redrawn maps, and expanded descriptions of the town locations. In addition, this article includes floor plans and descriptions of the castle citadel that were never before available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
