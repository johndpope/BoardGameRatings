			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Budget beat'em up game with a boxing theme. The owner of Joe's Gym is threatened by thugs who want to take over his business. He hires six men to take on the gang of thugs. The game is split in two parts, a joystick-waggling game in which the goal is to punch a bag as many times as possible, and the proper beat'em up part in which the player battle thugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
