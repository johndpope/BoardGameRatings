							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Dart</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds, if not thousands, of these cheap and versatile spaceships have been produced over the years. They were intended for use as workhorse spaceships for freight companies. Unfortunately, the manufacturer cut too many corners to produce an entry-level spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iron Dart has a reputation for unreliability and defects in design that is second to none in human space. The spaceship is so unreliable that this supplement includes a whole section on malfunctions that can be used for players unlucky enough to be flying it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iron Dart is an ideal first spaceship for a party of adventurers. It is very underpowered and unreliable and players will have to work hard to survive encounters that are the least bit challenging. It is also uncomfortable and cramped enough to encourage players to go looking for something better, to go looking for adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
