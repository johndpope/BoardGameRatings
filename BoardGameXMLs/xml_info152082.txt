			<description>The Dutch game association Ducosim publishes the game magazine Spel!. With this magazine they will publish several 'Spel!enkaarten' (gamecards). These are games which fit on a A5 card. #0009 is BattleStack and was published for the SpellenSpektakel convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a diceless variant of Katoiz. Just as in that game, the board consists of a 6x6 board build up with tiles. These tiles have 3 characteristics: form (square, triangle or circle), color (blue, red, green, yellow or white) and size (big or small). Next to that, each player puts a home tile next to one of the corners in his own color. To move the tiles around you can move a tile horizontally of vertically if 1 characteristic with the adjacent tile corresponds. To move diagonally, 2 characteristics have to correspond. Different to Katoiz, instead of rolling dice to determine which tile you can move on your turn, here you move tiles in a fixed order by color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect a stack of four tiles on your home tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
