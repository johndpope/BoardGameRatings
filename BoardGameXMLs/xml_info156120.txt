			<description>SOCK-O is a game of dexterity and chance.  The game's chips are divided evenly between the players.  One player will be the &amp;quot;Socker.&amp;quot;  The other players each take a wooden ball with a string attached and place it into the center of a ring on the table, holding on to the string.  The Socker then holds a rubber cup in one hand and rolls a pair of six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever the Socker rolls a seven or eleven (SOCK-O!) he must then slap the cup down and try to catch one or more of the balls in the ring.  If he catches someone, they must give him a chip.  If he fails to catch someone, he must give them a chip.  Players who pull away prematurely are penalized a chip.  If the Socker mistakenly slaps the cup down, he is penalized a chip for every player whose piece is still in the ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Socker continues rolling the dice until he has had three SOCK-O's, at which point he trades with the player to his left and play continues with the new Socker.  The player with the most chips when the game ends (by default or agreement) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
