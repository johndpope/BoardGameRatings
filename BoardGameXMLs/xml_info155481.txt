			<description>In this pirate game players fight each other in the Caribbean sea in order to conquer the towns the governors of the four major powers (England, Spain, France and the Netherlands) dwell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the victory conditions all the players agreed on before starting, the game ends as soon as a players either controls three (longer game) or two (shorter game) governor towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to amass the resources they need to gather their attacking force, players may perform missions, attack merchant ships or pirate vessels, produce goods and sell them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship movement follows the direction the included spinner indicates, which simulates the wind rose and as such the direction all ships need move to for that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
