							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chaos Effect: Godlike</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Effects: Godlike is a superheroic adventure campaign released for a general OGL &amp;amp; D20 Superhero system supplement introducing a major story event that greatly enhances a character&amp;rsquo;s super-abilities, with sobering consequences. In the early stages of the arc, the character appears to be in control of her new powers, or at the very least, capable of learning control, but as time wears on, the situation worsens. The character&amp;rsquo;s newfound abilities affect such profound change in her that her allies, even her closest friends, may no longer recognize her. As her powers continue to grow, her self-control dwindles, and her very humanity suffers. When, in a fit of madness, she steps over the line, using her newfound powers to commit some heinous crime, the other characters must decide whether their teammate is capable (or even worthy) of redemption. If you are looking to build an epic level adventure in the OGL &amp;amp; D20 genre, then this is the PDF for you. Best of all it is OGL and D20, so you can use it with the world most popular RPG rule set and should be easily compatible with any OGL and D20 Superhero genre based systems on the market today. This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     What is &amp;quot;Chaos Effects&amp;quot;: Using Godlike &amp;amp; Important Concepts&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter One - Preparing: Knowing the Players &amp;amp; the Characters&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter Two - Campaign Integration: Power Scale, The Premise, The Power, Power Use, Power Use - Ability Pool, Power Use - Narrative-Based Control, On Weaknesses &amp;amp; Storyline Phases-Plot Events&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter Three - Archetypes: The Receptacle, The Dark Half, Other Archetypes, Best Friend, Lover, Mentor, Rival&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter Four - The Nature of the Power:  Naming Powers, Power Types, Sample Powers &amp;amp; Power Type, Cosmic Powers, Divine Powers, Elemental Powers and various others&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter Five - Non-Player Characters&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter Six - Adventure and Plot Hooks&lt;br/&gt;     Nearly 20 All New Feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
