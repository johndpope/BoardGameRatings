							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Companion: Shanthas of Jorune   ...and a Ramian</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Shanthas of Jorune... And a Ramian is a convention pre-release. It details for the first time in print Jorune's most mysterious race, the shanthas. These eyeless natives easily manipulate the isho, or ambient energy, to do many things, including weaving orbs and bolts of great sophisticaton. Their powerful technology for creating dyshas, warps, sarceens, evids, cle-eshtas, and the powerful elip-ston are described within. You will learn how the shanthas evolved on Jorune, understand their seven religious sects and read their mythology. The shanthas themselves will be described physically, and many questions left in the past to reader's imaginations will have answers&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
