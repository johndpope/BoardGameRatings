			<description>&amp;quot;Rivality is a massively multiplayer online  browser-based strategy game developed by the Swedish software company FunRock Media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivality is currently available in five different languages, including Swedish, Norwegian, English, Dutch and Spanish. It has previously also been available in German and Finnish, but these servers are for now closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivality is programmed in ASP and runs in most modern browsers (such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer). Rivality can also be played on many newer smart-phones, but does not provide a separate mobile version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New players start out with a small land, in which he or she can start constructing a military base. There are several types of buildings available, such as Administration building, oil pump, oil refinery, barrack, factory, guard tower and more. The oil pumps are used to gather oil from the ground, which can be sold for money in the oil refinery. The money is used to produce units such as soldiers, tanks and aircraft. The units also have an upkeep cost, which means that the player must always keep money in the base to pay them, or they will leave. The units can be used for protection or be sent to attack enemy bases. They can also be used to reinforce other players' bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When advancing in the game, it is possible to produce engineers, which can be used to construct additional bases in the game. 50 engineers are required for each new base. The players can also conquer enemy bases by attacking them with a general. Each time a base is attacked by a general, the base administration building level will be reduced by one, provided that the general survives the attack. When or if the administration building has been destroyed, an attack with a general will conquer the base for the attacking player.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rivality&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
