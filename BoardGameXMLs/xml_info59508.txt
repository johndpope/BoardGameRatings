			<description>There are two games playable with this material (a square board, 11 x 11, and a number of playing pieces). In the actual &amp;quot;Andromeda&amp;quot;, players try to tow enemy spaceships to their own bases, the movements determined by dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Starship Alpha 11&amp;quot;, players try to encircle a starship. This ship, however, can jump around the board on a roll of 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
