The title was announced at Activision's E3 2008 press conference.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game takes place on a mysterious island known as &amp;quot;Katorga-12&amp;quot; where Russian experiments involving &amp;quot;E99&amp;quot; took place during the height of the Cold War era. Sometime during 1955, a terrible catastrophe involving experiments attempting to form a &amp;quot;Singularity&amp;quot; occurred on the island, causing the island's very existence to be covered up by the Russian government. The player controls Nate Renko, a Black Ops soldier who is sent to investigate bizarre radiation emissions coming from the island.

After regaining consciousness, Renko discovers that the island is constantly shifting between the time periods of 1955 and 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Singularity (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
