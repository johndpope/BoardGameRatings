			<description>Throughout the history of mankind conflict is at the core of our evolution, evident in each generation with war and expansion of territories to show dominance of one empire over its rivals. Such aggression is not a choice of right or wrong, but is instilled into our DNA through the course of evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This strategy game challenges players to execute military war tactics, allows for population growth, encourages development of city infrastructure to fuel the economy, forces long term rewards to be weighed against immediate benefits, and calls for the management of your civilization's resource expenditure. Winning is a combination of dice rolls and decision making. The key to success is using your economic engine to fuel growth and strategically engage in battles to weaken your opponent and strengthen your dominance on the map. Victory points are gained through killing enemy population, building a city capital, being the peace maker, acquiring special events, and conquering enemy land. No one strategy wins the game but is a combination of several of the victory points to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the game is played section: Players have two choices at the start of their return, (1) Improve Economy or (2) Battle. Improve Economy allows 4 action items for the player; (1) Roll dice which generates resources for all players by collecting resource cards based on dice outcome and the location of their pieces on the game board, (2) Player draws their own event card which generates additional resource cards, (3) Using resources can purchase buildings, population, and increased military strength and placement of those pieces on board, (4) Tactical movement which allows for 1 unit to be moved on board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, Battle allows 4 action items (1) all military units can be moved on board, (2) Engagement in battle which results in offensive pieces on board attacking defensive pieces and outcome decided by die roll, (3) Acquire a special event card through dice outcome, (4) Using resources can purchase buildings, population, and increased military strength and placement of those pieces on board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How are units killed and battle outcome decided section:&lt;br/&gt;Offensive team rolls X number of dice based on the strength of their military, and outcome of dice is based on value rolled:&lt;br/&gt;(1) capture civilian&lt;br/&gt;(2) kill civilian&lt;br/&gt;(3) kill military&lt;br/&gt;(4) kill military&lt;br/&gt;(5) nothing&lt;br/&gt;(6) special event&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defensive team rolls dice, and outcome is based on these values:&lt;br/&gt;(1) kill military&lt;br/&gt;(2) kill military&lt;br/&gt;(3) steal resource cards from offensive team(called Cost of War)&lt;br/&gt;(4) nothing&lt;br/&gt;(5) nothing&lt;br/&gt;(6) nothing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purchase of the following can be made:&lt;br/&gt;Barracks; generates Military based on dice roll&lt;br/&gt;Bank; generates resources cards based on dice roll&lt;br/&gt;Fort; provide military defensive mechanism when being attacked&lt;br/&gt;Fortification; provide first line of defense when being attacked&lt;br/&gt;Civilians, allows for collection of resources based on dice roll&lt;br/&gt;Infantry, allows player to initiate military attacks&lt;br/&gt;Land purchase, allows player to control more tiles of board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to win, first to 6(2-player game) or 7(3-player game) Victory points:&lt;br/&gt;Manifest Destiny; placement of 6 civilians on 1 tile; 1 VP&lt;br/&gt;Established Capital; all buildings + 6 civilians on 1 tile; 2 VP&lt;br/&gt;Peacemaker; 2 unused special event cards, 1 VP&lt;br/&gt;Conqueror; capture enemy owned tiles, 2 VP&lt;br/&gt;Slaughterer; 10 kills by military; 2 VP&lt;br/&gt;Genocide; 18 kills by military; 3 VP&lt;br/&gt;Assimilation; capture enemy capital; 3 VP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
