							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Circlet of Pilazer the Scintillant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Circlet of Pilazer is a multi-stage module written with the OSRIC system (with some monsters from an older iteration) and is a module for six to eight player characters of 4th to 6th level. It is advised that a competent cleric or two, maybe a druid accompany the party. The random (truly random) encounters can be vicious but the treasure possibilities are enormous. The DM might want to pare either or both. It takes place in the Kingdom of Peace otherwise known as Paxland landing in Venicia through Prissia, climbing the Ironteeth Mountains, through Kyria and Golanda, downriver in Paxland across the Western Ramp and into the Rampagian Range to the Lake of the Ram all the time chasing the mysterious and elusive Circlet of Pilazer the Scintillant, a legendary illusionist who had a circlet of power and rumored to possess a significant horde if only one could find his last habitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
