							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fidchess</name>
									
			<description>Fidchess is an attempt to create a chess-like game for Stonehenge, using just the original parts in the Stonehenge game. Its name comes from the Celtic game Fidchell, which has been called &amp;ldquo;Celtic Chess&amp;rdquo;. Fidchess has little to do with Fidchell, except that they are both abstract strategy games. The name of the piece are derived from Celtic numbers, except for &amp;quot;Rigant&amp;quot;, which means &amp;quot;Lord&amp;quot; in proto-Celtic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: To either capture an opponent's druid or all 10 of the opponent's disks that are used to make up pieces in the game.&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Stonehenge board (outer track). Outer track is four spaces wide (combining day and night spaces as one space) and 30 spaces round, using spaces 1-8 only.&lt;br/&gt;10 green disks and 10 yellow disks&lt;br/&gt;1 green and 1 yellow figure (Rigants)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has either captured their opponent's druid or eliminated their opponent's Oins, Duos, Peths, or Teths (and Quens in Quen variant) from the board, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
