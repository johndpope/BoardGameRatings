			<description>The airship marked a turning point in society. Now the skies were open to exploration, commerce, and illegal activity. The clouds became hiding places for Speakeasies, black market dealers, and much more unsavory activities. As a result, the Sky Patrol was created to help keep the peace. In an attempt to avoid being arrested during a recent &amp;ldquo;job&amp;rdquo;, you have accidentally wrecked your airship along with a few unlucky others. Fix your airship as quickly as possible to avoid certain incarceration!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll dice trying to match them to a type of component (using simple icons). Once you know what it looks like, you search for a token that has the same icons, trying to recover a piece of your airship. Once recovered, airship components grant special abilities like making your turns easier or even griefing opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all the tokens are useful. Most of the time, the player will select a token that is of no use to them and place it back in the pile. Memorization skills are necessary to ensure a player doesn't needless pick up the same token again and to remember where opponents have placed tokens the player needs. But with the special abilities that can be earned, the tokens can be shifted multiple times per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect all of their tokens to complete their airship wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
