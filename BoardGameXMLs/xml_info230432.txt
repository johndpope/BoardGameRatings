			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack Sparrow... um, Captain Jack Sparrow is back in business!  Along with other pirates he hunts for the mythical Trident of Poseidon, which controls all the seas of the Earth. But to succeed, pirates have to join forces with sworn enemies. Will the legendary pirates manage with it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are taking card from the characters deck and have to collect the group of different pirates together (duplicates are resetting). Then ships cards are taken. The next step is convince the opponent to attack the fleet. Loot is dispensing by the leader of the attack, so everyone should think wisely - agree or not to attack. The winner is the richest player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
