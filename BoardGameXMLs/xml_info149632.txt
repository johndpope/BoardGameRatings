							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Trek: Attack Wing â€“ Command Tokens Resource</name>
									
			<description>The Command Tokens set is a participation prize given to players who participated in Month 2, &amp;quot;The Battle of Chin'toka,&amp;quot; of the Star Trek: Attack Wing Storyline Organized Play Event, The Dominion War. It is considered a Resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resource:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Beginning with Month 2 of the Dominion War Organized Play Event, &amp;quot;The Battle of Chin'toka,&amp;quot; each player may equip their fleet with exactly 1 Resource. The Squadron Point Costs for Resources are located on the Resource Reference Cards. Players may choose from among any available Resources for the Dominion War Storyline OP, but cannot change Resources between Battle Rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Command Tokens set allows a player to choose 5 tokens from a set of 10 and place them on the token bar.  Once each round, that player may use the ability of 1 Command Token and flip it over, not to be used again during that battle.  Each token allows the player to either take one of several free actions (Evade, Battlestations, Scan, or Target Lock), re-roll attack or defense dice, add one attack or defense die to their own dice pool, or predetermine the outcome of one attack or defense die in a roll.  The Command Tokens set may be added to a squadron for 5 Squadron Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
