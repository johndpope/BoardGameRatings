			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a Name Like &amp;quot;Souleater&amp;quot; It's Gotta Be Good&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you receive a call from your old friend Dr. Green asking for a favor, you immediately agree. After all, nothing could be wrong with spending a weekend in the British countryside, right? Unless, of course, it happens to involve a dilapidated old insane asylum plagued by strange disappearances and freakish events. And that's just the beginning. As you start to unravel the mystery of Psukhe Asylum, you'll encounter dark secrets from the past, sinister specters, an eery little girl and an elusive foe that cannot be named. And although you can't prove it, you just know the answers you seek are locked behind that huge, iron door in the basement - the one with no key that sends cold shivers up your spine. But even if you COULD open it, you're not sure you should...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Souleater is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
