							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Puppy Lake</name>
									
			<description>A game of saving adorable puppies for 1-3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic Puppy Lake game is a solitaire game involving puppies, a lake, Mean Old Man Hubbard, a truck, a canoe and still more puppies. Players must attempt to maneuver their canoe to save as many puppies as possible before they drown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mean Old Man Hubbard drives his truck back and forth across a bridge, tossing puppies into the lake. Puppies float downstream towards certain death. The player has limited control over how far he or she can paddle the canoe each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for 2-3 players include multiple canoes and even a Mean Old Player option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puppy Lake is a quick playing humorous game about a sad and serious subject. Not intended for impressionable youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
