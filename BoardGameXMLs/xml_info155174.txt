			<description>One Piece: Romance Dawn is a role-playing video game based on the One Piece manga and anime series, released in Japan and other parts of Asia for the PlayStation Portable on December 20, 2012 via retail and the PlayStation Store. A port for the Nintendo 3DS was released in Japan on August 8, 2013 via retail and the eShop. It was also released in Europe on November 29, 2013 and February 11, 2014 in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game covers the first half of the series from Luffy's early adventures in the East Blue to the battle at Marineford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically a dungeon crawler with RPG combat similar to other role-playing video games. It uses turn based battles and action commands which can help the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can travel through a couple of random dungeon stages with a little of exploration or focus on story-driven stages, with no exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cutscenes are told in manga style, which makes them a bit static.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;One Piece: Romance Dawn&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
