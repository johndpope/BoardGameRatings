			<description>&amp;quot;Art of Fighting​ (龍虎の拳 Ryūko no Ken, lit. &amp;quot;Fist of Dragon and Tiger&amp;quot;) is a trilogy of competitive fighting game titles that were released for the Neo Geo platform in the early 1990s. It was the second fighting game franchise created by SNK, following the Fatal Fury series and is set in the same fictional universe. The original Art of Fighting was released in 1992, followed by two sequels: Art of Fighting 2​ (龍虎の拳2 Ryūko no Ken 2) in 1994 and Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior​ (ART OF FIGHTING 龍虎の拳 外伝 Art of Fighting: Ryūko no Ken Gaiden) in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art of Fighting 3 (Ryūko no Ken Gaiden in Japan) featured a new cast of characters with the exception of Ryo and Robert. Yuri Sakazaki is seen in the game, but only as a side character in Ryo and Robert's story mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story switched focus from the Sakazakis to Robert Garcia. Garcia disappears to search for an old childhood friend, Freia Lawrence, and he tracks her to GlassHill, Mexico. Freia is wanted by the game's boss character, Wyler, to complete a powerful elixir that was created by his and Freia's fathers. The drug affects users in a similar manner as the potion in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the game's characters, Kasumi Todoh, became a part of The King of Fighters cast.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Art of Fighting , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
