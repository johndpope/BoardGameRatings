			<description>Reach the top of the rock wall to complete this solitaire game, which uses a standard piecepack. In the game, you control the climber's hands and feet and also the position of the body in relation to the extremities. Find a way to move upwards choosing spots that are strong enough to support your weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles make up the wall and the coins (suit up) the spots you can hold on to. 4 dice represent your 4 extremities and a pawn your &amp;quot;center of gravity&amp;quot;. When you place an extremity in a spot you can hold on to, you flip the coin and it shows the maximum weight it can support. In addition, the farther an extremity is from the &amp;quot;center of gravity&amp;quot; the less weight it can support too. After moving the die to the new spot, you place it showing the weight it supports. The trick is to support your whole weight between the 4 extremities. Then, move your center of gravity to a new position where you can reach newer spots, finding your way through the wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
