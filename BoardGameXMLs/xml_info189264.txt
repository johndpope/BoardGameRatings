			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest that began in Black Willow Gorge continues in Caverns of the Blood Howlers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clearing is quiet and still.  The last sounds of the battle fade into the dismal depths of the gorge and the past day&amp;rsquo;s events return with shocking clarity.  The struggle through the strange, hazardous land and the battles with its bizarre, deadly inhabitants brought you here, to this clearing, yet the object of your quest is not here.  Her fate and yours now lay beyond the huge doors of ancient, verdigris bronze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures Caverns of the Blood Howlers is the second part in the two-part Blood Howlers adventure.  The adventure takes the characters beyond the great bronze doors where there is yet hope of completing their quest, if they are brave enough, tough enough, to make their way past the deadly inhabitants, dangerous traps and strange encounters that await within.  Succeed, and they can return as heroes.  Fail, and the characters may not return at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Module includes a new Adventure Record, 9 Adventure cards, 9 Encounter cards, 9 Event cards, 9 Search cards and 18 Treasure cards.  In addition, to capture the old school dungeon feel we&amp;rsquo;ve included several areas that are detailed in Custom Encounters and Custom Encounters II.  If you want to add more variety, strange events and encounters, you can expand on these adventure areas with cards from Custom Encounters and Custom Encounters II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caverns of the Blood Howlers takes the characters on an old school, dark and deadly dungeon delve, full of dangerous foes, strange sites and fabulous treasure.  Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, Caverns of the Blood Howlers can be played solo or with a group, with or without a GM.  The adventure is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards.  In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Module is a new, simple way to play fantasy adventures.  The organization and presentation of the adventures allows for quick setup, quick play and gives you the ability to focus on the action and &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; while leaving you the option to include tactical action and combat if you desire.  Enter a new and exciting world of adventure, full of wonder and surprises.  Enter the Caverns of the Blood Howlers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
