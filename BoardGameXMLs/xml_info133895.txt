							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Icarus Twins</name>
									
			<description>Icarus Twins is a futuristic, unmanned rocket race in which you attempt to out-distance your opponent within seven seconds without totally destroying your rocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take control of one of two different rockets: the Tiamat or the Fatboy. Each rocket uses a different press-your-luck dice mechanic that caters to different playing styles.  Players who enjoy high risk and high rewards will feel at home with the Tiamat while players who like to calculate the optimal path to victory will enjoy piloting the Fatboy.  During the game players will roll dice to increase the speed of their rockets, but pushing too hard may cause your rocket to disintegrate before the race ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a persistent ranking system and lifetime record cards to track each player's accomplishments between games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
