			<description>Welcome to the Slash! movie, set in Camp Bloodshed USA, where every teenager is a target and every dark corridor hides terrible danger. Of the eight teenagers spending the night at the Camp Bloodshed cabin, only one will be alive at dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From three to six players will take part in this hour-long bloodfest. To win, players have to guess which characters will die and when. They must then use their action cards to make it happen, tempting some with sinful activities, while protecting others with virtuous deeds. Meanwhile, lurking in the darkness, Slash! awaits, and every time his card is drawn, one hapless teenager dies. Who will live through the night at Camp Bloodshed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
