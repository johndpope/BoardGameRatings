							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Peril of Ardun: Incursion Into Newiron</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Turan tribes on the high steeps of eastern Tibbenian have banded together and are on the offensive! They call themselves The Order of the Red Blade, and are moving east, recruiting or enslaving humanoid and human tribes as they go. The Order has entered the territory of Fallmeade, and threatens to occupy its capital, Clydwyn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find yourself in the mining town of Craldash, in central Ardun, a country to the south of Fallmeade, just beyond the Oktan Mountains. You are approached by a representative of the local governor who says her employer is looking for a stout party of adventurers to help him with a little problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her contacts have reported some unusual activity near an old abandoned temple to the west. A garrison of Red Blade soldiers has entered the temple grounds and set up shop. The governor would like the garrison removed or at least run off, along with any other information you can find. Are you up to the task?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fantasy adventure compatible with first edition gaming and OSRIC. Recommended for 4-6 characters of level 2-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
