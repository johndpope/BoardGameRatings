			<description>From the publisher &amp;quot;The Entropy System is a set of basic rules for role-playing games (RPGs). These rules are used for our first game, Bif! Bam! Pow!, which lets players enjoy gaming in the world of comic-book superheroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be easy and fun for both beginning role-players and veterans. Characters can be created in a few minutes, without a calculator, and without being simplistic stereotypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters may be created using the standard, random generation system, or using an optional, point based system. The random system actually blends pure random dice rolls with player design by means on an extra dice roll, called a Specialty roll. The results of this roll are extra points that can be distributed among the ability scores in any way you want, allowing you to shore up weak areas or supercharge things that you are already good at.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes dozens of pre-designed powers, and rules for creating more, so the options are nearly unlimited.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
