			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;T-Mek&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T-Mek is a two-player, sit-down, virtual reality fighting arcade game manufactured by Atari Games in 1994. Each player can choose their MEK (a hovering tank with special weapons and abilities). One player can play against 6 AI players and the occasional Boss, or two players can play against each other and 4 AI players. There is a special Tournament mode where two players can go one on one. Up to three T-Mek cabinets can be linked for six-player competitions. T-Mek was later ported to DOS and the Sega 32X; rather than linking multiple systems together, the home versions featured split-screen multiplayer for two players. The 32X version was poorly reviewed, while the DOS version was met with fair reviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atari could not compete with the Japanese game manufacturers in hardware development, so T-Mek did not offer a great leap in graphics or computing capability. As a result, T-Mek was one of the first arcade games to offer an effective surround sound solution, which Atari euphemistically named &amp;quot;CAGE Audio&amp;quot;. Each player's station had four fairly high quality speakers; two in front and two behind the player, and a subwoofer mounted directly below the seat, which was quite effective in rattling a player in battle. T-Mek has no background music soundtrack, which was a departure for &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; arcade games in the coming-of-age era of digitally sampled audio, and instead relied upon the sound to help aid the player in finding enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
