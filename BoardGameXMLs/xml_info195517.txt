			<description>Welcome to Chicago. Don&amp;rsquo;t smell the gunpowder in the air or the scent of perfume coming from the whorehouses or the aftershave of the mobsters hanging around the corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stay alert, grab your bucks before your enemies beat you to it, build your gang fast and better than all the rest.  Because the next thing you smell could be the flowers on your grave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based by an innovative system of play called &amp;quot;confronts&amp;quot;: each mobster, according to his skills to do an action, must confront the power of the Gang (coming from influence tokens) with all other powers in the same district.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the players plays a Boss of a Gang on Chicago or the Police Chief at the beginning of the 1920. To rule the city, as Boss, you must command your mobsters as pawn to earn money coming from robbery, run clubs and assassinate enemies. If you represent the Law, instead, you must fight the crime with your policemen, closing the clubs, capturing mobsters and also try to send one of the Bosses to jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
