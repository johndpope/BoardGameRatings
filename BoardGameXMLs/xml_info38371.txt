							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HipBone Games</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The HipBone Games are board games in which players link one fact or idea with another, claiming points for each link.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board made up of ten spaces connected to one another by lines. A variety of boards with varying layouts and connections are available. Current boards include Psyche's Board, Tenstones, WaterBird, Pentagram/Mercedes, and Circuit Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns writing &amp;quot;ideas&amp;quot; into vacant spaces on the board. In competitive play, players score points &amp;quot;by claiming links between the idea in their own move and the ideas already in play in those positions on the board connected to it by the lines of the board in question. A link can be any form of association - similarity, opposition, cause-and-effect, metaphor. Fanciful links may be made and enjoyed - or hotly contested.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The HipBone Games are based on the concept of the Glass Bead Game described by Hermann Hesse in his Nobel-winning novel, Magister Ludi. They are foremost among current attempts to bring Hesse's game concept into implementation.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
