			<description>Spinning a top knocks balls into holes numbered 1-8. The rules sheet indicates that each player should take 5 turns and the player with the largest number of points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules do no indicate how many players but more than 4 seems unwieldy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One game seen has 7 red balls and one yellow ball. The yellow ball was noted to be of a different material. In some games a special colored ball scores in some special manner such as double point value. However since the rules don't stipulate any such special scoring presumably the game originally had 8 red balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
