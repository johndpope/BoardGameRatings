			<description>Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;Players have to make others guess words by giving positive and negative statements about the term in question and without mentioning that word. By doing so, they practice argumentation skills and looking at something from different angles.&lt;br/&gt; Game play&lt;br/&gt;The game can either be played in teams (4 or more players) or everyone against everyone else (up to 5 players). The stack of cards is placed face-down next to the board. Each of the cards has a word on it (e.g. &amp;quot;talk shows&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;mobile phone apps&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;EU enlargement&amp;quot;). The starting player starts by giving a positive statement about the word on his/her card. If a player guesses correctly, both the player who explained and the one who guessed move 6 spaces on the board. If the word isn't guessed, the same player has to use a negative statement next round, and if successful both players get to move 5 spaces (one space less per round that it takes to explain the word). The player whose token reaches the finish line first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
