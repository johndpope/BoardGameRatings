							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pillage &amp; Plunder: The Viking Longship Game</name>
									
			<description>A game supposedly reminiscent of Viking games of old, this game was first available in museums with the &amp;quot;Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga&amp;quot; traveling exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's web site (edited):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pillage &amp;amp; Plunder are two Viking brothers roaming the High seas in their Longship looking for fame and adventure. Pillage &amp;amp; Plunder is a game of luck and skill. Players take turns loading barrels onto the deck of the Longship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful! Keep the load balanced or you will dump all of the hard won treasure right into the Sea. Play Pillage &amp;amp; Plunder alone as a skill toy and see how many barrels you can fit on deck. The movable men and thousands of barrel positions will provide hours of entertainment for yourself or a group of friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pillage &amp;amp; Plunder is a fun toy and game for the whole family. Easy set up and rules make it an instant hit with young and old alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viking children played with many types of toys that we would recognize today. Lifelike toys such as dolls, toy animals and especially wooden toy boats, were extremely popular with children in Scandinavian lands during the time of the Vikings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural materials like wood were the obvious choice when it &lt;br/&gt;came to making toys in those legendary days and Acorn Games strives to keep that spirit alive today. Each Pillage &amp;amp; Plunder game is made out of solid wood and stained in natural, earthy tones to evoke the warmth of the early toy makers and to give you years of pleasure and a game that you can pass along to future generations of game players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Pillage &amp;amp; Plunder Game comes with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Decorated wooden Dragon Longship&lt;br/&gt;    * Wooden Pillage and Plunder pieces&lt;br/&gt;    * 18 hardwood &amp;quot;Treasure&amp;quot; barrels&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 color coded wood playing die&lt;br/&gt;    * playing instructions parchment&lt;br/&gt;    * felt lined box with clear-vu lid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
