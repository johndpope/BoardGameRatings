			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hilarious and insightful game where... &amp;quot;Everyone has an opinion and every opinion counts!&amp;quot; - if you match!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;The object of Elephonkey is for teams of 2+ players to score points by matching their opinions with those of their teammates by listing and ranking the top 5 answers in each opinion poll.  During each round, each team draws an opinion poll card and a category on the card is chosen by rolling the provided dice (one die decides the category while the other determines the point values).  When the timer begins, each player begins listing their opinions (e.g. Top 5 Bruce Willis movies) on one of the provided pads. After 90 seconds, players compare their answers with their teammates and are awarded points for direct and indirect answers, unless otherwise stated. The game ends once one team reaches the pre-determined number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
