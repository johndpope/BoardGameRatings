							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Right Wrong: The Joys of Syntax and Lex</name>
									
			<description>Each player places his/her colored marker on the start circle of their game board (there are 4 individual game boards with 50 squares on each). Working in a clockwise direction each player attempts to answer 'right' or 'wrong' when read a sentence from one of 500 question cards. These sentences will have one word in them that is the questionable word and the player should determine if the word was used correctly in the sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before giving their 'right' or 'wrong' answer pertaining to the validity of the sentence the player will roll the die. If the player gets the meaning of the word correct they move forward the number shown on the die. If incorrect they move backwards the same number. The first player to reach square 50 on their board is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ex. - She added LOVAGE to the stew on the stove. &lt;br/&gt;LOVAGE = An herb of the parsley family. &lt;br/&gt;So, if they answered 'right' then they move forward. If they answered 'wrong' then they move backwords. Simple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
