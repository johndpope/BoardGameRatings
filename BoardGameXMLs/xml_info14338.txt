			<description>The aim of the game is to be the first to make $1Billion in drug (legal) sales.  It is a game of strategy and some chance.  You need know nothing about the drugs or the law or anything else, just like in Monopoly.  You can choose to either get patents on your drugs or not.  You need never develop any drug, but instead can simply sell related drugs to those that others have already developed.  You can make up to $192Million in a single turn, and someone can be $500Million ahead and still lose.  &lt;br/&gt;Each turn you roll to get money from $1-3Million.  You choose to develop a drug or not.  Early decisions in the game will affect later strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
