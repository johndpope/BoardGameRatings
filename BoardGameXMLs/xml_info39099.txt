			<description>Guess What I Am! - The Hilarious New Twist on a Classic Guessing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 different games suggested to use with these components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Am I?&lt;br/&gt;Everyone receives one of 30 mystery character cards with a hole for them to place their face in. The cards show cartoon outlines of animals and community members (a pig, a lobster, an astronaut, a cowboy, etc). Your face replaces theirs, which looks really silly, and everyone can see what you are except you. Each player rolls a die and asks questions about their card to deduce what it depicts. The die tells them whether they can Ask, Guess, Lose a Turn, Reverse Direction, etc. Questions must be Yes or No: for example, &amp;quot;Do I have a lot of fur?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Do I wear boots?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Do people drink my milk?&amp;quot; A tally sheet is used to keep track of which characters aren't on your card, based on the answers given by the other players. The first person to correctly guess what their card depicts is the winner of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Challenge&lt;br/&gt;Each team gives clues to a player on their team who is wearing the card. They are allowed only five clues (three for advanced play) before the player must guess who they are. The first team to guess correctly wins a chip; first team to five chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charades&lt;br/&gt;Players select a card that only they can see. They then act out the card and each player in turn gets one guess. The player who guesses right gets two chips and the actor gets one.  Then another player chooses a card and is the actor. First person to collect ten chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lightning Round&lt;br/&gt;One team gets all the animal cards, the other team gets all the people cards. Players use one card at a time and guessers are only allowed one clue from their teammates. The team who guesses the most cards wins the round; if you guess the entire pile you get 3 bonus points. Card piles are shuffled and swapped. At the end of that round whichever team has the most chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
