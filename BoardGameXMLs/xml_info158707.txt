			<description>Rummy Runners is a card-melding territorial game for The Mystique Deck and a standard Hexpack, in which 2&amp;ndash;4 players compete to claim 3 hexes in a straight line, or any 4 contiguous hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of the nature of the hexpack, the board is modular, and the setup can be completely different every time you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you may meld a set, you must draw a card. Valid sets are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a group of three or more of the same number&lt;br/&gt;     a flush of three or more of the same suit&lt;br/&gt;     a swatch of three or more cards of the same color&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the &amp;quot;Rummy&amp;quot; part of the name implies, you may scavenge cards from other players' melded sets in order to flesh out the set you are melding from your hand.  After melding a set, if you have two or three of the three colors of a suit-number combo, whose matching hex has not yet been claimed, you claim it permanently. Furthermore, if you control a majority of the  hexes 1&amp;ndash;5 of that suit, you immediately (and permanently) claim the null.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several variants, as well:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Controlled Zoning &amp;mdash; Setup is not random; instead, players take turns adding hexes to the board.&lt;br/&gt;     Border Disputes &amp;mdash; Hexes claimed with just two colors can be stolen; however hexes claims made with all three colors are still permanent.&lt;br/&gt;     The Hard Way &amp;mdash; Groups and flushes are no longer valid.  They are replaced by these two sets:&lt;br/&gt;         a sequence of five cards: 1&amp;ndash;5.&lt;br/&gt;         a suite of four cards: one each of suns, moons, arms, crowns.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Piecepack &amp;mdash; Play the game with a standard piecepack, instead of a standard hexpack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
