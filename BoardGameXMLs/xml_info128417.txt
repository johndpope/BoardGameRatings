			<description>Piłkarski Manager is an unique boardgame connecting football and economy. Each player becomes a football team manager. Their goal is to build the strongest team and win the league.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the board we can:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     buy and sell players&lt;br/&gt;     expand training school and draft junior players&lt;br/&gt;     use airlines to move team between spots&lt;br/&gt;     place bet at the bookies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in our team has certain abilities with point values assigned. Our team strength depends on all its player abilities. The better the players, the more chance to win the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the match you roll the dice and compare the result to the game outcome table which takes into account different strengths of two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
