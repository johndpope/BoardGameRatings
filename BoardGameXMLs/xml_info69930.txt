			<description>It's a children racing game. &lt;br/&gt;Players throw with 2 dices, one normal with numbers from 1 to 6, but the other one is for the careful ones and it contains only numbers 1 and 2, three of each. Player can throw with both dices or only one of his/her choice.&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board and in every turn they have to stop once, otherwise their car got out of control and they have to wait for one turn.&lt;br/&gt;When two players end up in one spot, they battle for the leading place with dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
