							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tails and Tactics</name>
									
			<description>Created in October 2011, Tails and Tactics had been in development for almost two years before being released in July 2013. Creator Pedro &amp;ldquo;Reynard&amp;rdquo; Loustaunau first started with a very serious game concept and quickly found it to be lame. After realizing it needed a sillier tone, he quickly went from &amp;ldquo;a little bit lighthearted&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;quite a bit silly&amp;rdquo; as he realized Jan&amp;rsquo;s art would be perfect for his new vision of the game. Having found his ad in the programming schedule for Anthrocon 2011, Reynard contacted Jan with his crazy idea for him to become Lead Artist for the project. The ad pointed to Swords and Sausages (now Reynard&amp;rsquo;s favorite webcomic), which showcased Jan&amp;rsquo;s vibrant imagination and his talents as an artist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jan quickly became the Lead Artist for Tails and Tactics and development continued for almost two years before finally releasing at Anthrocon 2013. Thanks to the pledges of many wonderful people on IndieGoGo, Series 1 of Tails and Tactics became a reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;To win. Duh.&lt;br/&gt;In order to do that, though, you must fight through your opponent's front line and attack his or her base enough to deplete its health to 0 - before they do so to you.&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game with 30 Base Health. Base Health is lost when a unit controlled by an opposing player attacks your base (represented by you, the player). They may only do so, though, when you have no units on the field to defend with. If you do have units on the field that are able to defend, opponents must remove them before being able to attack your base directly.&lt;br/&gt;1 base health is lost per attack, no matter how powerful (or weak) the attacking unit is. Some powerful units make up for this by having the ability to attack multiple times, so watch out!&lt;br/&gt;Base health may also be lost when an opponent attacks one of your units and you choose to dodge the attack. Any dodged attacks will be applied directly to your base.&lt;br/&gt;Once your opponent's base health reaches 0, you are victorious! Gloating and victory dances are acceptable at this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
