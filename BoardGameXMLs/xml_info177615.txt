			<description>FIREFORCE: RHODESIA is a solitaire game of the Rhodesian War. The player assumes the role of a Commander of a combined Force of Rhodesian Security Forces, including the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), Rhodesian SAS and the Elite, Selous Scouts. As commander, you are responsible for securing your Area of Operations (AOR) by successfully conducting various military operations in order to locate and destroy the enemy ZANLA and ZIRPA forces. Although there are many units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE &lt;br/&gt;The objective of FIREFORCE: RHODESIA is to successfully complete a number of missions and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the Security Forces. The player can choose to play a short game (4 Missions), an average game (6 Missions), a long game (8 Missions) or a full Tour (12 Missions). Once all Missions have been resolved (successfully or not) the Player totals his VP and compares this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
