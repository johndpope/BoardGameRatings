							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Commander Blood</name>
									
			<description>Commander Blood is a science fiction adventure game that was developed by Cryo Interactive. Bob Morlock, a biomechanical mastermind, is the founder of a massive company called Kanary. Thanks to scientific advances, Morlock is the oldest being in existence. Knowing his time in this universe is nearing an end, he would like to see the Big Bang and the beginning of the universe. Kanary's Clone Consortium branch builds Commander Blood in order to help Morlock achieve his goal. Commander Blood is placed on a high-tech ship, the Ark, and aided by Honk, Blood&amp;rsquo;s onboard computer personality; the ORXX, Blood&amp;rsquo;s biomechanical 'clone'; Olga, Blood&amp;rsquo;s onboard translator; a radio, television set; and other technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication with the game&amp;rsquo;s characters is carried on clicking on a series of words that serve as topics. Captain Blood utilized UPCOM (icon-based communication system), while Commander Blood makes use of a multiple-choice conversation system, in which players click through word-choices in order to learn more information. Players traverse both time and space as they enter black holes in the search for the Big Bang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Blood,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Blood,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
