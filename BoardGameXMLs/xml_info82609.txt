							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sheep Dip</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to herd sheep through the dip and into the pen.  One player controls the farmer and his 2 dogs.  One or more other players control sheep that try to stay out of the dip and pen.  Play occurs on a grid of 18 by 18 squares.  Hedges, bushes, fences and water hazards impede movement.  The farmer may move vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.  The dogs and sheep move only vertical or horizontal.  The farmer moves the total of the throw of three dice and can divide his movement between himself and the two dogs.  The sheep use one die, and cannot move next to the farmer or dogs or through natural obstacles.   When the farmer or dogs move next to a sheep it forces the sheep to move away.  The farmer also has additional fences that he place to block movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although components are not included, complete rules were published in Games and Puzzles Magazine no. 5.  It is suitable for miniatures play using model railroad accessories on a ruled grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
