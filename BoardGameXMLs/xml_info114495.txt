			<description>Bottle, Barrel, Brick is a fast paced game of resource collection. Each player is a dwarf trying to make the most ale, or dig up the most gold. Players take turns deciding if they will try to gather new resources by rolling the die, or combine the resources they have into finished goods for more points. If they choose to gather resources a die is rolled to determine how much they gain. It is easier to make ale than it is to dig for gold, but at the end of the game gold is worth more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn a player can pass a bottle of ale to another player to decrease his chances of gathering resources on his turn, or pay another player gold nuggets to buy bottles of ale before they can be combined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all of the barrels of ale, or gold bricks are claimed by successfully combining bottles and nuggets the game is over and the player with the most valuable stash wins. This game includes a 6-sided die and all the resource tokens needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
