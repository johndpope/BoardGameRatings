							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assassins of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assassins are devoted killers, professionals or zealots with lifelong training in the art of murder. Unlike warriors, who face foes as they come, an assassin has a very specific goal in mind, and any violence except against the target is a distraction. The perfect assassination is never noticed&amp;mdash;not even by the victim. Nor are they thieves&amp;mdash;assassins might be skilled in infiltration, but their goal is never simple larceny. Still, no job is picture-perfect. Assassins are often pushed into the role of both warrior and rogue by their employer, cult, or guild. Nor is every murder on Porphyra a professional assassination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assassins of Porphyra further expands the world of Porphyra with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Information on the main assassin orders on Porphyra&lt;br/&gt;    The new Porphyran Assassin class from Carl Cram&amp;eacute;r the mastermind behind the Prestige Archetype: The Assassin&lt;br/&gt;    Over 10 different Assassin Secrets to customize your character from the Arcane Assassin to the Shadow Assassin.&lt;br/&gt;    Favored Class Bonuses for the Core Book races.&lt;br/&gt;    Five new uses for skills &lt;br/&gt;    A sample 1st level professional assassin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
