							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MRC: Multi Racing Championship</name>
									
			<description>MRC features ten cars, which are divided into two groups: road cars and off-road vehicles. There are seven different areas for car customization: tires, brakes, suspension, steering, transmission, gear ratio, and aerodynamics. MRC includes three tracks. &lt;br/&gt;In Championship mode, the player competes against nine computer-controlled racers. In Time Trial mode, players try to finish a course in as short a time as possible. Free Run mode lets the player drive freely without other opponents or time limit. The VS Race mode lets two players compete against each other. The unlockable Match Race option pits the player against a hidden computer opponent in a night-time race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Multi-Racing Championship&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
