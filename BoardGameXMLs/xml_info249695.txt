							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cape May Lighthouse</name>
									
			<description>Cape May Lighthouse is a dice-rolling game simulating a vacation in Victorian Cape May, New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns trying to roll symbols to engage in various activities the shore town has to offer: Visiting the lighthouse, going fishing or crabbing, taking a whale-watching cruise, enjoying freshly-caught lobster, and searching the beach for Cape May Diamonds.  All of these earn you points.  But the sea gulls can spoil your day!  Avoid them at all costs or you lose all your points.  The first player to reach 1000 points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cape May Lighthouse has a press your luck feature where the next roll could be an encounter with a sea gull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
