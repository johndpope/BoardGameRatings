			<description>The goal of the game is for players to move around the board accumulating as many points as possible. Whoever has the most points (numbered chips) at the end is the winner. When the player runs out of time cards, he/she can no longer play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Each player selects a game piece to represent himself/ herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Each player is given the equivalent of 36 hours of time cards at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Using the same spinner for everyone, players will spin to determine who will go first. The one spinning the highest value goes first. Second highest value goes next, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. All players start at the Airport site by means of a rental car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. The spinners will tell players how many cells they can move up each time it is their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Special rules for BALBOA PARK/DOWNTOWN (RED-LINE TRACK) movement:&lt;br/&gt;For those going to Balboa Park/ Downtown area, they have the option to go by trolley (use the trolley spinner), but will have to pay for that with 2 hour time cards. For those choosing to stay with a rental car in Balboa Park/ Downtown, 15 points will be taken from them. (A table of transportation modes around Balboa Park/Downtown area is provided on the board as well.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. MOVEMENT RESTRICTION: A player can only go in a backward direction in dead end paths (i.e. Imperial Beach, Coronado, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. Whoever has the most points (numbered chips) at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. When the player runs out of time cards, he/she can no longer play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
