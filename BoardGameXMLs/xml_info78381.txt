			<description>Formula 1 97 (known as Formula 1 Championship Edition in the United States) is the second game in the Formula One game series. This games was more of an evolution of the original Formula One than a brand new game. However, it had several new features, including a cockpit camera view (complete with dirt and flies hitting the visor, with the player having to remove the driver's tear-off strips), if playing on the Play Station, the use of the joystick and the introduction of a co-commentator (in both the U.K. and U.S. versions, this was Martin Brundle). Setting up the car became more intricate. Formula One 97 was developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Psygnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was the first in the series to have a specific driver on the front cover, Michael Schumacher appearing on the front of the '97 cover, however the Prost car of Olivier Panis appeared instead on the cover of the French version, with Jean Alesi's Benetton appearing on the Japanese cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Formula 1 97,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
