							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wilds of Mars</name>
									
			<description>A simple little photo safari game built on the Treehouse system.&lt;br/&gt; The object of The Wilds of Mars is to travel to &amp;quot;the grounds&amp;quot; where animals native to the red planet are bound to be and photograph them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Each player selects one of the colors from the sets. Two cards are placed face-down next to each other in the middle of the table; these are the homes. Each player places one of their small pyramids on one of the two base camps pointed straight up. In addition, each player gets an initial hand of 6 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Order of Play: Each turn a player takes, in order, the following actions: Draw, Resize, Play, Move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has scored at least 7 points of the grounds. That player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
