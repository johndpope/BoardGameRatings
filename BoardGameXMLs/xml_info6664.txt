			<description>Based off the strangely named anime of the same name, this is a fantasy dungeon exploration game most similar to 'Dungeonquest', and like that game, it is fairly luck (and dice) dependant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a board filled with squares that the room tiles are secretly placed on. There are 5 scenarios included with the game, each with different objectives for winning the game. One is &amp;quot;Hydra&amp;quot;, where the object is, what else.. to kill the Hydra. Battle Royale is a fight to the death in the dungeon. One has you placing a flame sword in the middle of the dungeon and then getting out. One has you trying to rescue 'Yohko' and get back out of the dungeon, and the last has you trying to get 'Satan's Ring' and escape from the dungeon with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
