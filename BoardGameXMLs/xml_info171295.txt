			<description>This game is about collecting flags of countries in European Union. It lets children learn useful informations - capital city, population and where to find each country on the map of Europe.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a card with flags printed on it. Then everyone chooses his starting point - one of the capital cities. Every city is connected to 3-5 others by lines with number on it. To move from one country to another, player must roll such number. By visiting every country he gets a small flag, which he puts on his card mentioned earlier. The first one to collect all of them - wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
