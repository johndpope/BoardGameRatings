			<description>This post Civil War spin-and-move game is notable both for its historical value and its sales technique. The board has a track of 100 circles starting at Washington and ending in victory at Richmond. The game requires a 1-8 spinner, and players use toy soldiers as tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each circle is marked with a battle, place, person or unit that took part in the Civil War. Some spaces are setbacks (Bull Run at 20 sends a player back to Washington), while the Andersonville and Libbey prison spaces traps a player until another player reaches a prisoner exchange space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the board both describes the game and shows how it was sold. A veteran soldier &amp;quot;or his agent&amp;quot; would leave a game card on doorsteps for residents to play freely, and then would &amp;quot;call in the morning for 10 cents, as it is earnestly hoped you will patronize&amp;quot;, signed &amp;quot;A Boy in Blue&amp;quot;. The rest of the back features the words to the patriotic song &amp;quot;We Saved the Union for You&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
