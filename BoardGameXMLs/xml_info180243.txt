			<description>This is a simple game base on the &amp;quot;Take That&amp;quot; mechanic. The goal is to be the last player with at least 1 tooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played by 2 to 4 players. A typical game will last 15 to 20 minutes. Players age recommanded is 8 and up. Younger players can play too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Use a d8 to attack one or more opponent by placing 1 to 8 small bacteria on their teeth. Use a d6 to try to clean your teeth. 1 point to remove a small bacteria. 2 points to remove a large bacteria. 3 points to clean a decayed tooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you cannot remove a small bacteria, flip the card and it becomes large. If you cannot remove a small bacteria, flip the card and it becomes large. If you cannot remove a large bacteria, remove all bacteria and flip the tooth card and it becomes decayed. If you cannot clean a decayed tooh, remove the card from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get lucky if you get a crowned tooth. Opponents must the attack with 6 points to remove it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
