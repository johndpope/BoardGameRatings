			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paris 1800' invites you to relive the XIXth century in Paris with its great figures, Romantic and Modern, to decide the future planning of the capital. Moderns transform the city by expanding its boulevards, creating monuments in iron and glass and restoring order. Romantics want to preserve the old quarters of bourgeois ambitions using the dissatisfaction of the people of Paris and inspiring them with revolutionary ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paris 1800' is an assymetrical game in which the objective is to have more victory points at the end of play (1910) or reach 20 VP at any moment. &lt;br/&gt;In each round the players: &lt;br/&gt;1 : collect Resources (Inspiration points or Millions of francs)&lt;br/&gt;2 : move character(s), according to the Observatory&lt;br/&gt;3 : perform an action (one per character)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Romantics score by making Revolutions, finding and stopping the Engineer from transforming districts and writing in Exile. They can also trigger Unrest in the districts (Discontent and Revolt), get inspiration in the Forest and  liberate a Romantic from the Fort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moderns score by transforming Faubourgs, Ville and Cit&amp;eacute; districts. Their actions are draw Projects, obtain/change Permit, Restore order and Imprison a Romantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both camps are able to open/close the newspaper and to change the movement order in the Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bribe: When a Prefect tries to put a Romantic in the Fort, he can use one a Bribe marker to avoid being locked up, but the Moderns immediately gain 2 million francs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calculation and treason cards: only valid in a three-player situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws two &amp;quot;Calculation and Treason&amp;quot; cards. Between 1825 and 1850, at any moment, every player secretly holds one card in hand. From 1850, if a player is a renegade, he will have to discreetly help the other camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 1850 loyal players can denounce a suspected renegade. If the player is indeed a renegade, he stops play and joins the other camp (the game is still a 3v3 pawns). If he's not a renegade, the camp loses immediately 5 VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
