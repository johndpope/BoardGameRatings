			<description>Team Apache is an attack helicopter flight simulator developed by Simis and published by Mindscape Group. The game emphasises on commanding a group of six AH-64 Apache crews of the US Army in battles against the Communist FARC insurgents in Colombia and the Russian military in Latvia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Apache is a different breed of helicopter flight simulator. Unlike most flight sims, Team Apache focuses less on the realism of flight and weapons systems modelling, and more on the gameplay aspects - consisting of command, tactics and battlefield realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team Apache is unique among simulations in that it gives the player unparalleled control over his combat unit. The player is not just flying missions- he is also managing the morale of his men, supply and maintenance, and the tactical planning that takes place before the mission. Although the player's control over these factors is rather basic, few, if any, simulations have as much depth as Team Apache. The geopolitical causes of Team Apache's wars, related in both the game's manual and the &amp;quot;daily&amp;quot; newspaper, are both sophisticated and plausible. Detailed military-style SITREPs create a thorough picture of the tactical situation, and ground forces can be seen in the game fighting each other all throughout the theater using fairly realistic deployments and movements. These details provided by the game, combined with the player's control over his men and his equipment, make Team Apache one of the most immersive combat simulations ever published in some player's opinions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Team Apache&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
