			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost in the Shell is a 1997 video game for the PlayStation game console, and draws on both the cyberpunk film of the same name and the manga by Masamune Shirow in its style, environments and characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the role of a nameless male rookie to Public Security Section 9 who pilots a Fuchikoma tank. The rookie participates in twelve missions set in Newport City dealing with a group of terrorists named the Human Liberation Front and plays an increasingly vital role in Section 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in an action game fashion, using the tank's mobility to jump, climb walls, and hang from ceilings. Both first and third person cameras are available. The in-game cut scenes were produced by Production I.G, who produced the animation of the film version of Ghost in the Shell as well as the animation for the sequel film and anime TV series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
