			<description>There are many cards, each card has 6 words written on it. Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &amp;quot;Silver Medal&amp;quot;). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, players play 2 vs.2. Each team gets a figure representing it on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take a card and not show it to other team member. After that a sand clock (also included) is set. The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &amp;quot;Silver Medal&amp;quot;, a player can say &amp;quot;something that a sportsmen wins at the Olympic games&amp;quot;. But if other team member says just &amp;quot;Medal&amp;quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team looses a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Alias is weird and crazy. The words doesn't make any sense, but you still need to explain these. Can you do it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
