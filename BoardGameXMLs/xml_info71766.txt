			<description>&amp;quot;Illusion of Gaia (ガイア幻想紀, Gaia Gensōki, lit. &amp;quot;Records of the Illusion of Gaia&amp;quot;),  known in Europe as Illusion of Time, is an action-RPG video game that was released on September 1, 1994, for the Super NES (SNES). It was developed by Quintet. Enix published the game in Japan, and Nintendo  published it worldwide. The Australian PAL release was in fact a North American localization and was converted to PAL60 format and released in Australia as Illusion of Gaia, a rarity for Nintendo Australia which usually rely on European PAL versions, despite the OFLC website stating it was classified as Illusion of Time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Illusion_of_Gaia,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
