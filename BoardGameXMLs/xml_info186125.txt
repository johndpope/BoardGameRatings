			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Ah, welcome! What an odd gathering of guests to all be arriving at once. But please, come in, wipe your shoes off and make yourselves at home. We have a bit of business to settle before it gets dark. I am Emerson Quin, representative for the late Lord Richard's estate and matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Surely you've all heard tales of the Hall? Ghosts, possession, crimes even I cannot bring myself to speak of... all hearsay and conjecture, the product of and busy little minds in this idle town. But there is enough to these bogeyman stories to draw you all, and per his final wishes, I've opened the door for one night to let the matter be settled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dark Architectures we will become a brave handful of explorers that step over the threshold into the ancestral home of Lord Richard York, Colbridge Manor. Colbridge Manor perches atop a hill near the center of Goshenkirk, which is itself a small town tucked between a reedy lake and a whispering birch forest and nearly forgotten by maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
