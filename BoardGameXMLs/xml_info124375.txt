			<description>This is the infamous strategy game that wouldn't die. It's virulent. It's infectious. It's to die for...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old man Stauf built a house and filled it with his toys. Or so the legend goes. It is said that one of these games could be found by entering the madman's laboratory and peering into his microscope. The germs and microbes there seemed to be imbued with his spirit and intelligence. It is also said that perfectly sane people who attempted to beat him at his own game went completely, absolutely, stark raving mad. Trilobyte has brought the microscope to you, giving you the opportunity to take up the challenge.  But you play at your own risk. You have been warned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trilobyte Games has re-built the wickedly maddening &amp;ldquo;microscope puzzle&amp;rdquo; from The 7th Guest. Re-imagined expressly for the iPad, The 7th Guest: Infection is a strategy game for two players or for single play against the mad genius, Henry Stauf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to play, but ever-challenging and difficult to master, this new version of the classic game takes advantage of Apple&amp;rsquo;s Game Center, enabling you to match your play against friends and other players worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
