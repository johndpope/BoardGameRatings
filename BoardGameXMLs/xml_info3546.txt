							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mage&#039;s Triangle</name>
									
			<description>The Triangle awaits. You are a restless apprentice who has worked hard for the last ten years studying and practicing to become a Mage. You are ready to take your last test before you can advance onto the final training to become an actual mage-extraordinary. In this test you must play against another apprentice and win the majority of 3 apparently simple games. &lt;br/&gt;THE WIZARD'S DILEMMA - A checkers variant where each apprentice can cast the inscribed magical symbols on the board.&lt;br/&gt;THE SORCERER'S ABYSS - Normal game board squares have been changed into hexes. In addition to this, the element of fate has been added.&lt;br/&gt;THE SHAMAN'S CIRCLE - Pieces move in straight lines as well as in circles. This game is the trickiest of the three and should be played carefully. Surprise wins are not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to make it through the Mage's Triangle? You must play the triangle to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
