			<description>Rudeness Rulez is a card game designed for children. It is similar to Cards Against Humanity, but differs in that players can use multiple cards to build sentences. The subject of cards is aimed at children and uses words that children would describe as 'rude', e.g. 'booger'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of cards, each with various words on them. One player then deals a 'start' card which has the start of a sentence on it, and the other players then try and come up with the best ending using as many of their cards as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
