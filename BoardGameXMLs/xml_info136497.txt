							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jake and the Never Land Pirates: Never Land Challenge Game</name>
									
			<description>Join Jake and the Never Land Pirates for a high-spirited adventure! Grab your pirate gear and crawl, tiptoe, and jump through the vine archways to earn gold doubloons. Each turn offers a chance to prove your playful pirate skills, whether it&amp;rsquo;s tucking the cannonball under your chin or balancing Jake&amp;rsquo;s sword on your head. Collect more coins than Captain Hook to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the players have to collect coins by performing challenges. The game comes with a starting plate, a red X and two archways which are setup before play. There are also several accessories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player draws a red and a blue coin, and flips them over. On their backs are instructions; together they form the challenge, such as &amp;quot;Crabwalk to the X and back waving the sword like a pirate!&amp;quot;. The player may exchange his blue coin as often as he wants to get a challenge that he likes better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player succeeds in the challenge, he gets the coins, otherwise, the coins go to Captain Hook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when three coins with the text &amp;quot;Game Over&amp;quot; have been revealed. If the players have collected more coins than Captain Hook, they have won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
