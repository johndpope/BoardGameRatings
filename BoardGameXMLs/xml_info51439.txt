			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Chaotic state of the UCAS! The United Canadian and American States is in turmoil. In the past year, the great dragon Dunkelzahn won a special presidential election - and was assassinated on the night of his triumph. Savage riots broke out and have barely subsided: inexplicable magical phenomena have triggered a vicious anti-Awakened backlash; and corporate backstabbing and political intrigue are reaching new lows as everyone who can makes a play for the big time. And nowhere in the UCAS are the aftershocks as fierce as in three of its greatest cities: Boston, Detroit and Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boston, home of the East Coast Stock Exchange, has been neutral territory for years.  But now, Richard Villiers of Fuchi Corporation is rumored to be undertaking a secret operation there, and Boston's shadows are jumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detroit is the ultimate company town, home base of Ares Macrotechnology and Damien Knight's personal fiefdom.  But all is not well in Aresville - Knight's ego is getting too big for the bottom line, and bad trouble is brewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Chicago, better known as Bug City, has finally been cured of the insect spirits that infested it ...or has it?  And could the cure be worse than the disease?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Target: UCAS contains a wealth of information for players and gamemasters: adventure frameworks that allow gamemasters to jump right into these explosive cities, rules for ghoul player characters and free bug spirits, and more. Target: UCAS is intended for gamemasters and players of all experience levels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
