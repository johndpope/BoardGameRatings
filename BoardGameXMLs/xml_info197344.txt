			<description>STORY CRAZE is a hilarious game that sparks the silly imaginations in children. Developed with kids, this game uses random PEOPLE, PLACES and THINGS cards as cues to ignite creative outside-the-box thinking to make up outrageously witty, laugh out loud, 3-chapter tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a simple story arc, children create imaginative intro's, hilarious action and crazy cliffhangers! These stories are filled with wacky twists and turns as additional cards are incorporated into each chapter. A judge awards points to winning chapters, and the team with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY CRAZE is for anyone who KNOWS, HAS or WORKS WITH kids ages 6+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's fun to play at home with FRIENDS and FAMILY.  It's also a great activity to play at BIRTHDAY PARTIES, YOUTH GROUPS, AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS and CAMPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And through our 9 months of research and playtesting, we also discovered this this game is a valuable tool for TEACHERS, COUNSELORS, HOME SCHOOLING, and for CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know what happens when all sorts of kids make up crazy stories together? Heaps and tumbling heaps of connection, creativity and laughter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you combine connection, creativity and fun, magic happens! These stories have a Purpose. Our Mission is to get this game everywhere kids hang out! In every home, homeschool, public and private school classroom, after-school program, camp, youth group and counselors office in the world! And here's why:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY CRAZE sparks all kinds of conversation and creativity and helps kids get to know their friends better &amp;ndash; all while having lots of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY CRAZE makes problem solving fun because it ignites all kinds of creativity and divergent thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kids engage in conversation with one another, problem-solve and laugh hysterically. This game offers kids a challenge to stretch their imaginations while figuring out how to combine completely random ideas. This helps kids find their voice to express their thoughts, feelings and experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our 9+ months of play testing with hundreds of children confirmed that it builds communication skills and confidence and helps kids to develop charisma and capture attention. The game has shown that it hones important skills such as teamwork, leadership, creativity, persuasiveness, and organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Writing is a hard skill to learn and to teach. STORY CRAZE helps make writing fun! Kids come together to create a story that combines real-life experiences, imagination and teamwork.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.crazystorygame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.crazystorygame.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
