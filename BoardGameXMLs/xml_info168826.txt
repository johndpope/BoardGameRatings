			<description>Cabriole is a medium-weight worker placement, card drafting, and resource management game for 2-4 players aged 13 and up, and playable in 60-90 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in London during the early 1700's, players aim to create the most successful furniture studios by hiring skilled craftsmen such as carvers, joiners, and turners; purchasing raw materials such as wood and silk; and fulfilling customer orders for tables, chairs, and cabinets. Players must balance the need for capital with the importance of increasing their studio's prestige throughout the city. The player who has scored the most prestige points at the end of eight rounds (nine rounds in a three-player game) is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
