			<description>Tactical Second World War game simulating a British battalion attacking a reduced German battalion in 1943-45. Published in the book Simulating War. Components are also available from the author's website. The designer recommends playing with seven players in two teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 6x8 hex grid, each hex representing about 150 meters across. Units are platoons, divided into four British companies versus two smaller German companies. The British side also has a machinegun platoon. Both sides are supported by off-map mortars. Terrain tiles are randomly placed before play to make a unique map for each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turn moving and firing with all their units. There are limits on cooperation between units from different companies. Successful fire attacks pin enemy units, preventing them from firing or moving during their next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is decided by elimination of enemy units. The British player also scores points for moving units to the opposite board edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
