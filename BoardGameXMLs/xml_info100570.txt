			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, hero. Your help is needed in this dire time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness surrounds us, and we summoned it. Although our goddess provided for all of our needs, empowering us to drive evil from the realm, we wanted more. We looked at Yahalla, our true goddess, and saw a distant queen of unlimited power rather than the kind mother who watched over us. We saw a chance to grasp the gauntlet of immortality, and bartered our entire world to claim it. The Reckoning that followed her death unmade the borders of all lands, casting us into a realm of chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ruins of our forebears surround us. Great cities lie in ash, the mighty palaces of the old kings overrun with evil. An epoch of learning and progress has come to nothing, its great works claimed by vile creatures and savage beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It falls to us to rise up and recover what has been lost. The Splintered Realm cries out for heroes. Will you answer the call?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
