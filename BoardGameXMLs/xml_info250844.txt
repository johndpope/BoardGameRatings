			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warp the fabric of time with powerful chronomancies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 16 page handbook includes everything you need to add temporal magic to your world. Temporal magic can be woven into chronomancies, spells that bend and twist the timestream to the caster's will. By performing these powerful spells you freeze your opposition out of time, suspend your power until the perfect moment and cut away at the strands of fate, rewriting them to suit your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces Temporal Magic, an entirely new school of magic that introduces a new damage type and two new conditions, Temporal Damage, Freezing and Suspension. This book has 24 new spells available to Sorcerers, Warlocks and Wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are 4 new fully detailed temporal subclasses made for existing classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Time Thief: Rogues adept at snipping away the strands of time that surround their foes, cutting them away and making better use of them.&lt;br/&gt;    Blood of Eons: Sorcerers whose blood drips with the effects of temporal manipulation long past or yet to come, their power cut from the echoes of time.&lt;br/&gt;    The Timeless:: Warlocks whose patrons exist outside time, their machinations confounding and bizarre, powers whose true purpose may not be felt for millennia.&lt;br/&gt;    School of Chronomancy: Wizards who seek to master time itself through temporal magics, contorting the timestream to their will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
