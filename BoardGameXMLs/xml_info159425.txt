			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 32 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Forgotten Plaza.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Buying or selling? What do you mean I have no wares? Do you not see the elegant goods arrayed in front of you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forgotten Plaza is a single map of a ruined plaza. The Forgotten Plaza includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the plaza just slightly to the west of the center fountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forgotten Plaza is intended for use in fantasy games. The ruined plaza also makes a suitable location for a Horror game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forgotten: When this plaza was sacked, a merchant&amp;rsquo;s shop was razed to the ground and several street performers, heralds, and shoppers were killed. Rumors in a nearby village are that if you visit the place at night, you can still see the ghosts of those slain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the place is visited at night, the player characters see the ghosts of a crowd that looks to be milling around shopping. They can hear faint music and faint yelling from the ghosts standing on the northwest platform. A ghostly merchant hawks his wares and has the loudest voice and seems to be able to both see and hear the player characters. The merchant attempts to buy, sell, and haggle with them but seems to have no goods at all. However, if they give him money, the item bargained for does indeed appear and is an exact replica of one of the items the merchant lost in the fire. The merchant is the key to the haunting. If he can finally sell all the items he lost in the fire, it will free him and all the lost souls tethered to this place. If the player characters offer money to the street performers or the herald, the faint music or the words of the herald gain clarity and volume, allowing the player characters to hear the music and voices clearly. The herald is announcing the new merchant shop and the street performers sing and play a song about buying and selling goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player characters try to take anything from the plaza, even broken barrels, the ghosts materialize and attack them. As long as their souls are tethered to the forgotten plaza, they cannot allow any item to leave without the proper payment. If they take an item, but leave money for it, no attack occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
