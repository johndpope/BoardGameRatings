			<description>Fast Action Hockey (DMC Games) is an exciting statistical simulation board game that lets you replay the NHL championships--or the entire 2000-2001 season--solitaire, or in head-to-head competition with a friend. Over 650 individually rated players representing all 30 teams are yours to command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast Action Hockey plays quickly because it focuses on the &amp;quot;fun stuff&amp;quot;--shooting and scoring--while eliminating time-consuming elements that add little or nothing to the excitement such as face-offs, puck passing, penalties, line changes, time-clock tracking, etc. What makes FAH even better is the ease and quickness of play. You won&amp;rsquo;t have to spend an hour or two playing a single game. Instead, once you are familiar with the play sequence and the charts, you can play a game in 20 minutes or less, and easily replay the entire Stanley Cup finals in one evening!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Sequence of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three phases to FAH:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Select 18 players and 1 goaltender from each team and list them on the score sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Determine the number of shots each player will take during the game and write down in the &amp;quot;SOG&amp;quot; column of the scoresheet.  To do this, check for the player&amp;rsquo;s shots grade (&amp;quot;Sh&amp;quot; on the roster sheet), roll all 3 dice and consult the &amp;quot;Player Shots&amp;quot; chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Resolve the shots for each player (i.e., determine the outcome of each player&amp;rsquo;s shots on goal.) and assign assists (the number of assists for each goal is indicated on the goal scoring chart).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast Action Hockey will produce lifelike statistical performances over the course of an entire replay season when playing schedules similar to the actual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Game was marketed on a limited scale in 2001 only, and sold primarily through Ebay).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
