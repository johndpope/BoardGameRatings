							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dispatches From the Bunker #37</name>
									
			<description>A magazine dedicated to Advanced Squad Leader:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 scenarios, as described by the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stossgruppe Schlicter: Nice tourney sized offering from Bruce Childs finds us in Norway 1940 as the German force is trying to remove a roadblock, cause casualties and exit. Quick playing with variable game length. Boards 34 &amp;amp; 37.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchoring the Line: The latest RB action from Any Hershey see the Germans on defense on New Years Eve 1942 in the east-central part of the Barricades.&lt;br/&gt;Reinforced infantry companies on both sides as the Russians try to take back buildings from the German defenders. Variable VPs for buildings in the German set up area lead to a guessing game on what they are worth. Nice SSRs spice things up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LZ S: Mike Puccio's latest look at the Glider attacks into Germany in March '45.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reinforced company of glider troops with plenty of SWs and some ordnance land around and possibly amidst German artillery positions on Boards 1a, 43 &amp;amp; 44.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking out the guns is the goal. Very cool scenario with instant action as the gliders try to land amongst AA fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mawchi Road: A big, large, nasty PTO fight from Joe Gochinski sees Brits of the Royal Berkshire Regiment trying to clear the Mawchi Road at Toungoo, Burma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sides have 3 company sized infantry units that are augmented from a pool of Divisional assets including SMCs/SWs/Ordnance for the IJA and a fleet of various armed carriers for the British. Although a Big Scenario on Boards 50, 63 &amp;amp; q, it plays fairly short due to only being 6.5 turns long and with all that firepower units tend to disappear quickly as well. Killer scenario in every way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
