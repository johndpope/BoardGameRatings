			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They know who you are.&lt;br/&gt;They know where you live.&lt;br/&gt;They know that you know about them.&lt;br/&gt;And they're coming to get you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What if...all the strange tales you hear are true?  What if there really are UFO's, vampires, mind-reading mutants, secret societies and government conspiracies?  What if the world is not as it seems, but as those who really run things just want it to look like?  And what would they do to you if you found out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;CORPS is the RPG of a present just like our own, identical in every detail...except that you know the truth, and they don't like it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
