							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GAMERS: The Generic Six-Letter System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMERS was intended to be a generic, universal system with several genre-specific implementations, including:  &amp;quot;Agents&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fright&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Heroic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Spacer&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Waster&amp;quot;.  Only &amp;quot;Spacer&amp;quot; received some (very minor) development--all of the genre implementations remained essentially conceptual.  GAMERS itself is quite usable as a generic system capable of supporting any genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMERS uses a single resolution system for actions, with a &amp;quot;Difficulty&amp;quot; stated for the action and a modified 2d6 rolled against it.  Players must exceed the Difficulty with the roll.  Combat works essentially the same--however, optional rules for an advanced form of combat also are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Traits divided into Attributes, Features, Quirks, and Skills.  Attributes and Features range from 2-12 (in exceptional cases, as high as 15), Skills range from -2 to +4, and Quirks have no rating.  Attributes are randomly generated with 2d6 and include:  Grit, Awareness, Mind, Endurance, Reflexes, and Strength.  Attribute scores above 9 are indicated with letters:  A, B, C, D, E, and F, for 10-15.  Features include License, People, Psyche, Status, Technology, and Walth--various campaign may or may not use any or all of these Features.  A massive Quirks table is provided and Quirks randomly are generated using 3d6 and reading the results in order, yielding 111, 112...665, 666 in a discontinuous range.  Skills start at a default level of -2.  Skills are placed into categories and randomly are generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
