							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MASHED Roleplaying Event Workbook: The Holly and the Oak</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a cold and snowy Christmas Eve, three new arrivals create drama for the camp. Can the players find a way to resolve the differences between a pregant refugee and her family, the AWOL major who is in love with her, and the pursuing lieutenant from the Central Intelligence Division? This event includes three threats (I'll Be Seeing You, A Christmas Carol, and Holiday Affair), each with its own suggested summary, stakes, and countdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, as in most Apocalypse World type games, COs should not treat this as an 'adventure' on which the players must follow a predetermined path. Instead, use this event and its threats as starting points so everyone can play to see what happens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
