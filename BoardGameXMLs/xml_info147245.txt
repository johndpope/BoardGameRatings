			<description>Blockade is an arcade maze game developed and published by Gremlin in october 1976. Using four directional buttons, each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them, turning at 90 degree angles. To win, a player must last longer than the opponent before hitting something, with the first person to hit something losing. The game ends after one player gains six wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Blockade (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
