							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skip Ball</name>
									
			<description>This is a table top version of the old fashion &amp;quot;Coney Island&amp;quot; type arcade game SKIP BALL.  The board itself is made of stained wood and the game uses ceramic marbles. One long side of the bottom of the box has a triangular wooden cross-piece instead of a cardboard side and on the other long side there are two pieces of wood with grooves to hold a piece of very heavy card on to which are stuck six 'cups' with different values if your ball lands in one of them. The instructions say &amp;quot;Give the ball as long a roll as possible before it runs up the slope of the box and you will find that it springs more readily.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
