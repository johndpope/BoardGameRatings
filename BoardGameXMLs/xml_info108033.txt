							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">T-72: Balkans on Fire</name>
									
			<description>T-72: Balkans on Fire! is a groundbreaking new tank simulation by Russian game developers IDDK/Crazy House and published by Battlefront.com. The focus of the game is the control of the your own tank, but the ability to command a number of attached units (armor, vehicles and infantry up to platoon strength) is given through the use of a command and navigation map. Artificial Intelligence (AI) controlled tank crewmen can man any station and be ordered by the player via hotkey's, or you can take the seat as tank commander, gunner, or driver yourself at any time. Internal and external free motion camera views provide an exciting and dynamic overview of the battlefield.The simulation&amp;rsquo;s main focus is on tank combat tactics on the modern battlefield. The inside of the playable tanks is simplified in an easy to use game user interface (GUI) for playability reasons, but it has no impact on realism - all aspects of the tasks of a tank crew are simulated in extreme detail from hand cranking a broken turret to manually shifting gears and applying the parking brakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
