			<description>Statistical golf replay game. Players are rated in various skills based on their performances in competitions like the Ryder Cup. Dice are used to give results based on the skill in question at that time. It would be quite easy to use the system to rate players up to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bernhard Langer on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
