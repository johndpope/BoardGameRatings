			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Solomon Station may well be the greatest engineering achievement in all human history. It took almost 30 years to build, the assistance of hundreds of Powered architects and engineers, the use of untested xeno-tech and a price tag that still hasn&amp;rsquo;t been fully calculated, but is likely in the hundred trillions&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For all its promise, Solomon was fatally flawed. The first generation of immigrants wanted nothing more to live in a peaceful, homogenous Christian enclave. However, every immigrant to Solomon was a moderate Christian voice stolen from North America. Every one of Solomon&amp;rsquo;s first citizens represented a voice that could have been raised against Ellen Dacoveney and her march towards War. But instead of that chorus, all America heard was the triumphant, sneering laughter, coming from Jupiter orbit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Dr. Arthur Wayne Tiberius, &amp;ldquo;The Scandalous Flight: how the Christian Exodus to Solomon Station Made the Abortion War an Inevitability&amp;rdquo;, Centros Press, 2093&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardworking and insular, Solomon Station is one of Earth&amp;rsquo;s most prosperous out colonies, and among the oldest. It is also an ideological Enclave, a proudly Lifer nation far from what its citizens see as an increasingly pagan, increasingly Hell-bound Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
