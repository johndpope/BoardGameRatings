			<description>This is a football trivia game that features questions about the University of Florida. Questions cover the beginning of the program in 1899 and continue until the game's publication date in 1984.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a representation of the Gator football stadium. Players move up and down the field by correctly answering questions about players, coaches, historically important games, etc. The number of yards a player moves forward on the gridiron is determined by a die roll. Penalties are assessed for incorrect answers. The player with the most points as time expires is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the board, four tokens, die, rules, and a storage insert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
