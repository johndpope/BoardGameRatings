			<description>&amp;quot;An educational activity to teach and reinforce vocabulary skills&amp;quot; says the cover of the rulebook. There are four decks of cards, ranked by difficulty, that each contain three words, and their definitions. The basic game is for somebody to read all three words, and one of the definitions. The person or team whose turn it is has to identify which of the words goes with the definition read. A spinner decides what level of word (1 through 4) is used, and if the guess is correct, that team earns 100 to 400 points. First time to 5000 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
