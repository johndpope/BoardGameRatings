			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ha Choo is an exciting new board game, designed to be both educational and fun, with the emphasis on fun! All players start out with fevers-the first one to reduce their fever back to normal with the proper ingredients is the winner! The excitement is generated in three ways: players collect playing cards, players reduce their fevers on their own thermometer by discarding cards, and players participate vocally when they land on special spaces! Ha Choo will teach the basic principles of good health and can reduce the worry and questions about first doctor's office visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up, 2 to 4 Players&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start out with fevers-the first one to reduce their fever back to normal with the proper ingredients is the winner. Play is separated into three categories: players collect playing cards, players reduce their fevers on their own thermometer by discarding cards, and players participate vocally when they land on special spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
