							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lords of Conquest</name>
									
			<description>Lords of Conquest is a strategy game of territorial struggle.  You begin by taking turns selecting territories on a game map.  Because of their locations and wealth, some of these territories will be important and powerful, while others will be insignificant and weak.  The rich ones contain &amp;quot;resources&amp;quot; such as Gold, Horses, Iron, Coal, or Timber, which you will work to acquire because of the powerful weapons and cities they can buy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action in Lords of Conquest takes place in yearly cycles.  Each year has four of five phases.  During each phase, you will have an opportunity to make decisions in preparation for that year's action.  The first phase is Development, during which you can invest in new weapons and cities.  Development begins during the second year, and is the first phase of all subsequent years.  The other phases are 1. Productions, in which your resource-bearing territories produce wealth; 2. Trading; 3. Shipment, in which you have an opportunity to move either your wealth or some of your forces to a more strategic location; and 4. Conquest, in which you relentlessly assault your neighbors' territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles between territories are decided on the basis of the number of supporting territories and forces (in the form of weapons, horses, boats and cities) held by each side.  During the year, all the players will have a chance to expand their territories and wealth at the expense of their neighbors.  Ultimately, you become strong enough to start building cities. The first player to build three cities, and successfully defend them for a year, is the winner.  One last word of advice, show no mercy, and expect none!  Not everyone has what it takes rules the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
