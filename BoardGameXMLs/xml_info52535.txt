							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bauhaus: The Power of Heritage</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millennia ago, long before the Dark Legion came to our hapless solar system, the four great merchant corporations ruled supreme over the human worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mishima took Mercury, Capitol took Mars, and faithful Bauhaus took fair Venus, the emerald jewel, as its own.  The Homebuilders carved out a place for themselves in the fertile lands.  They conquered the frigid icecaps and the stormy seas.  They made themselves a home in the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But then the Great Darkness came, and Venus' raging surface was scarred by citadels and by unending war.  Algeroth himself strode the planet, and Humanity was helpless before him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Homebuilders' ranks stepped Nathaniel Durand, the First Cardinal.  It was he that brought the Light back to us, that led the fight to beat back the Darkness.  But the battle for Venus and for the rest of Humanity is far from over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now is the time for heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BAUHAUS describes the hard and unforgiving way of life of the mighty Homebuilders of the human worlds.  Discover all about their hoary heritage, their strong ties with the Brotherhood and their roles as the last true defenders of humanity.  This sourcebook contains descriptions of Bauhaus society - from the downtrodden Thralls right up to the eternally powerful Elector Houses - Bauhaus professional orders, and the stilted structure of the entire megacorporation.  There are also detailed rules for how to create and play a Bauhaus character, including new skills and professions.  Plus, there's a bestiary of vicious Venusian creatures, a rundown of Bauhaus laws, and notes on Bauhaus's renowned armed forces, ranging from the Hussars to the famed Venusian Rangers and the Art-wielding Etoiles Mortant.  Learn all about the Cardinal's chosen ones, the proud people whose motto is: &amp;quot;If it's the best, it's Bauhaus!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
