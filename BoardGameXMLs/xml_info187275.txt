			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QCarz is an armed and armored automobile combat game, played with pencil and paper on a tabletop; it incorporates light-weight role-playing elements to allow for drivers (characters) to persist through multiple scenarios and gain experience and capabilities.  The clear focus of the game remains on automobile combat simulation.  QCarz was developed from the author's earlier game Carz which was devoid of all role-playing elements.  QCarz was published in at least three versions; the version 2.0 presented here was the final edition and also the first edition to include role-playing elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drivers (characters) in the game have four Attributes:  Agility, Power, Endurance, and Brains.  Attributes have a numeric rating from 1-10 (randomized or purchased from a random point pool) and are rolled against with D10 to determine non-trivial actions.  Note that during automobile combat, the driver does not function as a character, per se, but as a component of the vehicle.  If the car being used has multiple &amp;quot;crew spaces&amp;quot; then the player may populate each space with a character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
