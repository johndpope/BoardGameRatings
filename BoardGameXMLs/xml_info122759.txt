			<description>Vib-Ripple (ビブリップル Viburippuru) is a video game for the PlayStation 2 created by Masaya Matsuura and his studio NanaOn-Sha. It is the sequel to the 1999 PlayStation game Vib-Ribbon, released in Japan in 2004, but never published in any other markets.  Vib-Ripple is notable for allowing the player to import photographs to be used as the game's playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of Vibri, the simple, vector-shaped rabbit from the game's predecessor Vib-Ribbon. The game puts the player on top of various photographs, using each one as trampoline. Jumping on a photograph loosens up 2D items called &amp;quot;Peta Characters,&amp;quot; which Vibri must collect before a time limit expires. An icon on the left side of the screen gives the player a hint as to what part of the photograph to jump on to find the item; the icon's color, shape, and size corresponds to a certain combination of the three on the photograph. When Vibri is close enough to the item, a drumming sound is made and the controller vibrates. Other than the time limit, Vibri must avoid creatures called &amp;quot;Boonchies&amp;quot; that inhabit the surface of the picture. Coming in contact with a Boonchie will cause Vibri to de-evolve from a rabbit, to a frog, to a worm, and eventually causing a game over. However, it is possible for Vibri to evolve into a form called &amp;quot;Super Vibri,&amp;quot; allowing the player to temporarily disable a Boonchie, as well as see hidden Peta Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vib-Ripple has 60 default photographs. The player can create their own stages by uploading his or her own photographs from a digital camera or cellphone via the PlayStation 2's USB port, or even send pictures across the system's online network. The game automatically scales photographs down to 200 by 200 pixels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Vib-Ripple&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
