			<description>From publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-budget original boardgame for 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players, packaged in the foil as a magazine. Strategy &amp;quot;shooting&amp;quot; game with robots at the space ship. Players gain various improvements and weapons for their robots. Each game is different thanks to the variable setting of the space ship. In each game a different strategy leads to a victory...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robomaso (could be translated to English as Robocarnage) is a humorous Czech sci-fi game similar to RoboRally but yet significantly different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two robots of various war clans, with whom he/she moves every round under some restrictive, but decision allowing rules, and tries to survive and hunt other robots. The ultimate goal is to complete a set of program instructions (chits in-game) for some kind of weapon, the robots should originally destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features the modular tile placement, which takes place on each round before the movement, and brings a a different playing board each time, for much better replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having a very nice price for such a game, it is a cheap print on waxed paper, cut-before-play, but with some colour (robots, some important chits and tiles, etc., most tiles and chits are essentially black and white, which just fits well for a space theme), and especially if laminated can remain for a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
