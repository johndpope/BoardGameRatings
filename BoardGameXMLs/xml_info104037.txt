							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How to be a Great GM</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a great Game Master is a little like being yourself; no matter what you do to be different, you will always be who you really are in the end. Is that a little cryptic? Let me break it down for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a great Game Master means; being diverse and flexible. You have to be ready for any possibility and you need to be able to visualize things in your head that some people have trouble doing with visual aids. It's a tough job being the person running a game for others, but it's a rewarding one. Some even say that being a Game Master is a calling, not a job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one can tell you if you are a good Game Master or not, so the only way you'll ever know is to try it out and then try it again and again. Different people, different stories and game settings, even different moods can affect everything about the way you run a game and deal with your players. Setbacks happen from time to time so never give up and never feel down about a game session that didn't go as well as you had hoped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you who don't seem to have all the natural requisites and raw talent for Game Mastering, we have presented here for you, a one-stop guide to being a great GM. This book won't tell you everything you need to know, but it is going to give you everything you need to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
