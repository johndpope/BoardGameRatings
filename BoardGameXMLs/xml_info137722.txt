			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seloria seems such a simple land, a place of knighthood, nobility, and magery. The Sprites, Elves and Humans live alongside one another in peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, within your lifetime, the king has granted the three lowly Goblin races full citizenship, and not all are content to grant them equality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The balances of power are shifting, and those who possess the rare and precious metal Quicksilver will play a part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quicksilver is enchanted via psychic power. It can grant its wielder abilities both unusual or mundane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who would do so must beware! Frightening and dangerous creatures are spawned from fumbled attempt to control it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Seloria was created by legendary TSR artist Jeff Dee, co-creator of the classic superhero role-playing game Villains &amp; Vigilantes, and Talzhemir, co-creator of Furcadia!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Pathfinder adaption of the Quicksilver RPG. It describes the world of Seloria and its races and classes. It contains a bestiary, and rules for psionics and manipulating Quicksilver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
