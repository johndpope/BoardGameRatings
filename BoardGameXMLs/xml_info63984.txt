							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Selvos Castle</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selvos castle is the seat of the Earl of Selvos in northwest Kanday. Seized in 695 from Rethem during Ezar's War, it is a rich fishing port and one of the few safe harbors along the rugged western coast of H&amp;acirc;rn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although officially at peace with Rethem for over twenty years, raiding and skirmishing continues along the nearby frontier. Agents of Rethem, and political intrigue between hawks and doves of Kanday, make this a dangerous place for the unwary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selvos Castle is 100% compatible with Kingdom of Kanday, Dunir Keep, and the nearby City of Golotha, all recently published. Selvos Castle and Golotha are in Harn Atlas Map sector D7, also recently published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
