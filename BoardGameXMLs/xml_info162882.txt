							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GangStars</name>
									
			<description>GangStars is a skirmish game of petty crime in the hood. It&amp;rsquo;s about street gangs battling it out on the turf, cops trying to fight this and the Mafia seeing to it that their claims are not infringed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GangStars is a light-hearted game and NOT the attempt to portray street warfare as accurately as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s just a game for like-minded souls who enjoy some hours of heroic deeds and funny&lt;br/&gt;situations after endless happy hours of painting models and terrain-building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GangStars is a game where you don&amp;rsquo;t need to buy tons of miniatures. A small gang of 4 to 6 homies plus their trusted and loved dog is enough to get started and have a lot of interesting memorable games. As you don&amp;rsquo;t need that many miniatures take your time to paint them as well as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
