			<description>Kovas is a competitive medieval strategy and tactics board game inspired by the Lithuanian legend of the Iron Wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kovas you'll lead your armies using an innovative fog-of-war mechanic and turn system. The units start off rested (face down &amp;amp; hidden from your opponents) and stacked into armies of three units (small, medium, &amp;amp; large). They can be revealed to activate abilities, surprise with counter effects, and to gain additional movement points via force marching. Each round consists of players taking turns commanding their units and armies with a limited number of command tokens. At the end of the round all units that have not been commanded are flipped face down and are considered rested again. Play continues until one player captures a majority of an opponent&amp;rsquo;s units or captures their king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
