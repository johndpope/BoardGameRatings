							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Quest: Fushigi na Meikyuu (Mysterious Labyrinth)</name>
									
			<description>A mix of Labyrinth with one of those picture puzzles with the sliding blocks. Basically, you move around the board trying to find the treasure. There are special squares with trolls and the like, and certain places where you draw event cards, but most of the gameplay comes down to trying to get to the treasure chests. You then open the treasure chests to see if there's treasure inside or if the treasure chest is a mimic. The middle of the board is made up of corridors on blocks that can slide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
