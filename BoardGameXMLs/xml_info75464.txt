							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SPAM: Super Powered Awesome Mutants</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bomb hit or something. The world has been changed... some say awakened. Most say hideously mutated. You don't care. You never paid too much attention to that kind of thing anyway. Let's go beat up that giant lobster over there and take his stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: SPAM is a tabletop RPG. If you don't know what that is, stop reading this. Right now. I don't want to ruin your chance of ever wanting to play RPGs. Also put this down if you only play games in which you get to take on another persona. The purpose of SPAM is to roll up a crazy awesome mutant and then beat the (un)living snot out of something evil (or something good, we're not here to judge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY: All you need to play SPAM is a couple of d10's, some d6's, and the inclination to do something of no conceivable social value for at least an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
