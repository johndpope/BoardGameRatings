			<description>Minigame using the Empire Builder system included in Train Gamers Gazette 2(1).  The cards had to be photocopied onto cardstock, and the board had to be photocopied and laminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with enough money to build short lengths of track, and by running their trains and delivering loads to various cities acquire more cash to expand their networks. Game had three Major Stations, no Medium Stations, fifteen Minor Stationsn; and six types of Loads (Fuel, Imports, Penguins, Research Equipment, Tourists and Dinosaurs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain costs are higher than in other games of this system: 2 for &amp;quot;Clear&amp;quot; and 3 for Mountain mileposts due to the snow and ice.  Game is to $150 million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all games in this system, game length depends on the number of players, roughly 20 minutes per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
