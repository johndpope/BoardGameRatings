			<description>In Kaboom! players attempt to unload a gigantic bomb on each other. You may ship it to a stranger, drop it down a chimney, or simply toss it over the neighbor's fence... anything! Just make sure you're not holding it when it blows!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round of Kaboom! is divided into three phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Preparation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards and lay TRAPS, by placing cards from their hand face-down on the table.When another player attempts to pass you the bomb, they will likely set off one of your traps in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Passing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the bomb passes the bomb by placing it before one of the other players' traps.  The trap is revealed and the instructions on the card are followed.  The bomb is likely to pass to several players during this phase.  Whoever is holding the bomb at the end of the phase panics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Panicking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player panics, he/she must reveal the top card from the draw pile and suffer the consequences listed in the bottom right corner of the card.  This may include discarding cards, passing cards to other players, or exploding!  When a player explodes, they lose and are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining players start a new round, pass around a new bomb, and establish additional losers.  Of course, the last man standing may be thought of as the &amp;quot;winner.&amp;quot;  But it goes against the spirit of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
