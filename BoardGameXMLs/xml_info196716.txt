							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pranks, Inc.</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pranks, Inc. is a narrative, GM-less, diceless, collaborative-ish game designed as part of RPGGeek&amp;rsquo;s 2016 RPG Fool&amp;rsquo;s Challenge, a contest to design an RPG revolving around April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day; what exactly that means is up to each designer. It supports 3-6 players, but more can play if desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players are employees of Pranks, Inc., a company that designs, plans, and executes pranks for special events such as weddings, conferences, awards ceremonies, sporting events, etc. Each employee is in charge of designing a prank based on a theme. These pranks are coordinated and carefully designed into one large prank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a prank has gone horribly wrong. A team of investigators and lawyers from corporate have launched an inquiry into the botched event, determined to get to the bottom of the debacle. Players take turns as the investigators asking questions, as the employees being interviewed, and recreating the events in flashbacks. At the end, the guilty party will be revealed. Whether they take the blame or pass it off on someone else remains to be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
