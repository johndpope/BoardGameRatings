							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Crossing</name>
									
			<description>In King's Crossing, players try to navigate their King across the board to get the home space of the enemy king.  The battle rages as men pieces jump one another and also freeze and trap lines of pieces that are capture later.  Unable to retreat, pieces advance into an onslaught of exchanges and multicaptures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is one in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latest updated: Version 1.2 of the rules includes an alternate set up that is similar to that of Crossing Stonehenge, and a change in the win conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
