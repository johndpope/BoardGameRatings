							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Club Dead</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boogie 'Til You Die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prestigious Boogie Champ award handed out by Club Ikimasho is a mark of distinction earned by few and coveted by all. That is, until the Boogie Champs start dying. It seems that one of the past dance floor legends is determined to be the one and only, and is systematically bumping off the competition in a gruesome and bloody display of bad sportsmanship. The police are baffled, the club scene is suffering and no one knows who could be next. The only clue is a cryptic note pinned to each corpse, proclaiming this simple judgement: &amp;quot;Not Good Enough&amp;quot;. Looks like it's up to the players to unravel this deadly mystery before their dance number is called - permanently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something a Little Different&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Club Dead uses the &amp;quot;Bad Apple&amp;quot; Style of Play. In this SOP, one of the characters becomes the Bad Guy and plays the part of a sadistic killer, while the others race to expose him before he can finish them all off. Determined in secret before the game begins, no one knows which player the Bad Apple is - until it's too late. Always fun, always nerve-racking and occasionally downright vicious, Bad Apple is guaranteed to be unforgettable. It's player vs. player roleplaying at its sinister best. Also included are several Plot Twists which allow you to play the script in a normal cooperative style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Club Dead is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
