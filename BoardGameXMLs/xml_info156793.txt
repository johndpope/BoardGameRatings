			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;A Kapcon 16 Scenario Design Contest Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate Challenge Tea Garden is a scenario for DragonFist by Green Ronin Publishing. DragonFist is an OGL product and uses a variant of the rules found in Dungeons and Dragons. The scenario is designed to be run in three hours. No prior knowledge of DragonFist or D20 is needed to play this scenario, though knowledge of the wuxia genre is helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central story of this scenario revolves around He Shen, the hero of the people, who has just rescued his nephew Ping from the clutches of one of Emperor Jianmin&amp;rsquo;s palace servants, an evil eunuch sorcerer called Merciful Mao. Mao is in hot pursuit and He Shen is forced to take refuge at the Ultimate Challenge Tea Garden, where the other PCs are also present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user commentary:&lt;br/&gt;This is designed as a tournament/demonstration scenario and includes pre-generated characters and handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
