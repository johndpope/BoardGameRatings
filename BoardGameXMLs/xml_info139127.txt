			<description>INTELLI WARS is an operational level strategy space game where you manage fleets of spaceships and spend available resources to attack and conquer your opponent&amp;rsquo;s star systems by deciding when to commit your forces, where they must go and with what support while repairing, refitting and bringing in reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a 2 player, competitive, turn based, card driven, strategy board game. This is a science fiction war setting between two space empires. The map is a blank hex grid to allow for various scenarios and thus increase replay value. Players are in the role of fleet commanders in charge of a theater of war with a God&amp;rsquo;s eye point of view. The scope is that of a campaign operation; events are just part of the wider war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unit represents a fleet of spaceships and while the time scale is abstract a turn is meant to represent anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months. To win you must achieve the scenario's victory point level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game in its current format is print &amp;amp; play and files are provided in this page for downloading components and rules in electronic format for printing and assembling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; map sheet.&lt;br/&gt;     40 x 5/8&amp;quot; square counters.&lt;br/&gt;     24 x 3/4&amp;quot; square counters. &lt;br/&gt;     2 x sets of 24 cards, one set per faction (48 cards total).&lt;br/&gt;     2 x double printed scenario cards.&lt;br/&gt;     2 x double sided play mats.&lt;br/&gt;     1 x 8 page Rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
