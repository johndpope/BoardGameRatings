			<description>This is a British World War I naval game. The board shows the North Sea, with England on one side and northwestern Europe from Brittany to Norway on the other. Across the North Sea lie a series of dotted lines that intersect at multiple points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side has five naval bases that mark the end of a dotted line. There is a Minefield hazard dot 1-3 spaces out from each base. There also are two Mutiny dots at intersections and three Fog patches covering multiple dots around major intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side starts moving one ship from each base. On each roll or spin, the player must move one ship that many dots forward or backward. A player captures an enemy ship or base by landing on it by exact roll. Ships in fog cannot be captured, while landing on a Minefield or Mutiny dot destroys the ship. The winner is the first to capture an enemy base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
