							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike it Rich</name>
									
			<description>Each player is a modern prospector buying mines and hoping to strike valuable ores, like silver or gold. On his turn, a player rolls three dice and then skillfully arranges them. Two dice form the Mine Number, which indicates where a strike occurs if the mine is already owned, or indicates the mine the player can buy if it is not owned. When a strike occurs, the third die indicates the type of ore found and, thus, the value of the strike. It pays to own several mines that lie adjacent to one another on the board as adjacent mines help to increase the value of a strike. (A strike can be worth as little as $5,000 or as much as $150,000!) The Object of the game is to be the first player to make a million dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
