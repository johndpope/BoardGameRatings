			<description>Dotstream is played by players guiding their dot, which results in a line trailing behind it, through a track filled with obstacles such as squares, rectangles, and circles. Races (known as &amp;quot;drawings&amp;quot;) are typically 2 laps long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dotstream features three modes, Grand Prix, Spot Race and Formation. Grand Prix is considered the &amp;quot;main game&amp;quot;, with players racing around five circuits, with new drawings unlocked in this mode. Spot Race is a time attack mode around unlocked drawings. Formation begins with the player starting with one dot and having to collect small pellets to fill up a meter. When the meter is sufficiently filled up, another dot will appear to assist in the collection of pellets. While only the player's dot can be directly controlled, additional dots can be manipulated by holding down the appropriate Formation button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally part of the Japanese-only Bit Generations GBA series, a WiiWare version was released in North America on May 24, 2010 and in the PAL region on June 25, 2010, under the name light trax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bit Generations&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
