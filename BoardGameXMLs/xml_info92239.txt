			<description>[yellow tail]-opoly is marketing/promotional board game released by Casella Wines, who produce [yellow tail] wine. It is a wine-themed derivative of Monopoly and is similar to Wineopoly in many respects. From the game's own description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Buy and trade your favourite [yellow tail] wines, build your own winery and discover the little wine brand that could. Learn as you play! Each deed contains information and great Roo facts about our wines and winery. Test your [yellow tail] knowledge. Do you know how to make a [yellow tail] BUBBLES sangria? Grab another card and you could be sharing a glass with our Managing Director -- John Casella. The winery is still 100% family owned with three generations currently involved. Play by your rules because it's all about having fun! Be careful not to be sent to the WINE CELLAR -- you may never get out! So choose your token and advance to CHEERS! Who knows...you could be elected president of the [yellow tail] games club!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
