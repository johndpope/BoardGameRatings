			<description>Republica de Bananes is a 3-8 player free-for-all card game, set in a banana republic during the height of the Cold War. Players take on the role of the county&amp;rsquo;s ruling politicians. Their goal is to achieve a secret Ulterior Motive, while stopping their opponents achieving their own, all while trying to rule the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ulterior Motives include seizing the presidency with the support of a paricular faction, embezzling the nation's budget, manipulating the nation into becoming an outpost of the US or USSR, or causing outright civil war and benefiting from the ensuing chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn each player takes four actions, using cards drawn from the Power deck, and other options based on the political landscape of the nation, such as its current Stability, and the levels of foreign influence. These actions include playing Supporter cards to increase their personal strength, and activating abilities, which can  improve their position or hinder an opponent. Some abilities have broader effects, changing the political climate for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elections and Coups are a key part of the game. Each turn players jockey for political power, and often must rely on the support of their rivals to gain the power they seek. After negotiations are done players reveal their choices simultaneously. This is often accompanied by a fanfare of cheers, laughs, and cries of anguish from the betrayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
