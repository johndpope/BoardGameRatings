			<description>You've been invited to a party where everyone's dead. You're having a great time when you suddenly realise... you're dead too! The only way to get back to life is to appease the God of Life. The God of Life seeks sacrifice, but not of the physical kind. You must speak witty sentences and entertain for your passage home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GIFT (Good Interesting Fun Times) is a word game / party game where you create sentences containing secret keywords. In a round each player thinks of a sentence from a shared set of Letter Cards. Each word in your sentence must start with a letter that matches a Letter Card. The God of Life loves certain keywords. If you can secretly put a keyword from a Keyword Card into your sentence then you lose that Keyword Card... that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing! The first player with no cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However the God of Death is also listening. If the God of Death can guess your keyword then you can't discard the Keyword Card. A God of Death token is given to the player with the most Keyword Cards in their hand. This player is now the God of Death and can accuse players without penalty. Can you outwit the God of Death and entertain the God of Life with some Good Interesting Fun Times?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
