							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pokemon Diamond and Pearl Poke Ball Flip Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a Pokemon-filled game of fun and action as you try to be the player with the most cards when the timer signals the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn over a card from your stack and see if its number is higher than the &amp;quot;Number to beat.&amp;quot;  If it is, you get all the cards that have been played so far and you're closer to winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Ash shows up, a totally different kind of action begins.  You get three tries to flip a card on the special Pokemon Poke Ball paddle.  Complete the challenge and your stack will grow even more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Poke Ball paddle&lt;br/&gt;Timer&lt;br/&gt;Handle&lt;br/&gt;60 game cards&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
