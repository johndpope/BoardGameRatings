			<description>Yokai is a simple card game, the players task is to beat the other demons using a trio of colorful cards during the 9 turns of game. A turn ends when a player close a monocolor or a three colors trio, monocolor trio count all the points on the cards, otherwise a three colors trio don't count the card with the average points value. The player with the most points at the end of the ninht turn will become the new owner of the temple of Murochi, while the other players will have to suffer the wrath of the homeless Monk.&lt;br/&gt; STORY&lt;br/&gt;Crazy umbrellas and catfishes that wear kimono?! There is a strange air in Murochi Temple tonight.. It Seems that some spirits are living here... Sounds Interesting, who knows which of these demons will win the game? Unless they do not wake up the old monk.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
