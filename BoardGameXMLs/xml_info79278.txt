							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Devil&#039;s Crown</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;'...as the pirates slowly remove the Sparkling Stones they feel a cold eerie wind pass through their hair.  Suddenly, as the final Stone is removed from the Cursed Golden Crown, a massive Devil, from the darkest depths of hell, is unleashed, murders all on board and sinks the ship...with the treasure'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After many years of careful research the position of the pirate ship has been traced and legend speaks of death and evil on board.  Do you dare to return to the sunken ship and recover the Seven Jewels which have been scattered around the 40 rooms of the wreck, and replace them in the crown?  Before you recover the jewels you must first prove yourself by replacing each flashing object with the equivalent solid object, also hidden around the ship.  Only then is a flashing jewel revealed which must be replaced by a solid jewel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, with pirate ghosts guarding the jewels, killer fish and other nasties, your task is not an easy one, especially when you are in need of oxygen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game inlay card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
