			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a continuation of The Gooblitts of Punchstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hagall, friends! Have your players eliminated Tuz Sickfang and saved Reichenbach? Were they victorious against the vicious B&amp;auml;rbeorn? Did they delve into Belengar&amp;rsquo;s tomb only to find that their magic item was in another castle? Then have we got an adventure for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B&amp;uuml;rsten is a quiet logging village just a couple of hours east of Waldplatz. Just the other night some of their children were stolen during a Goblin raid, and the village council wishes to hire intrepid souls to rescue their kids and bring justice to the evil greenskins that stole them. However, things are nowhere near what they seem...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This follow-up to the first Mithgarthian adventure features multiple encounters along the roads to Waldplatz and B&amp;uuml;rsten, two smaller dungeons, and a larger final dungeon. Bring your players on an epic adventure which goes from bad, to worse, to downright hellish and back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
