			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NBA 08: Featuring the Life Vol. 3 is the third in the basketball franchise developed and published by Sony for PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 3.  The game offers all of the standard modes of play, such as exhibition, season, and playoff modes, as well as some mini-games such as 3-on-3 play.  The Life mode (a PlayStation 2 exclusive feature) allows you to train and play alongside a struggling young team and their beloved coach, Coach T.  The story in the Life mode is a direct continuation of the previous two games.  In the PS3 version, however, the special feature is called &amp;quot;Game of the Week&amp;quot; and allows the player to download information on individual performances in the ongoing 2007-2008 season and to try to match those performances in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
