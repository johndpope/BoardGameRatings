			<description>Wewaii is a builder - business simulation based on the vacation industry. Players build and manage a hotel and do their best to keep their vacationers happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key to success is to match the hotel&amp;rsquo;s services to your vacationers&amp;rsquo; requirements, such as sports or parties. Players can further influence the course of events by choosing their own guests carefully and organizing spontaneous activities. The player decides the level of complexity at which he or she plays the game. Something  can always be improved, making competition for the top ranks a challenging and exciting affair, even after many weeks of play. There&amp;rsquo;s also plenty for casual players to enjoy &amp;ndash; not least the game&amp;rsquo;s glorious graphics.&lt;br/&gt; The hotel manager&amp;rsquo;s most frequent tasks are handled directly on the scrollable and zoomable hotel. Dozens of objects &amp;ndash; from bungalows and luxury hotels to individual sun loungers &amp;ndash; can be placed and moved around freely, and you can tell from the graphic when renovations are needed. You can clearly see the vacationers going about their activities or cooling off in the pool you placed there for them. Your hotel bustles with activity all day long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: From the Publisher's Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
