			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartographer&amp;rsquo;s Cache is a collection consisting of maps created by Justin Andrew Mason as part of his VTT Maps Patreon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contributing patrons wanted to know if there was a way to go back and get the maps released during months before they became patrons or in months they missed funding. Cartographer&amp;rsquo;s Cache is the solution to that request. Each set contains all the maps released by Justin Andrew Mason via his Patreon for a specific month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both 600 dpi high-resolution and 300 dpi VTT-friendly versions are included of every map. All maps are in JPG format and are sized to fit a full 8.5 x 11 inch page. Three versions of each map are included with this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     VTT Map &amp;ndash; No grids, no numbers, no icons/symbols, all rooms shown&lt;br/&gt;     Player Map &amp;ndash; With grids, no numbers, player-relevant icons/symbols, and secret rooms are hidden&lt;br/&gt;     GM Map &amp;ndash; With grids, with numbers, all icons/symbols, all rooms shown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
