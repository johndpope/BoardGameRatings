			<description>CARGO RUNNERS is a thirty minute 2-4 player traditional board game designed to be played with family and friends &amp;mdash; The theme? &amp;quot;International Commerce on the High Seas.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;★ ★ ★ CARGO RUNNERS WAYS TO PLAY ★ ★ ★&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. LOCAL PLAY: Use the game's 'around-the-table' local play mode to sit down at a coffee shop or kitchen table and enjoy a game with your friends, spouse or kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: Use the built-in Online Multiplayer features through Game Center to find another Cargo Runners player to be randomly matched with (may take a few days before enough regular users build up for auto-match to work at its best).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. INVITE A FRIEND: Use Game Center in &amp;quot;Invite a Friend&amp;quot; to come play Cargo Runners online. It doesn't matter if your friend(s) are in Sweden or New York &amp;mdash; the Online Multiplayer is fast, fun, and intuitive once you've set up an online play session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;★ ★ ★ CARGO RUNNERS HIGHLIGHTS ★ ★ ★&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- NICE ART, SOUNDS, AND MUSIC: Beautifully-illustrated world map graphics, original recorded soundtrack, and custom sounds (or you can play your own music &amp;mdash; first start your playlist and then launch the game!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- FAST PLAY: Once learned, games typically last 20-30 minutes, about half the time of a typical printed board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- REWARDING REPLAYABILTY: The distribution of the Cargo Contracts is different every time you play, as well as the communiqu&amp;eacute; cards, weather events, and other challenges. Replay value for the game is very high!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 2 TO 4 PLAYERS: Cargo runners is modelled after traditional board game designs and is a truly social game experience, to be played with up to four human players (it is not currently designed to be played against a computer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;★ ★ ★ CARGO RUNNERS DESCRIPTION ★ ★ ★&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble Brothers&amp;rsquo; second originally designed game for iPad, Cargo Runners is played on a beautifully designed map of the world. The object of the game is to captain a ship that must journey around the globe racing to gather cargo as you compete for valuable contracts that earn you victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the world&amp;rsquo;s a stage! Thirty cargo ports-of-call with six different types of goods: Aerospace, Apparel, Coffee, Energy, Fruit and Lumber. Six home ports, each with a couple of contracts that need to be delivered. A race to determine the captain of the sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game is different because the contracts always change. Dice rolls determine movement and you bank what you don&amp;rsquo;t use. Every turn, there is a chance that bad weather or political crisis will impede your decision. Often, there will be Communiqu&amp;eacute; cards that will give you bonus opportunities. Always, you will have to watch what the other players are doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cargo Runners has the classic feel of a mid-50s board game - only it&amp;rsquo;s not! It&amp;rsquo;s brand new, designed specifically to take advantage of all the benefits of the iPad&amp;rsquo;s graphics and computing power. Cargo Runners can be played on a single iPad just like you would a regular board game or with its Game Center &amp;ldquo;Online Multiplayer&amp;rdquo; functionality, you can sail the world over with real players from all across the globe. A light strategy game built to bring back the joys of sitting around the coffee table sharing an evening&amp;rsquo;s entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: VGG Post by Developer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
