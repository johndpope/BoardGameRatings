			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of up to six 3rd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new covert organization has recently taken its place in the worldwide espionage scene &amp;mdash; a silent, deadly enemy that prefers to remain behind the shadows. They&amp;rsquo;ve branched out into many fields, but their specialty is high-tech applications of stealth and anti-security technology. They have several moles in the Agency, operatives such as Kurata Matarou (from &amp;quot;[The Tengu Conspiracy]&amp;quot;), and have used them to procure Agency research relating to stealth and cloaking technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new espionage organization calls itself the Invisible Hand (in deference to Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s mention of an &amp;lsquo;invisible hand&amp;rsquo; manipulating the global technological market). They approach scientists who are involved with promising research, including the Dutch Professor Adallard Ronken, who recently constructed a portable device capable of chemically duplicating a donor's blood or tissue and then creating a sample capable of fooling a DNA security-testing device. The Invisible Hand believes that if this device were combined with their current high-end camouflage suit, they could penetrate even the most advanced security systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
