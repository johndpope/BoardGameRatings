			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIGHT.  SURVIVE.  REBUILD.&lt;br/&gt;What is Pandemic Play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outbreak: Undead was designed originally for small groups to simulate their own zombie apocalypse plans.  When we decided to publish our 2nd Edition of the game, we wanted to go bigger.  People wanted a global campaign they could influence.  So Pandemic Play was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pandemic Play, we introduce an organized play environment where every Survivor can join an international community to simulate a worldwide zombie apocalypse scenario.  You and your friends now decide the fate of not only your town, but potentially the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandemic Play Regions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be The Resistance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find an Action Ranger (or recruit one from your ranks) and play epic events to see how you can survive.  You can play yourself as a character (which is the recommended way to play Pandemic Play), or you can build a character to use throughout the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get plenty of perks for season memberships.  First of all, their in-game progress will go towards the defense of their Region, which changes month to month as the various groups do what it takes to survive.  In addition to that, players will be given various exclusive reference cards that they can take to any organized play group to ensure that your character has access to the same gear and character traits that they have earned from any other session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, at the end of the season, players will automatically get a digital companion of the season&amp;rsquo;s events so they can be replayed.  This also includes short stories that can detail notable events as relayed to us by our Action Rangers.  A character&amp;rsquo;s heroism (or despotism) can become known far and wide and inspire others who are writing their own scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2016 Pre-Season is currently in play, which means everyone has a chance to participate for FREE MISSION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
