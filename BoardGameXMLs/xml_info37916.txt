			<description>This children's game requires no reading, but helps to learn the animal names.  Each player is given a &amp;quot;character card&amp;quot; depicting an elephant, giraffe, tiger, or zebra.  Players attempt to create a copy of their animal out of four square tiles.  The tiles start stacked face down on cards depicting one of eight other animals.  On their turn, a player spins a spinner to determine which animal's stack they may draw from to find one of their missing animal pieces.  The player completing their animal first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
