			<description>An antique tabletop dexterity game where they players score points by flipping weighted paper cones into a 7x7 grid of scoring holes punched into an insert for the bottom half of the box. Beneath each hole is a number indicating the number of points scored for each cone that goes in the hole. The scores range from 5 points around the edges of the box to 50 points for the center hole. Each player takes a turn dropping the twelve cones onto the board one at a time. The first player to reach 100 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include the game box, a set of twelve weighted cones, and a set of flippers. The instructions are printed inside the lid of the 12.5 x 12.5 x 2.25 inch box. The colorful cover art depicts two clowns juggling cone shapes hats back and forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publication date is an estimate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
