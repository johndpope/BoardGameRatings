			<description>Himaya is a card game in which you drift through the sands of time, using famous historical figures and creating a grand empire of science, art, and religion.  The game features 151 playing cards, 2 sets of 2 dice, 3 decks, and eats away about half an hour of your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order of play in this game is very simple.  Draw a card from the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; deck and play any one card from your hand.  You don't have to play a card, but you may.  There are a couple of exceptions to this order of play, but generally the game sticks to this format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 20 different types of cards in this game.  The card type is indicated at the top of the cards.  On your turn, you can choose to play one of them.  These cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Cities&lt;br/&gt;- General&lt;br/&gt;- Scientist&lt;br/&gt;- Merchant&lt;br/&gt;- Explorer&lt;br/&gt;- Historian&lt;br/&gt;- Spy&lt;br/&gt;- Assassin&lt;br/&gt;- Rebel&lt;br/&gt;- Prophet&lt;br/&gt;- Builder&lt;br/&gt;- Building&lt;br/&gt;- Artist&lt;br/&gt;- Literature&lt;br/&gt;- Song&lt;br/&gt;- Painting&lt;br/&gt;- Museum&lt;br/&gt;- Ceiling&lt;br/&gt;- Play&lt;br/&gt;- Theatre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, you may choose the potential victory conditions for the game before play begins.  Conditions are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Play until the &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;2. Determine a set number of victory points that must be reached.&lt;br/&gt;3. Play until a certain amount of time runs out (i.e. 30 minutes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
