			<description>Background statement from the rules: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's World War II and you're an Allied spy, one of the most cunning spies in the business. Your assignment is the most dangerous you have ever undertaken. You must enter the exotic and perilous island of Macao, center of a teeming network of international spies off just off the coast of China. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Once on Macao, you secretly make your way to the legendary Brass Monkey Club, site of the local espionage network and they place where you will make contact with the Master Spy himself, H.E.Rasske. But before you reach the sin-infected Brass Monkey Club, your life and your country's security are endangered many times.&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;Basically, you need to move around the board, collect three Brass Monkey Cards, and land on the Brass Monkey Club with an exact roll of the dice. Fail the exact roll, and you might find yourself starting from the beginning of the map. Minor complications are introduced with Subterfuge and Risk cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
