			<description>Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a North America-exclusive video game that was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kiltish army, led by Captain Lucius Khan Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger, held the island of Westica hostage; making the citizens into their slaves and ruling over them with an iron fist. For ten years, they are forced to mine for gems that made Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger and his crew into rich men so that they were too content to leave the island. A young man named Storm Jaxon decides to rebel and steal Sk&amp;uuml;ljagger's magical sword so that he can free the people of Westica. There is also the presence of a storybook-style, 80-page instruction manual that provides clues about secrets and hidden areas in the game.&lt;br/&gt;The player must advance within a strict time limit or automatically lose a life in the process. Bubblegum permits players to fly and jump higher than normal. There is even a practice mode that allows the use of the bubblegum power-ups without the threat of enemies or bottomless pits to kill the player's character. Jewels allow for beneficial effects like adding seconds to the game clock, an extra life, extra protection against enemy attacks, and permit the usage of projectile attacks with the magical sword. Having a mask makes the player completely invincible for a short period of time; similar to the Starman in Super Mario World. Without any gems to protect the character, the game is a &amp;quot;one-hit, one-kill&amp;quot; game like Contra III: The Alien Wars. In the two-player game, each player must wait his turn before being allowed on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passwords basically consists of putting words together to form sentences. Putting each word in the right order essentially opens a &amp;quot;warp zone&amp;quot; into the more advanced levels of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
