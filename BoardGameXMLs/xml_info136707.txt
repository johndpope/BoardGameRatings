							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Objectivist</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Objectivist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is he a dedicated antihero with a brutal but firm concept of justice? Or is he a sociopathic serial killer who chooses criminals as his victims?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately we would like to leave that fine distinction up to you, dear reader. In this brief character dossier, we will provide a short overview of the history and complete game statistics for a vicious vigilante that goes by the name The Objectivist. With the information included in this document you will be able to insert the Objectivist directly into your M&amp;amp;M game, whether as an NPC or as a pregenerated player character. The point costs for creating the Objectivist have also been included to allow for easy customization should the GM or Player wish to alter his game stats or adjust his power level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
