			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;On June 6, 1944, the world sank in the darkest of hells. On Doomsday the Dead started their hunt against the human specie.&lt;br/&gt;Now it's 1957, the world is a pile of rubble, where the few survivors try to resist to the hunger of the Dead. A few nations, ruled by cruel dictatorship, have survived.&lt;br/&gt;In Germany raised the IV Reich, a reign of horror and madness, of cold genetic experiments aimed to the creation of the chosen race and terrifying weapons.&lt;br/&gt;The great Russia is buried under the titanic Soviet's cities of steel, ruled by the inhuman calculator named Z.A.R. and his bio-machines.&lt;br/&gt;Italy, renamed Sanctum Imperium, is ruled by Pope Leone XIV and his Inquisitors. In those anachronistically lands stakes are returned to burn human flesh.&lt;br/&gt;The darkest future humanity could imagine has become the most hideous of reality. This is the world of Sine Requie.&lt;br/&gt;Face your destiny in this roleplaying horror, crude and realistic.&lt;br/&gt;Explore the world of SINE REQUIE ANNO XIII with an innovative game system based on interpretation, using Minor Arcana and Tarots.&lt;br/&gt;In this book you'll find the setting and all the rules necessary to adventure in the world of SINE REQUIE ANNO XIII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No piety&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No truce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only blind ferocity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
