			<description>It's a hurry-scurry shopping game. Go with Flatsy to the Supermarket with your shopping list. How fast can you get all the items? Will another player beat you to the Checkout Counter? Hurry! Hurry! First player to checkout wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains: Supermarket Game Board, 4 Flatsy Playing Pieces, 4 Shopping Lists, 24 Food Cards &amp;amp; Spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin and move around the supermarket trying to collect the food cards on their shopping list. They must land on the space next to the food item to collect it and place it next to that item on their shopping list. A player may pass her turn if she is close to a food item when her spin will take her past it. If a player lands on a space occupied by another player, she can bump that player, removing one item from the other players shopping list and putting it back on the shelf. A player must collect 5 out of the 6 items on their list in order to go to the Checkout area. The first one to reach the Checkout area (Finish) with 5 items on their list, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
