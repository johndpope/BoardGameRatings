			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stone was an online puzzle solving game that combined logic and visual puzzles with research focused on online searching to make the user find information, often about unusual occurrences or topics with a supernatural history, that would lead to a very specific answer.  It also included some things based in the real world: for instance, to play the game, you first had to buy a physical &amp;quot;Stone&amp;quot; with symbols carved in it, and sometimes hunts for objects would occur based on images that were intended to point to a physical location somewhere in the world.  The original intention was for all the puzzles to lead to a huge wrap up that tied several themes together, but a falling out occurred between the man who conceived of the game and the company that assisted him in his creation, and instead of giving one unified conclusion, the final puzzles were released and shortly after on April 3, 2008 the servers were closed down.&lt;br/&gt;The puzzles were saved and re-released in their original format on a fan-made site called the Scarecrow's Field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
