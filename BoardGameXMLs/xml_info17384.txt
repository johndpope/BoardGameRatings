			<description>HIS 'N' HERS - The Battle of the Sexes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How well do you really know your partner?  Or best friend (or best friend's partner?)&lt;br/&gt;Well now is your chance to find out.  You choose the subject, you choose the questions, analyze the points scored and then you'll find out (what you probably knew all along) if you're living with a Male Chauvinist Pig, a Right Wing Wet, a Left Wing socialist or just a plain slob.  Yes you'll discover the real man or woman in your life.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Booklet&lt;br/&gt;Subject Cards&lt;br/&gt;Prediction Cards&lt;br/&gt;Bonus Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A questioner selects a subject (e.g. indulgences, work) and reads out the three character descriptions from the booklet, appropriate to the &amp;quot;interviewees&amp;quot; sex. The players (including the questioner and interviewee) then vote (using prediction cards) on which type of characteristics the &amp;quot;interviewee&amp;quot; exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questioner then selects 6 questions from the Subject Cards corresponding to the subject chosen.  The questioner then reads out the questions and three possible answers. Each answer scores either 1, 2 or 3 points depending on the response given by the interviewee - these points are noted down discretely by the questioner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the six questions have been answered the points are totaled and the score related back to the character traits announced at the start of the round. The character of the interviewee is thereby determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players that successfully predicted which character trait the interviewee would show score points. The winner is the player with the highest score after an agreed number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
