							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tall Stories</name>
									
			<description>Tall Stories involves rolling two dice and moving a counter (shared by all players) around a board according to the result. The board spaces all describe themes. One die is red, the other is white. A card is drawn and the red and white dice specify two words on that card. A one minute timer is turned and you have that long to tell a story covering the theme you landed on and incorporating the two words you rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the job of other players to identify which two words you rolled. The words of course bear no particular relevance to the theme and hiding them on the spot involves the creation of the most colorfully chaotic tales with impromptu decoy words thrown in as fast as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system of reward has gone lost to me, as have the rules, and I'm unsure of how points are scored, except to say that there is a 1-10 scoring bar in the game. How it is used I don't know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have written Crown and Andrews but they have been unable to find any records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
