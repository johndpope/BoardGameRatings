			<description>This Western Australian production could possibly be described as parallel games of Scrabble without a board.  Players each have a collection of lettered tiles and they create their own set of words that interconnect in the style of a crossword.  Like Scrabble, each letter has a score with letters that are harder to use having a higher score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured in Western Australia by Herbert Stone Pty Ltd, Trademark Registed Pending Taree Pty Ltd.  Judging by the seven-digit phone numbers it is pre-1997.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
