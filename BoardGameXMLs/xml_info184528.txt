							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Art of Bidding</name>
									
			<description>In The Art of Bidding, you are a gallery owner trying to increase the Prestige of your business. Buy and sell paintings by Jackson Pollock, Vincent Van Gogh, Johannes Vermeer, Eugene Delacroix, and Andrei Rublev and become the most Prestigious gallery owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In game play, players own three paintings by one of the greatest painters of all time. Each player will auction their own paintings (one of which is a fake) and try to acquire paintings of other masters throughout gameplay. During bidding, players may bid with all assets at their disposal and the player auctioning a painting may accept the best offer and does not have to simply accept the highest monetary offer.  Players also can draw Gallery cards that may give investment dividends or may be used as end game multipliers of Prestige points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
