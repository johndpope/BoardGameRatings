			<description>Mercado Sustent&amp;aacute;vel is a roll and move, buy/sell stock game. At each space on the board the players can buy companies, pay fees, receive dividends or pay debts to creditors (other players). In some areas, however, the players can purchase 4 types of certificate cards (&amp;quot;market&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Technology&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;environmental&amp;quot;) so that each time other players lands on one of your companies, you can exchange a certificate card for a certificate chip, upgrading your company. Whenever another player lands there the company owner must pay dividends for the company certificates of others players. During the game, players can also adquire  charges or dividends cards, which provide information on sustainable business growth.  When only one player remains in play, exhausting all resources of other players, he or she is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
