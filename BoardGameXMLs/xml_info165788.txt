							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Amega Weapon</name>
									
			<description>The Amega Weapon is all about defeating your opponents in a deep space war while surviving the dreaded Black Star, which is a totally random object that wreaks destruction wherever it goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While conventional weapons cause damage, The Amega Weapon quickly destroys ships, therefore, players want to obtain the parts to the weapon, build the weapon, then use the weapon to obliterate their opponents. The last star warrior standing rules the Parax System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amega Weapon is played on a game board that is created by placing 4 different boards together in any way, shape, or fashion that you choose with over 30,000 possible game board variations.  The boards are the beautiful artwork of Greg Winters, illustrator of Star Wars featuring 12 planets, 6 star bases, novae, and asteroids.  Greg also created our fantastic box cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amega Weapon showcases 7 custom designed pewter playing pieces that we spin cast ourselves. Additional components include: top notch quality Mission Profile cards, Deep Space cards, Asteroid cards, and 6 denominations of money along with two 6-sided dice, a 10-sided die, and a 20-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can elect to play one-on-one, team play, or a regular game.  The game is player tested for ages 12 and up with a special kid's game for ages 6 and up that does not interfere with the normal game.&lt;br/&gt;The questions you have to ask yourself are: Can you obtain The Amega Weapon?  Can you obliterate your opponents?  Will you survive the Black Star?  Do you even think you stand a chance?  Got control???  Think again, lol!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
