							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Administration</name>
									
			<description>The rules of the game, for example, start out with this explanation: &amp;ldquo;Unlike other board games, nobody really wins at Administration. During the game each player gets poorer as, little by little, all money and property pass into the hands of the Administration. Thus the game is much like real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to remain &amp;ldquo;financially solvent&amp;rdquo; if possible and the winner is the player who is still able to pay of his debts at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one plops around the board, after a throw of the dice, he is able to pick up certain pieces of property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These include such holdings as &amp;ldquo;The Managed News Service&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;Re-run TV Network,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Feather bedded Railroad&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;Lemon Auto Co.,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Rusty Steel Co.,&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Big Brother Power Co.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOWEVER, THERE ARE other blocks to land on and some of these carry rather snide directions such as:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Collect $2,000 for information on fellow taxpayer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Or, &amp;ldquo;Election time; Administration exacts your contribution. Pay $3,000.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Or, &amp;ldquo;You are remanded to public psychiatric hearing for remark critical to the administration; lose one turn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Or, &amp;ldquo;You get free Medicare but each other player pays tax of $1,500.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apparently, the game can get quite complicated. Quoting again from the rules: &amp;ldquo;When a player lands on another player&amp;rsquo;s privately owned property, rent shown on the deed is paid as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. The landing player pays rent to the property owner.&lt;br/&gt;2. The property owner is taxed half of his rent by the Administration, except that unions are exempt from this tax.&lt;br/&gt;3. If the property has a union, and if the union is owned, the property owner pays half of his remaining rent to the owner of the union.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still another aspect of the games comes in the collection of cards the player must draw from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are broken down into three groups, &amp;ldquo;Planning, Court Rulings and Favoritism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Planning cards include such directions as:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Share the wealth. Give $5,000 to the player who has the least cash.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Administration announces a new welfare program. You get something for nothing. A new tax. Pay $5,000&amp;Prime;.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;By extensive correspondence, you refute Administration claim that you owe $600 in back taxes. Pay $500 postage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Administrative planning staff hires malcontent leftist professors recently employed by the university. Pay $2,000 staff salaries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;COURT RULINGS&amp;rdquo; cards include these notices:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You win case but must pay $1,000 to Administration for court record.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You lose case and are charged $3,000 for contempt of court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;FAVORITISM&amp;rdquo; cards run like this:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rusty Steel Co. gets order from Communist for 190 million shovels. Administration subsidizes sale. If you own the company, collect $5,000 from the Administration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Administration gives you $9,000 for concocting an October crises for the next election.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Collect $3,000 for not raising cotton.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a relative of the chief administrator, you get cheap oil lease from Administration, which you sell back at a profit. Collect $4,000.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the message on the box the game comes in, Administration is &amp;ldquo;simple enough for children&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;delightful for adults.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
