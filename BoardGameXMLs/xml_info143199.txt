			<description>Pocket Footy is a dice game based on Australia Rules Football. 7 custom made dice represent players and actions on the field to simulate a fast, action packed game of Aussie Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's light, quick and simple to play. 7 dice, 1 bag and instructions - that's all you need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 7 dice represent 4 key playing positions, the Umpire who adjudicates who has possession of the ball, a Contest die that determines who wins the ball in open play and the Pass Percentage die that determines if a pass has been successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to get the ball down to your Forward positions and kick a goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aussie Rules football is a fast game and possession changes hands a lot. This game too is fast and hectic with players swapping dice as possession is won &amp;amp; lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 4 quarters of play, the winner is the player with the highest total of goals and points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a dice game, so luck is involved. There is the option to play some advanced rules that allow for re-rolls and a push-you-luck mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please enjoy it for a fast, light filler that Aussie Rules fans will love!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
