			<description>This is a carom style game that incorporates many NHL rules of play. The game board is a simulated hockey rink that comes mounted on a turntable for easy shot access. Each team has five 'player' pieces or wooden disks, and one goalie piece that's loosely attached (off center) to the board allowing it to spin around in the crease. The puck is a small round magnet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you get three flicks of your pieces. These can be used to pass the puck to an open player, shoot on goal, or just be a goon and smack your opponents pieces out of position. Be careful. If you're caught offside you might be stuck spending your turn flicking your players back across the blue line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
