			<description>This is a somewhat canasta-like word card game.  The deck has 108 cards, of which 6 are wild, and the rest have a letter and value.  15 cards each are dealt for 2 players, 13 for 3, 11 for 4; the top of the draw pile is turned over to start the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player: &lt;br/&gt;1. Draws two cards from the draw pile; or he may draw the top discard if he melds it immediately and places it the rest of the discard pile in his hand. &lt;br/&gt;2. Melds cards from his hand onto the table.  A meld is a  word of 3+ letters, and fewer wild cards than letter cards.  His first meld must be one word worth 15+ points; after that he may meld any valid word and/or place cards at either end of a previous meld to make new words. &lt;br/&gt;3. Discard one to the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hand ends when a player empties his hand by melding or discarding.  Each player scores: 50 points for each word with a value of 15 or more, 10 points for lesser words; a bonus of 50 for going out; and a penalty of double the value of the cards left in hand.  The overall game is won at 1000 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
