			<description>The World of Farland: An Epic Roleplaying Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farland is a campaign setting for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;reg;, a roleplaying game. Specifically, it is a continent on a larger world called Nurion. This small continent is home to Elves, a tall and mysterious race; dwarves, a race of miners and craftsmen; humans, a flexible and prodigious race; and dark folk, creatures of shadows and evil. Farland is important, however, because it is the focus of a war for liberation. Currently much of the continent is ruled by the Seven Lords of Sin, fell creatures who rule with an iron fist on behalf of a more mysterious being, the Dweller in the icy and evil Wintervale. Farland consists of six human kingdoms and one dwarven kingdom, all of which are struggling for liberation from this oppressive evil regime. This site details the kingdoms, places, personages, and events of Farland and the wars for liberation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
