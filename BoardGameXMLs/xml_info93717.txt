			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you hold back the FURY OF SHADOW? This adventure takes during the events in the Fury of Shadow boxed set, and is an appropriate climax to a fight against the Shadow&amp;rsquo;s major offensive on the forest of Erethor. Your band of resistance fighters must succeed at a suicide mission deep behind enemy lines. There is no escape for you, but neither will there be for the thousands of orcs caught in the after-effects of the magical cataclysm you hope to cause. There is an enemy beyond the servants of the shadow and the dangers of the burning line, however . . . one that you may not recognize until too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search and Destroy is a one-off Midnight adventure that premiered at Gen Con Indy 2005. It includes 7 pregenerated characters, but may be adapted as part of a running MIDNIGHT campaign. It makes an excellent adventure to end a mid-level campaign or to use to resolve a party&amp;rsquo;s defeat or capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: Ties into Fury of Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
