			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a lot of fun and slightly different.  Your two partners in crime have made it to the roof of the Vic national Bank and they're throwing the money down to you.  Catch as much of it as you can but it's not easy, the way it drifts around.  Stash it in the trunk of the getaway car and go back for more.  In the end, the police will arrive and you will discover that crime, indeed, does not pay - but it's kind of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
