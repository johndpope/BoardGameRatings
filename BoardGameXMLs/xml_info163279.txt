			<description>In a world of liars gods, angels and demons, creatures of myth and legend walk among us. Kłamcianka is a card game that simulates the start of these powerful beings in the struggle for considerable rate - angel feathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The form of the universe created by James Ćwiek, dozens of unique skills, special cards which place the game on its head and lots of laughter! Make truces, and then it quickly column -  in the Liar universe there is nothing permanent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the game? In short, the idea is to collect the largest possible amount of feathers (which icons are shown on almost every card) and most annoy other players would not have a chance with us when it comes to counting points. At the beginning of each game, each participant draws fun for yourself one of the characters and places it face &amp;quot;Inactive&amp;quot; to the top. Then all derive 7 cards on hand and starts playing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player in his turn, he may do one of the following: attack someone, play the effect described on the card, replace one card to another (in the dark), or select the card to be in the hands of their 7 (if our budget was depleted during the game) . Each card beyond the value of the feathers (which is taken into account only at the end of the game) has a specific strength. The majority also has its effect, which we can use for example during the fight, whether or separately - consuming it his turn.&lt;br/&gt;You have to combine so as to eventually collect as many feathers. For this purpose, it is certainly useful Liars title card, but it also has a hitch - yes, gives the largest amount of feathers (3), however, the player who will be at the end of most &amp;quot;Liars&amp;quot; automatically loses. Remedy this, we can only exchanging with others (hopefully take us to the card), or finding a card Liar, which cancels the harmful effects of one of the Liar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;important:&lt;br/&gt;the game can be purchased only in the set of the latest book Ćwiek - &amp;quot;Liar 2.5&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;rules have been on the last few pages of &amp;quot;Liar 2.5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
