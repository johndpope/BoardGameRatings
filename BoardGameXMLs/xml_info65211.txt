							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gem Cards Set One</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody loves getting gems as treasure. They are easy to carry, are generally worth more than their weight in gold (or Dollars, Euros, Interstellar Credits, etc.), and are pretty to look at. But that's the problem. In most RPGs, gems are treated as an additional type of treasure, but the &amp;quot;details&amp;quot; provided barely scratch the surface of what is needed to actually visualize them properly. Sure, you can describe a black-colored gem that has a white pattern on it to your players, but wouldn't it be much cooler to be able to show them a picture?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gem Cards were created for use with any RPG, in any setting. Gem Cards: Set One contains 96 different gems that you can print out to give to your players. Each Gem Card includes an image of a unique gemstone, a full description, and a base value. Just print them out and when your players find a gem you can hand them a card detailing the exact gem that they have found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fans of the Gemerator will instantly recognize the format of the description provided for each gem and, for fans of the Mineral Magic Series, we have also included a notation on the Gem Cards for gems that can be harnessed into a mineral magic item. In addition, rules have been provided for those GMs who would prefer to randomly roll for a gemstone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
