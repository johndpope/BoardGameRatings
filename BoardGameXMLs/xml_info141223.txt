			<description>Players are on vacation by car. They start with their pawn at the parking lot. They advance by roll of the dice. All players must go to one of the 6 vacation spaces and spend money there. At certain spaces, they can buy a card (&amp;quot;Ausweis&amp;quot;) which will help against bad events (avoid paying money e.g.). Most important is the membership card of the ADAC. A player who spends his vacation in a location of the ADAC will be paid for his next dice roll. &lt;br/&gt;After an agreed time, all players head for the parking lot. In order of arrival, they receive a certain amount of money. The richest player wins.&lt;br/&gt;Content: &lt;br/&gt;board, 6x10 cards (Ausweiskarten), 48 event cards, 6 pawns, 2 dice, playing money, rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
