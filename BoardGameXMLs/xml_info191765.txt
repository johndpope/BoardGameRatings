			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Kind old Monsieur Praslin is the proprietor of the greatest candy shop in town. This is not only on account of his superlative sweets, but because he is given to distributing free candy to children who come to him with tales of what good little tykes they have been. That, and sometimes he is not as sharp-eyed as he used to be, and is not as quick to notice if little hands grab an extra handful or two! However, the finest and most coveted confectionery of all, the famous Praslin's Praline, it sits upon the top shelf, and can only be obtained by the youngster who proves to be the most upstanding and precious among his or her peers &amp;ndash; or the one who shows the most moxie and swipes more than their share!&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns telling the player to the right (who temporarily assumes the role of M. Praslin) a tale of their angelic kindness. They are then rewarded with a penny sweet (represented by using an actual penny).&lt;br/&gt;Play continues thus, but in order to gain more confections, the character must secure the attestation of witnesses to their testimony. For each sweet that they already have, another player's character must agree that the tale they have told is true.&lt;br/&gt;There are four tiers of sweets represented by pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and a single quarter (25 cents) for the Praslin Praline. Coins may be exchanged according to their value. Higher worth coins require a greater number of witnesses for corroboration.&lt;br/&gt;Characters may also attempt to steal a sweet from one of the shelves by throwing all of their coins. If they get a &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; from one of their existing coins for that shelf, they succeed and gain one more. Otherwise they lose all coins that came up &amp;quot;tails&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
