			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World is slated to end, so we bring you the Final Battle (#2)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some believe the ancient Mayans predicted the end of the world at some point during 2012, but there's uncertainty about when during 2012 the world is going to end. Just in case, we all die early, NUELOW Games is releasing a final ROLF! product every month this year, each with its own theory as to how the end might come. Real Gamers will go out rollplaying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And while the Mayans may have predicted the End of the World, they did not envision the nightmare that Dr. Ghoul will visit upon the Earth if he succeeds in turning the world's women into men! They could not have imagined the horror and devastation that the Power of Peanuts will create when it is used for Evil instead of Good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is still hope! George Washington Carver, undisputed Master of Peanut Power, has traveled through time to 2012 to save us all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Washington Carver and the Nuts of Doom presents four linked Battle Scenarios tracing the development of Dr. Ghoul's evil master plan from 1922 through 1942 and to the final year of 2012. It also contains seven pre-generated characters (George Washington Carver, Jimmy Carter, Dr. Ghoul, Black Cat, Black Kitten, Peanut Brutes, and Swedish Bikini Team Members) and several Combat Manuevers and Traits for use in creating your own ROLF! characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Battles: The Mayans Predicted the End. NUELOW Games Exploits It!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
