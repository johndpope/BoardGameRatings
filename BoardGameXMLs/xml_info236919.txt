							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Return of Cyris Crane</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last autumn, Cyris Crane, brilliant businessman, loving father, world traveler, and one of the wealthiest and most respected men in Arkham, ventured into the Arkham hill country and disappeared in a sudden blizzard. Now, he has returned, much to the joy of his friends and family, and he has summoned them to his home to make a pronouncement to them ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Return of Cyris Crane&amp;quot; is a LARP scenario designed to be played with minimal staff and a small number of players. The only staff required are the Keeper and, if possible, a Stage Manager. The Keeper should familiarize himself with each character in this script as certain important details are integrated into their backgrounds. It is stat'ed for the Cthulhu Live 3rd Edition system but can easily be adapted for use with other LARP or tabletop games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
