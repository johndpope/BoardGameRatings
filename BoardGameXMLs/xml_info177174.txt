							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Edgewood</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thriving village Edgewood stands in the very shadow of the Shadetimer Forest. For 100 years, it has prospered. Wars, droughts and pestilence striking other nearby settlements never seem to affect the village, and yet tragedy mars life in Edgewood. For every year, terror stalks the village and its inhabitants die seemingly random but horrible and gruesome deaths. Thus, despite its prosperity, Edgewood remains a small place, and few travellers remain there for long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
