			<description>STARS &amp;amp; CROSSES: Wargame rules for company-level battles on the Western Front in World War 2 in 6mm scale. Incredibly simple and flexible rule system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn, with modular expert rules you can use to customize your game play. Includes a PDF with printable counters and terrain hexes. Can be played as a hybrid board/miniatures game, thanks to unit bases that double as board game counters, with essential combat stats printed right on the unit base! Each player takes the role of a US Army or Wehrmacht platoon or company leader, with one or more platoons at his disposal, plus additional units purchased with a point-buy system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hex-based movement (no rulers needed!)&lt;br/&gt;    Intuitive range and sighting rules&lt;br/&gt;    Command and initiative&lt;br/&gt;    Custom-equip your rifle squads with snipers, bazookas, panzerfausts, and more&lt;br/&gt;    Infantry close assault and armor overrun rules&lt;br/&gt;    Ground attacks by air units&lt;br/&gt;    Called artillery fire&lt;br/&gt;    Wounded, medics, and aid stations&lt;br/&gt;    Specialized ammo like white phosphorus, smoke, and proximity shells&lt;br/&gt;    Stats for dozens of infantry and vehicle units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
