			<description>A card and dice game for 2-4 players where players roll the dice trying to match the numbered cards in front of them.  The ten cards are numbered 2 through 6, and 8 through 12 (no number 7).  The players also receive 25 counters in a single color.  &lt;br/&gt;The game is played by rolling the dice and matching the number rolled to the cards in front of them.  If a number that was previously rolled is rolled again, the next player shouts &amp;quot;Whoopee!&amp;quot; and play passes to the next player to the left who still has that number face up.  If no one has that number still face up, the current player keeps rolling.  If a 7 is rolled, the player has to place a counter in the center of the table and play passes to the player on the left.  Play continues until one player has turned over all their cards.  That player gets all the counters in the table's center plus one counter from each player per card remaining face up.  That player then begins the next round.&lt;br/&gt;(from the enclosed &amp;quot;Directions for Playing Whoopee!&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
