			<description>MONSTArgh! is a funny card game where you have to make your monsters the stars of a crazy b-movies film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In MONSTArgh! each player receives a species token face down and they secretly look at their assigned species. The game deck contains 6 monsters of each species with values from 1 to 6. The game deck is shuffled and each player begins the game with a hand of 3 monsters (of his/her assigned species or not!). In each turn a player has to put one of his/her hand cards on the game surface, adjacent to any other card that was there. If the value of the played card is exactly one point higher than any of the surrounding cards, then an interaction happens! In that case, the card played goes on top of the one on the table. The incoming monster eclipses the others performances!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep your monsters in the foreground and eclipse your rivals because your goal is to be the player with most monsters of your species visible on the table once all the cards of the game deck have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
