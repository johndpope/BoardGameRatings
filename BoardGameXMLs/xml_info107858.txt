			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords are gathering warriors to their sides to defeat their foes, claim powerful artifacts and grow rich in gold. This is a miniatures battle game where the Lord and his warriors are on the field to sow terror and reap glory. All melodrama aside, DTB is a quick and simple battle game. Any kind of miniature can be used as long as it is of a similar scale as the others used. Figures are not even needed. Slips of paper or different color poker chips can be used. As long as all players know who belongs to who, it does not matter. Players keep their record sheets to bring their Lords and warriors back to the table to further increase their spoils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
