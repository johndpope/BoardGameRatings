			<description>Birds was a promotional game distributed by the Woolson Spice Company for mailing in &amp;quot;Lions head cutouts&amp;quot; from Lions Coffee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, you draw the top card and give the top clue to the next player. If he knows the correct answer, he claims the card. If he gives the wrong answer or passes, the next clue is given to the player on his left, who will claim the card if they get the answer right. And so on, around the group, until the card is won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher, a coffee supplier, claims that this is one of 60 games they have published!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
