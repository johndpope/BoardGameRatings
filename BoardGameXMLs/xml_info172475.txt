			<description>The Invader has taken everything from us... except our free will.  As humanity rose to its zenith and laid claim to the solar system, there were no celebrations, no cries of victory, no songs of conquest &amp;ndash; there were only wry, sarcastic smirks and debates concerning how long it would take humanity to ruin the neighboring planets of the solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They felt no need to rush, for they had already won the war... Or so they thought.  Then the Invaders came.  Technologically advanced, hyper-militaristic, highly organized... they found in humanity a race bent over and begging to be conquered.  They devastated, annihilated, and set up their own system of rule. They took their time in destroying our off-world colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy Metal Thunder is an interactive fiction game written by Kyle B. Stiff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
