			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a con artist who has come to the Imperial City posing as the diplomatic representative of a far off (and quite fictitious) country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where are you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Imperial City. The Empire once stretched out across a massive continent, from sea to sea. The Emperor ruled his distant provinces from behind the thick walls of the Imperial City, never venturing outside. But that was long, long ago. Now the Imperial City and a few hundred square miles surrounding it are all that&amp;rsquo;s left. But though the glory of the Empire has faded, its importance has not. The Imperial City is home to a number of artisans and crafters who possess the knowledge and the skill to build the amazing clockwork devices that are common in the Imperial City but command a king's ransom in the outside world. Thus, the Imperial continues to hold itself above nations many times its size and power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are you here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Imperial City is a place of fabulous riches and technical marvels. The standard of living here is better than anyplace else. So as long as people think you're a legitimate diplomat, you can live like a king!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do I do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, mostly you try and lead a life of decadent hedonism. Too bad you keep getting caught up in the intriguing of other diplomats and preventing your lie from being exposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do I do that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a con artist. Be charming, glib, fast with your wits and faster with your feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
