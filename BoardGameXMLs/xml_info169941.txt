			<description>In Juris Perjurious, players are wealthy Roman citizens who have gathered at the city forum to discuss new laws. Players are dealt a hidden support card representing an influential citizen who supports their claims. Your goal is to be the first player to collect 11 coins and get your new law approved. Each turn you may trade away your support card or use individual support card powers. Using the ability of a support card is the only way to collect coins needed for victory. Players will claim they have support of various citizens to gain coins, look at other player's cards or they may trade coins or cards, it will be up to all players to decide who may be bluffing. Players can only be stopped by making a public challenge of their support. If you are wrong a small fine is paid to the city Quaestor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
