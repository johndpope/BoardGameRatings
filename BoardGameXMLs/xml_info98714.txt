			<description>The game consists of cards which contain a word in three ways: &lt;br/&gt;- the written word&lt;br/&gt;- a version in which each letter is represented by a picture (of an item starting with that letter)&lt;br/&gt;- a picture of the word. &lt;br/&gt;There are also 26 smaller tiles which show the representative pictures (see above) on one side and the letters on the other.&lt;br/&gt;The three versions are used for different age levels of writing students. &lt;br/&gt;The cards are put into the box in two piles, so that just one set of information is visible. The active player now has to form the word either from the letters or the pictures. If s/he is correct, s/he can move his/her pawn to the next field of the word's color on a scoring track. Occupied fields are ignored, so there is a certain level of strategy involved. The first player to reach the top field on the track is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User sumary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
