			<description>From the deigner :&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simulation of the North Africa campaign of WWII. &lt;br/&gt;Card game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Germans (&amp;amp; Italians), the other player is the Commonwealth (British &amp;amp; Allies).&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game turn consists of three phases. In the Logistics Phase, the players draw a hand of cards (the number drawn by each player varies from six to eight depending on the stage of the war). In the Strategy Phase, the players may discard up to three cards and draw replacements. In the Battle Phase, the players reveal their hands and the player with the highest Force point total wins the hand and takes a Terrain Token from the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with three Terrain Tokens. The game ends when one player controls all six Terrain Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
