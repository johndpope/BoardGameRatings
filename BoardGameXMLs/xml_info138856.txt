							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jacqueline Makarov and The Red Storm</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacqueline Makarov attended the U.S. Air Force Academy.  She specialized in Cyber-Warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon graduation, she went to work for Air Force ISR. She was then transferred to Red Storm (Spetsnaz Intelligence), immediately following reorganization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She was instrumental in preventing multiple cyber attacks against U.S. interests from nongovernmental organizations. Jacqueline always had a special hatred / rivalry with Rebecca LaRue.  She wanted to be the #1 in the eyes of the Red Storm and also to Kazlov. She possessed the intelligence and the power, and also the overall killer instinct that would prove her worthy in her coming into power aggressively and politically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
