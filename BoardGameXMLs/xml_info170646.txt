			<description>Played similarly to Monopoly, players use dice to move around a board and buy industries. The goal of the game is to have the best reputation for philanthropy and social justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Monopoly, any player landing on an industry space owned by another player must pay the owner. However, a player may become &amp;quot;the best in their industry&amp;quot; by giving up their move and paying 2,000 in currency to purchase a ring. When a player lands on an industry space with a ring, the owner of that industry must pay the active player. This represents the social responsibility of being the best in an industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a player must have four rings on four different industries he owns. He also must land exactly on the Charity Shop space and pay 2,000 in currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
