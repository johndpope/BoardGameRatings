			<description>In Baby Blues, every player is an employee in a daycare center. You are responsible for five babies, and you will have to do anything that is needed to keep them happy. As soon as they start crying, you won't be able to make them happy again. When a player is faced with five crying babies, the game is over and the other players score points for all non-crying babies. Every baby has a point value that is known only by the owner of the baby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make your life hard in the daycare center, opponents will attach bad cards to your babies so that they become unhappy. At the end of your turn, you have to find a solution for an unhappy baby or he'll start crying. A few things that happen in the game are stolen pacifiers, babies that need a diaper change, and crying babies that receive a toy horn so they can make even more noise. For almost every card played there is a reaction. For example, if an opponent makes your baby nervous, you can play calming music from a mobile, but as a reaction they can break your mobile to keep the baby nervous. You can feed your baby, but your opponents can steal your food...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't have the right cards to keep your babies happy, don't worry. Your colleagues are there to help! During your turn you can trade cards with other players. If you receive the right card in your turn you can still make your babies happy again and prevent them from crying. But be aware your colleagues can also try to trick you by giving a different card as the one they promised! So do you want to make friends so you maybe could also get a little help later in the game or do you just want to make your colleagues completely mad? It's up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
