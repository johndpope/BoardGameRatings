			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porfirio's amazing adventures in the country.&lt;br/&gt;Porfirio is a cat &amp;mdash; a couch potato, a philosopher, a family pet, just a regular cat happily living with an ordinary family in a city. His lazy life is interrupted when his little owner is sent to the countryside to live with her grandparents for the summer. Naturally, she takes her best friend Porfirio with her.For an urban cat, the country is a nightmare! Instead of pillows and blankets you get a pile of straw in the barn; instead of canned cat food on schedule you have to search for something to eat. And those terrible local cats could upset anyone... but not Porfirio! He will prove to these country cats that urban cats are worth something!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path to the title of &amp;quot;top cat in the village&amp;quot; is not a simple one, but it is an interesting one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Running races;&lt;br/&gt;- Dangerous fishing missions;&lt;br/&gt;- Acrobatic traveling on the roofs of houses;&lt;br/&gt;- Battles with angry wolves;&lt;br/&gt;- A poetry contest for intellectuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these adventures and more lie along Porfirio's path to his goal!&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
