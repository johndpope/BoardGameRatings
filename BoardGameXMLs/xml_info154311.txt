							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Odyssey</name>
									
			<description>Odyssey is played by two players on a hexagonal shaped board comprised of 91 hexagons, six to each side.  One side of the board is the home row for black, the opposite row is home for white.  Each player begins with six pieces on the board, one on each hex of their home row, and four pieces in reserve, which may enter the game later beginning with the far right hex of the home row.  On every turn, each player throws two six-side dice, and moves two of his pieces according to the outcome of each die, the number of each representing the number of hexes a piece may move.  All moves are either forward or sideways (parallel to the home row.)  The first player to move all ten of his pieces to his opponent's home row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
