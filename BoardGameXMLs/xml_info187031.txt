							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeons of Ice</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the top of a frigid mountain pass lays a ruined castle. Rumored to be haunted, this once imposing fortress is now nothing more than crumbled walls and towers of rock and ice. Although the castle has been deserted for years most travelers still consider going near it dangerous and using the pass that goes near it ill advised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your group of adventurers is treasure hunting or just trying to take a shorter route over the mountains, they may find themselves trapped in the haunted dungeons of Stormholm Fortress, and escaping may not be so easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to challenge your players, Dungeons of Ice is written for five level three or level five characters using rules from the fifth edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular role playing game. This location-independent, dungeon crawl-type adventure can be played as a stand-alone module or added to an existing campaign as an unexpected detour. There are plenty of challenges to overcome including, traps, a secret code to decipher and of course monsters to conquer. Detailed maps are included for both the Game Master and the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
