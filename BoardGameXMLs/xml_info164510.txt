			<description>The players start at space 1 and have to get to the finish line at space 22, while minding the traffic rules. Movement is determined by a die. On their way, the players get  winning points awarded or penality points imposed. The last points are awarded for reaching the finish line (12 points for the first, 6 points for the second and 3 points for the third player). The player who gets the most points (after substracting the penality points) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
