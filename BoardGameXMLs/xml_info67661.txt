							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: Shrine of the Sisterhood</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thick stone door blocks the doorway, its surface carved with hundreds of shells and undersea plants. The stone has been smashed away around a keyhole beneath a rusty iron pull-ring. It looks as though the lock were destroyed and later repaired.&lt;br/&gt;The dungeon&amp;rsquo;s brick walls give way to a tunnel hewn roughly through the rock. Though wide and high enough to stand upright, the tunnel seems perilous, with an uneven floor and jagged ceiling supporting by rotting timbers. A few puddles of water glisten under the light of two hanging lanterns, and the distant rush of water can be heard through the walls. Countless humanlike dolls litter the ground, and at the bend in the tunnel, an open chest sits beneath three ragged tapestries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover Shrine of the Sisterhood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 11, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
