							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlechangers: Ironworks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlechangers: Ironworks builds on my non-D20 based standalone roleplaying game, Battlechangers (2012) and allows players to construct gigantic, transforming robots fully compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Where the original edition of Battlechangers (and the upcoming Generation Two revision) was a comprehensive homage to Transformers with a unique game engine, Ironworks deals with transforming alien mecha integrated into any Pathfinder-based campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This massive sourcebook includes a very comprehensive character creation system that will allow you to build everything from child-sized cassette spies to ground shaking, ultra-armored behemoths and everything in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But building your Battlechanger isn&amp;rsquo;t all you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do. Battlechangers: Ironworks includes dozens of racial traits and nearly 75 race specific feats, covering everything from the ability to assume Ground Walk Mode or unleash a Mini-Missile Flurry. Your robot might even become the recipient of the legendary Circuit Chalice, the badge of office carried by Freegear leaders, or be chosen as a herald of a star god.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the traits and feats, new spells like Fuelon Armada and Function Reformatting give Battlechanger mages some unique new occult weapons to deploy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, you&amp;rsquo;ll meet some intriguing new threats, including Dino-Berserkers, Tyrakron Hunter-Killers and Freegear Rebels, and learn how you can use this sourcebook to build non-sentient transforming mecha in addition to alien robots!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a free bonus, the original edition of Battlechangers: The Quick Play, Transforming Robot RPG is included in the download, so you can compare and contrast&amp;hellip;or mix and match&amp;hellip; as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
