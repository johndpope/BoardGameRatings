			<description>Shuffle the 8 Worship cards and place the deck near the board. Each card represents a Divinity. During their turn, players can take 1 card from the Worship deck plus 1 additional card for each 2 resources (any type) paid to the reserve. Players can keep only 1 card from those drawn, and the others must be put back (reshuffle the Worship deck). Keep the card hidden from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, a Worship card is considered accomplished if the player who holds it won his corresponding category. For each accomplished card, a player gains 3 VPs. For each card that is not accomplished he loses 1 VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
