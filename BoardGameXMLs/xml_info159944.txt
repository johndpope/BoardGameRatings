							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maleficium</name>
									
			<description>Maleficium is a competitive fantasy game for 2-6 players, with no player elimination. Players assume the role of one of twelve Magi, each with a unique set of abilities and who practice one of six specialised schools of magic. Players may develop their magi's powers throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spell-casting is done through the combination of a spell vocabulary to create different effects. For balance, effects are weighted, and action points are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A distribution of negative points, rather than the pursuit of positive points, is intended to encourage closer games. There is a set-collection sub-game for players who get loaded up on negative points early where they can access special abilities.  There is also a trading mechanic and simultaneous monster combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
