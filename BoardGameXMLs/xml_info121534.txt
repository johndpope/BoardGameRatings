							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Handicap Race Game</name>
									
			<description>Tin-plate game. It consists of a spinner with eight unequal areas. Each area is assigned to a horse and the bigger the are allocated, the shorter the odds for that horse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players just place their bets and spin the spinner. After the result, pay the winners and take in the losing bets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suspect that it was assumed that you would use counters as the 'money' and the one with the most counters after an agreed number of races, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can see no reason why adults might play this by using real money instead of counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
