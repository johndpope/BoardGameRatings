							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Breast Hope for Peace</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huda thought it was possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bikini model ushers in hope, change, and the possibility of world-wide peace! Her simple act of posing on the cover of a magazine brings world leaders together as never before, and a Golden Age is about to dawn on Planet Earth. Well, unless terrorist suicide bombers and Martian Special Forces don't put a stop to this digusting outbreak of peace and harmony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: The Breast Hope for Peace was inspired by the real-world controversy surrounding model Huda Naccache's appearance on the cover of Lilac Magazine. Written with all the insight and sensitivity displayed in The Death of Osama bin Laden and The Pimp, the Protester, and the Po-Po, Steve Miller and L.L. Hundal proudly present yet another work that informs while it entertains. (And they reveal the top secret true origins of Kim Jong Il while they're at it. Learn what the CIA and the Red Chinese don't want you to know!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring new combat maneuvers, traits, and five battle scenarios, this expansion also includes game stats for Huda the Bikini-clad Wonder herself, Barack Obama, Pope Benedict, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Chuck Norris, and five other major international figures. (And then there's the stats for Suicide Bombers and the Martian Special Forces....)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
