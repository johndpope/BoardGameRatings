							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quantum Collapse Issue #0: One Hero, Many Possibilities</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a universe with infinite possibilities, there are some interesting phenomena. What if a super-hero existed within several different realities?  How would he advance in power if the energy from his parallel identities was spread amongst the survivors? How would he be different in a world where the American Revolution never happened? What about if the Allies lost World War II?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet Hurricane, a former football player turned meteorologist who recently was imbued with super powers. He is presented at power levels 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16. Additionally, see how his world would be different with four alternate world histories. Hurricane is ready to be a friend or a foe in your Mutants and Masterminds game, featuring the Quantum Collapse campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
