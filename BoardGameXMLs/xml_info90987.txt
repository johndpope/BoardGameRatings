			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;500 GP is an arcade racing title developed by Namco. The game holds FIA licensing. Players can choose from three different tracks: Suzuka, Paul Ricard, or Jerez. Likenesses of real riders from the GP Championship are included in the game, and players can race on authentic motorcycles from Yamaha, Suzuki, and Honda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcade cabinet is equipped with a 3/4ths replica sportsbike that players use while racing. Steering is performed by tilting to the left or right, and the throttle and brakes are used to control speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
