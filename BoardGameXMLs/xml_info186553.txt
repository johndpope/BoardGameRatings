			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a stripped deck of playing cards.  Kings, Queens, and Jacks are retained by the suit player for special use.  Each player retains a stripped deck for their own use.  The rules detail three types of tests (Target Test, Skill Contest, and Opposed Test) characters make and how they resolve them using cards.  Court cards may be played in some situations to give a &amp;quot;Patron&amp;quot; boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have six Attributes (Charisma, Size, Willpower, Memory, Intuition, and Dexterity).  Each Attribute starts at 3 and characters then distribute 4 bonus points into whatever Attribute they like.  Characters then distribute 20 Skill Points into whichever Skills they like.  Characters then develop their &amp;quot;Persona&amp;quot;, a mental projection of their digital self in the Matrix.  This process is similar to the character creation process and uses a point distribution method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
