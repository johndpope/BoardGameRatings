			<description>A variant of Dou Shou Qi and L'Attaque; although very similar to L'Attaque this game has more in common with Dou Shou Qi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have eight pieces, six knights, strength eight down to three, A Herald, valued at two, and a trumpeter, valued at one. A piece can capture any piece with a lower value. However a trumpeter will lose to any piece which attacks it but will defeat the number eight knight if it attacks. If two knights of the same strength meet the attacker wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like in Dou Shou Qi the trumpeter (the Rat in Dou Shou Qi) is the only piece allowed to go through the fenced off areas (the river in Dou Shou Qi). However, unlike in Dou Shou Qi, it is the seven and eight knights (the Elephant and Lion in Dou Shou Qi) who can jump over the fenced off areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is essentially what R.C. Bell has described as the Jungle Game. The theme has just been changed from jungle animals to knights. See The Board Game Book, or Board and Table Games from many Civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
