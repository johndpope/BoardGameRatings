			<description>A casual, resource-management game about nature, beauty, and connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an unusual game because it is dual-purpose. Firstly, and most importantly, it is a good game: fun and interesting, and especially so when played with friends. However, at the same time, it is also designed to share and promote understanding and appreciation of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is centered around plant cards. Every plant card has a point value, and the winner of the game is the first player to collect 10 points. Plant Cards grow and change in response to randomly drawn Event Cards, and player-used Resource Cards. There are thirteen different species of plant in this game, and each has its own personality, which means that each responds to Events and Resources in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be successful, you must collect, trade, and play Resources in order to improve the plants on your own landscape, foil your opponents' plans, protect yourself from dangerous Events, and defend yourself from the snarkiness of your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
