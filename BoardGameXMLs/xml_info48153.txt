							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skyrealms of Jorune (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>A richly illustrated game that includes many detailed and unique races, cultures, and bizarre wildlife. It takes place on the planet Jorune, 3,000 years after an Earth colony settled and sparked a catastrophic war with the Shanthas, the dominant indigenous race able to wield the strange magical energies called Isho that permeate the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players seek to become Drenn, or full citizens. Players must accomplish deeds to impress other Drenn into giving their support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player races include Humans, Muadra (smaller humans capable of manipulating Isho), Boccord (larger humans with Isho sensitivity). Other human-related races include Woffen, Bronth, Crougar, which are uplifted wolves, bears, and cougars respectively. Native Jorune races include the spiritual and now dwindling Shanthas, the inquisitive Thriddle, the sometimes savage Ramian, and the vicious jungle Cleash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
