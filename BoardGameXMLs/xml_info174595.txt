The first such exercise was held back in 1949.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 2 or 4 players. Each player has one base with airport. In the base are anti-aircraft guns, ammunition depot, radar, ... The game has 3 levels. In the first level are light attack aircrafts and fighter-bombers. In the second level supersonic attacker aircrafts are added, and in the third level interceptors are added. The planes are armed with guns, bombs, Air to Ground missiles and Air to Air Missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main characteristic is that the game board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. Vertices of these triangles are points at which the players hold position and move figurines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a task to achieve as many hits as possible in the enemy bases.
