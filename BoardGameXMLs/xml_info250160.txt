							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Highway Marauder Targets, Set 2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, the post apocalypse is a bad place full of bad things and there&amp;rsquo;s not much point in being good anymore. With that in mind, the player characters have turned to terrorizing the passengers of the ruined freeways in search of gear and dangerous fun. So, what kind of vehicles and occupants might they run into as they lay in waiting along the roadside? This 50 list provides a detailed description of vehicle types, passengers, and possible gear that may be on board. Some targets are harmless and at the mercy of the marauders... others not so much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
