							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mausoleum Madness</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mausoleum Madness is centred around an ancient druidic temple, buried with time into the wilderness. The legends tell of untold riches and magical artifacts within - but no explorers have ever lived to tell the tales. In this adventure, players will have to find the entranceway to the legendary ruin - but that will be the least of their worries. Once inside, players will have to use everything at their disposal to solve riddles, avoid lethal traps, and fend off crazed cultists that worship something far below the earth...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mausoleum Madness was designed for a party of Level 3 players, though is primarily narrative-driven and may be adapted to the scale you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
