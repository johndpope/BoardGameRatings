			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcane Lore reveals a vast treasure trove about heroquesting. Collected from almost 30 years of questing, this book explores the philosophy, mechanics, and practice of heroquesting from a multitude of viewpoints and angles. Although much of the material was written for the old RuneQuest game, and other parts were used in the development of Hero Wars and HeroQuest, all of it is useful in understanding heroquesting and developing your own heroquests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to extensive sections on Heroquesting, God and Mortals, The Worlds, and The Mythic Ages, Arcane Lore contains over 40 pages detailing heroquests. From the Hill of Gold to The Quest for Knowledge, from the Jackal&amp;rsquo;s Path to the Westfaring, these quests provide details of Glorantha and the Hero Planes that have never been published anywhere. It also includes over a dozen maps and diagrams of the Hero Planes and Otherworlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although much of the contents are speculative and subject to change as development of HeroQuest continues, Arcane Lore is a book no serious fan or heroquester will want to miss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
