							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack</name>
									
			<description>Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack is a side-scrolling puzzle-platformer about a grumpy mutant Blob that escapes into the world and starts eating everything around him. A follow-up to PSN Platformer Tales from Space: About a Blob, Mutant Blobs Attack features new levels, new powers and controls, and a new Blob player character. The game is being created for the PlayStation&amp;reg;Vita handheld entertainment system.&lt;br/&gt; In Mutant Blobs Attack the player-Blob grows by eating loose objects in the game environment. Over the course of each level, the player encounters a series of obstacles he must grow large enough to bypass. The game combines traditional 2D thumbstick-based platforming controls with touch-based powers and abilities. Physics-based puzzles are often mixed in with the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
