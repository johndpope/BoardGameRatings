							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sentinels of the Multiverse: Gloomweaver â€“ Skinwalker Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>GloomWeaver had never felt such hatred as felt by Jack Donovan. So, when the villain known as Spite died, GloomWeaver offered him another chance to wreak havoc, but this time as an Agent of Gloom! Spite now hunts victims to bring about a new era of true gloom. And GloomWeaver works to enter this realm in a new way: this time through a vessel of flesh. Both of these promos bring horrifying new twists to the villain stories you have seen before from Spite and GloomWeaver. Good thing Dark Watch is here to help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released as part of the December Special - anyone purchasing any item from the publisher's webstore during December 2013 received this promo along with the Dark Watch and a Spite Promo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
