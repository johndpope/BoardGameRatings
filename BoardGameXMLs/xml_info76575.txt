			<description>Star Wars is an arcade game produced by Atari Inc. and released in 1983. The game is a first person space simulator, simulating the attack on the Death Star from the 1977 film Star Wars. The game is composed of 3D color vector graphics. This game was developed during the Golden Age of Arcade Games and is considered the #4 most popular game of all time according to the readers of Killer List of Videogames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of Luke Skywalker (&amp;quot;Red Five&amp;quot;), as he pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. The player's ultimate goal is to destroy the Death Star through three attack phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase of the game, the player begins in outer space above the Death Star. He must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase (occurring beginning with the second wave), the player reaches the Death Star's surface as laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. If the player manages to destroy a certain number of turrets, he will receive a sizable point bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the final phase, the player finds himself speeding through the trench of the Death Star, avoiding obstacles and blasting gun turrets until finally firing a proton torpedo at the correct time for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. What follows, if the player is successful, is the Death Star exploding in a multitude of different colors, plus the awarding of one bonus shield (on factory settings). If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, he will receive a sizable point bonus for &amp;quot;using the Force.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases in difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in the second round, and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, in order to give the player a chance to destroy the fired shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Wars (1983 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
