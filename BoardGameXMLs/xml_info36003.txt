							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbarella</name>
									
			<description>A card game inspired by the events and characters of the movie Barbarella.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck of cards. There are six suits in the deck, each with nine cards. The suites are Barbarella, Allies, Foes, Places, Events, and Things. The players score points by playing six-card combos. Scoring is as follows: one point for three pairs, two points for two three-of-a-kinds, three points for a flush, and four points for a straight which includes one card from each of the six suits. The first player to reach ten points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
