			<description>Muzundrum is a game of creating musical triads and scales by placing 12-sided musical dice on a hexagon-based playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers' website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muzundrum is a crossword-style game of music theory developed by composer J S Kingfisher. Players interlace 12-sided musical dice to form scales and triads on a giant honeycomb, forming unique tonal weaves... it&amp;rsquo;s great for beginners, challenging for pros, and always mind-bending fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 Twelve-sided Musician&amp;rsquo;s Dice&lt;br/&gt;The Honeycomb Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;Embroidered dice pouch&lt;br/&gt;Instruction Booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players, time required&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muzundrum can be played by 1 to 4 musicians of any age (see &amp;ldquo;knowledge required&amp;rdquo; below); or by 2 to 4 teams of musicians (playing in teams allows musical novices to learn from their more experienced partners). The average game lasts 15 to 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Muzundrum, players intertwine triads with scales, rather like a musical crossword puzzle (albeit a three way one). Triads are built vertically; scales are built diagonally. Points are earned as players add to or complete triads and scales; double and triple scores are earned when dice are played in the &amp;ldquo;honeypot&amp;rdquo; cells (the ones marked with 2&amp;rsquo;s and 3&amp;rsquo;s). The game is over when all of the dice are played; points are then tallied, and the player or team with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge required&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic working knowledge of key centers, major scales, and triad construction is needed to play Muzundrum &amp;ndash; all stuff taught in first-year Music Theory classes and by most private music instructors. In addition to being a heap o&amp;rsquo; fun, Muzundrum is quite educational: it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to become fluent in all 12 keys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
