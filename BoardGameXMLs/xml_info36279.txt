			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. World War II theme. Abstract platoon level combat. Each figure represents a company or unit of men. Victory: You rout the enemy if you destroy 9+ of his units.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the combatants. Each player starts with eight Infantry, four Tanks, and four Artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Air War rules variant replaces two to four Infantry units with Air units. Additional attack, move, and defense cards are added to the deck for the Air units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
