							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salt Lake City: The Game Of Monogamy</name>
									
			<description>Salt Lake City - The Game of Monogamy is a Monopoly clone set in the Utah Capital. Squares on the board share names with landmarks from and areas of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike some other Utah based Monopoly-style games, this one makes many references to Mormon culture and less to Utah scenery/buildings. Players can land on squares such as &amp;quot;Go to Church,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Choose the Right,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tithing.&amp;quot; Houses and Hotels are replaced with the ward houses and stake centers (names for Mormon church buildings). Also, all five playing pieces are directly related to Mormonism (CTR Ring, Bee of Deseret, Sunbeam Baby, Scripture Book, Brigham Young's Hat.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One interesting aspect of the game is that there are nine squares on each side of the board instead of the usual ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
