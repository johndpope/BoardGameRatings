							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arkanoid vs Space Invaders</name>
									
			<description>The game includes elements borrowed from Space Invaders and Arkanoid. The player maneuvers the Vaus spacecraft along the blue region located at the bottom of the screen, and must deflect a ball at a formation of bricks and Space Invaders aliens. The player will need to avoid fire from the latter, although the player can deflect the shots at the aliens. The goal of each stage is to destroy the formation of bricks as well as the aliens, and the player will move forward to the next stage once this goal has been completed. The player will need to make his/her way across several different worlds, with each world containing four stages. At the final stage, the player will need to fight a final boss before moving on. Once a world has been completed, the player will acquire a random power-up in the form of characters representing older Taito properties, such as Bubble Bobble, Darius and Psychic Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid_vs._Space_Invaders Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
