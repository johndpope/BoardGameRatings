			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Campaign Chunk is an item, place or something else that can fit into any campaign or story with little or no modification although some will be more suited to certain genres than others. They have few stats (if any) and help provide starting grounds for adventures or help fill in the gaps when your players go off exploring and you need something for them to do. Each has several hooks or rumour that can be used. Which of these are true and which are false?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally first published on the blog/website of Ennead Games, these Chunks have been compiled into a handy volume. Their details may have been cleaned up and more hooks or rumours added to them, but they basically the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume covers flora, or plants, with fungi or two thrown in for good measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find chunks for...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Apples/Apple Tree&lt;br/&gt;    Baobab tree&lt;br/&gt;    Giant Redwood&lt;br/&gt;    Peanuts&lt;br/&gt;    Puffball Mushroom&lt;br/&gt;    Rafflesia&lt;br/&gt;    Red Tide&lt;br/&gt;    Sunflower&lt;br/&gt;    Venus Flytrap&lt;br/&gt;    Wang Peony&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
