			<description>Heroic Samurai: One Brain Cell Rules for Clan Feuding in Classical Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These are rules for playing a wargame with toy soldiers. It is intended for several players - say 4 or more. Players control significant leaders - the key samurai of a clan, who in turn have contingents of fighters under them.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules are intended to simulate some of the smallscale&lt;br/&gt;conflicts that went on from time to time in Japan.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There are many sets of rules that simulate the epic battles of the Sengoku era, and a number of games about individual skirmishing. These rules are intended for situation in between these two scales.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There are many examples of fights breaking out between smaller families or clans - or even between factions within a clan. These fights might involve only a few hundred fighters - too small to be counted as a battle - too big to be a man-to-man skirmish. In this game, players are significant individuals - leaders with great martial skills - and they have a following composed of their friends, family, vassals and servants.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This means that the composition of the force controlled by a player can be highly varied.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The rules are written with 15mm scale figures in mind - but there is no reason why they can&amp;rsquo;t be adjusted for other figure scales - or even played with cardboard figures or counters depending on the sort of resources you have at your disposal.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
