			<description>All Gods Are Dying is a strategic board game about the true nature of religions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth is the planet of our evolution. The home of all mankind and all of it&amp;rsquo;s imaginary creations, the so called &amp;bdquo;Gods&amp;rdquo;. These things can elicit such emotions in humans that make them able to willingly do literally anything. Churches are organizations created to control and use these emotions. They nourish the delusion and work for their owners&amp;rsquo; greed. Atheists are free fighters against Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player leads a religion. Religion deceives with light but good things are all available by secular ways. Delusion, oppression flow from religion. Missionaries collect money and convert people. The aim is to make more money, to level-up the religion, to reach the highest level and power over all others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different kind of areas in the game where religion&amp;rsquo;s missionaries can get money from believers. City, country, and playground - because some religions like to use children for their purposes. Values are depending on the religion&amp;rsquo;s nature and popularity in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game on the first level. By collecting enough money you level-up your religion in greed. By successfully finishing a mission you level-up your religion in spirituality. On player's board numbers show bonus points or penalties valid at that level. That value influences the collected money and the power to convert as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four kinds of levels are to go through from white to red. With different colors new action cards and mission cards become available. Level-up by money becomes more expensive. You have five cards in the game, action and mission cards mixed. You have three cards hidden with face down. And you have to show openly the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may do the following in your turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Roll the dice and move your followers (the pieces)&lt;br/&gt;     Get your money from your followers&lt;br/&gt;     Or convert other player&amp;rsquo;s follower&lt;br/&gt;     Use an action card and draw another one &amp;ndash; action or mission card&lt;br/&gt;     And may accomplish one of your missions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or, if you don&amp;rsquo;t like your cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You may replace up to three of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your aims are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     to reach the top level of greed,&lt;br/&gt;     to reach the top level of spirituality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the game style you may win by reaching the top level, or beating others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
