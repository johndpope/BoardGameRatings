The other player is the Cowboys. The aim of the game is to kill 3 opposing gunmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 Decks: &lt;br/&gt;1.     The Action Deck&lt;br/&gt;2.     The Wound Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player sets up his men on his back 4 rows, up to one man per row, with none of the men touching or sharing a column or on the farthest left or right columns.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns. &lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 3 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  The hand is filled to 5 Action cards. &lt;br/&gt;-  For each of a player's men killed, 1 less card is drawn. &lt;br/&gt;2. Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  A layer plays &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; cards to move his men. &lt;br/&gt;-  Each man may move only once per turn. &lt;br/&gt;-  The man must be moved the exact number of spaces written on the card.&lt;br/&gt;3.     Shoot Phase&lt;br/&gt;-  A player may play a card to have a man shoot. &lt;br/&gt;-  Each man may shoot a max of once per turn. &lt;br/&gt;-  The shot is fired at an exact range as written on the card. &lt;br/&gt;The Shot will automatically &amp;ldquo;Hit&amp;rdquo; unless the opponent plays a defence card to negate it. &lt;br/&gt;-  If a shot is not negated 1 wound card is drawn from the Wound Deck and its effects applied to the target (e.g. killed, wounded, not wounded)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins when he has killed three of his opponent's gunmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
