			<description>BACKGROUND: Samurai Conquest is a semi-historical simulation of Japan&amp;rsquo;s Wars of Unification. The Player assumes the role of the head of the Tokugawa Clan during the later decades of Japan&amp;rsquo;s Wars of Unification (1540-1600). As the Leader of the Tokugawa Clan, you have the powerful ambition of conquering your Clan Rivals and unifying all of Japan&amp;rsquo;s Provinces under one ruler, you. Will you be able to fulfil your destiny to become the Shogun of Japan?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE: The Player takes the role of the Daimyo of the Tokugawa Clan and must muster his forces and manage his assets to defeat the rival Clans. The Player must control a number of Settlements whose Fortification Values (FV) total 60 or more by the time the last Campaign Card is played. If the Player controls a number of Settlements whose FV total is 20 or less during the Victory Check Phase, the Player loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: Samurai Conquest features a 4-Sheet Map, lots of colorful game counters, Campaign Cards, a Battle Mat for resolving Battles and much more. Units include Ashigaru Spearmen, Teppo (Arquebusiers) Infantry, Samurai Foot, Samurai Cavalry and individual Samurai Champions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you love movies like Ran, Kagemushi, The Hidden Throne, and Heaven and Earth, you will enjoy this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samurai Conquest can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
