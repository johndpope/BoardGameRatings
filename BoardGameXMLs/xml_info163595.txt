							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">8-bit Action Hero: Jungle Adventures</name>
									
			<description>Inspired by a certain sabre wielding hero from 8 bit computer games of the 1980's, 8-bit Jungle Hero is an adventure game played on a map that changes throughout play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to navigate the labyrinthine jungle paths of the lost valley, surviving the encounters within. Adventurers must locate the lost pieces of an amulet and then make it to the magic portal that will allow them to escape. At the same time travelers must avoid the predations of &amp;ldquo;The Beast&amp;rdquo; a terrible creature who patrols the valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players explore their surroundings, react to encounters, change the map of the valley and move &amp;quot;The Beast&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is a grid of tiles with four fixed points - mountains, within it.  As part of their turn players get the opportunity to rotate or move one or more of the tiles of the map, changing the paths through the jungle.  Players also have a short trail of tiles immediately behind them that they have already visited. This moves with them and can change in length depending on the items they are carrying.  This path cannot be changed by other players.  However if &amp;quot;The Beast&amp;quot; picks up this trail it will follow it and may attack the unfortunate adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time they enter a new tile players draw from an encounter deck.  This may produce a beneficial result but more often will reveal one of the jungle denizens poised to attach them.  Surviving an encounter may result in them getting treasure, including pieces of the amulet needed to escape the valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the valley is via a portal that moves around the outside edge of the map each turn.  To escape players must move off the edge of the map onto this portal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
