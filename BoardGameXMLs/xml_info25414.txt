			<description>Mindrubble is  a combination of abstract gaming and trivia games. That is: to make a move on the board, you have to answer a trivia question first. The game has 400 question cards in 3 categories: numbers, cities, people. Furthermore there is a board with a 8x8 grid, containing symbols of the 3 categories and 64 chips, grey on one side, black on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before starting the game 2 gray and 2 black chips are placed in the middle of the board. If you have 4 players, you'll play in 2 teams. On your turn you place a chip in your color on the board next to one of your opponent. Your goal is to capture your opponents chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How is that done? First you try to close your opponents chips in. For that you need to have your chips on both sides of your opponents. This can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Then you try and capture the chip(s) by answering a question. When answered correct, the opponents chip(s) are turned over. When answered incorrect, nothing happens and your opponent takes his/her turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the board is full or when no player can place a chip or when all chips are one color. The player with the most chips up, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
