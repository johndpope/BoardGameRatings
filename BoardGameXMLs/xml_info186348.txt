							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">These Goblins Won&#039;t Kill Themselves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elves of Igpay need your help!  Constant raids have left them a secretive and diminished race, and they have no means of protecting themselves from the dread Goblins of the Arkday Caves.  If only some of the fabled weapons of their greatest warrior, Erohay, could be recovered, they might stand a fighting chance...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Goblins Won't Kill Themselves is a real adventure with a humorous overcoat.  It is written in generic language and is readily adaptable to almost any role playing game system.  The first in a 3-part series, all of the adventures in this campaign may be played either as stand-alone adventures, or as part of an ongoing story line. This adventure is suited to 3 or more adventurers of begininning to low levels of experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
