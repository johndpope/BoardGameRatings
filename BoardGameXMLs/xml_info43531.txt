			<description>Want to enjoy a game of Age of Steam, but don't have the time?  Try this dice variant, which plays in about 30 minutes, instead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This takes the main elements of Age of Steam (the special actions, building track, and delivering goods) and distills them down to a Yahtzee-type game playable by 2-4 people.  There is no board, there are no auctions, and there's no permanent track built.  Instead, you just get 10 dice and 3 rolls each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a work in progress, so all feedback is welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
