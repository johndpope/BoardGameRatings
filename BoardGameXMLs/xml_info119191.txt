			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dicing Knight was a winner in the WonderWitch (a homebrew development kit) competition and was one of the last games to be released on the Wonderswan. You play as a knight who must traverse a randomly generated dungeon looking for keys that to grant you access to higher floors and eventually a boss battle. Once a boss is defeated you are presented with a new and more difficult dungeon to face. The fighting system is rather unique in that for every hit taken or delivered a dice pops out to determine how much damage is dealt. Some enemies will drop goodies, such as time freezes, fortune, invincibility and new abilities such as a drill arm.These items which can be stored and used at later date. Their effects only last for a limited period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strangely for a Japan only release all in game text is in English&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
