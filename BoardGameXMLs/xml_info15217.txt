			<description>In this game players take on the roll of firefighters. The board depicts streets and house locations (4 small houses and 1 large central public building). Wooden blocks are stacked on the structure locations to depict the buildings. Each building has a number: 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, and the large building is both 1-1 and 6-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn you roll the dice, and if you throw doubles, you remove the roof of the building with the matching number to expose the red surface underneath indicating a fire. You may then move your trucks the number indicated - either 1 truck the total amount thrown, or both trucks each using a number from one of the dice. You must throw doubles before you can move (thus starting a fire), but after that you can move regardless of what you roll. Each time a double of a house already on fire is rolled, a block from that building is removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To put out a fire, both spaces in front of a building must be occupied by a fire engine. Each truck then scores points equal to the remaining number of blocks for that building. If you own both fire engines, the second truck scores double points as a bonus. The large central building is also worth double points (or quadruple points if both fire engines are yours). The player with the highest score after ALL buildings have caught fire and been put out wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
