							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Urban Upstart</name>
									
			<description>Urban Upstart, programmed by Pete Cooke, is set in the fictional British town of Scarthorpe. Scarthorpe is a particularly grim town, with a high crime and unemployment rate. The protagonist begins in their house at three o'clock in the morning, with the objective of escaping from Scarthorpe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Richard Shepherd Software's previous adventure, Invincible Island, Urban Upstart did not come supplied with a separate &amp;quot;help program&amp;quot;. This was intended to take the pressure off the company with regards to giving hints, but only caused customer confusion. With Urban Upstart, Shepherd instead supplied help sheets to customers who wrote in asking for information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban Upstart is a text adventure in which the player types actions in verb-noun format. The upper half of the screen displays an illustration of the current location.  Typing in expletives results in the protagonist being arrested on obscenity charges and sent to a gaol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Urban Upstart&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
