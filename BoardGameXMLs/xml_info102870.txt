							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flummox</name>
									
			<description>Flummox is a tug of war fought with cards and brains. Each player has an exposed hand of cards they use to move and shift the Flummox token around the table. Sometimes players want to get the Flummox to land in their own hand, and sometimes it's best to send the Flummox to another player. Special cards can Stop, Bounce, Slide, and Bump the Flummox as it travels around the ring...sometimes with surprising results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flummox is a card game for 2 to 5 players and is suitable for families, parties, and gamers alike. The box includes 108 cards, a rule book, and an oh-so-cute Flummox figurine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
