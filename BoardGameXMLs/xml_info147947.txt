							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Old Cemetery</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 40 x 40 inch, Cemetery. It comes with Hex, Square and No Overlay and includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;It also includes 10 paper figures to use with the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entrance to the cemetery is the lych-gate at the bottom center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stonewalls completely surround the cemetery except for the eastern wall and  the southern lych-gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eastern wall is the remains of an old Abbey, whose high glassless windows,  overlook the cemetery. Two of these pillars have gargoyles resting atop them,  with a third gargoyle statue in the north center of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grounds are no longer well maintained, with the paths through the cemetery a mix of stone, gravel, and dirt intermixed with wilted grass and weeds choking  out the paths and giving the grounds a chaotic and uneven appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The many trees and bushes have long since died, but have been brought back  to a strange sort of life by the hundreds of spider webs that now cover them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple rows of gravestones are in the western and eastern parts of the map  and some surrounding the main center path in the south leading to the mausoleum on a hill in the middle of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large rocks, two stone statues watching the path, and a wilted tree line the path  from the lych-gate to the mausoleum. The four corners of the map have larger  crypts and tombs, some cracked and in poor condition. A gazebo with moss  growing on the top is also in the southwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old cemetery makes a great location for a necromancer to find corpses  to raise from the dead. The fact that mourners rarely visit the place is another  plus, meaning it keeps their activities away from the public and prying eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This makes the old cemetery the perfect spot for a zombie or ghoul infestation  to fight off. We&amp;rsquo;ve included some zombies and ghouls for just this use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps there are powerful creatures buried in the mausoleum such as vampires  or mummies. They leave the mausoleum at night to feed on the living, always  needing to return to the mausoleum before the sun rises. A rash of night killings  could occur in the local village, with victims drained of life energy and having  a shriveled appearance when found. The Player Characters investigate and  find out about the old cemetery, entering during the day to put a stop to  the killings and needing to fight off vampires or life stealing mummies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
