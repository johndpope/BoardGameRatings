							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Overkill</name>
									
			<description>OVERKILL is a fast-paced sci-fi skirmish game set in mankind's unstable and degenerate future, its not quite post-apocalyptic but its only a matter of time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the greatly expanded and more comprehensive second edition of the rules which revolve around an exciting and unpredictable initiative system that leads to incredibly tense and thrilling game-play. What also adds to the fun is the deteriorating turn sequence. Play commences with the turns switching regularly between both sides, but as the battle develops and armies become fully engaged, the turn sequence becomes more and more fickle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players would expect, the rules contain details of a large array of weapons, armour and equipment as well as extensive vehicle data and vehicle construction rules. Also included is wide-ranging background material that details the main warring factions and the cities and terrain that they fight over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERKILL&lt;br/&gt;also features a large section on campaign games which deal with army progression, promotion, recruitment, training and experience as well as details on trading, currency, intelligence gathering, propaganda, infiltrating, hiring mercenaries and executions! In addition to this OVERKILL also includes complete rules for solo gaming and seven scenarios for solo games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At heart, OVERKILL is a fast, simple and exciting rule system backed up by high levels of detail that allows players to expand the game in different and interesting directions. The rules require the clever use of weapons and tactics, command and strategy - and a bit of luck. Victory will go to the skilful player - not just the one with the biggest guns - although there are plenty of them in OVERKILL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
