			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Version - Designed to match the Terra Mystica: Fire &amp; Ice Expansion!  This newly redesigned version of our popular Terra Mystica overlays is made to allow compatibility with the Fire and Ice Expansion.  This new base game set can be combined with the keys from the Fire and Ice Expansion to form a complete set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This laser cut accessory fits precisely over the top of your faction player mat, providing spaces for each building, power disc bowl, ship and shovel level. In addition each overlay comes with an innovative interchangeable key section allowing for the 2 &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; factions that are dramatically different than the others. Each set is comprised of 5 Bases, 5 standard Faction keys, and 1 each of Mermaid and Fakir Faction keys. All of the components are laser cut from 3mm Acrylic and may contain a protective film/paper on one or both sides that is easily removed. Patent Pending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        We have been made aware of thickness variability in the production process of Acrylic. Normally this would not be an issue as each overlay or tracker was it&amp;rsquo;s own independent entity. However, with this overlay implementing interchangeable parts it is conceivable that you might notice it. Even though we are attempting to cut each set from the same sheet, the variations still persist, so there really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything to be done except let you know about the potential cosmetic inconsistencies.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
