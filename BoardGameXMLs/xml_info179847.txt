							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Queen of the Labyrinth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reluctantly, Hera repressed her anger and devised a plan instead. The only way to give the Cosmos a rightful ruler was to enter the contest, but she was sure her husband wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of being ruled by her in the future. If she openly asked to enter the competition, Zeus would surely not allow it. She then resolved to act with secrecy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen of the Labyrinth is the second supplement for Mythos, a setting of epic adventures in mythological Ancient Greece. This second supplement details Hera as she enters the Heavenly Contest. With her entry into the Heavenly Contest, Hera grows in Patron Deity potential with Mystery Cults, new heroes to sire, new lands to explore, and a deep delve into the Labyrinth of Knossos in Crete where the minotaurs dwell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Queen of the Labyrinth is designed for players and GMs and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A new playable race &amp;ndash; minospawns&lt;br/&gt;    New Hindrances&lt;br/&gt;    A new Patron Deity entry covering Hera&lt;br/&gt;    Two new Mystery Cults&lt;br/&gt;    Information about the Island of Crete&lt;br/&gt;    A write-up of daemons&lt;br/&gt;    A toolkit for navigating the Labyrinth of Knossos in Crete, usable for any labyrinth or dungeon delve&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip; and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
