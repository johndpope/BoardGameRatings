							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mytteriet p√• Bounty</name>
									
			<description>A game based on the Mutiny on Bounty. &lt;br/&gt;The players starts with 120 points each and the goal is to keep as many of the points as possible. As the players roll the die and move around the board (following the route of the ship) they earn and loses points based on where they land. &lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points at the end, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Damm game number 336.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
