							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DEVICE 6</name>
									
			<description>A surreal thriller in which the written word is your map, as well as your narrator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEVICE 6 plays with the conventions of games and literature, entwines story with geography and blends puzzle and novella, to draw players into an intriguing mystery of technology and neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anna wakes up in a castle on a remote island, with little recollection of how she got there. All she remembers is an unusually unpleasant doll...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are there two identical castles on the island? Who is the mysterious man in the bowler hat? And above all, what is the purpose of the tests Anna is put through?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read, listen and peek into three-dimensional photographs to solve the bizarre mysteries of DEVICE 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
