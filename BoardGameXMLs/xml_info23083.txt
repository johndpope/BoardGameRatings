			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Force Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to introduce a novice wargamer to conflict simulation, these games rely on familiar mechanics from other games you may have played to allow players to focus on strategy instead of learning new rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Force: Hammer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game introduces a bit more combat, including tanks, scouts, commanders, and militia. Instead of hunting bad guys, you're trying to take control of your opponent's territory by getting your population into his city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
