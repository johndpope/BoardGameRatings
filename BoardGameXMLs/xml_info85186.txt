			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schwimmbad Tycoon (an English release would probably be called: Swimming Bath Tycoon) is a management simulation game about managing a swimming bath. First the player has to build his location (including the option to designing his own water slides), put snackbars and other shops in for additional income, hire staff and after all that is done, open and watch his customers swim and spend their money. There's also a dynamic weather system which influence your customers (less people will swim on rainy days).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 12 specific missions (goal to meet) and a 'free build mode' in which the player can just endlessly run his compagny and expand with new water features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
