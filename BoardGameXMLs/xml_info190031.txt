			<description>In Coding Gear, players compete to infiltrate the opponent's install gate or remove the opponent from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of nine tokens: two each that show movement to the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) and one that shows your install gate. At the start of play, each player secretly chooses one of their tokens and places it on their install gate, with these gates being located at opposite corners of a 3x3 grid. Then they each program three moves on their side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player reveals their first token and carries out the move, then second player carries out their first token, etc. If you choose the install gate, you must choose one of your tokens and place it face down on your install gate; if you choose movement, you must move one of your tokens one space in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you move or install on an opponent's token, you capture that token; on future turns, you can use that token to program moves, but you can't place it on the board. If you move or install on your own token, you stack them; on future turns, if you move a stack of at least two tokens, you can jump an empty space with some of the tokens, leaving at least one token behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you remove all of the opponent's tokens from the board, you win. Alternatively, if you simultaneously occupy both install gates, you win. If you can't move or move your only token off the board, then you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
