							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sexuality in Role-Playing Games</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role-playing games offer a chance to pretend, make-believe, and share fantasy. They often invoke heavy themes into their game play: morality, violence, politics, spirituality, or sexuality. Although interesting moral debates perennially appear in the media and academia concerning the appropriateness of games&amp;rsquo; ability to deal with such adult concepts, very little is known about the intersection between games, playfulness, and sexuality and what this might mean for players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book offers an in-depth, ethnographic look into the phenomenon of erotic role-play through the experiences of players in multiplayer and tabletop role-playing games. Brown explores why participants engage in erotic role-play, discusses the rules involved in erotic role-play, and uncovers what playing with sexuality in ludic environments means for players, their partners, and their everyday lives. Taken together, this book provides a rich, nuanced, and detailed account of a provocative topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
