			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How can you add more inner conflict, fear or change, and wonder of discovery to your transformation adventures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Design Volume 12 - In a change story something upsets the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s life in a significant way. The character then has to adapt and come to terms with that change. It can be something normal yet tragic, like the death of a loved one or being diagnosed with terminal illness. It can be a good yet scary thing, perhaps moving to a strange new place or winning the lottery. The change can be a physical transformation, such as gaining superpowers. The change might simply be a realization or shift in awareness, like discovering that wizards exist and you&amp;rsquo;re one of them. The focus is on the process coming to grips with the upheaval in the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s life, and settling into a new status quo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of the change plot include The Catcher in the Rye, The Last Picture Show, My Fair Lady, The Paper Chase, Red Badge of Courage, and Straw Dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
