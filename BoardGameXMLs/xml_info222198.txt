			<description>In this game each player forms a director of a fine art museum. Your task is simple yet so difficult to achieve, collect as many artpieces as you just can with the lowest prices. The box contains 32 cards with various fine art paintings on the front side, and 55 black plastic chips that represent resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhibition is an auction game, where your goods are represented by the black chips. You can pay a chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card, or you can pick up the current face-up card and reveal the next card from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paintings are numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value. Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors. Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is who collect the most paintings for the lowest price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
