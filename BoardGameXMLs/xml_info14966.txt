			<description>The players are visitors to an art gallery and want to leave with as many memories as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard shows the art gallery, divided in several rooms. At the beginning of the game, the players can buy tickets for the different rooms. After that, the game starts. Each turn, a player rolls the dice and advances his pawn as many fields as shown on the die. If he lands on a field with a memory, he can take it. If he lands on a field with a ticket box, he can buy a new ticket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players may challenge the active player and ask him to show a ticket for the room he is currently in. If he cannot produce such a ticket, he must pay a fine and leave the room, without taking any memories. If he does have such a ticket, the challenger must pay him a fine. A player who runs out of money must sell off some tickets; if he still does not have enough money, he is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players have left the gallery; the player who has collected the most memories wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
