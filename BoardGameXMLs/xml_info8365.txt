							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon at Lutzen</name>
									
			<description>This game  recreates the Battle of Lutzen (also known as the &amp;quot;Battle of Gross-Goerschen&amp;quot;) which was fought on May 2nd, 1813 and was the first major battle of Napoleon's 1813 campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a unique system not repeated elsewhere.  It has a Igo-Yougo sequence of play with fire combat taking place before or after movement, at owning player's choice (but the non-phasing player always fires first), and melee combat at the end of a player turn.  The command system uses a set of orders changed at the start of player turn, indicated by placing chits next to units or groups of units: MANEUVER (the default), MARCH, INF FIRE, INF ASSAULT, CAV CHARGE, ARTILLERY IN BATTERY, RESERVE.  Units that are out of command range can only switch to Maneuver orders or stay in reserve. Orders affect melee and fire strength and also the strength of a unit's Zone of Control. Victory is terrain and morale-driven. Morale is affected by losses and taking units out of Reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;scale = 402 m (0,25mi = 439 yards)/hex; &lt;br/&gt;time = 30 min/GT; &lt;br/&gt;size = regiment/brigade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
