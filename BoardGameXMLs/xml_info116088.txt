			<description>Bratz: Rock Angelz is a 2005 video game based on the popular Bratz fashion doll line. This is the first Bratz game published by THQ. It is based on the direct-to-DVD movie and the collection with the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These PlayStation 2 and GameCube games are an open world sandbox adventure, similar to the Grand Theft Auto series (it even shares the same RenderWare engine with the GTA series, most especially the Grand Theft Auto III-era games).  The player controls one of the four Bratz girls - Yasmin, Cloe, Sasha and Jade - who are attempting to launch their own fashion magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jade had taken a job as an intern for her favorite fashion magazine. A problem, caused by twins Kirstee and Kaycee, results in Jade being fired from Your Thing magazine. Her friends decide to cheer her up by suggesting they start their own magazine. After redecorating an old office the four girls launch Bratz Magazine. Later the girls launch their own line of fashion and form a rock band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can explore three locations; Stylesville (also known as Bratz Town), London and Paris. The objectives of the game are triggered when the player takes the correct Bratz girl to a speech bubble. During the game blue coins called blingz appear, which are money for the Bratz girls. Each girl carries a mobile phone, used to send messages between characters, check the amount of blingz owned and the location of the next objective. The phone's cover and ringtone can be changed. The player character can also collect character coins, used to buy movie clips from the 25 available for each Bratz girl, take pictures, and play mini-games for extra money. The girls' make-up can be applied as the player wishes, the Bratz characters can be guided to shops, to buy the latest trends with their collected blingz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini-games are activated by going to certain locations or talking to non-player characters. They include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Posing game - The player must do the button combinations before the time runs out. In certain objectives, this mini-game will be featured.&lt;br/&gt;    Blown Away! - The player has to pick up pieces of paper that a person has dropped, and return them.&lt;br/&gt;    Model Behavior! - The player has to take pictures in a photo booth.&lt;br/&gt;    Rockin' Racerz - The player has to put on the Bratz girl's roller skates, and grab the flags as fast as she can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bratz: Rock Angelz (video game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
