			<description>Players impersonate squirrels who are looking for food: fungi, nuts, pine cones, rowan-berries. Cards are put in one pile and revealed one by one while forming another pile. When someone uncovers a squirrel then he/she must say which kind of food his animal eats. Player takes every card in reject pile with food that he has chosen and lays those cards next to others with this food. The player who collects the most number of cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
