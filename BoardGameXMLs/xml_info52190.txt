			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, the final installment of the Macho Women trilogy is finally here, to close the book on gaming's answer to The Satanic Verses.  Once more, we rehash old rules with new broads, and persuade you to part with your hard-earned dollars for what has got to be one of the most overhyped ideas of the year.  But wait, there's more!  BWBFH includes the aerial combat rules for the system, as well as new creatures, and combined arms rules to play all three games at once.  You also get two (count 'em) 11x17 pseudo-official Macho Women posters for your home or office (if you want fired).  And last, the BTRC rips the veil of secrecy off the gaming industry and presents the long-secret Game Name Design Tables, which allow you, the gaming peasant, to go through the same process used by major game companies to name their products.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
