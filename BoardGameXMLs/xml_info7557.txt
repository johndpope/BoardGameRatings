			<description>This is Battlegame Book 1.&lt;br/&gt;The second half of the book contains 4 games, each with an A3 colour board, and monocolour pieces to cut out and assemble (most are folded like a triangle to make a stand-up piece with 2 faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four games are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buffalo Hunters: for 2 to 4 players.  Players control a chief and a brave, and have the object of capturing horses and buffalo.  The animal pieces flee when an indian moves adjacent to them, so the trick is to drive them onto your other piece sitting in a stationary ambush or to drive them against an obstacle.  A horse doubles an indian's movement and is required to transport a dead buffalo back to camp.  Combat and theft of animals is permitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Cloud's War: for 2 players.  The US Govt player has to keep supply wagons rolling up the trail to Fort Keogh, the Red Cloud player needs to stop the wagons and starve Fort Keogh to surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Horse: for 2 to 4 players.  Use your surveyors and construction gangs to build your railroad to Central City before the other players.  This would be simple were it not for the Indian tribe which means you have to hire gunmen for protection.  Gunmen can also be used to terrorise other player's workers, or to have a shoot out with another gunman.  Some gunmen are better than others, and all will work for the player offering them the most money!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lincoln County War: for 2 players.  Major Murphy and Sherriff Peppin take on Alexander McSween and Billy the Kid.  A real wild west shoot out, with the Kid's gang trying to break through to the Chisum spread before the rifles, pistols and Col. Dudley's Gatling gun mow down McSween or the Kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
