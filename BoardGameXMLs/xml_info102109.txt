			<description>The first installment for the Super Famicom, originally released on December 13, 1991, and later released for the Wii Virtual Console on June 2009. This game was also remade for the i-Appli, S!-Appli, and EZ Appli mobile phone services in 2005. Due to the change of hardware, many improvements were made such as 3D-like visuals that made use of gradiation and stereo sounds and voices. A &amp;quot;mosaic guessing&amp;quot; mini-game has also been added as well where the player must guess the identity of an object covered by mosaic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of its inclusion of various stages and boss battles from the first two Famicom installments, as well as in the inclusion background music, this installment is more of a compilation of the previous installments than a new game by itself. This was the first installment to include a password feature, as well as adjustable difficulty settings, which became standard features for the succeeding installments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The warp zones and alternate routes from the first two Famicom games were removed in this installments, although some of the stages differ greatly between difficulty settings. Moreover, the shiritori mini-game now has a new rule which causes one to lose by default when the opponent chooses a word than ends with the Japanese consonant &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wagan Land&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
