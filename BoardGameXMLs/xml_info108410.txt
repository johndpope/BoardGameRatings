			<description>Bass Masters Classic: Pro Edition is an enhanced version of the Bass Masters Classic fishing video game.  It contained real companies in the fishing industry (i.e. Ranger Boats, Evinrude Outboard Motors, etc.) The game had two modes where the player fished as an amateur and competed against other amateurs. The player also had the option of playing as a famous bass anglers such as Tom Mann Jr. and Hank Parker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the player had selected a mode they then had a number of other choices to make. The tackle shop being first, the player would purchase various lures, rods, motors, depth sounders and other fishing implements. From here the player could practice skill in the practice pond, or begin fishing in their first tournament. While there were a few different lakes that could be unlocked the gameplay remained the same. The player would begin by driving their boat to a spot on the lake they believed would yield the most fish. There they would cast and the screen would switch from overhead view to an underwater camera. The player would then entice the fish into biting their lure and a fight would then ensue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While no previous knowledge of fishing is needed to enjoy the game, various strategies can help the player. Buying stronger fishing line, selecting lures based on depth and clarity of water, as well as not wasting time by catching fish other than black bass, since in tournament mode this eats up the player's set time limit to fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bass Masters Classic&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
