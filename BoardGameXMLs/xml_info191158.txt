			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere is a narrative driven exploration game, set in an alternate Colonial India. The game explores the strange consequences of the search for a mythical city called Kayamgadh. You navigate through the stories about Kayamgadh by becoming other people. And as you shift identities, you realize that each person you become is a figment of another character's imagination and a part of yet another story. Explore this convoluted construction, celebrate it's absurdity, and piece together it's strangely crafted stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
