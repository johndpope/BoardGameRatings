			<description>The game box contains 4 identical 20 piece jigsaw puzzles, and   two special &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot; pieces which do not go into the puzzle.  Players start with 5 random pieces, and take turns drawing one piece out of the box.  All pieces except the &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot; pieces have text written on the back, which is one of: &amp;quot;Holy jigsaw, use this piece&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Zowie! pick 2 more pieces&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;holy Batmobile, pick 1 more piece&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Zap! Lose one piece&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Riddler strikes lose 2 pieces.&amp;quot;  If a player draws one of the &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot; pieces he returns it to the box and takes a piece from any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may keep duplicate pieces which are useful when directed to lose one or two pieces.  When drawing as directed by the text on the back of a piece, text is not read or followed on the pieces drawn, and if a &amp;quot;bat&amp;quot; piece is drawn this way it is returned until a non-bat piece is drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when a player completes his 20 piece puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
