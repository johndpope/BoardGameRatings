			<description>Big Mutha Truckers is primarily a racing game, in the same vein as 18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker. Players spend the majority of their time on the road, navigating the highways between the game's six cities: Salt Sea City, Capital City, Greenback, Skeeter's Creek, Smokestack Heights, and Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated. The player will earn most of his or her money through trade, shipping goods from cell phones to beer, with additional opportunities from mini-games and challenge races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every city features three locations: a garage, a bar, and a store. The garage allowed players to repair damage, refuel, switch trailers to carry different kinds of cargo, buy upgrades to improve their rig, or design custom logos for their truck. In the bar the player can find tips on where to buy and sell certain cargo, and a loan shark. The store allows the player to buy and sell goods, with prices varying by town. When visiting Big Mutha Truckin' Incorporated, the bar and store are replaced by visits to Ma Jackson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the road, the player can earn extra money by smashing other vehicles. This money can be multiplied through combos, or by hitting a vehicle with the trailer. If the player earns a high enough combo, he can make reward icons appear on the road. When collected, these icons can refuel the truck, repair damage, or offer a cash bonus. Police and biker gangs are both present in the game, and cause trouble for the player if he or she attacks them by mistake. Police officers will pursue and arrest the player, while bikers will attempt to shoot up the trailer, or even detach it from the truck. In either case, its a significant blow to the player's cash. Police can be avoided with skillful driving, and bikers can be shaken off the truck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occasionally, the player will be asked to accomplish a side-mission when he or she visits a bar. These simple point-to-point races are good for cash if the player can complete them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Big Mutha Truckers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
