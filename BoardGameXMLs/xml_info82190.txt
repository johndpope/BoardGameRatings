			<description>A tactical real-time PC strategy game set in World War II that is similar in many respects to the famous Close Combat series of PC games.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;From the designer Sean O'Connor's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Firefight is a World War II real time simulation game. It relies heavily on the use of artificial intelligence to create a realistic game, while having a user interface so simple and intuitive that you can learn to play in minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of up to twenty squads of tanks, anti-tank guns or various infantry formations. These squads can be manoeuvred around the large battlefield and ordered to fire on enemy positions. In addition the player can call down artillery strikes of high explosive or smoke shells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by the player taking control of the designated mission objective, either a village, farm or hill, and holding it with enough strength to resist enemy counter attacks.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
