							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sine Tempore: Beli&#039;ar</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beli'ar is a psionic who has been almost totally corrupted by his own power. He travels through space, isolated by his travel companions, in a trance-like state allowing him to acquire knowledge unknown to most. His equipment belongs to an old legacy dating back more than 40,000 years. Beli'ar is a difficult character to manage. Each of his powers comes at a price and his solid physique makes him the perfect target for many enemies. However, be careful not to unleash his fury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beli'ar is an additional playable character and includes his own hero sheet, skill sheet, miniature and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Kickstarter exclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
