							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunted Case of Eleonore Zugun</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fascinating mystery for use with award-winning Monster of the Week system and other horror games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Austrian Society for Parapsychology and Border Areas of Science opens an international, well-funded research program on the case of Eleonore Zugun, a long-dead woman haunted in her youth by a poltergeist &amp;ndash; or, some say, the Devil. For many researchers of the occult working on this case sounds like a dream job but our hunters know better: anybody who has ever investigated the Zugun case was haunted by the same forces that tormented her. Incompetent people dabbling once again in this story will surely provoke a disaster&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunted Case of Eleonore Zugun draws the hunters into a complex mystery and offers them so many tools to solve it than it takes a huge part of Europe to contain them all. They can dig through haunted archives in Vienna and London, search Romanian countryside, summon ghosts, teach magic to parapsychologists - and maybe even solve the Zugun case once and for all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the mystery you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A ficional version of Eleonore's real story presented as a Monster of the Week mystery&lt;br/&gt;    Lots of complex villains and bystanders to populate your session&lt;br/&gt;    Handouts to draw the players into the story right away&lt;br/&gt;    Personal motivations to make it more intense and engaging&lt;br/&gt;    Advice about using the story in other systems and settings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
