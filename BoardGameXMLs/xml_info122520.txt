			<description>A game similar to (but not identical to) Ludo, where the players race to be first to the treasure in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players can play, taking turns. Each have three pieces, moving by rolls of a die along interconnected paths that lead to the treasure. The paths are organized in three distinctive levels with paths between them. The players can knock out other player's pieces by landing on them so they start over (just like in Ludo). The paths include special spots, including green spots (skip three turns), red spots (slide down to an earlier path, like in Snakes&amp;amp;Ladders) and blue spots (entrance to the next level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is clearly of german origin since it is designed by Rolf Kauka, a famous german cartoonist. German publications and name are unknown. A swedish low-cost version was sold in Sweden in the 1970's, most likely produced by Klee. Although Klee is not printed on the game, Klee made other games in identical boxes with similar part numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is mostly known in Sweden through a famous comedy sketch from the late 60's, with four adults trying to socialize by playing the game but the play quickly turns into bickering. This makes the game particularly interesting as a game that everybody knows about but few have played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
