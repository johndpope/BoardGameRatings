							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Destruction Derby: Arenas</name>
									
			<description>Destruction Derby Arenas is the sixth and final installment of the Destruction Derby series.  Based around the real-life sport of demolition derby driving, the game involves wrecking other cars for points, or driving cars as a simple stock car race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular game is notable for being one of the first PS2 games that had an online play feature. While it was the first title of the Destruction Derby series released for the PS2, the game was met with, overall, fairly low reception in comparison to its predecessors, due to its deviation of realism and reliance on a more cartoonish tone. It was therefore the last game of the Destruction Derby series, but the car crashing genre still continued with the likes of Flatout, which arguably could be the spiritual successor of Destruction Derby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Destruction Derby Arenas&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its website is currently inoperative: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.ddarenas.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ddarenas.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
