			<description>&amp;quot;Julius Styles: The International is a thrilling, action packed game that places players in the unglamorous world of economic espionage. Working for the &amp;lsquo;Assembly&amp;rsquo;, an elite circle of businessmen bent on channeling global funds into their pockets, players take control of Julius Styles, a young man who recently graduated from MIT and has lost his way. Julius joins on with the Assembly as an economic hitman, an expert in persuasion, blackmail, and assassination. His quick thinking, unorthodox methods, and unmatched computer skills allows infiltration into governments, businesses, and other shadowy organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolving from the military special ops, security specialist backgrounds of characters I&amp;rsquo;ve played in the past, this guy was trained by the streets of today, to be the international player and dot com super spy of the future. said Wesley Snipes, Fall back, Nino and excuse me, Mr. Bond! I&amp;rsquo;d like you to meet Mr. Styles, Julius Styles: The International. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
