							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giant Bloodrager Bloodlines</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witness the Rage of Giants!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Giants are fearsome and iconic fantasy foes, but very rarely do player characters get a chance to enjoy the bulk, power, and pure destructive capabilities that being a giant has to offer. While there is room for debate about some types of giants, such as hill giants and ogres, other species, like fire and storm giants, are clearly magical in nature. Yet no bloodrager bloodline exists for players who want to have characters descended from giants&amp;hellip;until now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces four giant-themed bloodlines for bloodragers. Featured are the fire giant, the frost giant, the stone giant, and the storm giant. In addition to providing elemental powers associated with the type of giant in question&amp;mdash;such as superheated blood that burns your attackers, the ability to see and move through mist and ice as though it weren&amp;rsquo;t there, the ability to throw rocks and make the very earth shake, and the ability to hurl mighty thunderbolts&amp;mdash;these bloodlines also grant players giant power, granting them some of the strength and size of giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want to play a giant-blooded character with an exciting new bloodline, just want to expand your bloodrager&amp;rsquo;s bloodline options, or are a GM looking for just the right thing to spice up a giant shaman or berserker&amp;rsquo;s stat-block, this book is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
