							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jailbreak!</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for a group of about three to six heroes. If you go with a dynamic duo or a single superhero, you might need to toss them a couple of extra points of Determination to help even the odds. On the other hand, if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a legion of superheroes, feel free to increase the numbers on some of the bad guys, or toss in a few of those supervillains you&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to try out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While much of Jailbreak! is written with the understanding that the players have an established superteam, it isn&amp;rsquo;t required. You can have the heroes start off not working together at all, each independently working with SHARD (see the sidebar) only to be thrown together as they fight their way out of the evil machinations of the Killer Gamemaster. If the heroes decide to form a superteam after this adventure, or if Jailbreak! is intended to be the start of establishing a superteam the players have already agreed to, go a little easy on them and let them tweak and adjust some things like team aspects as they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
