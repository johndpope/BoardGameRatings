							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grandma&#039;s Geographical Game</name>
									
			<description>This is one of the seven &amp;quot;Grandma's&amp;quot; games issued by Milton Bradley in the early 1900s. This one, as the title suggests, is a geographical quiz. It consists of 119 plain cards each with a single numbered question, and a booklet with directions and all the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given at least six cards each, and take turns flipping over a single one of their cards. If that player cannot answer the question, he passes it to his left, and each player in turn has the opportunity to answer. Whichever player answers correctly keeps the card, and the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the box is undated, Alex G. Malloy dates it to 1910 (American Games, 1999, p. 35, #1081), and the questions confirm the period: Cuba is shown as an independent nation, while the largest Empire in the world is still Russia, with its capital at Petrograd. Interestingly for an American game, 11 of the questions (almost 1/10) deal with what is now Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
