			<description>Challenge your family to games based on the hit ITV gameshow The Cube . The show's nail-biting format has been cleverly downsized for this fun family game that retains all the best elements of the series. There are seven rounds of physical and electronic challenges to complete and players have just nine lives to use up before being booted out of the game. There are options to do a Trial Run or Simplify the challenges, just like in the show, and with 50 different games included, The Cube Game is sure to keep the whole family entertained. Designed for two to six players aged eight and up, the The Cube Game is great for fans of the TV show but just as fun for those who are new to the format.
