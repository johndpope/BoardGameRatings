			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triggers is a card game designed to provoke animated discussion among friends. Players win point by accurately predicting how others will vote on controversial subjects. Get ready to check your privilege with questions like, &amp;ldquo;Is it OK to punch a Nazi?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Pineapple on pizza?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Is climate change an urgent priority?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is simple. Each player begins with a YES and a NO card. The first player draws a card from the QUESTIONS deck and reads it out loud. All other players vote silently on the question by placing the corresponding answer card face down on the table. The first player now guesses if the majority voted yes, no or if there was a tie (if mathematically possible). If they guessed correctly, they keep the question card as a point. The turn moves clockwise to the next player. First to 5 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRIVILEGE cards add a strategic element to the game. Use them to steal points, steal a turn, challenge someone to a staring contest or force someone to give you a compliment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triggers forges an environment of fun and open exchange of ideas. Players often find common ground in unlikely places and gain new perspectives on familiar topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
