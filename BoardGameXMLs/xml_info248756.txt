			<description>Hands of Time is a one player card game. You're trapped inside time! To escape you must fix the clock before the hour strikes twelve, without being caught by Father Time, or you'll be trapped in time forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only 54 cards in this solitaire game. You use these cards to build a clock board upon which are the twelve number cards of a clock. Arrange the clock numbers in their correct order to fix the clock, while keeping your player character ahead of Father Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you draw a bell card the clock hands move forward an hour and the bell tolls. You must fix the clock before it strikes twelve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement of the player and Father Time cards around the outside of the clock creates a tense cat and mouse mechanic that perfectly fits the game's theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally created for the 2018 54-Card Game Design Contest, it is available as a free print and play game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the 2018 54-Card Game Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;-Best Solo Game: Second Place (Tied)&lt;br/&gt;-Best Artwork: Fifth Place (Tied)&lt;br/&gt;-Best New Designer: Second Place&lt;br/&gt;-Best Overall Game: Fourth Place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
