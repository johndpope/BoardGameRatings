			<description>Spagyric (a.k.a. White-Black-Red) is a two-player game designed for play with a Shibumi set.  It uses a 4&amp;times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White beats Black beats Red beats White&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Create a connected group of 4 same-colored balls, neither first creating a group of only 3 same-colored balls, nor creating a group of 5 or more same-colored balls.  If you create a group of precisely 3 or more than 4 same-colored balls, you lose.  If the pyramid fills with 30 balls before a winner or loser is determined, each player takes 1 white, 1 black, and 1 red, and the winner is decided by a sudden-death white-black-red (see below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: The 4&amp;times;4 board starts empty. Each player starts with 8 white, 8 black, and 8 red balls. Keep this supply of 24 balls hidden from your opponent at all times during the game. Use an opaque container (e.g. the Shibumi bag) to receive defeated balls over the course of the game. It should be able to hold 24 balls. Never look in this bag of defeat during the game.&lt;br/&gt;Both players simultaneously and secretly select a ball from their supplies. Simultaneously reveal them on a count of &amp;quot;White, black, red, go!&amp;quot; The stronger ball (White beats Black beats Red beats White) goes into play wherever the &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot; likes; the weaker goes into the bag of defeat. If both players revealed the same color, those are stunned, and set aside until this turn is done; then they will go back into your supplies.  The game ends when your supplies are empty, even if it&amp;rsquo;s due to stunning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Shibumi Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downloadable PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
