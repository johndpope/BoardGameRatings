			<description>From the Invisible City Productions website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the fun of a pinata, with none of the screaming, accidental concussions, or clean-up. For two to six hyperactive greed-crazed kids (or kids at heart).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To form specific combinations of cards by selecting them from a common pool of face-down cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is simple: Scatter a Poker deck face-down on your playing surface. Set a timer for one minute. Start the timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no turns; all players act simultaneously. Your goal is to search for the cards that you need (combinations and penalties are listed on printable reference cards) while abiding by the rules of the game (only use one hand, only hold one card at a time, move cards you want to your 6-card-max stash, move cards out of your stash that you don't want, and don't touch other players during the game.) All play stops when the timer rings. If you have a card in your hand when the timer rings, you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with it whether you want it or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once play has stopped, reveal your stash. Compare your stash to the Combinations and Penalties reference cards. If you have the highest score, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the rules and the reference cards here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/157/i-want-candy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/157/i-want-candy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
