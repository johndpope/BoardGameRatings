			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le Ma&amp;icirc;tre des &amp;Acirc;mes (&amp;quot;the Master of Souls&amp;quot;) is a French computer RPG. The royal magician Kharram Akkad vanished from his tower just after announcing he was on the verge of a great discovery. Shortly after his disappearance, a great storm rose around the tower and drove the surrounding population away. Now, a team of adventurers prepares to enter the tower, solve the mystery of the wizard disappearance and find a way to stop the storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an icon-driven, first-person view dungeon crawl. Players have the option of creating a team of adventurers or use the pregenerated one. The rules are heavily inspired by Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, using the same set of character stats and classes. One noticeable feature of the game is the ability to split the party in several groups (or even single characters) and switch control from one group to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
