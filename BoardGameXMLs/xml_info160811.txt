			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring the opportunity to secure victory into your own hands with Psychological Combat! From the designer who brought you the Pact Magic Unbound series and the Everyman Gaming blog, Psychological Combat gives players all of the tools they need to feint, demoralize, and antagonize their way to victory! Within, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Psychology DC, a new, easy to calculate statistic designed to streamline the rules presented in Psychological Combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Antagonize, a new special action that any character can take during combat to goad foes into focusing their violence upon you.&lt;br/&gt;     Morale, a new subsystem that GMs can use to help them determine when their cravenly monsters have taken more punishment than they can bear.&lt;br/&gt;     Updated rules for demoralizing and feinting in the midst of battle.&lt;br/&gt;     New archetypes that allow any martial character to assault the minds and morale of opponents.&lt;br/&gt;     New feats that enhance the special actions revealed and refined within Psychological Combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Mythic feats.&lt;br/&gt;     Character traits.&lt;br/&gt;     And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
