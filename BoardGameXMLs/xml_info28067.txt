			<description>According to the encyclopedia, This was a dice game popular in the Midwestern United States from the 1920s through the 1950s, in which a player selects a number from 1 to 6 and then casts 10 dice 13 times, attempting to throw the chosen number 26 times or more, or exactly 13 times, or fewer than 10 times. The house edge (advantage) in this game is approximately 18 percent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apparently this game lost popularity once anti gambling laws went into place. Standard odds were give from tavern to tavern and payoffs were usually settled by the winner getting drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
