			<description>Taken from the designer's game description...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game arises out of many long nights of playing other games that took way too long and started way to many fights. Playing a board game involves multiple players, each looking to win. The resulting competition can devolve into incredible displays of lunacy. Nit-picking over the rules, collusion against specific players because of grudges carried over from other games, and even fights over bending or missing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game harnesses all of this angst into a game in and of itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you move on a board that's only 10-spaces long, trying to be the first person to get to the end. You do this by playing specific cards on your turn, each representing things that might happen during a typical board game. Watch out though, because your opponents will be trying to get there first as well. Cards like &amp;quot;Analysis Paralysis&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bathroom Break&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Blame-Shifter&amp;quot;, and good old-fashioned &amp;quot;Cheating&amp;quot; will no-doubt bring back memories of past board-game fights. Who knows, maybe you'll all get along next time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
