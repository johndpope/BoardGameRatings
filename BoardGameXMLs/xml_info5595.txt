							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lucy Show Game</name>
									
			<description>Lucy and Vivian are each given a lot of money... the bet is on as to who can spend their money the fastest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice and move around the board to attempt a visit to every store at least once and spend all of their money exactly.  Players may buy an item at each place they visit.  Everything from Jewelry to Real Estate is represented by cardboard tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to spend all of their money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
