			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Euro Game about time travelling, inverse-drafting card driven, resource management and victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a fictional future in which there are multiple organizations who started time travelling to steal important goods and hire historical characters to their cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three turns, each divided into five rounds, and, at the end of a turn, a mutual resolution phase is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How a round is played: During rounds, players choose one of the two cards they own in their hands and pick one of the two sides in them. They then cover the other side of the card with an hand and show it at the same time as other players. Cards have an action resolution order, then the chosen card is passed to the left for a new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
