			<description>A 50 card deck of death predictions: ways in which people can die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than being a game in itself, the cards are a game system: they are used to create and play other games, or optionally supplement other existing games. The cards come with rules for games with players being encouraged to create their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature a single word or phrase detailing how a person can die: for instance, OLD AGE or TRAGIC FLAW or FED UP BARISTA. These predictions can be used in party games ala Apples to Apples: one player names a weapon and the rest submit a card from their hand that they feel could have been given to a person killed with that weapon. They can be used in storytelling games, where each player gets a card and the group must construct a series of events in which everyone dies. The rules also include an RPG of sorts, where players must buy items to kill targets with the deaths dealt from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
