							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Flag Game</name>
									
			<description>Flag consists of deck of 60 cards, each depicting a different national flag, and 76 tickets.  60 tickets bear the name of a country, 11 show stars and stripes, four show a pirate flag, and one flag of truce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 60 are initially dealt out evenly to all players.  Then players take turns, randomly drawing a ticket.  If the ticket contains the name of a country, the player who holds the flag of that country places it the middle of the table.  If the ticket shows stars and stripes, the player captures all the flags that have been placed in the middle.  If the ticket shows a pirate flag, the player who drew the ticket returns all his captured flags to the middle.  The game ends when all tickets have been drawn.  Whoever drew the flag of truce card, captures all flags that remain in the middle.  The winner is the player with the most flags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
