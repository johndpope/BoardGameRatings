			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take command of the USS Ranger and let Battle Trek's hi-res graphics, exciting sound-effects, and joystick control turn your Atari into a battle cruiser!  As Commander of the Ranger, you must navigate, activate shields, manage power, and monitor enemy ships, destroying them if possible with positrons, mesons, and probes.  Your assignment is especially difficult because the enemy commander, who has skills equal to yours, has some clever strategies of his own.  Battle Trek, a realistic and difficult game for the thinking spacewar far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
