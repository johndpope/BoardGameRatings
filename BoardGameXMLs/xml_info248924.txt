							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fate of the Grey City</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grey City is heard of only in legends and whispers. Its exact location is known only to sages and madmen, but it is said that if you seek it long enough, you will find it. All quests lead to the Grey City, and all things can be found there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some say that the Grey City is built on the corpse of a dead god. Others call this foolishness and insist it was founded by the child of an angel and a demon as a haven for those who rejected both armies. Others say an immortal wizard dwells in the tallest tower, and all of the Grey City serves him unknowingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the Grey City is, in truth, remains to be seen. Where the Grey City is, however, has been discovered. You have found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
