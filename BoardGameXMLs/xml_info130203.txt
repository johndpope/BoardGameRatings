			<description>A hex and block style wargame, Khalkin Gol is a little known border incident that escalated to a major battle in Manchuria. Soviet and Japanese tactical doctrine comes to a head at Khalkin Gol in the summer of 1939. This  pivotal battle was the earliest example of the blitzkrieg tactics so popularized by the Germans in WW2.    Since the Japanese had decisively beat the Russians in the 1902 - 1905 war, they thought it would be easy once again. But, Japanese doctrine was just to stiff and too old fashioned to deal with the realities of modern land warfare in Asia. This battle is recreated in full at the battalion level with a minimalistic rule system.  Wooden blocks for land and air units provide a realistic fog of war as only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong, until combat is engaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
