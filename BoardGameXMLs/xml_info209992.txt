			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ages past the realm was plunged into an age of darkness beneath the terrible wrath of Tenebrash, vile lord of dragons. His evil had no mortal equal, and hopeless lament was the only bounty of his subjects. For generations the tyrant ruled unopposed until the Order of the Sacred Dawn challenged his cruelty. By the charge of a powerful and benevolent deity, six holy knights were bestowed with an artifact of tremendous power. Wielding the relic known as the lucespel, the order vanquished Tenebrash and light was returned to the weary world. The knights bound the vengeful spirit of the dragon within their stronghold, and sacrificed their own mortality to eternally guard the artifact from those who would misuse its power. With the return of evil to the realm, a new quest has been called: venture into the ruins of the ancient keep to retrieve the lucespel. Those who seek to harness its holy essence will face the ultimate challenge to prove both their valor and virtue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 20th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
