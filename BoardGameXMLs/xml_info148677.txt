							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sentinels of the Multiverse: Villain Oversized Cards</name>
									
			<description>The first draft of Sentinels of the Multiverse included oversized villain cards that had the art for that villain and all of that character's game text on one big card. These 4&amp;quot; by 6&amp;quot; cards represent the villains from the core game, expansions, mini-expansions, and promos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Edition (2012) contains all villains from before Shattered Timelines, the Shattered Timelines Update Pack contains the villains released in the Shattered Timelines expansion and reprints of some misprinted cards from the First Edition, and Shattered Timelines Current Total Pack contains all villains to date with the reprints instead of the misprints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015, Sentinels of the Multiverse: Oversized Villain Cards was released with new cards not seen before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
