			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Generic Outlandishly Big Spacefleets! is the game where you control vast fleets of vessels of all shapes and sizes, from nimble little fighters to moon-sized planetsmashers. Move your ships. Fire your weapons. Launch your torpedoes. And watch your enemies explode into brilliant flashes of molten metal! Everything a budding megalomaniac... err, defender of the galaxy... could want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G.O.B.S.! is designed to allow you to build big, custom spacefleets and fight quick, explosive battles with simple rules and little or no record keeping. Just move, shoot, and (probably) explode. What could be more fun? Best of all, you can use G.O.B.S.! with any spaceship miniatures you like, from those expensive metal jobs to cheap plastic toys to scratch-built wonders made from household items. (Yours truly is contemplating a fleet made from seashells.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In G.O.B.S.!, a ship&amp;rsquo;s speed and combat worthiness are determined by the size and apparent purpose of the miniature(or whatever the manufacturer happens to call the thing). Players may then customize the armament to reflect their preferences.&lt;br/&gt; Big ships are slow, clumsy, and easy to hit. They also carry lots and lots of weapons and are both very dangerous and hard to destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smaller ships are fast and nimble, and very hard to hit. However, they carry few weapons and are very easy to destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement and combat systems of G.O.B.S.! are designed to reflect these general principles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download G.O.B.S.! at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homepage: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thegobspage.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thegobspage.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
