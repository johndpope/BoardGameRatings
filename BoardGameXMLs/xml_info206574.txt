			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bushido is a martial arts fighting game for the IBM PC. The game is set in old Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unarmed, you must make your way into a heavily defended enemy headquarters to retrieve items and exit alive. Using punches, kicks and jumps, you must take on a seemingly unending stream of ninjas armed with swords or shurikens. You may also face dangerous animals, such as cobras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission is played out in five stages spanning three different screens that depict the enemy headquarters. There are only three screens because the first and second areas are repeated when you pass back through them on your way out of the enemy headquarters. You can choose to start the game on any of the five stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A difficulty setting, adjustable from 0 to 9, allows you to vary the difficulty of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
