			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEVER MIND THE EXPENDABLES--HERE'S THE OLD AND ANGRY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, they sent bad guys to prison, physical rehab, or the morgue. Harry Callahan. James Braddock, Robert Malone and his wife Barbara Gordon-Malone were forces for good who cut violent and bloody swaths through evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that was a long time ago. For more than 20 years, they have been living quietly in the Shady Acres Retirement Community... but that peace is being disturbed by loud music, obnoxious protesters, and marauding muggers. Hip-Hop Enthusiasts, Occupy Movement Members, and other trouble-makers have invaded their happy home and are threatening the traquility of Bingo Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now these aging champions of justice for the innocent are once again picking up their guns and pulling on their butt-kicking boots to show these punks how it was done in the old days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: Old and Angry features game stats for five classic action characters, and four other characters who are their friends to be protected or foes to be defeated in six Battle Scenarios. Also included are five never-before-presented Traits designed to let you make your own battle axes once you're done playing with the ones we've presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HARRY HAS THE MOST POWERFUL HANDGUN IN THE WORLD, &lt;br/&gt;SO YOU KIDS BETTER STAY OFF HIS LAWN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
