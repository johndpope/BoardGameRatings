							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planet Zongo</name>
									
			<description>Planet Zongo' is based on the proliferation of small arms. This game is about an epidemic, but instead of being threatened by diseases or zombies, the players must escape their own weapons. In this game, players may even want to give weapons to  their opponents in order to get rid of them.  &lt;br/&gt; Like in other games, players need armies to protect themselves or attack their opponents. They also have populations to sustain their armies. But the problem is: &lt;br/&gt; 1. Weapons never leave the game. When an army is killed, its weapons stay on the board. Those weapons are given to another population (even belonging to another player). That population thus becomes an army. &lt;br/&gt;2. But armies need populations. When an army is not sustained by a population, it starves and is removed from the game. However, as explained in rule 1, its weapons stay on the board and will be given to another population. &lt;br/&gt; As more and more weapons are added in the course of the game, this mechanic threatens the players with a snowball effect: The more armies get destroyed, the more populations become armies by receiving weapons.The  more populations become armies, the less armies can be sustained&amp;hellip; And so it gets only worse: as those unsustained armies are eliminated, the remaining populations receive even more weapons ...  &lt;br/&gt; The winner will be the player that best survives this process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
