							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cunning Couplets</name>
									
			<description>Party game.&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 Cunning Couplet cards and these feature couplets made up of two words that are not related. The 12 cards are placed around the room where players will be able to see them. Each player will have one word that is the first correct word to a couplet. They then look for another card that has a second correct word. For example, they know the word Turn, so they look around and evenutally find Coat, which makes Turn Coat. Now they must look for a word that goes with Coat and so on until they find a word that has Finish next to it. The first person to do this wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
