			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set collects a nice bunch of paper minis previously released as promotional pieces and also includes a brand new figure exclusive to this set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters in this set all have an urban feel, and none of them are on the right side of the law! These characters could show up as the members of the rogue's guild, or each could appear on their own to hassle or help the party.&lt;br/&gt;It also includes an artbook which has lots of photos of the minis in action, and includes nice high resolution copies of the artwork for each character. The artbook also includes a lot of sketchbook art that explains a little of the design process that went into each character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figures are scaled to 28mm, and will look good alongside most popular brands of miniatures and all manner of 28mm scaled scenery. Each model has a distinctive front and back, and both sides feature rich and gorgeous detail, and line up with each other perfectly. Thick black outlines make hand-cutting as easy, or as complicated, as you'd like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detail is boosted by the high resolution of the PDF, and the colours have good contrast to make them pop at a distance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models are designed with removable bases. This set includes 2 sets of interchangeable bases. Another bonus of this feature is that the flat components are really compact and very easy to store because they don't take up much room at all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement is distributed as four PDFs and a txt file in a zip archive:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assembly Instructions&lt;br/&gt;Artbook&lt;br/&gt;Paper Minis&lt;br/&gt;25mm Rounds Bases&lt;br/&gt;Read Me First&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
