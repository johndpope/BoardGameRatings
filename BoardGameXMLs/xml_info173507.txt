			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are things that the mightiest wizards dare not speak of, and even the gods themselves dare not confront: Great Cthulhu, the Black Goat, the Crawling Chaos, the Unspeakable One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that long ago They ruled and terrorized the world, possibly even other worlds and dimensions. Something must have happened to Them, because all that remains now are cyclopean ruins, servitor races, and sanity-eroding records. They slumber in death-like states, or are imprisoned outside of space and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They stir in Their sleep. They test the boundaries of Their prisons. Eventually They will wake and free themselves. Eventually They will return. What then? Will They crush the cities of man underhoof, devouring everyone they find? Will the world be transformed in accordance to Their whims, or will it be reduced to a blackened cinder?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only sure thing is that They&amp;rsquo;re going to win, and it&amp;rsquo;s better to be at Their side then in Their path. Granted They&amp;rsquo;ll likely crush or devour you anyway, but it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to hedge the odds in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given all the other Lovecraftian content I've created over the years, I'm honestly surprised it took us this long to make a cultist class. You start out being able to requisition resources from your cult, summon monsters, perform dark rituals, and knowing things that people just shouldn't know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you level up you get to choose how you grow: do you become more influential in your cult; do your monsters become bigger and better; do rituals become easier to pull off; do you delve ever deeper into secrets best left forgotten?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a revamped character sheet layout (I had to in order to fit everything on the sheet), there's also a digest-sized pdf that includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The cultist (obviously), along with 20 advanced moves.&lt;br/&gt;    Some new bits of gear, including magic scrolls that anyone can use, and an ancient tome that lets you uncover forgotten or unknowable secrets at the possible cost of your sanity.&lt;br/&gt;    Two magic items: the flute of the outer servitor and silver key.&lt;br/&gt;    The child of the goat compendium class.&lt;br/&gt;    Four Lovecraftian monsters: the dark young, flying polyp, hound of Tindalos, and thulhid.&lt;br/&gt;    A deeper look at your cult, cultist moves, and items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
