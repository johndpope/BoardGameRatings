			<description>Construction is a card/board game designed by Robert Abbott and published in his book &amp;quot;Abbott's New Card Games&amp;quot;. In this game, two players take turns drawing and placing cards, and construct a gridwork of tracks on the table over which their commuters and other pieces navigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses 2 decks of ordinary playing cards, though more (or I guess fewer) could be done. Each player has a chess king representing his &amp;quot;commuter&amp;quot; and several checkers that act as blockers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; the other &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;. The players simply take turns drawing cards from the deck, and the player whose color matches the card chooses how to use it. The cards can be used to build a road grid, or to move your commuter, or a blocker. You can only move your commuter onto a card by discarding a drawn card with an equal or higher number. Thus, players try to use high cards either to hinder the opponent's moves, or to move their own commuter. Low cards are used to build out one's own road grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
