			<description>Laaste D&amp;oslash;re &amp;ndash; 20th Anniversary English Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closed Court (Laaste D&amp;oslash;re) was originally written for Fastaval 1994. It has been called the original &amp;quot;intrigue scenario&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;This translation has been underway since December 2006 when I made a very rough first version. At the time there was some talk of preserving Danish roleplaying history and making it available to the international community at large, which necessitated English translations.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;I have stayed as true to the original as possible and tried to recreate the layout faithfully. I have corrected a few minor mistakes, what I would simply call proofing, and I had a terribly flowery prose at the time which I have toned down somewhat, but no major revisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THe game rules are light-weight and fairly optional.  The game can be played with or without a game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
