			<description>Urosette is an abstract strategy game for 2-5 players with a Moroccan theme. It is similar to both Othello and Go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first take turns placing starter tiles (coins) on the game board. Then, they draw a hand of 3 coins, each having a different ability defined by the arrows on the coin. Placing a coin points to one or more other coins not owned by the player, and that player lays claim to those coins by placing a colored token on them. On subsequent turns, claimed coins change hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a coin is completely surrounded either by other coins or the edge of the board, it is captured by the last player to successfully claim it. This means a coin captured on your turn could go to an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all of the spaces have been filled with coins, and all of the coins have been captured. Each coin has a number on it, add those up and the player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
