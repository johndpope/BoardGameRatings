			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S.C.A.R.E. - Secrets, Contacts, Allies, Rivals and Enemies. They are part and parcel of the character generation process, and provide endless opportunities for adventure, intrigue and complication. The S.C.A.R.E. line gives you NPC's designed to provide maximum flexibility as they can be used in several ways; either as a valuable Contact or Ally, or as a dangerous Rival or Enemy. Secrets can be exploited for profit, patriotism or career advancement; and each could lead to danger, wealth or fantastic new discoveries. Multiple plot hooks and adventure ideas are also presented in each release, allowing easy integration into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you get when you take a member of the Imperial family (in this case a grand-niece to the Emperor), add in the loyalty and training instilled by the Imperium's finest organizations, the unlimited authority granted by Imperial Credentials, access to bleeding edge technology, the unlimited resources to create multiple, bulletproof cover identities, and the contacts, networks and intelligence gleaned from hundreds of Imperial and Corporate agencies ? You have a Shadow Agent with the authority to arrest an Inquisitor, kill with impunity or start a war! Only a select handful are trusted with such authority, but they are the most fearsome and effective weapon in the Imperial arsenal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viesca Melin Aella is one of these &amp;quot;Shadows&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
