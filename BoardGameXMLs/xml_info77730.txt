			<description>Football (released as NFL Football) is a multiplayer sports video game produced by Mattel and released for its Intellivision video game system in 1979. The players each control a football team competing in a standard four-quarter game. Like Mattel's other sports video games, NFL Football did not use any official National Football League team names or player names, even though Mattel obtained a license from the NFL and used the league's logo in its box art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M Networks also released a version for the Atari 2600. This game is an upgrade of Atari's original football release. The field runs left to right and only approx 20 yards of the field are visible on screen. Graphics and controls are still limited by the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
