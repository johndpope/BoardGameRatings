			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Chandra came, the world  changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth was under attack from an advanced  alien invasion force and there was little we could do to stop them. Cities were burned and the people panicked. The nations of the Earth in a rare moment of mutual alliance created &amp;ldquo;Global Defence&amp;rdquo;. This organisation was formed of the best each nation could offer, and armed with the most advanced weaponry they could muster. Money was no object, the safety and security of the entire planet hung in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But then the invasion stopped. The Chandra took control of small areas across the world and fortifi ed their positions. These areas became known as &amp;ldquo;Dark Zones&amp;rdquo;. No one went in, no one came out, and the enigmatic invader&amp;rsquo;s agenda became all the more mysterious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the rest of the world, it was business as usual. People got used to the idea of living close to the Dark Zones and even with the Chandra presence on Earth. Sure, you heard stories, but you still had to go to work, keep up with your bills, brush your teeth. Somehow the threat didn&amp;rsquo;t seem so bad. Some of the countries without Dark Zones began to withdraw funding from Global Defence. Why should they pay for what seemed now to be someone else&amp;rsquo;s problem?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the while the Chandra waited. Their plans quietly advancing as the forces against them squabble and bicker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
