			<description>The game board depicts a world map. Each player receives several &amp;quot;runners&amp;quot; and starts in a continent (or two, depending on the number of players). The runners can hold up to five wooden pearls, each pearl color representing a continent. A runner can move 1-6 squares, depending on the number of pearls it holds. The more, the slower. The runners try to pick up pearls from each continent (by moving there); they can lose pearls and start over by being jumped over by another runner. The first player to return to his/her home continent(s) with all runners, each runner holding five colors of pearls, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
