			<description>Pro Cycling Manager 2009 is a cycling management video game. It was released just before the 2009 Tour de France (PCM 2009 is the Tour de France licensed game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released for Windows and PSP. A Tour de France-only game was released for the Xbox 360 but was only available to buy from the Xbox Live Arcade. On this version of the game there are only 5 riders per team which means that there are only 90 riders in the race, although you get to choose from the whole squad of the teams to choose the riders. The Fuji-Servetto team are in the game although they didn't compete in the Tour de France in 2009. They are in place of the Cerv&amp;eacute;lo TestTeam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pro Cycling Manager 2009&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
