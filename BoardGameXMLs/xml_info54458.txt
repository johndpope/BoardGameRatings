							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Caves of Chisca</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caves of Chisca is an introductory adventure for use with Northern Crown: New World Adventures and Northern Crown: The Gazetteer, published by Atlas Games. It is designed to be a very challenging experience for a party of four 1st-level PCs or a moderately difficult adventure for 2nd-level PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yuchi town of Chisca, nestled in a mountain vale deep in Cherokee territory, is attacked by&lt;br/&gt;haints issuing from the nearby caves. Something has stirred these monstrous humanoids, but the cause is in dispute. Some say that treasure hunters, searching in vain for a golden relic of a Uropan priest, have inadvertently roused the haints, who may be the ruined remnants of a century-old expeditionary force of mercenaries led by a notorious plunderer. Others say that the mercenary captain ºs spirit has awoken after a century-long sleep, and is sending forth his followers to exact revenge upon the town that resisted his brutal search for gold and led to the destruction of his company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure module, the PCs will piece together the history of the area from interactions with a young Yuchi cleric and a Kelt innkeeper. They will battle both the haints and a sinister Vandalian agent as they explore the caves, seeking to solve the mystery of these attacks. A final confrontation with the ancient mercenary captain himself, another surprise villain, and with&lt;br/&gt;the agent who allowed him to rise and renew his campaign of terror, caps the story and points to&lt;br/&gt;further opportunities for adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
