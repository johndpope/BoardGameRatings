							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bridges We Burn</name>
									
			<description>The Ninth World is full of wonders and dangers. Just how far will your heroes go to explore them all? How many traps will they disarm, how many ancient tombs unearth? And while doing so, will they ever stop and think about the consequences of their actions? How many bridges will they burn to get treasures, knowledge and glory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign consists of 5 linked scenarios that can be also played separately. They are designed for Tier 3 characters and offer a variety of challenges: a grand ball and mingling with nobles, investigation, exploration of a strange fortress and finally &amp;ndash; battling a powerful monster and its minions to save a city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign provides 25-30 hours of play, but can be easily expanded and built upon for even more fun! It takes place in the city of Uxphon, which featured in &amp;quot;The Devil's Spine,&amp;quot; and serves as an excellent follow-up set of new adventures. But fret not, knowledge of &amp;quot;The Spine&amp;quot; is not required!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes never-before seen art to inspire your imagination. And yeah - it is gorgeous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure module for Game Masters and requires the Numenera Corebook from Monte Cook Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is PDF-only publication and comes with two files, optimized for your tablet or screen.&lt;br/&gt;[source: Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
