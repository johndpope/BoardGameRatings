			<description>In a world of Nomadic Hamlets, Temporary Towns and Moving Castles, you are the Captain King of a Rolling Rampart who has come up against an enemy Fortress in a battle of siege engines and fortifications.&lt;br/&gt; Who will siege the day?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rolling Ramparts, players decide whether they will attack, defend or deploy the white flag for each of the six sections of their moving castle. Each choice has both benefits and drawbacks. Battle Dice are rolled and combined with their section's strength and damage is applied. Captain Kings continue the siege until one of the castles has three sections reduced to zero strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling Ramparts was designed specifically to be included in the &amp;quot;36-Dice&amp;quot; family introduced by Asmadi Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
