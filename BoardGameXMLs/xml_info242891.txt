			<description>X-O is played on a board showing 129 yellow/orange/red squares where numbers between 1 and 25 can be read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls 3 dice to obtain a number or numbers similar to the one(s) on the square where the player wishes to place one or several of his tokens. For example, a player rolls 3/4/6 : a) he may place 3 tokens on squares &amp;quot;3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; ; b) he may place 2 tokens on square &amp;quot;12&amp;quot; (=3x4) and &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; ; c) he may place 1 token on square &amp;quot;18&amp;quot; (=3x4+6). All operations may be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player places 5 of his tokens in a straight line orthogonally or diagonally, he scores points according to the colour of the squares they are located on : 1 point on a yellow square, 2 points on an orange square, 3 points on a red square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player runs out of tokens. Each unplayed token is worth 1 point for each player. The player with the maximum score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
