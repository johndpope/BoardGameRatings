							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conversation Cards</name>
									
			<description>On September 27, 1784 the following game ad appeared in the newspaper the Baltimore Intelligencer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Just published and for sale ... a new and elegant edition of the much admired Conversation Cards, containing a variety of amusing, entertaining and innocent questions and answers in the art of courtship. Each pack contains sixty-four cards, thirty-two questions in black and thirty-two answers in red.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apparently one player would read a question and another of the opposite sex would follow with a randomly-drawn answer, to everyone's amusement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it may not sound like much of a game, it may well be the first American commercial game design ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
