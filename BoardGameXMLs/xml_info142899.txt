			<description>from the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Wing Commander Role-Playing Game First Edition Core Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wing Commander is an award-winning and ground-breaking series of space combat flight simulators, originally created by Chris Roberts and Origin Systems, Inc. Starting with the original game in 1990 and ending with Wing Commander: Secret Ops in 1998 (later followed in 2007 with Wing Commander: Arena), the series has developed a large following throughout the years from all types of gamers. The series is known for a number of firsts, including some of the first examples of voice acting in the video game industry (WC2), the world's first fully interactive movie (WC3), one of the very first games that could be played over a network (WC: Armada), and one of the first &amp;quot;episodic&amp;quot; video games ever created (WC: Secret Ops).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wing Commander series is set in the 27th century and chronicles the struggles of the Terran Confederation, a starfaring human society, in their epic struggle and ultimate victory against the forces of the Kilrathi Empire, a cat-like species with a warrior-based culture. After a brief inter-human&lt;br/&gt;conflict later in the series, a new conflict heats up against a new, powerful foe known only as the Nephilim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book you're reading is a pencil-and-paper (PNP) role-playing game adaptation of these original games. The rules contained herein have been designed to be as flexible as possible, so that players may be as detailed or as carefree as they'd like to be while playing the game. They've also been&lt;br/&gt;designed such that players may play a game very similar to the original games, or have a much different type of adventure within the Wing Commander Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
