							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Visions</name>
									
			<description>City Visions is a unique and exciting way to discover the city. It is a guide AND a clever game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tucked into a neat travel deck are 80 oversized photographic playing cards. The cards feature places throughout the city, including restaurants, museums, performing arts, landmarks and sporting arenas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card is filled with a beautiful photograph and backed by three questions about the featured place; background information and a locater to help you get there. The game involves risk, strategy, knowledge and a little bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you guess all three answers you collect a card. The goal is to collect ten cards. Keep guessing until you miss or pass; you get up to three cards per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're an avid traveler; a proud native or simply curious and eager to explore; City Visions is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Visions is now available in five cities: New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago (with 60 cards) and Washington, D.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
