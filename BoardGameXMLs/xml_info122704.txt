							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scenarios for All Ages</name>
									
			<description>Scenarios for All Ages is a 160 page book whose goal is to provide interesting scenarios for wargames of any period.  The book includes 50 scenarios broken up into groupsing such as Attack and Defense, Storming and Last Stands, Bold Actions, Raids, Amphibious Operations, Surprise, Night Operations, Assault from the Air, and Logsitics Problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than providing simple scenarios with balanced forces facing each other across reasonably neutral terrain, this book provides set ups that are more realistic from a warfare perspective.  Each scenario provides reasons for the action, build up, the objectives of both sides, and the consequences of the action.  Although forces will frequently be unbalanced, the mission of either side may be achievable.Victory or defeat may be measured in casualties, in ground taken, time bought, or even successful extrication from the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
