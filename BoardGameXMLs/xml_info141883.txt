			<description>A set of flash cards containing music theory elements ( notes in different clefs, key signatures, notes of different values , etc. etc.) published in the late 19th century whose instructions contain 10 different games of different types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four  of the more distinctive  games in the instructions are :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- A simple drawing/drafting game where a player keeps drawing cards from the stock until they match the time value ( eighth rest, 16th rest, half note, etc.) of an initial top card. After an initial go-round players  match the initial value with a card from their hand if possible, if not they resume the drawing process. First player out of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- A variant of this game where after all the cards are drawn, players form &amp;quot; melds' of a whole note's value ( 4 beats) and these are  ( two variants) then scored Rummy-style or game is played until someone has eight melds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--A forerunner of climbing-to-X-number sorts of games ( O No 99, Zeus on the Loose, et al.)  where players play cards of rests and notes to get up to a whole note's value of 4 beats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--A children's game with a pre-Knizia type of interesting scoring.. all cards are given out to all players-- them the players with the most of each value get to score the amount they have. ( E.G.   Person with 5 16th-note/rest values has more than everyone else, therefore they get 25 points, each of the cards counting for as many points as cards held.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
