			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major League Baseball is a multiplayer sports video game produced by Mattel and released for its Intellivision video game system in 1980. It became the best-selling title in the console's history, with over 1 million copies sold. Baseball put players in control of a nine-man baseball team competing in a standard nine-inning game. When first released, Mattel obtained a license from Major League Baseball, although the only trademarked item used was the MLB logo on the game's box art. No official team names or player names were used in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M Networks also produced a version for the Atari 2600. It was an upgrade over Atari's original Home Run release, but had no AI for one player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
