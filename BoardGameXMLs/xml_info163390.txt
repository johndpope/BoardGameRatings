			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting was used in the FN series and like the others in the FA series, it was used as an area for multiple adventure opportunities as well as a semi-safe haven. The main community in the area is the Village of Tomore. This community is offered as a free download! With a multitude of side adventures this area helps mid-level adventurers increase their experience point base. Close this area is the previously published Sunken Temple of Bulu and the Ruins of Tarlac Keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for mid to upper level groups of adventurers.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for several one shot adventures or a continuing campaign setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
