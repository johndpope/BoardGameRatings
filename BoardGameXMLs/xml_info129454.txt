			<description>&amp;quot;Humans thought they were alone in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;                                            They were right!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Timestreams takes place in a possible future, where the human race has made two very intriguing discoveries: 1) We are alone in our universe.  2) There are universes in which other races exist and function in a totally different time frame than ours. The problem is that now that we know, the other races know as well. Thus, the beginning of the timestreams invasion is now taking place, during which entire races invade the parallel timestreams.  These invasions cause temporal distortions, causing a dimensional vortex that may cause one race or more to be so distorted that it will be impossible to interact with anything from a three dimensional universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Timestreams is a game where players alternate turns and try to wreak havoc for their opponents. All players start with their player card next to a timestream, and during the game they try to avoid being in the same timestream with another players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, a player must calculate a temporal distortion, and all players that are on the same timestream as another must lose an amount of this distortion by counting on their vortex resonator. The winner is the last race standing, after everyone else's race has reached its critical point.  There is no player elimination.  Players will continue to play until the end of the game and take their vengeance on the opponents that took them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
