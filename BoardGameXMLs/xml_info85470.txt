							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zed Run!: The Survival Horror Game Show</name>
									
			<description>Survival horror game show set 25 years after the zed virus turned 90% of the worlds populaion into flesh eating zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must explore a 7 x 7 grid of tiles laid out to create the play area, the Dead City.  During this exploration, gathering items, weapons, and prizes is key, as your contestant is initially tossed unarmed into the fray.  In combat, rolling a 6 on a D6 will score you a kill, and found weapons and items will better that chance.  Hazard tiles will make the run a bit more &amp;quot;hazardous&amp;quot; -- such as adding scores of hungry dead, which you can plop down on your favorite rivals, or &amp;quot;Infection&amp;quot; which will change your recently deceased contestant, into a ZED, now bent on devouring your former rivals and able to control the actions for your lesser zombie brothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zed Run! you grab the loot, find the exit and win big... the rest is zombie chow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;1 Start tile&lt;br/&gt;48 ZR tiles&lt;br/&gt;32 Zombie Tokens&lt;br/&gt;15 Item Cards&lt;br/&gt;10 Prize Cards&lt;br/&gt;2 dice (six-sided)&lt;br/&gt;4 Character / Zed Cards&lt;br/&gt;4 Character Tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
