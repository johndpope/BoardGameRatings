			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phitos, an obscure and silent sphere of metal, travels slowly through space.&lt;br/&gt;Phitos is a name known by few, an unknown structure, a black hole ready to swallow up all forms of evil.  &lt;br/&gt;Phitos was built by brilliant hands, using ancient yet elusive technology, hands worthy of a God.  &lt;br/&gt;Phitos is the home of Pandora.  &lt;br/&gt;Phitos is a prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora is a unique being, the descendant of an ancient species, tied to the machine by choice and now immortal. She controls the space station in a silence broken only by the screams of the latest arrivals. Pandora wanders through space looking for forms of life marked by evil, hunting them down and capturing them, satisfying the wish of her creators. Her trusted Punishers are supported by the Sin Eaters and repair droids, called Shield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She had lived in darkness and silence for millenniums, until she was touched by two beings that seemed destined to cross her path. In them, Pandora saw something she had never seen before, a pure and candid aura, in strong contrast with their appearance. She immediately understood that she had stumbled across something precious, which if properly moulded could become a lethal weapon, something feared by all, something fair yet terrible.  &lt;br/&gt;She had found Alpha and Omega.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora&amp;rsquo;s vigilant slumber was interrupted by a signal that she never imagined to receive on Phitos. Somebody had intercepted the course of her spaceship. But who would be so foolish? Why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this new expansion, our heroes will find themselves managing Pandora&amp;rsquo;s fury, in search of Beli&amp;rsquo;ar, Jukas&amp;rsquo; master, lost in space for decades. In a moment of sanity, Beli&amp;rsquo;ar had managed to yell out for help through the purple flames, and Jukas had heard his echo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this mini campaign, you&amp;rsquo;ll visit Phitos in search of Pandora, ready to rescue Beli'ar. You won't be able to use the Blessed Weapons as heroes, but will come up against them as enemies together with the droids and their strange appearance, helping Pandora defend against intruders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora will end with a breathtaking finale, which will allow you to play Beli'ar in the future, either as a Nemesis or as a Hero. It all depends on you. The final Pandora mission is a nemesis mission, with action cards to manage this new and powerful adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But how did Beli'ar come to be imprisoned on Phitos?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
