			<description>LONG DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything or almost everything is possible in this game, based on the theme of World History figures from 13 important areas: governors, the military, astronomers, philosophers, scientists, explorers, mathematicians, pioneers, writers, painters, musicians, Nobel Prizes and Human Rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;- EUREKA (GAME 1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;It is played by two teams of two players. The aim of the game is to gather 4 people from one of the 13 sets: the military, astronomers, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;When the player gathers the 4 cards they secretly signal their partner who then says EUREKA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving forward...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. At the beginning of each round, turn 4 cards over (from the deck) on the table. &lt;br/&gt;2. All together, players count up to 3. &lt;br/&gt;3. After finishing the count, each player can switch the cards held in the hand with the ones on the table (he/she can switch as many cards as desired). &lt;br/&gt;4. A round ends when players do not wish to exchange more cards. &lt;br/&gt;5. The 4 cards on the table from the previous round are discarded. Turn 4 new cards over from the deck and repeat the procedures from step 2 forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- FAMILY GAME (GAME 2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;Gather as many Families as possible. Each Family is composed of 4 characters. Each character is associated to a colour: green, red, yellow and blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving on&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player asks another player for a card of his/ her choice. This request must respect the following rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     the player already has a card of this Family;&lt;br/&gt;     the player must always say: first, the name of the Family to which the card belongs; then, the colour associated with the desired character: green, red, yellow or blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the following options occurs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     if the player succeeds in getting the asked card: then, he/ she asks a player for a new card;&lt;br/&gt;     if the player cannot get the asked card: he/ she picks up a playing card from the deck placed on the centre of the table and stops playing. It is the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
