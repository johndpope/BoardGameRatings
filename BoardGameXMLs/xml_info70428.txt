							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mia Famiglia: The Lodovico Crime Family</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some games can feel constrained when running a straight &amp;quot;Store-bought&amp;quot; adventure. And often the other end of the spectrum isn't much better, since the GM has to be ready for any decision the players make. (And my players take a special delight in throwing as many curve-balls my way as they can!) Lack of preperation can lead to games that just aren't as much fun; so to address that, Skortched Urf' Studios introduces: Adventure Blocks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure blocks takes all the components of a typical adventure or campaign and breaks them out into Blocks. Mix-and-Match various Blocks and you can create any adventure you want on-the-fly while still having the entire encounter statted' out with descriptions and various ideas for implementing it in your game. Everything you need to keep your adventure running smoothly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure Block for the D20 Modern game details the Lodovico Crime Family. We present a brief history of the organization, as well as all the major players with stats, background and history. From the Don and his wife, the Perrone Crew and the Made Men, as well as the various &amp;quot;associates&amp;quot; of the organization like the doctor who will patch up those bullet wounds without asking questions, to the cop-on-the-take and more. You have everything you need, including new equipment, Mob Hook ideas and more to help integrate this product into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
