							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mean Streets and Mean Villains</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mean Streets and Mean Villains is inspired by the glamorous police and detective series of the &amp;lsquo;70s and &amp;lsquo;80s such as Starsky and Hutch, Miami Vice, Police Woman, Kojak, Hawaii 5-0, Cannon, The Rockford Files, Hunter, The Avengers and New Avengers, and The Professionals; or films like Dragnet, Beverley Hills Cop and the Dirty Harry series. The list is endless, there are many more than I&amp;rsquo;ve listed here; and I&amp;rsquo;m sure you could add a lot that I haven&amp;rsquo;t even heard of. More recent television shows, such as Sledgehammer and Funky Squad, capture the themes of the game perfectly, because it is intended as a gentle parody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mean Streets and Mean Villains is designed to allow you to run games in a similar vein: not large campaigns, but small, one-off games as a way of injecting a little light humour between your normal gaming sessions, or when half your players don&amp;rsquo;t turn up. Adventures (or Episodes as they are called in this game) are targeted at one, two or (very occasionally) three or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
