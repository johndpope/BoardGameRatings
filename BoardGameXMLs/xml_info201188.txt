							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire: The Eternal Struggle â€“ Camarilla Edition</name>
									
			<description>Camarilla Edition was the fourth Vampire: The Eternal Struggle set to be published by White Wolf, and was the first full standalone edition of the game since the original Jyhad/V:TES edition of the game was published by Wizards of the Coast. Camarilla Edition has since been reckoned as the &amp;quot;Second Edition&amp;quot; of the game, thanks to the release of Vampire: The Eternal Struggle Third Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name implies, Camarilla Edition was the first V:TES expansion set to focus primarily on the clans and Kindred of the Camarilla. Most of the new cards introduced in this set are crypt cards (vampires), and are drawn from a variety of Vampire: The Masquerade sources, primarily Children of the Night and the various &amp;quot;by Night&amp;quot; city sourcebooks. The complete set of these 100 new crypt cards was later reprinted as the Blood Shadowed Court factory set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six clans spotlighted in this set are the Brujah, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue, and each of these six clans has its own preconstructed starter deck for this set. The set follows the metaplot of Vampire: The Masquerade, in which the Gangrel left the Camarilla and became independent; they appeared as a mostly-independent clan in the next expansion set, Anarchs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
