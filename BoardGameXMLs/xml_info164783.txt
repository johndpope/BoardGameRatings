			<description>(from BGG user:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another Sekigahara game from Game Journal. But, this one is really unique and innovative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is secretly assigned a role as a secondary daimyo: Kobayakawa, Kikkawa, Chosokabe, or Shimazu. Neither player knows the identity of their opponent. Since identities are hidden, control of the Eastern and Western forces alternates each turn until players reveal their identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is decided by victory points for eliminating the other side's units. However, the points earned are better for the side who wins the battle than the side who loses the battle. It is possible that both players belong to the same side at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
