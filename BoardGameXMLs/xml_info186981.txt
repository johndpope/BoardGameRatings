							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fossil Hunters</name>
									
			<description>Fossil Hunters is a game of area encirclement for 2-5 players. All players have access to the same slab of rock. The goal is to split it apart, divide the spoils, and form complete dinosaur skeletons. Large dinosaurs are much more lucrative, but incomplete skeletons do not score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using wooden sticks to divide the board, players collectively determine which tiles will be claimed and by whom. As the board splits and shrinks, players are pressured to finish what they've started before every fossil is claimed. Timing is everything, so sometimes it is best to take a partial turn and conserve resources for later. Each player also holds a unique single-use tool. This should be employed at the best moment for the greatest reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fossil Hunters is a short small-box game, taking only 20 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
