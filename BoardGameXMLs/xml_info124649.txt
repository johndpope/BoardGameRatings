			<description>From the game publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;RoShamBo (aka Rock Paper Scissors) is a board game that takes an age-old concept and transforms it into a game like no other on the market &amp;mdash; ever. Ro Sham Bo is simple yet complex &amp;mdash; an entertaining game that makes play fast, intense, and sometimes personal, but most of all fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's pretty simple (but for those of you who have been living under a rock &amp;mdash; no pun intended&amp;hellip;) Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock. Got it so far?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players advance toward the winner's level by rolling the dice or by winning challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, more is at stake than just winning the game (on the board) &amp;mdash; challenges can go beyond traditional game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way players land on spaces that call for challenges that range from moving ahead a few spaces and changing places with the winner, to being everyone's butler for the rest of the game, or doing a crazy stunt or challenge of the cardholder's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
