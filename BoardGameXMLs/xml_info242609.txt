							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Danger in a Midwinter Wonderland</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Danger in Midwinter Wonderland is a single session adventure suitable for a party of 3-5 players of 4th or 5th level but is best with 4 5th level players. It is easy to play as a one-shot adventure with new characters or to place into an already existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure also includes Christmas themed magic items like the Exploding Midwinter Crackers and has stats for a number of new monsters including the fearsome Snoman and the deadly Krampus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone has heard of the festival of Midwinter, the great Winter's Father and his dutiful Toy Makers. They are the core of the Midwinter celebrations and there is no better place to visit than the Noel Isles and see the Winter's Father in person during these celebrations. Each year the Toy Makers decorate the Isles with such splendour that it can only be fully appreciated in person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this year something foul is afoot, the Winter's Father is missing and the Noel Isles are too quiet. Something is definitely wrong but you're not quiet sure what. All you know is that you sense Danger, in this Midwinter Wonderland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
