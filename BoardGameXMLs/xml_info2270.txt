							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Borderlands</name>
									
			<description>In Borderlands, each player runs a kingdom. The kingdoms are grown by adding new lands to the capital and new creatures to the lands. As each kingdom grows, it becomes more powerful -- but it also becomes more vulnerable as its borderlands grow as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, land and creature &amp;amp; feature cards are drawn. Power cards, Gold, Food, and Resources are gathered from the lands. Armies are deployed to opposing kingdoms, capturing new lands from their borderlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, one player will save up enough power cards to create an artifact for his kingdom. If this artifact is brought back to the capital, the player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
