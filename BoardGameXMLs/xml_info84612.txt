			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this interactive legal adventure game you take the role of Sterling Granger, a San Fransisco District Attorney. You are in charge of the prosecution in a murder and grand theft trial, and your task is to try and prove that both accusations are correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your object during pre-trial is to examine various pieces of evidence and to question witnesses and other people involved in the case. The witnesses' attitude towards you, and the way they treat you changes depending on the questions you ask and the way you ask them. The questions you ask appear in the form of an interactive pre-recorded video segment. Different questions elicit different responses from witnesses, and may or may not allow for follow-up questions. You do all this from a first person perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the quality of your work as a prosecutor, and if you manage to elicit the proper responses from witnesses, you can go to trial having a very strong case against the accused. You can thus manage a conviction for first degree murder and grand theft auto for the accused, and victory for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If on the other hand your case is poorer, you have a range of possible weaker outcomes. The worst possible outcome is the dismissal of the case and your humiliation. There are also possibilities for the accused to be acquitted, and various lesser convictions such as manslaughter, grand theft auto, or second-degree murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
