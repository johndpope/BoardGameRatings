			<description>RULES (for 3 or 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIM: To collect and arrange five cards in &amp;quot;rock cycle&amp;quot; order. Cards represent &lt;br/&gt;rocks and geological processes, these must be collected and displayed in the &lt;br/&gt;right order depending on the Rock Cycle (see below). Each single card tells &lt;br/&gt;what are the preceding and the following cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Burial: heat-pressure&amp;quot; card is very important as it allows the transformation&lt;br/&gt;of a sedimentary/igneous rock into a metamorphic one. It is essential that the &lt;br/&gt;preceding card and the following card are logically ordered. The exact sequence&lt;br/&gt;is described in the &amp;quot;Burial: heat-pressure&amp;quot; card. That means that if you have &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Granite&amp;quot;, you have to link it to &amp;quot;Gneiss&amp;quot; and nothing else.&lt;br/&gt;N.B. Chalk should be treated as Limestone (i.e. changes into &amp;quot;Marble&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1- Shuffle cards and deal 5 each. Place the remaining deck, face-down, at the &lt;br/&gt;    centre of the table; reveal the first card and place it &amp;quot;face up&amp;quot; next to the deck.&lt;br/&gt;2- Players have to arrange the five cards in &amp;quot;rock cycle&amp;quot; order: each player &lt;br/&gt;    have to decide, according to the cards in his/her hand, which &amp;quot;section&amp;quot; of&lt;br/&gt;    the Rock Cycle would be more convenient to build upon. Players should not&lt;br/&gt;    reveal their cards.&lt;br/&gt;3- In turn, clockwise, each player pick either the top card from the deck or the &lt;br/&gt;    face-up card next to it. Then he/she has to discard one card; this will be placed &lt;br/&gt;    face-up next to the deck. Once the card has been discarded, the next player can &lt;br/&gt;    pick a card and so on.&lt;br/&gt;4- When a player has put all five cards in order he/she will reveal them all and,&lt;br/&gt;     if the other players acknowledge the right order, he/she is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
