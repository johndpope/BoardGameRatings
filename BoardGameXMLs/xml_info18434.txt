			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;BULLS HIT is a fun game involving watching each others' flies as they zip in and out of their favorite cowpat.  The first fly that's 'dungroamin' is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each fly must start in the very bowels of the country pancake and then wind their way out again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dung - the final frontier.  Set your flies in motion as you travel from the very heart of the 'dung-eon' of no return.  No holes are barred in the windy city of flies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll play this game until the cows come home!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to work your way out of the middle of the cowpat by telling stories or making statements convincingly enough to make your opponents guess wrongly as to them being Bulls-Hit, No Bulls-Hit or Total Bulls-Hit.  The winner is the first player to get out of the cowpat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
