							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trolls on Treasure Island</name>
									
			<description>From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Samantha and Norbert were baby Trolls their Grampa told them tales of lost treasures stashed on a mysterious far away island.  That was long ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, while wind surfing, our teenage troll twins came upon an undiscovered and uncharted island filled with excitement, adventure and hidden treasure. Exploring the island they soon &lt;br/&gt;realized it was the same island their Grampa told them about when they were very young.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twins passed through vine covered trees filled with multi-colored birds of every description. They were overwhelmed with the beauty of the island but they couldn't help thinking about the warning Grampa always told them: &amp;quot;If you ever come upon this magical island like I did when I was young - explore it with great care. There are many strange and dangerous creatures that make the island their home. Venomous snakes, giant flying insects, and huge slobbering jaws to name just a few. Remember, always be careful!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
