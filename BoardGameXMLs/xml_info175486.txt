			<description>A mysterious dungeon emerged from the middle of the continent with great power to summon creatures and control them. All nearby kingdoms have sent heroes. Some are here to destroy the dungeon, some to take that great power. You are one of these heroes. By your king's order, you must defeat all other heroes and monopolize this dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dungeon will help you summon powerful creatures, but you need an altar to do this &amp;mdash; and if you lose your altars, you can hardly survive this battle. By the same token, you can dominate this dungeon by conquering your enemies' altars. You can also collect victory points by destroying the enemies themselves. Making the most powerful army is one way to win. Now it's time to begin the battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GSBM (Great Strategy of Battle Monsters) is a fantasy-based strategy game that gives you extreme freedom to maximize your strategic choices and control the game. Each player forms an army of monsters to compete with other players in phases such as Produce, Summon, Move, Battle, and Conquer; each monster has its own unique skill, allowing you to devise clever strategies by combining it with other skills or tactic cards. Players must manage their resources, action points and five mana elements: water, fire, air, earth, and ether. Using these resources effectively is the key to victory. Players must also use field effects, elemental superiority, unit type differences (infantry/archer/cavalry/flyer), joint attacks, and joint defense to their advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers several victory conditions, so each player can take strategic approaches to different victories based on how the game plays out. The game field is randomized for each new game, altering territorial dynamics between players and providing near-infinite start settings. As players become more skilled with the game, their tactics and strategy develop, allowing them to play against others with more unique and original play styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&amp;bull;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GSBM은 판타지 세계관을 배경으로 한 2~8인용 전략 게임으로서 최대한의 자유도 및 무한한 확장성을 바탕으로, 게이머의 게임 지배력과 전략적 선택가능성을 극대화한 작품입니다. 핸드와 필드 관리, 마나 관리, 승점 관리, 소환 거점 관리 등의 여러 요소가 게임에 녹아 있습니다. 이들을 균형있게 유지해야만 마법진에서  승리의 영광을 눌리 수 있을 것입니다.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
