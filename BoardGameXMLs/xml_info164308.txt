			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verdun is a First Person Shooter which can only be played online in multiplayer battles. The game is set in World War One and features several maps of the Western front which saw some intense trench warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play team vs. team, a player must join a squad. A squad is a group of four people, each one with an unique role (and possibilities), like officer, grenadier, support gunner etc. Matches consists of 4 squads of 4 men per side, so 32 players on a map. During play, the teams are forced in roles: either attacking the enemy trenches and securing victory points there, or defending. Roles (attack, defend, counter attack) switch a number of times during one match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squads gain experience. When you start, you'll wear an early war uniform and weapons. Once you gain more experience, your outfit become more late war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features WW-I weapons. Meaning, as an officer you just have your pistol and binoculars (for artillery requests) for instance, while most players are equipped with bolt action rifles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
