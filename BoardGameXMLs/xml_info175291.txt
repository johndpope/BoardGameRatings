							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadzone: Infestation</name>
									
			<description>Deadzone is the science fiction miniatures game where two Strike Teams do battle in a war-torn urban battlezone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Deadzone, you will build your force from deadly soldiers and powerful heroes. Across one-off games or a linked campaign, your squad will grow in number and experience, earning special abilities and new equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadzone is played on an interactive 3D gaming board built using the innovative hard plastic Battlezones Terrain Tiles. These tiles are fully modular, simply use the connectors and click the pieces together. No glue required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Faction: Veer-myn&lt;br/&gt;Veer-myn are a new faction in Deadzone, and this is the first time we are creating miniatures for them in hard plastic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An insidious disease ridden race, the Veer-Myn fester in the darkest corners of man&amp;rsquo;s world. Their broods writhe and chatter in a rodent like manner, equally matched by their physical appearance. The uncertainty of whether the Veer-Myn act with a motive, or just the need to infest and expand, only adds to the nightmare created from what lurks within the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Miniatures: Enforcer Pathfinders&lt;br/&gt;New in hard plastic, the Enforcer range gets a boost with these deadly scouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even amongst the ranks of the Enforcers, the Pathfinders are an elite and highly specialised group. Their role demands that they avoid direct contact with the enemy wherever possible and their standard equipment and weaponry reflect this. Deployed ahead of the main force, the Pathfinders are tasked with gathering all the necessary Intel required to support a successful campaign, while eliminating any obstacles that may hinder the deployment of the main Enforcer vanguard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Scenery: Industrial Scenery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative range of modular Battlezones terrain tiles. The tiles clip together using special connectors. These tiles expand the range with new Industrial scenery, giving you a new style of tiles to play with&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Getting Started: we want gamers everywhere to be playing Deadzone. The new Rulebook will be streamlined and reordered to make getting started simple, whilst incorporating the abilities and skills from the original expansion for easy reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New Force Organisation: We are implementing a new Force Organisation Chart to make building your strike team easy, and helping make your next purchase that little bit simpler. More information on this during the campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Deep Campaign Setting: one of the original's shortcomings was the campaign section, and we'll tackling this with a new exciting system in the updated book after incorporating feedback from playtest groups and the community at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All existing miniatures are fully compatible with this new rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
