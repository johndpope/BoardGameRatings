			<description>Publishers Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tactical level game, for two players, of the battle that took place near the Murray River, Western Australia (WA), in October 1834. Governor Stirling led a British Force comprising troopers and soldiers of the 21st Regiment on a punitive expedition against a local Aboriginal community in an attempt to stem the rising tide of attacks by Natives that resided near the Murray River, against the white settlers in the region. Players control the various British and Native forces which took part in this battle. &lt;br/&gt;Units range from individuals to small groups. Map scale is 33 metres per hex and each turns represents about 4 minutes. Murray River comes with a full colour map in 2 A3 sections, 256 mounted color counters, rule book and charts in a ziplock bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
