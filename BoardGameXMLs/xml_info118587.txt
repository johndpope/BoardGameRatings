			<description>A game you don&amp;rsquo;t put away&amp;hellip;            &lt;br/&gt;Game objective: Have most pieces at the top of the piles.  &lt;br/&gt;A strategic game: choose the game piece and where and how to place it, is already a brain-teaser&amp;hellip; but to make the good choice between playing or passing the lead, is a true strategic choice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-A board game with 5 axes of different heights. &lt;br/&gt;-2 series of 12 pieces: &lt;br/&gt;    4 parallelepipeds pierced in the 3 axes of its space. &lt;br/&gt;    4 cylinders, pierced in the 2 axes of its space. &lt;br/&gt;    4 cones pierced in their height. &lt;br/&gt;    (One set of pieces of the same colour for each player.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To have the most pieces piled on the top of the axes at the end of the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player disposes of a set of 12 pieces of the same colour. &lt;br/&gt;Lots are drawn to choose the player who starts.&lt;br/&gt;The first player puts one of his pieces on one of the axes. &lt;br/&gt;Then each player plays at his turn by putting one of his pieces on one of the axes. &lt;br/&gt;When a player puts one of his pieces on an opponent&amp;rsquo;s piece, he has to play again. &lt;br/&gt;The game is over when one of the players has no more pieces, or when it is not possible to place piece any more.&lt;br/&gt;The player who has most pieces on the top of the axes (piles) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
