							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caps &amp; Hammers: A Particularly Cold War</name>
									
			<description>We live in a world of two great nations: the Caps and the Hammers. These fierce rivals are prepared to engulf the world in their quest for prestige, influence, and domination. Take the reins of one of these mysterious powers and lead them to global Supremacy. But tread carefully, for if your ambitions run too high, you run the risk of nuclear annihilation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to navigate the treacherous waters of cold war diplomacy? Or will you lead the world to destruction?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Caps &amp;amp; Hammers: A Particularly Cold War is to achieve SUPREMACY by having more supremacy points than your opponent at the end of eight rounds. Supremacy points are awarded to the players for each country and scientific project they control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round, players take turns distributing a hidden action card onto the countries and scientific project in hopes of proving their superiority in every conflict. After both players have expended their cards and have revealed their plans, players gain control of the countries in which they have a higher action point sum. Players must reach the requisite eight action points to complete a project, and are constantly in a race to the next scientific milestone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each action card has a special effect that can turn a conflict to the player&amp;rsquo;s advantage, effects include shifting card locations, buffing action point values, stealing countries, revealing enemy plots, and etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players share a Defcon value that represents the state of war readiness of the two powers. If Defcon 1 is reached, both players must make concessions to avert nuclear conflict. Carefully spending this shared resource is essential to effective cold war strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
