			<description>Explore an abandoned mine shaft in search of lost gems and ore while being careful to avoid the previous tenant's pitfalls.  Draw cards by digging (draw two) or prospecting (look at the top three and choose one) from the deck until it is depleted, trying to avoid Dynamite and Gas Leaks, sure signs of disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also return to their base camp in order to stash their finds for safe keeping, or throw Dynamite at other players in order to make them drop their haul. Once the deck has been depleted, players tally the value of cards in their hand and stash to determine a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
