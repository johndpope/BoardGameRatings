			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!&lt;br/&gt;Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, &lt;br/&gt;and behold the greatest circus in the land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold the skilled mummers performing at The Stage;&lt;br/&gt;you&amp;rsquo;ll literally feel like you're part of the play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrill to the death-defying acts (and audience) &lt;br/&gt;in the two rings under the Big Top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laugh at the antics of the baleful buffoons, harmful harlequins, &lt;br/&gt;and malevolent merrymakers of Clown Alley!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaze in wonder at the wild beasts of the Menagerie,&lt;br/&gt;(just make sure you know which side of the bars you&amp;rsquo;re on)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this and more, for the small price of a single admission, to&lt;br/&gt;Bitterbark&amp;rsquo;s Magnificent Circus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circus is in town! But there&amp;rsquo;s something not quite right about it. There are rumors of missing children, evil plots, and more. Can you discover the secrets hidden inside Bitterbark&amp;rsquo;s Magnificent Circus?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bitterbark's Circus is a stand-alone adventure for 3-6 characters of level 8-9. This adventure can be inserted to almost any existing campaign with a minimum of fuss (several options are presented for the GM to choose from to involve his players), and can also be used as an expansion to the best-selling Castle of the Mad Archmage&amp;trade;, which has a magical gate leading to the circus on one of the lower levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for the Adventures Dark and Deep rules, Bitterbark's Circus can be played with most Basic and Advanced compatible rule sets with little or no conversion needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure also includes the entire Jester character class from Adventures Dark and Deep&amp;trade;, along with all the new spells unique to that class, to enable every GM to run this adventure to maximum effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
