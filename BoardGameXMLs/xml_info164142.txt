							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Robots</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle the Ultimate Weapons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots have long been a staple of science fiction, from hapless and harmless helper droids to incredibly deadly weapons of war. They have also been a part of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game for some time, and even have their own subtype, as well as rules for force fields, lasers, and plasma weapons. But Pathfinder robots have never been mythic&amp;hellip;until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents three brand new robots for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, each of which has both a mythic and non-mythic version, for a total of 6 monster stat-blocks. Included are the buzzsaw drone (CRs 3 and 4), the harvester (CRs 9 and 11), and the witchstalker engine (CRs 13 and 16). The buzzsaw drone is a flying reconnaissance robot with a body shaped like (and used as) a buzzsaw, allowing it to cut through enemies and obstacles alike. While it can perform powerful sweeping dive attacks, its flight is easily disturbed, and successive strikes can quickly knock it to the ground. The harvester also features buzzsaws: one on each arm, which the mythic version can even launch into the air to act as buzzsaw drones. It travels on powerful treadmills which can crush its foes, and has a swivel-mounted laser drill. Finally, the witchstalker engine is built to hunt down and capture spellcasters, and features a number of abilities that allow it to negate the power of such creatures, including a special chamber for storing them, which prevents dimensional travel and&amp;mdash;in the mythic version&amp;mdash;all magic, entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
