			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Twister has finally found it's way onto gaming consoles. The famous boardgame by Christophe Boelinger was made into a digital version by Hydravision and is first released for the PlayStation 3, while also being planed to be available on other gaming consoles like X-Box 360, or on the Steam network for PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to maneuver a group of up to 8 characters through a set of rotatable maze-like rooms and reach the other side of the maze, before your enemy does the same. Each character has a special ability that helps you pass solid walls or jump deadly spiked pits. Combat is also possible and a viable strategy to block your enemy from leaving the dungeon. Combat is resolved with combat-cards, with values ranging from +0 to +6. The trick is, your higher combat-cards are only usable once, so you have to make decisions on when to use a card and when to hold back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
