			<description>Author's Note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate of the Norns 2e is the second edition of the popular Fate of the Norns franchise. It continues to use the d10/d% system, but deviates from the RPG norm by creating a battle atmosphere that is less concerned about reducing someone to zero lifeforce, but instead focuses on relaying a compelling narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition was more focused on history than the mythology and established a much more low-fantasy feel than its predecessor. The void left by the lack of the supernatural was replaced with more characterization on dwellers, involving a detailed life-path system. The life-path system involved kingdoms and politics of the Viking times. Combat involved more swordplay and revolved around elaborate mechanics for such confrontations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
