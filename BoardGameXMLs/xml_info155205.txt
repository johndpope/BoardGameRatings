			<description>Pop the Question features thirty-two cards that can be grouped into eight different four-card &amp;quot;marriages.&amp;quot;  Each marriage is comprised of a ring, a minister, a man, and a woman card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dealt out for three to six players, who must take turns calling out one of the three questions on one of their cards to one of the other players.  If the called out player has the matching card, he must give it to the calling player, and play continues to the left.  If the card is not there, nothing happens and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player collects a marriage of four matching cards, they are set aside to be counted at game's end.  When no cards are left, the player with the most marriages wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
