							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Wimpy: The Hamburger Game</name>
									
			<description>Mr. Wimpy is a platforming video game released by Ocean Software in 1984. The game was intended to be a promotional tie with Wimpy restaurants as their logos, company mascots, and theme tunes were reproduced. The game was released on the Oric 1, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Commodore 64. The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving potholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard a character called Waldo tries and steal these ingredients from him. After the opening level the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr Wimpy across the platforms whilst walking over four various burger ingredients which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Wimpy,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Wimpy,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&amp;uml;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
