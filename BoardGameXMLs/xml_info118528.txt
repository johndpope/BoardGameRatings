			<description>The players take turns turning their cards over and compare their letter with the other players' letters. If two players have the same letter (capital or small), they must hit the &amp;quot;Cheese&amp;quot; card in the center of the table as fast as possible.&lt;br/&gt;The fastest player gives his cards to his opponent. Six different Action cards give more punch to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
