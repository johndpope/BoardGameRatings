							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wild West Pinball</name>
									
			<description>Wild West Pinball is an innovative for iPhone platform 3-D pinball simulator designed in the western style with all specific attributes, namely a bank and railway robbery, an Indian village, a bar, a combat with Dirty Garry, a highwayman, a prison and many other exciting details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Country style music smoothly plunges you deep into the breathtaking world of cowboys and Red Indians. You can always change the music into your favourite one listed in your iPod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thing you can see is the main menu designed as a 3-D table with flying camera and prompts for a player over it. You may move the screen to the right if you want to look through your local and on-line scores, or move the screen to the left to read breathtaking news from Gameprom, or just start your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
