			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The sounds of the big guns still ring in your ears as you walk slowly down the street. The fort seems quiet now, at least by comparison. Only minutes ago it was filled with Imperial troops wager for a shot at you, and now only distant rifle fire can be heard. But is it too quiet? What was that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You turn and fire your PPR at a corner of the building just as six Imperial soldiers - green Gorlons all of them! - blast you with laser fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You look wildly around for cover and, spotting a heap of smoking rubble nearby, fling yourself behind it. Wiping the sweat out of your eyes you pick out an Imperial soldier and raise your weapon to draw a bead on him. But what you see is so incredible you can't believe your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clint Eastwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clint Eastwood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And John Wayne. And is that Jimmy Cagney over there by the wall? Yes. Clint Eastwood and John Wayne and Jimmy Cagney are all standing there with guns trained on the Imperial soldiers, and the Gorlons seem as surprised as you are. What the devil is going on?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
