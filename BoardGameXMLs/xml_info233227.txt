							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hideouts &amp; Hoodlums Basic Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How long have you been waiting to combine golden age comic book gaming with old school game rules? Okay, since 1st edition? Well, wait no longer -- because HIDEOUTS &amp;amp; HOODLUMS Second Edition is here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is H&amp;amp;H 2nd ed.? Well, it's still a d20 game, so it's class- and level-based. It lets you play superheroes, but it's not just a superhero game -- you can play fighters, magic-users, and mysterymen too. The game emphasizes exploration (of hideouts) and character interaction almost as much as combat (vs. hoodlums and other cool stuff).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why emulate the Golden Age of Comic Books? And so specifically the pre-war years? Comic books were pretty gonzo crazy back then. You could have a dope ring-busting G-Man, a funny animal character, and a planet-hopping galactic explorer all in the same anthology comic book -- back to back! It's that anything-is-possible feel I most wanted to emulate in H&amp;amp;H. Adventures also tended to be short and for small groups of heroes in the Golden Age -- perfect for the time-strapped small group of friends who want to get together to game on weekday evenings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's different about H&amp;amp;H in 2nd edition? There are skills now. There are new mobster and trophy types. There is a sample metropolis to use as a home base -- plus lots of tweaking in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is this a &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; book? This is everything you need to get your heroes from levels 1 up to level 6. That should keep you busy for awhile. Past level 6, you can look back to 1st edition, or wait for the Advanced Hideouts &amp;amp; Hoodlums books coming out in the future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
