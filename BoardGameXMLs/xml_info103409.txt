							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CSI: Crime City</name>
									
			<description>CSI: Crime City is the eleventh video game adaption of the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation television series, developed for Facebook by Area/Code and published by Ubisoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;CSI: Crime City&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is very simple and straightforward - players click on squares within a grid at a crime scene to search them for evidence.  Eace scene has a predetermined number of pieces of evidence to find before progress can be made in the case and to close a case you have to find all the evidence at all the scenes.  Each space searched uses up your energy bar, and once empty you must wait for it to replenish.  Short cut-scenes are played out inbetween each location playing out the storyline of the case.  These often feature characters from the TV show interacting with the protagonists in the case, along with your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can customise their avatar and laboratory, and view their Facebook friends labs and avatars.  Items can be bought to increase your capability to search quicker, or for purely cosmetic value.  Free energy in the form of coffee can be picked up from friends' labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New cases are added to the game periodically and there is also a set of cases based on real CSI episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
