			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core task resolution method involves rolling a dice pool of d10, with the number of dice based on an identified character trait and Skill.  Results of 7-9 count as one success and results of 10 count as two successes.  If the number of successes meets or exceeds the target difficulty, the action succeeds.  If no successes are rolled but the pool roll includes a 1, a critical failure has occurred.  Impossible situations still allow a &amp;quot;faint hope&amp;quot; roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GM will set a campaign type of either Heroic, Standard, or Gritty, and nearly all phases of character creation will be impacted by that decision because the various build points/options for every aspect are based on the campaign type.  Character creation involves much background and personality development prior to generation of statistics.  Attributes, ranging from 1-7+ (maximum human is 6) are grouped into three categories:  Physical (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitutions); Mental (Intelligence, Senses, Wisdom); and Social (Attractiveness, Grace, and Charisma).  Skills, also ranging from 1-7+ (maximum human is 6) are grouped into three categories:  Informal, Formal, and Specialized.  Combat can remain simple or involve a large variety of special situations and maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
