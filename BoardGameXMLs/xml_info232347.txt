							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goth Court</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to this most venerated court of law. We commend the keen sense of justice and duty that has called you to these hallowed chambers. The litigants you will see today are goths and their adversaries facing mortal conflict. They have already filed suit or been served a summons to appear in municipal court. Both parties in the suit have agreed to dismiss their court cases and instead settle their disputes here, in this most venerated and dramatic forum: Goth Court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cases last a few minutes and are ridiculous. A typical game takes an hour, but you can keep playing as long as everyone is having a good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
