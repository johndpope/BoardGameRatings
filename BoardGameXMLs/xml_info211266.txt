Often imitated, never duplicated.&lt;br/&gt;3-10 players&lt;br/&gt;Hampered by cheek retractors, teams attempt to read and interpret silly phrases, like:&lt;br/&gt;Mother f&amp;cup;&amp;copy;k!ng penguins.&lt;br/&gt;Pop my butt pimple.&lt;br/&gt;Bubba Gump is a backdoor bandit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch Ya&amp;rsquo; Mouth NSFW Expansion Pack #1 comes with 143 depraved, explicit phrases.
