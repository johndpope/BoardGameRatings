							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Stately Homes of England</name>
									
			<description>Players have to go around a map of England collecting cards that show Stately Homes.  There are 66 Stately Homes, but only 18 have cards.  You need to collect them all to win.  This task can be aided if you gain a Bonus Visiting Card, which acts as a joker.  Information on each home is available.  A variation where players have to name which Home is at each place they land on the map, makes the game harder.  The game dates from 1967 and is now quite rare to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
