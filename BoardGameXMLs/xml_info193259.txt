			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creature statistic cards for all the 'System Reference' creatures of the 5th edition of the world's most popular Fantasy RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is a PDF of cards set up to be printed at 2.75&amp;quot;x3.75&amp;quot; and trimmed to 2.5&amp;quot;x3.5&amp;quot;. Also included is a second PDF with all the cards on 8.5&amp;quot;x11&amp;quot; pages, 4 cards per page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The text on the cards is generally a 9pt font, but some cards have 8pt or even 7pt.  The actions, traits, etc. were condensed as needed and as possible but several couldn't fit at 9pt even after abbreviating.  If you have ideas to abbreviate the cards with a smaller font further and possibly allow a higher point size, please post a comment in the product's discussion or message support at inkwellideas dot com. One creature (the vampire) is split between two cards.  Some other cards (bat/giant bat, frog/giant frog, etc.) were combined to one card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
