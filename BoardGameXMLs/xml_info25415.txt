			<description>Modern Fast Attack Craft Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by David Manley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current Edition 1.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 pages; recommended scale 1/600, 1/700; complexity: 6/10; level of detail: 5/10; avg game length 2 hours; dice required: D20, D10, D6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;View Summary of Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are for the recreation of small naval engagements with Fast Attack Craft such as missile boats and smaller warships, mainly in coastal waters. The period covered runs from the late 1950&amp;rsquo;s onwards, and allows also for the use of aircraft and helicopters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important aspect of the rules is that the units can start as unidentified &amp;ldquo;blips&amp;rdquo;, which might be dummies, and there is a simple detection and identification system that changes the status to &amp;ldquo;contact&amp;rdquo; (detected as an enemy vessel) and &amp;ldquo;target&amp;rdquo; where the model is deployed. If you can get out of radar &amp;ldquo;sight&amp;rdquo; then you can revert to &amp;ldquo;blip&amp;rdquo; status again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shooting system allows for guns and missiles of various types, and damage is recorded in a graded system with 5 states from intact to sunk. Vessels can take Special hits when damaged which further degrade their ability. There are simple rules for operating helicopters from ships, as well as rules for anti aircraft fire with guns and missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also additional rules for unconventional craft, mine warfare and operations against coastal targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are rounded off with extensive data tables for missiles, torpedoes, guns, rockets, SAM systems, Air to Air missiles, ships, helicopters and aircraft. (There are 140 sets of ship data from over 40 countries).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETTING THE SCENE: Vessel Descriptions; Command and Control; Play Area&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TURN SEQUENCE AND INITIATIVE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOVEMENT: Moving Astern; Turning; Collisions; Drifting; Grounding; Towing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TARGET DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION: Detection / Identification States; Managing &amp;ldquo;Blips&amp;rdquo; and other markers;  Moving &amp;ldquo;Blips&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Contacts&amp;rdquo;; Notes on Detection and Identification; Radar Detection; Detecting Radar Emissions; Sharing Detection Data; Visual Identification of the Target; Random Visibility; Sharing Identification Data; Starshells and Flares; Countermeasures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIRING: Weapon Firing Arcs; Eligibility of Targets (Lines of Fire); Gunfire; Missile Fire; Torpedo Fire; Salvo Rocket Launchers and Rocket Pods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DAMAGE:  Basic Damage Table; Damage Control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS:  Altitude; Aircraft and Helicopter Detection and Identification; Surface to Air and Air to Air Fire; Aircraft Damage; Air to Surface Attacks; Launching and Recovering Helicopters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNCONVENTIONAL CRAFT: Semi Submersibles; Surface Effect Ships; Hydrofoils; Hovercraft; Ekranoplans; Suicide Craft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINE WARFARE: Types of Mines; Hits on Minelayers; Mine Laying; Detonation; Minesweeping; Mine Hunting; Minesweeping Helicopters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LAND FORCES: Troops; Vehicles; Buildings; Use of Naval Weapons against land targets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TABLE OF ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DATA TABLES: Air to Air Missiles; Anti-Ship Missiles; Guns and Rocket launchers; SAM Systems; Special Craft; Torpedoes (Unguided); Torpedoes (Guided); Bomb Systems; Typical Helicopters; Typical Aircraft; Notes on Ship Data Tables&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHIP DATA TABLES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
