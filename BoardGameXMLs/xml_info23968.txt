			<description>Division Commander is a set of miniatures rules designed for very high-level World War II operations.  Each stand is a battalion, the ground scale is 3&amp;quot; = 1 mile, and turns are 90-180 minutes.  The rules are designed from the ground up to play multi-day campaigns with multiple divisions per side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Bruce's &amp;quot;Great Battles of World War II&amp;quot; rules, one of the primary concepts is that of troops &amp;quot;going to ground&amp;quot;.  Troops start the day fresh and can make dramatic breakthroughs.  But, as damage occurs, troops are less willing to push forward, they will seek out defensive positions and wait for a new day.  Green troops, in particular, will tend to go to ground very quickly, while more elite troops can continue moving forward.  At this level, combat is abstracted, but operational aspects such as air support and corps and army artillery support are key parts of the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of scenario books are available for the system, including France 1940, Eastern Front, Normandy, North Africa, and the Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
