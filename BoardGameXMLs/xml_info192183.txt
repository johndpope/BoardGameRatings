			<description>1 Cat&lt;br/&gt;18 Balls of thread&lt;br/&gt;4 reels of thread&lt;br/&gt;1 coloured dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to place the brightly-coloured balls or blocks on the cat without the animal tipping over or one of the balls falling off.&lt;br/&gt;Rolling the dice determines the colour ball which is to be placed on the cat. Each player takes turns throwing the dice, moving in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt; A player that causes a ball to fall during their turn is out of the game. The winner is the player who places the last ball of thread on top of the pile without causing anything to dislodge and fall or who is the last player to remain in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
