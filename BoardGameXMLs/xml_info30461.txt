			<description>Might and Reason is designed to provide a fast-play set of rules that will simulate large-scale land warfare during the period of the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years War.  They allow players to game the larger battles of the period to a conclusion in just a few hours time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are made up of multiple stands of miniature figures that represent units of brigade size.  The rules are consistent with any basing system. There are also rules for pre-battle scouting and post-battle pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules set also includes two complete campaign systems:  an all-European grand campaign as well as a campaign tool kit for creating one-year campaigns within a given theater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.sammustafa.com/mr.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.sammustafa.com/mr.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
