							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TorahLine: Exodus from Egypt</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TorahLine card game is a quick 15-minute game designed to help make learning the Torah more fun. Created to captivate children in an era of increasingly short attention spans, the TorahLine game provides engaging gameplay to help kids absorb stories, facts, and the chronology of the Torah.  The first game in the TorahLine series, Exodus from Egypt &amp;ndash; Shemos, Va&amp;rsquo;eira and Bo, depicts the riveting events from the book of Exodus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed with 90 colorful cards and providing hours of fun for ages six and up, TorahLine: Exodus from Egypt covers the events in the first three Torah portions from the enslavement in Egypt to the 10 plagues to the first Passover to the eventual freedom from Egypt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The front of each card has an event title, a hand-drawn illustration, and verse text. The back includes the Torah portion and chapter and verse numbers. At the start of the game, players are dealt starting events on which to build their line of cards in sequence. Players then take turns drawing cards from the pile and correctly (or incorrectly) placing them in line in order by chapter and verse. After all the cards are gone, the player with the most correct cards in his or her line wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game makes it easy to adjust the difficulty for each player, making it ideal for older children and families. It also comes with a bonus trivia game that can be played in the car or at the dinner table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
