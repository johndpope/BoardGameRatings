			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Once the magnificent residence of the Town Lord, now the castle it is the hiding place for a group of marauders led by Graunth Obadai &amp;ldquo;the merciless&amp;rdquo;, a towering half-orc who is said to have demon blood in his veins. Graunth is often out of the castle to maraud the countryside. A small garrison of cutthroats is always left in the castle, surveying the fabled treasure amassed by the band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows the true name of Graunth Obadai &amp;ldquo;the merciless&amp;rdquo;. It is said he took the name of the evil warlord who sacked the Ruined Town in the past after making a strange discovery in the dungeons of Castle Falconflight. People say the bandit took that feared name to provoke terror in the countryside but few persons say the half-orc retrieved a lost artifact in the dungeon of the castle and that after the discovery he was changed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product expands a location found in &amp;Oslash;one's Blueprints: The Ruined Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
