							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mega Man Star Force 2</name>
									
			<description>Mega Man Star Force 2 is an action RPG much in the same vein as the first game. It is rendered in an isometric style (sprites, views, etc.) during field gameplay, but its battle system is three-dimensional, with the battles being viewed from behind Mega Man, and movement restricted to only left and right. Since enemies have a much larger playing field, battle evasion seems limited, but the player is given a choice of techniques like shielding and homing attacks to keep battles balanced. Mega Man's life is a simple &amp;quot;Hit point&amp;quot; (HP) numerical system. When he takes damage, the number lowers, and when it reaches &amp;quot;zero,&amp;quot; the game is over and the player must restart from their last save point. HP can be recovered in a number of ways, both in and out of battle.The player can also use their standard Mega Buster at any time to combat with, and upgrade items for Omega-Xis can be collected throughout the game to increase the Mega Buster's rate, power, and charge speed. The Mega Buster is constantly charging to release a single powerful shot, but the player can hold the button down to fire rapidly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mega Man Star Force 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
