							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Modder River</name>
									
			<description>This is a game about the November 1899 battle during the Boer War. A British force marching to relieve the siege of Kimberly ran into a force of Boers dug in along the banks of the Modder River and suffered heavy losses. The Boers were eventually outflanked and withdrew to another defensive position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an amateur wargame published in Great Britain during 1981 by Yorkshire Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
