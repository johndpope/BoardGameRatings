			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive the waves of ferocious Dunlendings that assail you from all sides with The Dunland Trap Nightmare Deck? Its new encounter cards force you even further back on the defensive as you stumble into a Dunlending ambush. New enemies and treachery cards reinforce the original scenario's design adding new effects that trigger when you draw cards, as well as others that discard the cards you've just drawn, forcing you to draw more. Meanwhile, several new locations offer the scenario's Dunland enemies a measure of cover that makes it harder to damage them in the staging area and harder to avoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare Decks for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios cast in the shadows of the game's challenging Nightmare Mode. Featuring deadlier enemies, darker locations, and more terrifying surprises, each Nightmare Deck introduces new, alternate encounter cards and instructions for using them to reshape a scenario's encounter deck. The result? A nightmarish journey through territory you thought you knew, but with twists and turns that will have you on the edge of your seat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
