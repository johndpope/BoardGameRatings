			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters start off having been hired by an emissary of their king to map out a safe trade route through the Stalk Forest. During this journey, they will encounter a strange old wizard named Makavejev, who is currently fleeing for his life from a group evil creatures known as Fear Deamons. He will attempt to enlist the party's aid in combating them. If they agree to help, he will teleport them off on a quest for a valuable spell component, the Liquid Light,by means of which he can cast a powerful spell to seal away the Fear Deamons forever.&lt;br/&gt; The obliging characters will find themselves transported across the continent to a far away jungle, where they will encounter the Ziggurat of the Liquid Light. Once inside the structure they will face many dangers toward their goal of reaching the awesome Room of Liquid Light, but should they succeed, they will transport themselves back via Makavejev's magic, and hopefully deliver to the mage the Liquid Light in time to have him cast the spell that wil save him, themselves, and the surrounding country from Horrors Unspeakable.&lt;br/&gt; An adventure for 6th-10th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
