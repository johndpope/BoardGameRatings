							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warhammer: The End Times â€“ Nagash</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nagash was the most powerful and feared of the necromancers of old. Now he has returned, and the Warhammer world will be forever changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume details the fateful events following Nagash&amp;rsquo;s return to unlife, and his plans to unite all the Undead of the Warhammer World under his supreme command. This terrifying new chapter in the history of the Old World is revealed over two softback tomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer: Nagash Book 1 is a 296-page volume which provides a narrative sweep of the events surrounding the return of Nagash. From Bretonnia and the Empire, to Nagash&amp;rsquo;s birthplace in the Land of the Dead, vast battles are fought, the dead rise and nothing will ever be quite the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer: Nagash Book 2 is a 96-page volume that contains new scenarios and rules based on the events in Warhammer: Nagash Book 1. It includes the full rules that will allow you to field Nagash and his loyal subjects - along with all-new rules for some of the most powerful heroes of the Old World, such as Valten and Vlad von Carstein - in your games of Warhammer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armies of the End Times can also field more Lords - to up 50% - and the brand new spell lore - The Lore of Undeath - allows every wizard, mage and sorcerer to wield the fell magic unleashed by Nagash. There are also army lists that allow you to create a unified army of Tomb Kings and Vampire Counts known as the Undead Legion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
