							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rising Sun, Tumbling Bear: A Solitaire Game of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).</name>
									
			<description>BACKGROUND: RISING SUN, TUMBLING BEAR is semi-historical simulation of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) at the dawn of the 20th Century. The Game begins shortly after the Japanese surprise naval attack on the Russian warships docked in Port Arthur. The Russians are now building up their forces and gathering their fleets to kick the Japanese out of Manchuria and Korea. The Japanese must capture a number of key Russian controlled settlements before Russia is able to effectively mobilize an overwhelming force into the region or the United States President, Theodore Roosevelt, signs the Peace Treaty of Portsmouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of the Japanese Naval and Land Forces, you must gather your land and naval forces to capture a number of Key Russian Controlled Settlements before the Russian Baltic Fleet reaches Port Arthur or President Theodore Roosevelt signs the Portsmouth Peace Accord. The Japanese must control all 7 of the Key Russian Settlements in order to win. If the Baltic Fleet reaches Vladivostok, they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RISING SUN, TUMBLING BEAR features many colorful Unit and Ship Counters and fast and furious Combat systems for both land and naval combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
