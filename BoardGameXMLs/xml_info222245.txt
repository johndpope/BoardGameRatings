All of the 20 canopies are placed in the basket and each player takes a bare tree. The youngest player goes first by picking up a canopy and placing it on their tree. The game then continues in a clockwise direction. A player throws the two dice that show the ACTION to perform (e.g. take a new canopy and put it on your tree) and WHERE to take the canopy from (e.g. from one of the other player's trees) or WHAT to take (e.g. a green or pink canopy). The game ends when a player, the winner, completes their tree with all 5 canopies of the same season (same colour).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
