			<description>Designer's blog post*:&lt;br/&gt;Recently the Tenkar's Tavern [blog] wrapped up a competition called OSR Superstar.  Perhaps it's a silly name but I figured I'd enter and managed to keep going until the final round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final round was completing a map by Matt over at msjx.org (whose Maps for Heroes campaign is wrapping up today and could use some support - it's got some cool maps in it and supports the Wounded Warrior project) and then keying it.  I finished a map but went a bit beyond my original intent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Along the Road of Tombs] is a 42 page adventure set in the Fallen Empire setting that I've mused about here before.  It's a fairly vanilla setting, and stated up for Swords and Wizardry Complete.  Anyhow hope people like this adventure - it's a romp about bandits, cults and slumber ancient war machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*lightly edited - gmonk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
