							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ausgerechnet Fernweh</name>
									
			<description>Ausgerechnet Fernweh uses the same game play as the other Ausgerechnet titles: Players deal three piles of 15 location cards from a deck of roughly 200 cards (naming locations related to Hamburg for this edition), then place an interlude card between each set of piles to make a deck of 45 cards. One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn, a player draws a location card &amp;ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &amp;ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how he/she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is L&amp;uuml;neburg west or east of Blankenese? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &amp;ndash; and the card placed wrongly &amp;ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After fifteen cards have been placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
