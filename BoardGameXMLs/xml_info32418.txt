							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Junk</name>
									
			<description>Junk is a parody of Battletech-style wargames, with a strong 'redneck' theme throughout the rules and artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; A Game of Mechanized Combat in a Not-So-Intelligent Future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junk is a twisted interpretation of the classic mecha theme. In Junk, players pilot giant robotic fighting machines called 'Cans, made from scavenged materials and jury-rigged weapons, and powered by engines that run on beer. They are unreliable, dangerous machines that nevertheless are the kings of the battlefield on the junkyard planet of Joisey. It is a world were life is short and harsh. A world where beer is worth it's weight in gold. A world where pretentious game hype is mocked and trodden underfoot. A world where only the strong survive. You know, sorta like the Bronx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes rules for 'Cans, vehicles, and rednecks on foot, as well as a campaign system to tie it all together. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
