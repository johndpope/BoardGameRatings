							<name  sortindex="1">Protocol Prime Game Series 34: The Scarecrow</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Scarecrow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scarecrow is a story roleplaying game about isolation and superstition. Characters are children living in rural America all dealing with a local &amp;lsquo;legend&amp;rsquo; about a Scarecrow, who may or may not be real. Based on the Cropsey myth on Staten Island or the Slender Man from the internet, this game plays upon misguided fears and preconceptions, creating an environment that is both unstable and comforting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
