			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;ステータス (STATUS) is a Japanese word deduction game which uses a radar chart. Radar charts are a familiar way in Japan to show information on things like products or people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, some of the players are known as 'Parents' and write down hidden answers they others are seeking to discover.  The other players are 'Respondents' try to get information from the Parents based on cards they have in their hand. The Respondents ask questions, and the Parents plot their responses on the radar chart on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game begins, Clue Cards are placed around the five axes of the radar chart, with each Clue Card have different words on them. Pins are applied to select one clue word on each axis. The clue words are adjectives or nouns such as thickness, money, size, drink, technique, weight, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this way, the Respondents try to derive the hidden word form the strengths of clues on the chart. The publisher's site includes images of a completed chart where the hidden word is related to food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was a sell out at the Tokyo Game Market in 2017 and has now been re-issued and can be bought through the publisher's online shop. The contents include a game board, 53 hint cards, 10 pins, re-usable marker pens, a cleaner cloth and other components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
