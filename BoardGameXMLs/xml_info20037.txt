			<description>This is another roll-and-move election game. Components include cards for Votes, Contributions and Expenditures as well as cash (Campaign Checks) and a pair of +/- dice (3+ and 3- on each). Players start with 200 votes and $1,000 cash and roll for move order. First mover is the incumbent and rolls the +/- dice, winning or losing 100 votes. Players move around the track, getting or receiving money and winning, losing or breaking even on votes. The spaces that grant votes are sometimes optional usually require rolling the +/- dice to bet against the house or another player, with 2+ being a win, 2- a loss and 1/1 breaking even. Winner is the player to accumulate the most votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
