			<description>A simple roll and move game where players travel race from the earth to the moon. &lt;br/&gt;Players choose their course by the roll of the dice, with 1 and 2 travelling along a black path, 5 and 6 along a red path and 3 and 4 along a yellow path. Along the way various challenges are encountered such as faulty air supply in the rocket or not enough acceleration to leave earth and penalties are applied.&lt;br/&gt;Players pass through the constellations on route to the moon and landing on certain numbers assists or hinders the players progress. &lt;br/&gt;Landing on the moon is accomplished by throwing a 6 on the dice. First to land on the moon is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;The game was published by the Fritz Homann A.G company of Germany who produced a few board games to promote their Fri-Ho-Di margarine brand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
