							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure: Casket of Beauty</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small wooden chest is exquisitely made from the finest wood, with not a seam showing. The delicate hands of a gentlewoman could carry it easily, yet it looks large enough to hold most of a lady&amp;rsquo;s personal effects. You open the top slowly. The first thing that catches your eye is what appears to be an emerald, set atop a band of silver. It&amp;rsquo;s nestled in a fine lace-trimmed handkerchief, delicate fabric gleaming white in the light of your candle. And taking up half the small chest you see a silk pouch. Trying to untie the knotted strings, you hear the distinct clink of coin against coin. The bag falls open, and gold gleams before you! At least one hundred pieces! Your heart beats faster, but something even more wondrous catches your eye. Reflected in a small mirror under the lid is a gorgeous creature. Is that. . . you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the casket of beauty a blessing, or a curse?  It's all in your point of view.  Or perhaps, your point of possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
