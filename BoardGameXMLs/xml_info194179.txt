			<description>Making History - The Great War is a turn based strategy game of global war set in the volatile period of the early 20th century. As leader of your nation you have the power to choose your path and alter the course of history. Can you conquer and hold a global empire? The world&amp;rsquo;s people will not be subjugated willingly, and how you govern your conquests will determine your fate. For while today&amp;rsquo;s victory may increase the lands and people you control, it can sow the seeds for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s unrest, instability and, ultimately, collapse. Skillful management of your economic resources will be required - failing to invest in technology and arms can be fatal, but overspending may lead to a collapse in government support and widespread rebellion. Victory also calls for careful diplomacy. Will you be able to entice key nations to join your alliance before they ally against you? Ideology matters less than national interest in this time period, so be ready to negotiate with, threaten, and undermine other leaders to get what you want. A new era is looming on the horizon as the fate of empires unfolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
