			<description>from Game Cabinet rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the same board and pieces as for International Chess (also known as English Chess or Western Chess).&lt;br/&gt;Start with an empty board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One side starts first on any square, after which play continues in turn. A player cannot pass his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A legal move consists of one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;placing one's own piece on an unoccupied square. The color of the square is immaterial. &lt;br/&gt;moving a piece as per the International Chess rules with the exception of pawns. A pawn piece moves and captures like a King piece, that is one step in any direction. No promotion when a pawn reaches an edge of the board. &lt;br/&gt;capturing an opponent's piece by moving one's own piece to that square. &lt;br/&gt;The side who first captures all the opponent's pieces wins the game. If neither side can capture all the other side's pieces, and both sides agree to a draw then it is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other possible variations: The size of the board, the number or types of pieces can be different from the International Chess set. To play handicap games, players can take unequal number of pieces or can start with initial placement of pieces such as pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
