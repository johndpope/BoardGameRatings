							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winter Court: Kyuden Asako</name>
									
			<description>Third volume of the Winter Court series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The third Winter Court sourcebook for the L5R RPG brings the story firmly into the turmoil of the Clan War. Set in the lands of the Phoenix, it details the madness which overtakes Asako Oyo, causing the other clans to look more closely at the agenda of the Henshin; meanwhile, the ancient evil bound by the Black Scrolls comes ever nearer to its release. Like the other Winter Court books, Winter Court: Kyuden Asako also supplies a wealth of information about Rokugani society, including gempukku ceremonies, castles, and the Seppun shugenja school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;The snows fall again and Rokugan's nobility gathers once more for the Emperor's Winter Court. But this time, honor and diplomacy hold higher stakes than ever. War has swept across Rokugan, shattering the fragile peace which has held since the Scorpion coup. The Lion grow more aggressive by the day, while the Crane struggle to defend themselves and the Phoenix watch warily for signs of attack. The Crab Clan's absence spawns fresh rumors daily, and whispers abound of dark pacts that will guarantee them victory on the battlefield. In this highly-charged atmosphere, when mortal foes and shaky allies gather under the pretext of civility, a single word can change the course of history. Diplomacy is taxed to the limit as news from the battlefield slowly trickles in, and the knives which once lay concealed behind pretty lies now come gleaming into the open. The negotiations which take place here could bring victory to any side...or plunge the empire into an eternity of darkness. Welcome to the Winter Court. We hope it's not your last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter Court contains a complete update on the world of Legend of the Five Rings, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New shugenja schools, including the mysterious Tejina illusions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Strongholds and fortresses in Rokugan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A complete historical update, new skills and nemuranai, astrological events, tips on being properly offensive, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully compatible with the Second Edition L5R RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
