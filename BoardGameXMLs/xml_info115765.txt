			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Eesti Laulude M&amp;auml;ng&amp;quot; (The game of Estonian songs) is a board game for ages 12+, although we are sure, that even a younger players can handle the game and find answers the adults cannot. So, one might say, that the game is meant for all ages just like the differential Estonian music. The can be played alone and as a team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you need to answer six different questions. Players move around the board according to the track drawn there and answering the questions according to the space they are standing on. Important thing is to keep a fun and happy attitude and even sing along with the songs. When a player suddenly finds themselves on  Rock board on a Pirate space, the player must give up one card he had already won. The reason this game has a Pirate space is because in real life a lot of music is stolen as well, so hopefully this space has a small motivational purpose as not to steal music. We are sorry! The Pirate space will not affect a player who already has 6 cards. When players finds himself on a corner, then he can choose the category. You need to collect 6 different colored cards, this is how you win the golden record. &lt;br/&gt;To win the game, you need to stand on one of the finish squares and the player to the left ask one question and this time you need to sing the answer. Get it right, and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
