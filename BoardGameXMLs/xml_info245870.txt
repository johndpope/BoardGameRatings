							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hedgehog Hustle</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s dusk in the meadows and the owl is on the prowl.  Mama Hedgehog is calling all her children home before the owl arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw a card and look at the number of balls: you have that many chances to forage for the food needed on the card.  Check your targets and bounce your hedgehogs into the correct pockets on the board.  Have any balls left?  Try and win the game automatically by hitting the owl out of the sky with a perfect shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win if there are 6 food icons facing up.  Players lose if there are 8 Owl icons facing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
