			<description>This is a one card mini expansion which was included in the White Wind game Rainbows to promote their games Tricks and Phantoms of the Ice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion consists of a new goalie named Tricks and a rules card. Tricks has a value of &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; but can foretell the defeat of his team. If he is right, the losing team wins the game, if he is wrong, he must be discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
