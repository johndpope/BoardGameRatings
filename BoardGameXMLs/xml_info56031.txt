							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classic Dinner Party:  Dine with William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway</name>
									
			<description>A dinner party for 8 people intending to recreate a setting similar to one in Shakespeare's time.  This only slightly qualifies as a game as the box includes a small set of trivia cards to play with during the dinner.  It is intended more as a fun dinner with a theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;This box contains the ingredients for a unique and historic dining experience. You and your guests can travel back in time, taste the flavours, discover the story and become part of one very special moment in European history.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 48 trivia cards to divide amongst two teams after the meal.  The team with the most correct answers wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
