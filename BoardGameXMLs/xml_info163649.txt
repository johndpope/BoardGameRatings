			<description>&amp;quot;Step right up ladies and gents and witness the eighth wonder of the world! Flip Florey's Flying Flea-rina! These special Argentinian fleas have been trained in the arts of martial combat and acrobatics for your entertainment and edification!  Watch them perform amazing acts of aerialist acumen. See them fight and spar as the ancient gladiators of lore. Experience a singular event of epic and microscopic proportions. Flip Florey's Flying Flea-rina will amaze and astound you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Flea-rina, the players compete with their fleas to perform amazing stunts while making glorious attacks against each other. Each turn, the players select a stunt with a movement path. They then roll dice trying to match the icons on the stunt. Completing the stunt reaps victory points by entertaining the crowd. If they fail to complete the stunt they may still move along the path up to the icons rolled and may collect resources off the board and/or attack the other fleas. Fighting fleas also entertain the the crowd, gaining victory points with gladiatorial skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players have depleted all the resources on the board or when one flea has been defeated, the game is over and the player who has entertained the crowd the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
