			<description>Salomo 3000 is a Bible trivia game. The name refers not only to the 3000 questions included but also the 3000 proverbs that are said to have come from King Solomon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are divided in seven categories. The players are first dealt random category cards. They may keep a part of the cards and exchange the rest with other players. The cards then determine the asked questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect pearls into their crowns. Two correct answers in a row gives a pearl. However, in the crown category single correct answer is worth a pearl. First one to collect seven pearls wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Salomo Junior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
