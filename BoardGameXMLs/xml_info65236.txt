			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of middle school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be played on a large table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. The Spanish forces consist of 46 figures and the American forces consist of 134 figures. Terrain features and obstacles include hills, trench lines, barbed wire, and a blockhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical background, from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1898 the US battleship Maine exploded while docked in Cuba. Blame immediately fell on Spain, which was trying to put down a revolt on the island. A short time later, the Spanish American War had begun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The most famous land battle in this short conflict occurred at San Juan Hill. Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders were among those that gained fame by storming the Spanish trenches on the hills surrounding the city of Santiago. The African American cavalry troopers known as the 'Buffalo Soldiers' also fought bravely in this battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
