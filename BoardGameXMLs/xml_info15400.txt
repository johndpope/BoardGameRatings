			<description>This game has a series of 5 different games for players of varying ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Like its predecessor, GOOD OLD HOUSES, this game focuses player attention on specific architectural details and on the stylistic variety of historic buildings.  MAIN STREET, however, brings attention to downtown buildings, structures which, in the hustle and bustle of commercial life, escape the notice of even frequent passers-by.  Our illustrations show each style with its original storefront, but because storefronts are periodically remodeled, one is lucky to find historic storefronts intact.  MAIN STREET players will find themselves looking at the upper levels of commercial buildings to recognize styles they have learned in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The range of styles in MAIN STREET from Federal to Art Deco/Modern, isn't intended to encompass the breadth of American Architectural history, but to represent some basic styles often used in commercial buildings between the late eighteenth and mid-twentieth centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eight building puzzles (nine pieces per puzzle) are used in five different games for 1 to 8 players Ages 5 and up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
