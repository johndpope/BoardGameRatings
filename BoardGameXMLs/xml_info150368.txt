							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Kings World Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khitus is a world in decline. New heroes must emerge to challenge the wicked before all is lost &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benevolent Dragon Kings who ruled over Khitus have inexplicably vanished, leaving once-powerful nations at the mercy of foul creatures. Cold Skins and Krikis grow numerous and bold. Desperate cities of the Old Countries struggle against savage marauders who draw ever closer to their crumbling walls. Ancient wizard schools guard their tomes, essential to their dark sorcerous bargains, more jealously than ever, while the followers of a mysterious prophet rekindle the magic-that-is-not-magic. The essential materials of life and civilization are ruthlessly plundered by the mysterious Pretenders in their Black Fortress, leaving the southern lands, especially, in dire straits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers must face the wrath of a violent world, not only to survive but to right these wrongs, protect the innocent, discover the fate of the Dragon Kings, and reintroduce some semblance of justice to a world on the brink of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Kings is a new fantasy game setting conceived and presented in fiction, art, and music simultaneously. Written by Timothy B. Brown (creator of Dark Sun and 2300AD), Dragon Kings is the spiritual successor to the popular fantasy setting, Dark Sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Kings includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &amp;middot; A hardbound game book&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; A progressive rock CD&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; An art-intensive, concert-style book that expands heavily on each song (with lyrics, stories, maps, more art, and so on)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the PDF available in March 2014, and a planned hardcopy shipping date of June 2014, the game book is rules-agnostic, with PDF supplements for different game systems (Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, FATE, and 13th Age).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each song on the Dragon Kings progressive rock epic album follows our hero's life from his desperate stand against mercenary raiders to his enslavement on the mighty caravans and his subsequent escape and encounter with an ancient, gentle folk who impart mysterious truths about Khitus, the world of the Dragon Kings&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every song has its own two-page spread in the album book, expanding upon the material and bringing it to life. Contributors include Timothy Brown, Mike Stone (formerly of Queensryche), Mark Stevens, and Frank Klepaki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s Dragon Kings: a fantasy world envisioned and created in fiction, art, and music all at once!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
