							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Masunagi Ito</name>
									
			<description>Little is known of Itsunagi Ito&amp;rsquo;s enforcer. The &amp;ldquo;Red Death&amp;rdquo; as he is known in Okyo, named so for the mask that never leaves his face. Some whisper that Orochi&amp;rsquo;s gift has warped and distorted his face. What is clear is that his mind is definitely twisted. The apparent satisfaction he makes from cleaving his foes in half, or the calmness in battle reflects the actions of one who is teetering close to madness. Rumours and conjecture aside what is undisputable is that Masunagi Ito is a fearsome and brutal warrior on the field of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
