							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blessed Ladies of Law</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blessed Ladies of Law presents three new completely open game content deities of law that can be dropped into virtually any d20-style campaign setting. This trinity of goddesses often simultaneously find themselves on the same side, while being at odds with each other. All three believe that laws are meant for the betterment of society, and that people are better off following the law. Also, all three believe those impacted by those who break the law should be protected and have a right to seek amends from those that wronged them. However, it is in how they handle wrongdoing that they differ. Calana, goddess of Justice, seeks to insure fairness in trial but also uphold the punishments administered by the courts. Dalana, goddess of Vengeance, tracks down those who have avoided punishment or who, in her opinion, were not punished enough. Finally, Elana, goddess of Mercy, seeks to rehabilitate wrongdoers so that they can become productive members of society.&lt;br/&gt;Use these goddesses singularly or as a group, depending on your campaigns needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
