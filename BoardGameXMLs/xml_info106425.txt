							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">East India Company: Privateer</name>
									
			<description>Fans of East India Company will get the chance to experience the darker side of naval trading and combat with the upcoming expansion, East India Company: Privateer. Players will get to take on the role of a ruthless seafaring privateer, motivated solely by a thirst for fortune and holding allegiance only to those who will pay for their services.&lt;br/&gt;Players will operate their own fleets, commanded by merchant or privateer captains, with the goal of accumulating as much wealth as possible and by any means necessary. Though it offers a limited&lt;br/&gt;timeframe, Privateer is more mission-oriented than the original game, as players free of allegiances can embark upon such missions as smuggling, blockading ports, and hunting down ships bearing diplomatic envoys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
