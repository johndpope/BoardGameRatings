							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Der schiefe Turm von Pizza</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build the leaning tower of pizza!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect the pizzas and put them, one on top of the other, to build the leaning tower. Be the first to deliver the order. The higher the tower, the more points you get. But be careful not to make the tower crash ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 80 wooden &amp;quot;pizzas&amp;quot;, the order-cards and the scorecard. Turn by turn the players collect pizzas until an order can be completed by putting the pizzas on top of one of the towers. The higher the better, but once the tower crashes down, you loose your score, so be careful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The leaning tower of pizza&amp;quot; is a fun and thrilling game of skills for kids and grown-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
