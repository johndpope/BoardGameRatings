			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lars held his sword high and watched the eight horsemen dancing their mounts back and forth around an invisible circle surrounding the blade. The men were visibly nervous, the horses more so. The one in chain mail, probably a knight, calmed his horse and spoke.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Stop what you're doing, wizard, and surrender, and I give you my word you'll come to no harm.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;And if I don't?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We'll see if an archer can defeat your spell.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Lars cursed softly and sheathed the sword. The soldiers breathed a small sigh of relief, their supernatural fear replaced by a natural one. He might still have other magicks.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Throw the sword down,&amp;quot; the knight ordered.&lt;br/&gt;Shrugging, Lars unbuckled his baldric and tossed it to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Get that,&amp;quot; the knight said, pointing to one of his riders. &amp;quot;It is safe, wizard?&amp;quot; he added when the man balked.&lt;br/&gt;Lars simply smiled as the soldier dismounted and slowly approached the enchanted weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Well?&amp;quot; the knight demanded.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's safe enough,&amp;quot; Lars replied at last.&lt;br/&gt;As the man reached for the weapon, he shot the mage a look of rage and fear....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Earth offers a new way of viewing magic and mages. Mages have access to enormous power, but face great limitations as well. A mage has a different outlook on life, adventuring, and conflict than a normal man does. This difference adds an extra element of role-playing to being a mage in the world of Fantasy Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic is designed to fit smoothly into the world, to be consistent with the sort of low fantasy role-playing for which Fantasy Earth is designed. The life of the average man is largely untouched by magic. However, beware the unknown wizard, for his power is unpredictable and his potential immense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains:&lt;br/&gt;- Three different styles of magic, each giving a different feel to the characters who use them and the&lt;br/&gt;world as a whole&lt;br/&gt;- Over 100 pages of ready-to-use spells, plus rules for making up your own&lt;br/&gt;- Complete information on creating magic items&lt;br/&gt;- Rules for magical colleges and religious organizations and their benefits for members&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
