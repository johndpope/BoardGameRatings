							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walpurgisnacht</name>
									
			<description>2 - 4 young witches are trying to join the party of the elder witches for Walpurgisnacht (a kind of witches night in German tradition). For this, they have to reach certain points on the game board as fast as possible and thus score points. Some animals which can be moved by each player block the path, event cards can gain or lose points. &lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by movement cards (numbered 1-6) that each player holds. The players can pick either of the cards they still hold. The player with most points after all movement cards have been played is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
