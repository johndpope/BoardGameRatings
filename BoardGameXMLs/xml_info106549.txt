			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Rangers Zeo: Battle Racers is a racing video game featuring the cast of the Power Rangers Zeo TV show. The game was developed by Natsume and published by Bandai for the Super Nintendo in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features eight racers and one secret racer. There are sixteen racing tracks and six battle tracks included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the racers in the game has their own stats for speed, grip, and acceleration. The racers use one of either a car, motorcycle, or hoverbike. Rather than picking up power ups, each character has his or her own blaster with a power range and set amount of ammo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main game modes: a single player and two player mode where the player attempts to finish in first place on every track, and a two player battle mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
