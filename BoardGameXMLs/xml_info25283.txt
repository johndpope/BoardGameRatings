			<description>Of&amp;ouml;rberedd (&amp;quot;unprepared&amp;quot;) is a Swedish trivia game, but not quite like most trivia games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get through high school, get a doctorate, and finally win by becoming a professor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player is still a student, his examiner (the next player) draws a card and reads a subject from that. The subject is something like &amp;quot;Name a city by the river ....&amp;quot;. The examiner reads the question and fills in the blank with something of his own choosing. If the student can answer, he gets a diploma in that subject (there are four different subjects). If the student can't answer, the examiner must answer the question. If he can't, he gets a warning. Otherwise, the student gets the warning. The rest of the players are arbiters in the case of disputes as to what is the correct answer to a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After collecting three diplomas, the player is finished with high school and can now start working on his doctorate. To achieve that, he must get a diploma in each of the four subjects. Once he has that, he must also hold a lecture. To get the subject of his lecture, the player arranges his diplomas in a certain order and reads the sentence that this creates (if he has more than one diploma in a subject he may choose which one to use). This will result in a subject like &amp;quot;The bad influence / of movies / upon art / in troubled times.&amp;quot; The student must now keep a two-minute lecture on this subject. If there are no obvious errors in his lecture, he gets his doctorate. To become a professor, the doctor must get another diploma in each subject and hold another lecture over a given subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt; - 48 student question cards&lt;br/&gt; - 16 doctor question cards&lt;br/&gt; - 12 warning cards&lt;br/&gt; - 64 diplomas&lt;br/&gt; - 6 &amp;quot;finished high school&amp;quot; counters (student's cap)&lt;br/&gt; - 6 &amp;quot;become a doctor&amp;quot; counters (doctor's hat)&lt;br/&gt; - 1 &amp;quot;become a professor&amp;quot; counter (laurel)&lt;br/&gt; - Rules booklet&lt;br/&gt; - Booklet with explanations of questions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
