			<description>Der kleine Verkehrsprofi (the little traffic expert) is an educational game by Ravensburger. From the rulebooks introductory text: With luck and skill the goal of this smart and at the same time educational game is to get the most traffic sign tiles. By playing the children learn to know the most important traffic signs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a wooden playing piece (child) moving around the gameboard. There is only one pawn for all of the players. Before the game begins all tiles are put face back on the game board. The game board then is covered by tiles with the exception of the middle spot which is the pawns starting point. The tiles depict traffic signs and come in pairs, e.g. one pair consisting of a tile for green traffic light and a tile for red light. The tile back depicts both versions green and red, the tile front only one. Players move the common playing piece around by rolling a die. When the child moves to a space where a tile is they first have to guess which picture is on the tiles front side. Two possibilities are pictured on the tile back. Upon a correct guess the player whose turn it is also has to tell the meaning of this traffic sign. If both are correct the player can keep the tile and roll again. If not correct it is the next players turn. The game ends when all tiles are taken. The player with the most tiles in his/her possession wins. &lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a sheet with all traffic signs in the game and what they mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
