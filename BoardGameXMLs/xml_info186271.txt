							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Felix The Cat&#039;s Dandy Candy Game</name>
									
			<description>Players choose one of the Cowboy/Cowgirl character disks that have been punched out of the insert. Game also includes 12 orange slice disks and a punch out spinner with an inner and outer ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin on the Starting House and move forward by the number of spaces on the outer ring of the spinner. When a player lands on an orange slice space, they receive an orange slice piece and spin again, this time using the inner ring of the spinner. Players continue until someone reaches the Candy House. The first player in the Candy House gets 2 orange slices. The player who has the most orange slices at this point, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other side of the board is a checkerboard, and black and red checkers can be punched out of the insert, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
