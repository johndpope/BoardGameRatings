			<description>Adapted from IF Wiki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are an Enchanter, that is, a magic user, carrying your spell book, a silver coin, and a magic burin. You don't quite remember how you arrived outside this ramshackle hut, but you think it has something to do with your colleague Helistar, another Enchanter who was investigating some dark magic and hasn't been seen lately. You're rather vague on the details. Perhaps you should explore and see what you can discover.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in Zork, this unofficial sequel to the Enchanter trilogy reincorporates the basic magic system from Enchanter, including some of the more common spells and the featureless white cubes first seen in Spellbreaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game's primary purpose is to demonstrate the Inform language's versatility. As a result, it has been re-released in several editions to highlight new features of the language. In particular, Release 3 is a significant modernized version of the game with an adaptive hints system (provided using a library by Mike Phillips). The game was ported to Inform 6 with Release 4, and to Glulx -- with graphical, GUI enhancements -- in Release 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
