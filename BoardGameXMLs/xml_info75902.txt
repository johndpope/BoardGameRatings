			<description>The Orange Box is a video game compilation for Microsoft Windows, the Xbox 360, Mac OS X and the PlayStation 3. Valve has also released a soundtrack containing music from the games within the compilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The compilation contains five games (four in the Japanese release), all powered by Valve's Source engine. Two of the games included, Half-Life 2 and its first stand-alone expansion, Episode One, were previously released as separate products. Three new games are also contained within the compilation: the second stand-alone expansion, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the puzzle game Portal (not included in the Japanese release), and Team Fortress 2, the multiplayer game sequel to the Quake modification, Team Fortress. A separate product entitled The Black Box was planned, which would have included only the new games, but was canceled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orange Box has received critical acclaim and Portal was recognized as a surprise favorite of the package. The PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box has been noted for several technical shortcomings that were not present in the other versions, which were later fixed through various patches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Orange Box&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
