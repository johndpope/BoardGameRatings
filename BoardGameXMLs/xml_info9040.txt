			<description>&amp;quot;If we do not stop retreating, we shall be left without bread, without fuel, without metal, without raw materials, without factories, without railways.&amp;quot; [Stavka Order No. 227, July 28, 1942]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stalingrad: Pivot on the Volga is a two-player game about the military drama that unfolded in southern Russia during the last half of 1942, culminating with the surrender of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad on February 2, 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes on the role of the collective Axis theater commanders, chafing under the Fuhrers directives and orders embodied in the game's victory conditions. His opponent takes on the role of their Soviet counterparts, struggling to turn the tide after a year of catastrophic losses, fortunate enough to have a commander (Stalin) who allows more operational freedom, but who does not tolerate defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 11 x 17&amp;quot; map covers the Southern Russia at 55 km per hex. The 280 counters represent the German and Soviet troops at a divisional/corp/army level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
