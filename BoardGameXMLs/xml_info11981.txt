			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evenly matched opposing squadrons meet on the high seas during World War Two. YOU are the &amp;ldquo;admiral&amp;rdquo; in command of one of the squadrons. This is a relatively simple introductory-level game of luck and skill that is based on World War II naval surface actions and is suitable for play by two or four players. Playing time is normally less than one hour and is suitable for play by ages twelve (children as young as eight can grasp and play the game if it is explained to them) and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opposing players initially each select a squadron of ships to command. If there are four players, each may command a separate squadron and there will be two players per side operating together as a team. BATTLESHIPS IN ACTION is played in Game Turns. Each side moves their ships and conducts all firing and torpedo attacks during an appropriate phase of a Game Turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
