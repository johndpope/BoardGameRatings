			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right. Wrong. I'm the One with the Gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge John Warden, a tough sentencer and enemy of organized crime, was made an example of when he sent several heads of mafia clans to prison for the maximum time. His family was slaughtered in front of him, and he was beaten, tossed in the river, and left for dead. When he emerged from the waters, consumed with bitterness and rage, he soon became something criminals began to fear. He became the final Judgement (PL 9)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
