			<description>A simple racing game for two players. Movement is determined by a six-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a board (showing a 37-space racing track), 4 player tokens and a die. Both players try to get their soapbox derby racer (i.e. one of their two player tokens) to the finish line first. Players take turns rolling the die. The player's first token (the racer) is moved according to the result of the die roll. If the racer lands on a stop space, the player has to send his/her mechanic (= the second token) the following turns. Only when the mechanic has reached the racer, the racer can move on. The mechanic stays on the stop space until the racer lands on another stop space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose racer reaches the finish line first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
