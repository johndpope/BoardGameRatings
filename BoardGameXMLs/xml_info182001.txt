			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;cadaver draconis; n. Being a nutritious if slightly stale miscellany of entirely unofficial and discarded addenda for the Dragon Warriors RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems like aeons have passed since Magnum Opus Press first breathed life into the revised version of the Dragon Warriors RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later in the Magnum Opus print run, a concept took form, of a mystical tome that would be known as the Players Book or Legends, which would enhance and revise significant aspects of the Dragon Warriors RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not that book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, this book is mostly comprised of an almost fully-written core component from early drafts of the Players Book. Over time, this material was replaced with even more cool stuff, and it eventually found it's [sic] way to the proverbial cutting room floor at Dragon Warriors HQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the Dragon Warriors Players Guide - as it was named when printed by Serpent King Games - was eventually published without the considerably lengthy Paths mechanic and evocative flavour text. In addition, a small selection of later rules and background material were also dropped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this cut material has not been lost or forgotten, basically because in our humble opinion it is pretty darn good. Good enough, in fact, to justify publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is dedicated to all those Dragon Warriors fans who waited ever-so-patiently for the long overdue printing of the Dragon Warriors Players Guide - this book is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long may your Dragon Warriors prosper!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
