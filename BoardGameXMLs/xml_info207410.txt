							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Wushu Guide to the Matrix</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've been running games set in the world of &amp;quot;The Matrix&amp;quot; since shortly after the first movie opened. The setting lends itself well to one-shot, mission-based games, just jack in, kick ass, and run like Hell for an exit! It's popular with new gamers, since they're already familiar with the movie&amp;rsquo;s background and style. My Wushu rules system fits The Matrix like a glove because it's easy to learn, fast to play, and expertly mimics the movie's anime-inspired style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This role-playing guide explains how the Matrix works (as I see it), gives advice on running Matrix games, and includes the complete Wushu rules system. What it does not contain is information on the &amp;quot;real world.&amp;quot; Every Matrix game I've run has opened with the PCs loading up and ended when they hit an exit. The format works great and, quite frankly, there's not much detail on the real world to be found in the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item presents the rather novel idea of using the Wushu Open cinematic game style and rules to run &amp;quot;in the Matrix&amp;quot; segments of a campaign and using &amp;quot;a more realistic set of rules&amp;quot; like Shadowrun or Alternity for the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; segments of a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
