							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thrill Drive 3</name>
									
			<description>Thrill Drive 3 is a street racing sim arcade game released by Konami in 2005. It is the sequel to Thrill Drive and Thrill Drive 2, released in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the previous titles, the game still lets you choose from an assortment of vehicles including a bus and an oil rig, and lets you race around the United States, Japan, or Europe, but also lets you race under certain situations such as fog or night. Also, the object--like the previous titles--is to cross the finish line first without hitting any obstacles, running into any police cars or causing any accidents. As always, when the player crashes his or her car, he or she still receives the &amp;quot;cracked windshield&amp;quot; sequence, but this time there are different camera angles of the crash. New notable features in this game include a new seatbelt function, as you are required in this game to wear one to feel the impact of the crash, and driving your car to several shops, which include, but are not limited to the following (you have to drive to a certain station on the course):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Car dealer: You can trade the car you selected at the beginning of the game for another.&lt;br/&gt;    * Repair factory: After you have crashed your car too many times, you can bring it here to repair damage.&lt;br/&gt;    * Parts shop: You can tune up your car here.&lt;br/&gt;    * Car wash: Works the same way as the &amp;quot;Repair factory&amp;quot;, except any dirt or any other items on the car can be washed off.&lt;br/&gt;    * Garage: Like a checkpoint that awards extra fuel (in this game, the clock acts like a fuel tank), you can use this to refuel your current vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;    * &amp;quot;Burger Bar&amp;quot;: You can re-boost your energy after driving for a long period of time in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the previous titles, when you finish a race, the computer will tally your driving technique in six areas, how many obstacles you hit, and how much dollars in damage you caused--and, as always, hitting too many obstacles will cause the rank to suffer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Thrill Drive 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
