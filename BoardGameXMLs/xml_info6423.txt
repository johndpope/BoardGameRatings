							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tocce</name>
									
			<description>Tocce is a game designed by one of the Crokinole board manufacturers which uses Crokinole disks and any table top.  The title is a shortened form of table top Bocce, and like Bocce, the object is to get your disks closest to the target disk.  It's a 2 or 4 player (in partnerships) game, with sides taking turns flicking a disk toward the target in the center of the table.  Included in the game are the rules for Squayls, a similar game with slightly different scoring rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
