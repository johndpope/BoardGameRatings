			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Skirmish between two feuding Scottish Highland Clans. Abstract skirmish level combat. Each figure represents a single man (unit). Victory: You win if you kill 6 or more opposing units.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the units. Each side starts with sixteen units: a Chieftain, five Champions, and ten Clansmen. A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the shared deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
