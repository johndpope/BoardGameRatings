			<description>A Diplomacy variant based on Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s Lord of the Rings.  The game uses the basic mechanic of the original Diplomacy game.  Players control armies on a map divided into areas.  Some areas contain supply centers, the control of which, allows the player to build another army.  Players write their moves secretly, either moving into an area or supporting another unit.  Players may support the move of an another player.  The object is to control the majority of supply centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some significant differences that set it apart from the orginal.  The topology is a map of Middle Earth, with Arnor, Rohon, Mordor, Rhovanion, and Gondor, being the &amp;quot;nations&amp;quot; represented.  Mordor begins the game much stronger than the other nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to armies there are double armies and triple armies which attack at double and strength but are supplied at single strength.  The ring is special piece that can be held, worn, or transferred by an army.  If worn, it will increase the army&amp;rsquo;s strength (SA to DA, DA to TA, etc.) and will affect victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
