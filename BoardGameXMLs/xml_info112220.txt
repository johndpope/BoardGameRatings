			<description>Game designed to let children test their powers of the German language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dealt out evenly (any number can play). In a turn, a player must ask another player to answer correctly the top card in one of three categories; Words that end in g or ch? Words that end in g or k? Words that end in s or z?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player answers with the correct spelling ending, he puts the card to his right. If he gets it wrong, it goes to his left. If a player runs out of cards, he must pick up all the cards to his left and play on. The game ends when one player has all his cards to the right and none in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
