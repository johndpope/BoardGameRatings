			<description>Zone Twelve is a dice game for 3-6 players with some elements of gambling and lots of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of 5 rounds plus one bonus round. One game takes about 15 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn a player rolls the three dice and tries to get the dice to add up to 12. Two of the dice are 0-5 (one side is labeled &amp;quot;Zone&amp;quot;) while the other die is 2-5 with a side labeled &amp;quot;Zone Wild&amp;quot;, which can be any number 0-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the bonus round, each player rolls a green die and wins or loses chips based on an earlier bet. This die has special sides of W, W 1/2, L, L 1/2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players count up their chip totals. The instructions state that 4 games should be played and the person with the highest cumulative chip total be declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
