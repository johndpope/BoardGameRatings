			<description>A dexterity game for 2 or more players.                                      &lt;br/&gt;Plays in 10 minutes with 6 players.      &lt;br/&gt;For ages 6 and up .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Snapps there are 6 blocks and a 8cm&amp;times;8cm square board and all you have to do is place the blocks onto the board&amp;hellip; simple. &lt;br/&gt;Well, yes and no: You see, the blocks have magnets in them, and you must place the blocks without making any of them snap together. The first few blocks will be easy to place but as more blocks get placed, the available space on the board dwindles, and it becomes rather tricky to place the last blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all the blocks get placed on the board, the game enters a second phase, in which players must take turns to push a block towards the centre of the board. At some point the blocks will suddenly snap together, and the player taking their turn at the time is eliminated. Eliminate all your opponents to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge about the physics of magnetism is not essential; what you need are a steady hand and nerves of steel, because those snapping blocks will make you jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schnapps is the adult variant, in which the player who makes the blocks snap together must drink a shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
