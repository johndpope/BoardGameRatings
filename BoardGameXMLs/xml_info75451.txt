							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystery Science Theater 3000 Presents &quot;Detective&quot;</name>
									
			<description>From IF Wiki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by C.E. Forman. Ported by Graeme Cree. IF Comp 1995: 4th of 6 entries in the Inform division. Later updated in 2000 by Stuart Moore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interactive MSTing of Detective (Matt Barringer; 1993; AGT). In this game, you are playing Matt Barringer's original Detective, but with the sarcastic commentary of three characters who are watching you play interspersed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is given a quick introduction to Mystery Science Theater and to Detective. Then, we find ourselves on a spaceship where three robots show off their first text-adventures. Are they awful? O yes, but--not as awful as the game we'll be playing the rest of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
