			<description>QuickDraft is a fast tactical card game about drafting the best cards for your hand, maximizing your Victory Points and disrupting your opponents plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach this goal, the players have different card types at their disposal. &lt;br/&gt;There are coloured cards with different victory point values and quantities and there are white cards offering a wide selection of effects - ranging from improving or copying another card to stealing cards from another player and bonus victory points if specific conditions are met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in three phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Drafting Phase the players are selecting a total of nine cards for their hand using a drafting mechanic like in &amp;quot;7 Wonders&amp;quot; or in &amp;quot;Magic: the Gathering&amp;quot; sealed tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Playing Phase the six of the nine cards collected during the first phase are played and the different card effects are resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Counting Phase each player determines how many victory points he has using all the cards he has in front of him (+ eventual bonuses from cards on his hand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most victory points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though QuickDraw is a multiplayer game, there are rules for a solo game included where a single player trys to beat 10 levels of increasing difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One deck of cards (60 playing cards) is enough to accomodate up to 5 players. If however, two decks of cards are combined, up to 10 players can play QuickDraw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In January 2013 the second edition of this game was published by the Gamecrafter. The game now features a new card type - black cards, new card effects on the white cards and offers several new strategies by strengthening the coloured cards.&lt;br/&gt;This new version also includes a Hold'em variant - essentially offering two different games in one small package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
