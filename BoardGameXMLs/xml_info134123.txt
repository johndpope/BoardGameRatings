			<description>The Fair Folk &amp;amp; the Wyrd Sisters: A Tragic Comedy of Love &amp;amp; Death is a &amp;quot;Tabletop LARP for 5-8 Storytellers&amp;quot;, written by Good Idea Games, for Gamechef 2011.&lt;br/&gt;Theme: William Shakespeare. &lt;br/&gt;Ingredients: daughter, exile, nature, forsworn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Fair Folk and the Wyrd Sisters&amp;rdquo; is a storytelling game of Love and Death in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s narrative style. Celebrating the incredible similarities between these genres, players are put into two teams, competing in a battle of wits to bring a mortal Pawn to their ultimate end.&lt;br/&gt;This game can be considered a Tabletop Live Action Role-Playing Game. Play takes place sitting around a table, but the action happens in real time, and the words said by the Players are the same words said by the Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of a mortal Pawn is contested as a coven of dangerous Witches compete against capricious Faeries to bring the Pawn to a tragic or comedic end. Using powers of inimitable illusion and influence, both parties take control of the very fabric of reality to weave a path for the Pawn to follow. Whether they reach a Bitter or Happy end depends on the choices made by the Pawn, and the world woven by the players.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played out over five acts, wherein Witches and Faeries compete to drive the Pawn to a particular End. During each Act, both sides are asked to manipulate the Pawn into completing a number of goals that help drive them toward one end or another.As the story enters the final act, the group that best accomplished their goals will bring the Pawn to a Bitter End, or a Happily Ever-After.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
