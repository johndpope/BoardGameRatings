							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Workshop of the Alchemist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TW1 &amp;ndash; Workshop of the Alchemist is this week&amp;rsquo;s offering in Filbar. An initial level adventure, this scenario has allowed for each PC to have an encounter as they get to the community of Lakedale (offered earlier) to prepare for their career. After successfully getting to the town the new PCs quickly discover a job opportunity pertaining to an overdue shipment from a Gnome Alchemist. Gelbo Green, alchemist, has an agreement with one of the merchants in town and is late on a delivery. Lettice Beauson runs the Purloined Purse and is looking for a group of adventurers to check on him. Time to start your careers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Wagovian Campaign, but is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure, a continuing campaign or just something to do when the rest of the group can&amp;rsquo;t make it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
