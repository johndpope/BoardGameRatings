							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Krosmaster: Arena – Ruel Stroud Promo</name>
									
			<description>Ruel Stroud is a promotional figure for Krosmaster: Arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enutrofs are bounty hunters and treasure diggers. They love nothing else than to find loot. Many adventurers surrounds them, waiting for them to be alerted to the next gold mine. Ruel Stroud is a very well known Enutrof and is a very stingy one. He, however, is a very respectable fighter and welds a gold plated shovel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruel is a mid-range combatant, using his shovel to slam away at his opponent's health. His shovel is also capable of stealing his enemy's movement and passing it onto him, letting him just skirt right outside his melee opponent's reach. If Ruel is used alongside his teammates, who are also promotional characters, he will gain armor, to help keep his fragile old bones safe, and a little extra nimbleness to help him escape his enemies if they get too close to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
