							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mel Allen&#039;s Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>This game uses an 33â…“ LP recorded by New York Yankees announcer Mel Allen to determine the outcomes of baseball plays. Each side of the LP has seven tracks, for use in different game situations. Each track has four interleaved grooves announcing the resulting play, leading to different outcomes based on which groove happens to catch the phonograph needle.  The back of the LP sleeve itself is used as a game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
