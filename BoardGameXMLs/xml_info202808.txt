			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your tribe is an ancient one. It&amp;rsquo;s lineage can be traced back many ages before your parent&amp;rsquo;s parents. Though your tribe is well established it still has no written language. You rely on imagery and visual cues to pass on the history of your people. Your deities live in the sky and watch over you each night ensuring your safety and inspiring your people to do great things. You see them as the origin of your history. The points of light they inhabit form the pictures that are the basis of your beliefs. The stories of your ancestors are recorded in paintings along the walls of caverns which you call home. You and the other Tellers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
