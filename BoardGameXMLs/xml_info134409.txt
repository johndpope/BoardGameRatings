			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This marriage would be wonderful, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for your betrothed. It&amp;rsquo;s not that you don&amp;rsquo;t love them; it&amp;rsquo;s that you don&amp;rsquo;t get along a superficial level, let alone a fundamental level. That is not going to stop you, and it&amp;rsquo;s most certainly not going to ruin the marriage. People cannot change. Not at all. At least, not by themselves. But you can change someone. And you&amp;rsquo;ve taken it upon yourself to change them. &lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t they deserve to be happy, after all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, they think you need changing. Of course, they&amp;rsquo;re just being silly. Why would you change? There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with you. See to it that while you&amp;rsquo;re busy repairing this marriage before it starts, that your betrothed doesn&amp;rsquo;t manipulate you into fulfilling their absurd expectations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and Me is a game about forcing people to suit your wants, needs, and expectations (for their own good, mind you). You and Me is a game about fixing people that you think are broken. You and Me is a game about always being right. You and Me is a game for two players, possibly with an audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
