			<description>From ZX Spectrum instructions&lt;br/&gt;As the commander of a submarine, it's your job to destroy four&lt;br/&gt;convoys, each consisting of a freighter and two destroyers.&lt;br/&gt; Having selected the difficulty level (Captain is easiest, Admiral&lt;br/&gt;is hardest) and the weather conditions (press F if you want fog&lt;br/&gt;to appear), press ENTER to start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game docked on a friendly island. The top third of&lt;br/&gt;the screen shows the view through the periscope, while the bottom&lt;br/&gt;two thirds are taken up with four windows showing various pieces&lt;br/&gt;of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(..)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your first task will be to locate an enemy convoy, indicated on&lt;br/&gt;the map screen. As your sub only has a top speed of 22 mph,&lt;br/&gt;you'll need to make use of the accelerated time feature (which&lt;br/&gt;speeds up the game by about 30 times) to cross the large map area&lt;br/&gt;quickly. Having sighted a convoy, you need to be within 1.5 miles&lt;br/&gt;to be able to hit them with a torpedo. The torpedoes travel twice&lt;br/&gt;as fast as the sub. Alternatively, you could fire a wire-guided&lt;br/&gt;missile, but this is rather harder to control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've attacked, of course, the destroyers will be alerted.&lt;br/&gt;If you're on or near the surface they'll shell you; if you dive,&lt;br/&gt;they'll depth-charge you. Sitting on the sea bed with your&lt;br/&gt;engines off is a good way of fooling them into thinking you've&lt;br/&gt;left the area. However, you need to have enough compressed air&lt;br/&gt;on board to be able to blow the ballast tanks and return to the&lt;br/&gt;surface; if you run out of compressed air, you're stuck.&lt;br/&gt;Compressed air is produced by a compressor attached to the sub's&lt;br/&gt;diesel engine (which also recharges the batteries), but  this can&lt;br/&gt;only be run on the surface. Underwater, you can only use battery&lt;br/&gt;power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You only have a limited amount of ammunition and fuel on board,&lt;br/&gt;so you'll need to return to a dock to rearm and refuel. The map&lt;br/&gt;gives the location and co-ordinates of your two docks. Docking&lt;br/&gt;is quite tricky and needs some practice! (Hint: going in slowly&lt;br/&gt;is a good idea...). You also have a time limit before the four&lt;br/&gt;enemy convoys cross the map and reach their destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
