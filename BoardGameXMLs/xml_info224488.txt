							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malachai Stout&#039;s Family Reunion</name>
									
			<description>Malachai Stout&amp;rsquo;s Family Reunion is intended to be played around a table by eight people (but extra players can be added as investigators). Each of the players will be assigned a character and given a character sheet that explains who or what their character is, what information their character knows, and how their character should respond to events that occur during the game. In this particular Murder-Mystery Mini, the guests will be playing the roles of the largely dysfunctional members of the Stout family, who have gathered at their ancestral home for a family reunion, hosted by the elderly Malachai Stout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
