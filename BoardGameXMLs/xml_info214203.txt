			<description>This game consists of a deck of 15 large cards, each bearing the name, picture and price of an item that might be sold by a wandering peddler, and four decks (cream, orange, red and blue) of 15 small cards, each with a typical farm product and value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes the role of the Yankee Peddler, while the others are farmers. On each turn, the peddler places one of his goods face up, while the farmers each play one of their goods cards. The farmer with the highest value card takes the peddler's item, and the peddler writes down the difference between the value of what he sold and what he accepted as his profit (or loss) on that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play repeats until the cards are exhausted. At that point, the peddler adds up his net profit, while the farmers add up the total value of the goods they have purchased. If the peddler's profit is greater than the total value purchased by any farmer, he wins; otherwise, the farmer with the greatest value of products wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules say that for two players, both are farmers competing for peddler cards as they are turned over. For 5 or 6 players, the farmer cards are distributed equally, but it is suggested that the peddler again be a non-player, as otherwise the peddler will almost certainly win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
