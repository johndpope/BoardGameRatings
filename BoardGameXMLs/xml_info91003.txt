			<description>Die Civilization (DieCiv) is a game about civilization building through the management of resources. Players attempt to win the game through special resource victories, progressing the furthest, or through achievements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single game should take 60 or more minutes to play and requires two to five players. In addition to the included component sheets, you will need 10d6 for the resource dice, and 300 cubes (320 for the espionage variant) to keep track of resources (50 cubes in 6 different colors for 300 cubes, and 20 black cubes for the espionage resource).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play starts with everyone at progress level 1 where you roll the first of the 10 dice. As you increase your progress levels, you get to roll more dice each turn, increasing your chances of gaining more resources to purchase achievements, resources, and higher progress levels. Each player can take 2 of a number of actions each turn, granting a variety of winning strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to meet one (or more) of the several goal conditions wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion thread: Die Civilization: Civ Building game for 2-5 players, 30+ minutes - Feedback wanted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
