							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sphinx:  The Game of Ancient Egypt</name>
									
			<description>Both sides, jade and amber, have six sphinxes, and the objective is to reach the other side's kingdom at the opposite ends of the board with one sphinx.  &lt;br/&gt;At the start of a round, two dice are rolled and one of 18 pyramids lands on the space.  If a sphinx was there, it is removed from the game.  If another pyramid was already on the space, then it is removed and the space is free again. &lt;br/&gt;Each side then moves a piece one space orthogonally or captures an opponent's piece one space diagonally.  This ends the round, and the player who moved second is now the starting player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
