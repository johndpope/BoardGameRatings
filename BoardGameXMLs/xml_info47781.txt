			<description>User summary (condensed from product text):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a cold and wet evening in Spring of the year 950 AD. A group of weary travelers squats shivering under the trees on the north bank of the Adige. Some have been waiting all afternoon to cross the river. On the far shore, the torches of the ferry inn flicker behind shuttered windows. At last, the ferry looms out of the darkness, and coins jingle as each pays his fee. The last to board glances over his shoulder and peers into the gloom, thinking of the life he leaves behind as the ferry casts off...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes is a role playing game set in Europe's Dark Ages. Players take the roles of adventurers who arrive at a Mediterranean port city intent on making their fortunes. Sections cover detailed character creation and background, professions, equipment, combat, social interaction, scenario creation, religion, crime and punishment, political factors, geography, history, land holdings, piracy, naval campaigns, merchant ventures, commerce, raiding, and Dark Ages medicine and healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book includes many optional rules covering a wide variety of situations, including the hazards of infected wounds, the punishment for stealing a pig, and the effects of alcohol during drinking contests, all of which provide greater flexibility of play. Although the Heroes RPG can be used as an accessory for any Dark Ages game, this book provides an elaborate and playable fictional setting called &amp;quot;Ouesterlands,&amp;quot; modeled on the political conditions found in historical 10th century Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes includes a pull-out political gazetteer of Ouesterlands, and a 17.5&amp;quot; x 25&amp;quot; fold-out map of the area surrounding the port city of Triente, the game's suggested starting point for adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes RPG requires percentile dice or their equivalent (not included) for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
