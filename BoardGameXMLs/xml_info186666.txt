			<description>(From the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Ready for 9 Innings of Fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bases Loaded, each roll of the dice represents an At Bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out-Roll your opponent on offense to hit doubles, triples, and even home runs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilize the strategy cards to steal bases, bunt and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With two different ways to play, Bases Loaded is fun for all ages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bases Loaded is a simple simulation of baseball. One player is &amp;quot;at-bat&amp;quot; and one player is &amp;quot;in-the-field&amp;quot;. The both roll three six-sided dice and the highest roll uses their dice result to determine the outcome. It's a single for the &amp;quot;at-bat&amp;quot; player and an &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; for the &amp;quot;in-the-field&amp;quot; player. There are special results on rolls of doubles (two dice having the same number) and triples (all three dice having the same number) for both players (provided they win the roll off).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The come comes with a LARGE set of cardboard stand-up players that are moved around the bases. However, there is no &amp;quot;outfield&amp;quot; players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; rules, both players are given a set of &amp;quot;one-use&amp;quot; cards which can also affect play. For the &amp;quot;at-bat&amp;quot; player these are: Stolen base x2, Balk x1, Sacrifice x3, Hit by pitch x2, Walk x4, Bunt x2, Double x3, Triple x1 and Home run x2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the &amp;quot;in-the-field&amp;quot; player these are: Ground out x4, Pick off x3, Fielder's choice x4, Double play x4, Triple play x1 and Bring it back x2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's pretty much it. Other than choosing when to use which card there are not many decisions to make and no way to influence the dice rolled, so that parts primarily luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple family game with nice components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
