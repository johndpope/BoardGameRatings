							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minotaurs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the minotaur. A classic of greek myth, these half-men half-bulls have captured imaginations for centuries. Though depicted in legend as a terrifyingly powerful guardian and deadly foe, the standard Pathfinder minotaur is only CR 4. The minotaurs in this tome are designed to take minotaurs from being an uninspiring low-level bruiser to a memorable encounter unto themselves. First, the two-headed minotaur (CR 7) is a feral and wild beast with a fractured mind, whose savage offensive power is only somewhat mitigated by its mental fragility. The bronze minotaur (CR 10) sounds like a construct (and looks like one too) but isn&amp;rsquo;t. This terrible guardian of tombs and other such places is an expert at crafting traps, and the sound of its approaching footsteps is so terrible that it drives fear into the heart of seasoned adventurers. Finally, the maze master minotaur (CR 15) is a minotaur of a more magical bent, who can drag foes into a mystical maze of its own creation, where they face deadly threats and, if slain, grant the maze master minotaur the ability to create a simulacrum of the victim to serve him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
