							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Our Favorite Adventure Modules, and What We Learned From Them</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Kickstarter was launched for How to Write Adventure Modules that Don't Suck (Revised), the authors of that august tome prepared essays on their favorite adventure modules. The contributors to the project are all great adventure designers who have in turn been inspired by the adventures that came before them. The goal of the essays was to share their love of these favorite adventures, and also communicate to fans what they had learned as game designers from these adventures. HTWAMTDS is a tome of adventure design advice, after all, and such advice comes not only in pedagogical form, but also from inspirational sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backer response to the essays was very positive! Therefore we have collected the essays together into this booklet as a stretch goal for the Kickstarter backers. We hope you find these essays to be valuable as you embark on your own adventure-designing projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
