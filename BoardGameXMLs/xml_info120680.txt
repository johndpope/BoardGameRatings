			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A home-made Japanese card game, based on the so-called &amp;quot;dating simulators&amp;quot;. Players compete for the attention of six girls, each with their own events related to them, and the player with the most events scored at the end wins. The game consists of general events, special events and activity cards. Players start with a deck of activity cards and some general events, though none are kept as a hand, but instead drawn one at a time and played. Each turn, a player can choose if he wants to gain a certain girl's special event card to add to his deck, or if he wants to gain as points the events he'll play. It's a matter of keeping in mind what you have in your deck and relying on luck enough to get them in the right order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back&lt;br/&gt;A game distilling the sweet-and-sour (or so 'tis written) romantic memories from fictitious school days. Players try to impress the different heorines, and gradually build their own decks with the memories they prefer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love or dislike&amp;hellip; put into words there is no end to it.&lt;br/&gt;My radical days keep going on and on (pun from a famour dating sim).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
