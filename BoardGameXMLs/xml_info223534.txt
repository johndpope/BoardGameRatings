							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lore of the Bloodlines</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each chapter addresses one of nine bloodlines of the modern nights from the perspective of a vampire in it:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bound by their mutual worship of demons, the Baali have become the targets of many Kindred as they corrupt and manipulate vampires and demons like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Daughters of Cacophony focus on the power of song and voice. They are touched with both madness and artistic insight that other vampires crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by ancient Tremere experiments, the Gargoyles are not-quite-vampires that serve their masters loyally... except when they violently rebel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harbingers of Skulls are the last remnants of an ancient Clan with a long-held grudge against the Giovanni. They hide behind a variety of masks, and only some of them are physical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misunderstood scholars, the Kiasyd are obsessed with mental puzzles. Some believe they are the result of experimentation with the fae, but the truth may be far stranger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nagaraja are cannibalistic vampires that lurk in the shadows of Kindred society. They comprise part of the shadowy Sect known as the True Black Hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once one of the thirteen Clans of Caine, before the treachery of the Tremere nearly destroyed them, the Salubri now struggle between revenge and morality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unsure of their own origins, the putrefying Samedi act as voudoun mercenaries among the undead. They don&amp;rsquo;t know if their founder is a vampire or a loa, but they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the True Brujah manipulate time while seeking to reclaim their place as the true successors of Brujah. They lurk on the strange fringes of the World of Darkness, ready to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each bloodline&amp;rsquo;s chapter starts with some pertinent history, followed by information about how the bloodline interacts and works now. At the end is a wide variety of combination powers, Merits, Flaws, and other mechanical bits for players and Storytellers. Use them or ignore them as you like to expand, refine, and modify typical members of that bloodline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
