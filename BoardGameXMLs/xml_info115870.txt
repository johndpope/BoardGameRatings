			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While traveling through the Spine of the World Mountains, the PCs stumble upon a wrecked caravan of wagons on a lonely road. Of the six covered wagons, none have been spared whatever disaster has befallen them. The bodies of horses and humans lie scattered in the snow, some torn to pieces, their blood frozen in small puddles near their corpses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While investigating the wreckage, the PCs hear a moaning over the frigid wind. In the back of one of the destroyed wagons is a woman. One of her arms has almost been torn completely off. Ice hangs from her face, and frozen blood is pooling under her ravaged arm. When she sees the PCs, she motions for them to enter the wagon. When the PCs are close enough, the woman tries to sit up, only to collapse onto her back. As she coughs up blood, the PCs realize that her arm was simply the only visible wounds they could see. She tries to talk, but it comes out in a half-whispered, choked voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ice trolls&amp;hellip;took everything. Came out of nowhere. No one left alive. The outpost will die&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
