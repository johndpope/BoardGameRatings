							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sweeping the Doorstep</name>
									
			<description>A previously unpublished expansion for the ASL Starter Kits, utilizing boards and countermixes for ASLSK 2 and 3. Included as an insert to Tactical Wargamer's Journal, Issue 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweeping the Doorstep is a two-player scenario depicting the fighting at Carpiquet in July 1944. The scenario was designed as part of the Battles of Carpiquet (q.v.) contest but was not released with those scenarios as it was the only ASLSK scenario in the contest. In addition to the scenario, playtest notes and historical articles are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Wargamer's Journal (ISSN 1918-9729), published on a non-regular schedule, covers topics of interest on all aspects of the world of commercial tactical wargaming, with its focus set on warfare at the man-to-man, squad and platoon level in the 20th Century and contemporary era. Tactical Wargamer's Journal (TWJ) places emphasis on both military history and the history of tactical level gaming itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue 3 focuses on the history of the 21st Army Group in Northwest Europe and depictions of the Commonwealth Armies in that theatre in tactical-level wargames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
