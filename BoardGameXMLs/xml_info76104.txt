			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date for the big fairy ball gets closer and closer and Princess Rosie still has nothing to wear. But luckily she has good friends. The mouse, the hare, the bear, the hedgehog, and the frog want to help Princess Rosie by trying to find the most beautiful fairy dress that has even been worn at a ball. Pupsi, the pig, has taken command and you can support the animals to find all the parts of the dress. But hurry up - you have to be ready before the ball starts at sunset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board and box fit together make a diorama scene that all the players sit in front of, much like a stage. The scene is of a beautiful meadow with seven berry bushes, a castle, and blue sky beyond. The berry bushes are cards that are shuffled and placed randomly. Most of the bushes have a picture of part of Princess Lillifee's dress printed on the back so the players don't know which dress part is behind each bush. The pawns have one of the helpful animals on the back side. Pawns are placed on the board so the players cannot see which pawn is which animal. The Pig sets the goal by showing a card with a combination of a dress piece and an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a die and moving the pawns behind each of the bushes, trying to match the animal and dress parts shown on the Pigs easel. Since the players don't know what is behind the pawns and bushes, they use the mirrored magic wand to look behind the bushes to see if they found a match. A sun mover acts as a timer as it moves from cloud to cloud showing that the ball is getting ready to start. If the players can collect all the dress parts before the sun sets, they win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
