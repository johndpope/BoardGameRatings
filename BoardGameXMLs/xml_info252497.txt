			<description>Welcome to the fabulous world of short short story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will write a short short story all together.&lt;br/&gt;But it is not a difficult thing. Because we prepare a special&lt;br/&gt;notebook only for writing a strange short short story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can write the paragraph by just reading the previous one. Each player cannot read the whole story, so the story will be&lt;br/&gt;changing little by little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the players wrote 8 paragraphs, it's done.&lt;br/&gt;Let's read the story that all of you had just written now and laugh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
