			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 30 x 32 inch, full color battlemap of a Bazaar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to the Bazaar, an oasis of wealth in the middle of the desert. If your food packs are empty you have come to the right place, for the right price of course.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Bazaar Merchant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bazaar is a map of a medieval marketplace set in the middle of a desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bazaar is intended for use in fantasy or medieval games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bazaar can be used in many different ways. If the group is in the desert running out of supplies, they can spot the Bazaar to resupply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back tents might also have more interesting and illegal items provided by the Thieves&amp;rsquo; Guild for the Merchant&amp;rsquo;s Guild to fence out in the desert far from the prying eyes of the law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group might even be hired by a rival Thieves&amp;rsquo; Guild to grab the stolen goods in the back tent and provide proof that the Merchant&amp;rsquo;s Guild was selling contraband in their bazaar.  They can then use this evidence to implicate their rival Thieves&amp;rsquo; Guild and cast aspersions on the current Merchant&amp;rsquo;s Guild. This could end the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s permission for the desert bazaar which is giving their rivals significant profits as well. If the current Merchant Guild goes out of favor, the rival Thieves&amp;rsquo; Guild wants to establish their own Merchant Guild allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This task is not as easy as one would think. The merchants might not be much a threat outside of social and economic combat, but their thief allies may be skulking about in the guise of merchants ready to protect their ill-gotten gains if the need arises. They also have a tribe of fierce desert nomads that help them avoid the worst sandstorms of the desert. Men hardened by the desert who are excellent scouts and horsemen with scimitars and bows alike. If the group is caught trying to steal the contraband, it will be a fight to leave the bazaar alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
