			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post-apocalyptic Los Angeles meets Cimmerian Pulp Adventure with a heavy dose of Gamma World in this new RPG setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the OMEGAZONE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We call it the World Before. Where all the destruction and mayhem called the Omega Wars originated. Nowadays, fighting to survive is just a way of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jussabout' everything here is touched by some kinda weirdness, msself included. No clue why, but when you grow up with it, you don't notice it so much. It's just the way things are. But they haven't always been. There are leftovers here from the Omega Wars against the Kreen. I read about them in a pamphlet that managed not to get isself burned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's how I know everything's changed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMEGAZONE is an Instant Setting for the Fate Accelerated roleplaying game. The 54 card deck contains all the ingredients you need for adventure. It's  just waiting for you to fill in the details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure generation is just as easy. Included are pre-built locations with NPC faces and potential allies/antagonists, and a adventure hook generator to jumpstart a plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMEGAZONE is inspired by games like Gamma World and Enslaved: Journey to the West; cartoons like Thundarr the Barbarian; books like Conan the Barbarian, A Canticle for Liebowitz, Remnant Population, and The World Without Us; and movies like Escape from L.A., Mad Max, and Six-String Samurai. What I love about adventures set in these kinds of worlds is that the Monstrous becomes familiar, and you get to be them or unite with them to face some other kind of threat. Whether that's leftover robots in a nature-reclaimed ruin of a city, or just helping defend an outpost of gasoline-makers against The Humungus, there's always new adventure to be had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;for additional material see OmegaZone Setting Guide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
