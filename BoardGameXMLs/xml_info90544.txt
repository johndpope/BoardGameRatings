			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP is the first Gameboy Advance title for the MotoGP series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game shares a title with the PS2 version, but is a completely different beast. It features 16 tracks, only one of which is available on startup. The other tracks can be unlocked through Grand Prix mode. Players can choose from a number of different racers and race in four different play modes: Quick Race, Time Attack, Tournament, and Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tournament mode has different leagues that offer different levels of difficulty; Lower leagues allow the player to continue if they place fourth or better, for example. Grand Prix is a point-based series of races where the champion is decided by the best overall point score after all the races are complete. Up to four players can play simultaneously with a Link Cable and enough copies of the game in Quick Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control scheme is simpler than in its PS2 counterpart. There is no option for manual shifting, but it is possible to perform a &amp;ldquo;turbo&amp;rdquo; wheelie to get back into the race when falling behind. MotoGP makes use of password saves rather than save files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
