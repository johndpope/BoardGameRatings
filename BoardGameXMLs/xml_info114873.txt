			<description>Protect your strawberry patch from gluttonous invaders in Garden Panic, an action-packed game of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've just grown the most wonderful and tasty strawberries in your little old garden but insects have quickly taken noticed. Now, they are launching an all-out attack to feast on your fruit but they are unaware that you have the perfect defenses planned for them. Can you keep these marauding insects from eating up your strawberries?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up your protective plants to take out the bugs as they make their way to your strawberries. Purchase from five different varieties and watch them shell out destruction in many ways. Watch as they gain experience, then upgrade them to do even more damage to the oncoming insect invasion. Plan carefully and set them up strategically, or else your strawberries are history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
