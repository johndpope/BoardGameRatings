			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Kingdom of Nyrond Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duke Grevin Damar of Flinthill has spread word far and wide. His castle in Arndulanth will host it. Heros of the realm will attend as his personal guests. A very special gnome will speak to the brave. The recruitment has begun. But, are you really ready to attend an event being called The dragonslayer&amp;rsquo;s Ball? And is any party really going to mobilize the realm to face a rampaging dragon bent on killing every gnome in the Flinty Hills?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters level 6 - 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario was referred to as Gnome Way Out in scheduling (and in the footer of the document); the title page gives the name Silence of the Gnomes, apparently in error as that name was used the previous year - see NYR2-05: The Silence of the Gnomes.  The cover also offered the series code of NYR3-05, also in error as the module is NYR3-04.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
