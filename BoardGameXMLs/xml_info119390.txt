			<description>Cardgame consisting of 69 playing cards and 3 instruction cards (English &amp;amp; Dutch), developed for dart players by (the dart brand) Bull's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules include a introduction and full game, and offers variants for both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 62 dart board scoring areas are represented by individual cards, thus creating 3 suits: singles doubles and trebles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, a player select an open or blind card, and either returns a card, or plays a shot. The amount on the card is subtracted from the players score, which (by agreement) can be 101, 201, or 301. To win a player had to hit exactly 0 with the last shot, AND the last card played should be a 'double'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the more advanced game the player is allowed to open as many 'pile' as he likes, but scores negative points for unfinished piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
