			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gemstones have long played an important role in the magical arts. Magic users believe each gem is imbued with its own distinct energies, and that it is possible to tap into those energies for personal gain and insight. Unfortunately, most roleplaying systems have simplified gemstones to the point of uselessness, serving little purpose in gameplay other than as a variable description for a piece of random loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Gemstones offers 70 gemstones with related folklore and reported magical properties. Add a touch of mystery to your game by using the information in this product to develop new ideas for magical items, or add some variety to random treasure rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this product is designed as a general resource for any game system, it includes supplemental information for the Karma Roleplaying System. The Karma Roleplaying System allows players and storytellers to craft their own spells and magical items, design their own races, and completely customize their characters with a unique point system. Pick up with product for only 99 cents, and then explore the rest of the Karma RPG product line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
