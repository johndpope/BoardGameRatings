							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Chibi Defenders: Wedding Edition</name>
									
			<description>The fearsome dragon in charge of the Wedding Hoard has rallied the (uninvited) guests to its cause of getting the first bite of cake! The Wedding party must join forces to fight off this threat before the entire day is ruined by the dessert motivated forces of evil! Ultimate Chibi Defenders: Wedding Edition is a lite cooperative game of tactical cake defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn players move and use an action (attack or special ability) to slow or defeat the advancing and growing hoard of wedding crashers. Once all players have acted, crashers advance - attacking any heroes in their path - and attempt to eat the wedding cake. The players win if the Dragon is defeated before the cake is completely eaten. The Wedding Crashers win if the cake is devoured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was distributed as a wedding favour at the designer's wedding reception. It is now available for free as a print and play game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
