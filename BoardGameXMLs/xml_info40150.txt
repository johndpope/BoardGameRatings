			<description>Golf has two parts: A luck-based starting phase in which the players try do get their golf ball onto the green by rolling dice, and a dexterity phase on the green in which a mechanical golfer statue pushes the ball into the hole (for this, you have to press down the shoulders and then let go, and the golfer will hit the ball with a corresponding strength).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
