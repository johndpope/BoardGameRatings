			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an online version of Mechwarrior released for GEnie (the G.E. network) and ran from 1992-1996.  Players created a character and then picked a faction from the 5 major Houses of the Inner Sphere during the Third War of Succession to fight for.  Then through the user interface, players would pick a planet from the Inner Sphere map, which acted as a lobby of sorts, and chose to defend, liberate, or contest the planet.  Players could fight alongside up to 3 other human players from the same House.  The results of your battles would affect the status of the planet and eventually determined who controlled it.  Mission success also brought promotions for your character.  Eventually, you could command other Mechs and determine the focus of your House's war efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
