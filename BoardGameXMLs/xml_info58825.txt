			<description>12 plastic animals are set onto holes in the game board. A pump is attached to one of the 12 outside holes of the board. The players then take turns hitting the pump. This leads to one animal jumping up into the air, as the holes are connected through tubes. If the player can catch it and it is one of the animals assigned to him or her by a card, he or she can keep it. If it belongs to a different player, it is put back onto any of the holes; if it belongs to the active player and he or she cannot catch it, it goes back to the original hole. When a player has caught all of his or her animals, he or she is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
