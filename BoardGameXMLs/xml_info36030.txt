			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card &amp;amp; Dice game for 2+ players. Each player is a Gambler trying to win Big. Victory: The Winner is the first player to accumulate $5,000. If you ever lose all your money, you lose the game.&amp;rdquo; Each player starts with $5000. Pennies or other tokens are used as money, each being worth $100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom set of cards. There are five types of cards in the deck: Casino Game Bets (Black Jack, Poker, Craps, &amp;amp; Roulette), Race Track Bets (Dogs, Horses, Jai Alai), Sports Bets (Baseball, Basketball, &amp;amp; Football), Win Cards and Special Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player plays a Bet card and rolls on a 2d6 Wager Table to determine the result. Win Cards can be played to modify the result. Multiple Casino and Sports bets may be made in one turn, but Casino and Track bets may not be made in the same turn. Special cards are played at the end of a player&amp;rsquo;s turn and add $100-$600 to a player&amp;rsquo;s bankroll as determined by a die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer notes that the game is based on the gambling practices of his father and uncles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
