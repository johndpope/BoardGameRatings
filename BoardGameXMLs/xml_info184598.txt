							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death or Glory: Main Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death or Glory is a generic, universal roleplaying system.  The system espoused several design goals which included the absence of experience points, classes, and levels.  Instead, characters were built around skills which drove all actions.  Characters improved their skills in a &amp;quot;learn-by-doing&amp;quot; paradigm.  The game also included a fairly robust fatigue system that influenced skill performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters had Main Attributes, ranging in value from 3-18 (typically generated with 3d6 though alternate methods are provided).  The twelve attributes are Speed, Strength, Endurance, Constitution, Fight (hand-to-hand weapons), Accuracy (missile weapons), Agility, Handwork, Command, Intelligence, Calm, Sociability, Resistance to Magic, Magic Aptitude, and Mental Power.  When a character attempts an action based on a Main Attribute, they must &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; the Main Attribute value with 1d20 to be successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also have numerous skills that detail the full range of performance available.  Skill values range from zero to 100; when used, a character must &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; the Skill value with 1d100 to be successful.  Characters in all genres have some basic Skills, including Moving, Ambush, Hide, Robbery, Stealth, and Observation.  Other skills vary by genre, as appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters will have a race, which often influences Skill values, and they also will have a Social Rank which may influence Skill values and may restrict access to certain Skills.  Weapon use is a Skill and combat is resolved by Skill use.  Armor provides protection, but adds to fatigue.  The fatigue of characters is tracked and influences their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
