			<description>&amp;quot;Royalty, a game that tests your knowledge of the Royals.  You will be surprised by how much you know, [if you're from the UK or have UK connections...]and astounded by some of the things you didn't!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The object of the game is to be the first to reach the Throne at the center of the gameboard and answer a Royalty question correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player takes it in turns to roll the die, move their playing piece and then attempt to answer on of the Royalty question cards.  If a player answers correctly they may take another turn.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
