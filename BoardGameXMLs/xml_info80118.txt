			<description>From the Back of the Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genghis Khan began life with nothing but an obsession for an old legend that spoke of the great destiny of the Mongols. It would take a miracle for one man to fulfill this legend and turn divided Mongolia into an empire stretching from China to Europe. Genghis Khan was determined to supply this miracle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Genghis Khan, Richard the Lion-Hearted, Emperor Alexious III or Shogun Minamoto of Japan you build an empire. Keep it by making sure your populace is happy, your treasury full, your subordinates loyal, and your enemies down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In battle, out-maneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers, or even challenge him to a duel. Battlefield victory alone does not mean conquest. The newly acquired country must be governed, prisoners dealt with and a successor found. A successful rendezvous with a local princess may help solve the last of these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENGHIS KHAN is a sophisticated simulation for one to four players. Although a great war game, the human side of empire-building has not been forgotten. Finding the right way to approach a hostile empress is just as important as training troops for battle. Know the people around you and use them effectively. In a world where empires rise and fall with the seasons do not let your guard down and be ready for a host of problems, natural and otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     For one to four players&lt;br/&gt;     Realistic military, economic, and diplomatic simulation&lt;br/&gt;     Characters with distinct personalities and emotions&lt;br/&gt;     Two separate scenarios with five levels of difficulty&lt;br/&gt;     Superb graphics and detailed animation&lt;br/&gt;     A Quick Resolution Mode that revolves battles in seconds&lt;br/&gt;     Complete instruction manual and historical notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced by Kou Shibusawa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
