			<description>On the Deep Space 9 station, Ferengi wheel and deal legal and illegal items in order to accrue the most profit because as you know, a Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all (Rule of Acquisition #18).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Star Trek: Galactic Enterprises, 3 to 8 Ferengi buy and sell their wares, trying to monopolize a particular item for greater profit. However, once other Ferengi get those same items for sale, it becomes a matter of negotiation: Do you work together to gain the same profit, or do you agree to cooperate, then sell at a lower price to steal all the profit for yourself? After all, opportunity, plus instinct, equals profit (Rule of Acquisition #9).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be wary of special action cards that can mess with the business of other Ferengi. The bigger the smile, the sharper the knife (Rule of Acquisition #48). The Ferengi who has earned the most profit becomes the First Clerk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
