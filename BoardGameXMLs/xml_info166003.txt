							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bibi &amp; Tina: Das Spiel zum Film</name>
									
			<description>A memory and racing game themed on the German movie &amp;quot;Bibi &amp;amp; Tina&amp;quot;, which, in turn, is based on the children's audiobook series of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to reach the finish space on the board first or, in case Maik-and-Maik (adversaries from the movies) get there first, to have collected the most heart tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the dice. The red die is for moving the Maik-and-Maik token, from the white dice the active player selects one result for him/herself and moves his/her token accordingly, then the other players chose the remaining dice results.&lt;br/&gt;The racing track contains shortcuts and spaces on which an effect card has to be drawn. Most of these have negative effects (having to move back, changing place with the last player etc.). Other spaces get you a heart token and allow all other players to look at one of the movie cards. Remembering which movie card is where allows players to take shortcuts.&lt;br/&gt;Heart tokens can be used to allow players to move fewer spaces than the die roll dictates, to turn over an additional movie card when trying to take a shortcut, or to ask other players for help with finding the right movie card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
