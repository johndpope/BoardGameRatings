			<description>A children's game in which players advance around a circular track, partly by roll-and-move, but mainly by being able to recall four characteristics of a thief whose appearance constantly changes and who can only be glimpsed fleetingly as he is rotated between screens by a clockwork mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the end of the track is deemed to have arrested the thief and so won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
