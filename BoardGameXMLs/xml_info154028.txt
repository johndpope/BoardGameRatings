							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Percepto</name>
									
			<description>Percepto is a puzzle game for iOS. It was my pet project while I was studying Computer Science and Design at Georgia Tech from 2008-2012. Shortly after version 1.0 was released it was chosen as Apple&amp;rsquo;s iPhone Game of the Week. Almost a year later in March 2012, I released Percepto 2.0, which significantly improved the art, added IPad support and game center, among other features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
