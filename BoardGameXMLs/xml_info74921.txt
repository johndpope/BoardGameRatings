			<description>Subtitle: A Super Hero Quick Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;A string of bank robberies over the past few weeks have left police baffled, and your team has been called in to assess whether or not the robbers are super powered. The robberies usually happen during normal business hours with the witnesses unable to remember anything about the incidents. The robbers always take large amounts of money and open every single safe deposit box in any bank they hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The police chief is anxious to get these robbers caught, and he has made it clear that if the problem is super powered villains, then his police officers will not look as incompetent as they do now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
