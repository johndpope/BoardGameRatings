			<description>The object  of the SOCIETY TODAY Game is to reach The Best of All Possible Worlds before any other player, using your knowledge about people and social institutions, your intelligence, and sheer luck to overcome the many obstacles that life&amp;mdash;and your opponents&amp;mdash;may put in your path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roll-and-move board and trivia game. Contents are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 player tokens&lt;br/&gt;32 Refusal tokens&lt;br/&gt;32 shot-in-the-dark cards&lt;br/&gt;16 limbo cards&lt;br/&gt;24 imponderable cards&lt;br/&gt;timer&lt;br/&gt;dice rules with 300 questions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true/false questions are about &amp;quot;society today&amp;quot;. Many are factual (such as Q40: During the early 1960s income differences between black and white males with some college increased (true)). Others are subjective (such as Q37: At the same job level, Catholics are more conservative than Protestants (false, apparently)). Gameplay is roll and move, following the instructions on the square you land on. Shot-in-the-dark, limbo and imponderable cards are similar to community chest in Monopoly - random events that may be good or bad. With shot-in-the-dark cards you have to convince a judge (another player) of the merit of one side of a social issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
