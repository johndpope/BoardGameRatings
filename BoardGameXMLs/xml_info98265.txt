							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jack and Jill (A first card game)</name>
									
			<description>A simple card game for pre-school youngsters.The cards depict characters or scenes from the nursery rhyme 'Jack and Jill went up the hill'. You just draw a card, if it is Jack you place it in front of you. If it isn't Jack you discard it. Once you have Jack, you need to draw Jill, and so on. The cards must be collected in this order; Jack - Jill - Jack and Jill going up the hill - Jack and Jill fetching a pail of water - Jack falling down and Jill tumbling after - Jack in bed with his head bandaged with vinegar and brown paper.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect these cards in that order, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
