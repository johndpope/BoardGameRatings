			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Spiral Vortices is a unique setting expansion for Glimpse the Beyond, which examines options for an expanded, futuristic version of the galaxy. Black Spiral Vortices introduces a possible future for the world of Glimpse the Beyond, in which humanity has discovered the true nature of the supernatural through expanded exploration. Set in the year 2216, this supplement looks at a human race that has prospered through technological advancement and survived supernatural strife. Civilization as we know it in the 21st Century is a distant memory, and the Magi, once hidden from humanity, have risen to cultural prominence. No longer concerned with keeping their fellow humans in the dark about the supernatural, Magi now stand side by side with engineers and astrophysicists, using their knowledge to shape the future. Science and Magick have found a way to coexist in this world, by merging into the new practice known as Metateck, for the betterment and expansion of humanity throughout the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Spiral Vortices examines how new technologies and magickal revelations have reshaped the universe and expanded humanity&amp;rsquo;s role within it. The rules and materials herein are designed to explore a dark, yet hopeful future, far removed from the &amp;ldquo;world outside your window&amp;rdquo; presented in the core rulebook. This possible future is painted in broad strokes, leaving many of the specific details up to the Guide to determine. New setting elements and systems will be introduced which have been designed with the interstellar setting of Black Spiral Vortices in mind. Having said that, some Guides may wish to cherry pick certain elements from this book for use in a standard Glimpse the Beyond campaign, while ignoring other elements. Such is the prerogative of the individual Guide. It&amp;rsquo;s your game. Keep what you like and discard the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Spiral Vortices includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Alternate Character Creation Rules: an expanded rule set that allows players to draw up mundane humans, Magi, technomagickal Metaphysicists, or supernatural creatures as playable characters.&lt;br/&gt;    New Boons, Flaws, and Skills: Boons, flaws, and skills specifically designed for use in the Black Spiral Vortices setting.&lt;br/&gt;    Alternate Ritual Magick Rules: the Black Spiral Vortices setting is a futuristic environment. As such, Ritual Magick works a bit differently than in the core setting. Furthermore, Black Spiral Vortices introduces a new type of technological magick called Metaphysicks, and the rules for implementing this potent tool.&lt;br/&gt;    Locations: a brief overview several human colonies, both within the Earth solar system and beyond! Take to the stars with Black Spiral Vortices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
