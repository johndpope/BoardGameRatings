			<description>The object is to collect the animals from the farm. For this, the items hidden under the straw must be memorized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that collects his assigned animals first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four animals are placed on the circular board (sheep, cow, horse and pig). The rest of the animals are placed in the barn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next to each field on the board, a straw card is placed with the hidden items. On each of these an object from the farm is depicted. Of each item there are two cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt three cards with the animals to be collected. On each turn a player rolls a die and selects an animal to move. After the move, the straw card next to the animal is turned to show the item. The the player selects any other straw card and turns it as well. Following results can happen:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The items on the cards are the same, and the animal that was moved is one of the assigned ones. The player then takes the animal into his collection and ends his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The items on the cards are the same, and the animal that was moved is not one of the assigned ones. The player then takes a new animal from the barn and places it on the board and ends his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The items on the cards are not the same. The player then ands his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After this all open straw cards are turned back again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that has collected all his assigned animals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant for younger players: The assignment cards are not used and whenever two matching items are found, the player takes the animal. When all items are taken, the player with the most animals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
