			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of an Industrial Boiler Room, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The automated controls have gone haywire! The only way to stop a boiler explosion now is the manual release valves!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 1 is a single map of a mechanical floor in the basement of a building. Level 1 can be used as the bottom level of a building with Sector 15 at the top and Level 19 as the mid-warehouse level. Level 1 includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Level 1 is intended for use in modern or near future science fiction settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manual Override: The mechanical floor includes a series of industrial boilers controlled by a remote room. The remote room suddenly is unable to control the mechanical room. At the same moment, the building goes into lockdown as if the entire building has been hacked. The boiler could explode if the group does not go down to manually override the boiler controls and release the pressure. Either they have the knowledge to do so, or they need communication equipment to contact the remote control room. The hacker will attempt to jam this communication and disrupt this way of saving the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its either that or figure out a way through the doors to escape the building before it explodes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hacker is a former disgruntled employee of Sector 15 trying to destroy the building as revenge for being fired. It is up to the group to hunt him down by finding him from his remote location nearby after saving or escaping the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
