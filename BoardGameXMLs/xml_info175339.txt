			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob tossed the two six-sided dice onto the table. &amp;quot;Six,&amp;quot; someone at the table offered. He picked up the small game piece shaped like a shovel and moved it six spaced on the tan colored board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob couldn't remember the last time he had an evening to himself. When he saw the internet post about a board game night at a local game store close to his house, he figured he'd give it a shot. Now he sat around a table playing a game with five complete strangers and was having a blast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he picked up the dice to take his next turn, Jacob saw the glass doors to the store fly open and three men in ski masks walk in. They were armed with pump-action shotguns and menacingly swept them around the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nobody move,&amp;quot; the tallest of three commanded. Spotting the games on the tables, the masked man added, &amp;quot;this is not a game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob rolled his eyes. &amp;quot;Are you serious?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave. Grab a copy of Modern Floorplans: An Average Modern Pool Hall today, and keep an eye out for future releases!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 5000+ square foot game store with all the bells and whistles. The store has three semi-private gaming areas, tons of shelf space for product and a private office in the back. In addition, a wall forms a large area that is perfect for tournaments or organized play events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
