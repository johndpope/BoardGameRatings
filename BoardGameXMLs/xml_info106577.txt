							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buku Sudoku</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a digital version of the traditional pen/paper game, Sudoku. The premise remains the same: the player must complete sequences from 1 thru 9 in both horizontal and vertical lines, as well as throughout the various square groups that make up the play field. This version adds a few features that are not found in a typical paper version. These include the ability to change the background and some of the sound effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose between boards that are 6x6, 8x8, 9x9, or 12x12. They can also choose the difficulty level of their game. While playing single-player, you can select either a setting that is either &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; (unlimited time) or &amp;quot;timed&amp;quot; (limited time). There are also features that can be turned on to assist the player, such as: a 'pencil' to scribble in your options, something that informs you if you input an incorrect entry, or something that lists the remaining options for a box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player adds more options. These are: co-op, duel, and team battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
