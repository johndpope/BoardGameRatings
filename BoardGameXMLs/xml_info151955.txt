			<description>In Familie Feuerstein (The Flintstones), each player gets two meeples, which he has to get from his starting spaces to the finish on the rotating Center of the game board. If a player rolls a 1 or 6, he may rotate the Center instead of moving a meeple. The meeples can be thrown out by opposing meeples, if they don't stand on a safe space with a picture of a Flintstone character represented by the player. The player who is the first to get his two meeples to the center spaces, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
