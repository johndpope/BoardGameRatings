			<description>Miss Trish - The Kindergarten Teacher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In Kindergarten, only the strong survive!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miss Trish - as her young wards call her - may not look like much, but a core of steel lurks behind her granny glasses and sensible shoes. Leading naptimes, teaching the ABCs, and dispensing timeouts to rowdy kindergartners, Miss Trish rules her classroom with an iron fist. The first zombie outbreak found her on a class trip at a children's zoo. Snatching up a firearm from a deceased police officer she herded her young charges onto the Piggle-Wiggle Choo-Choo Train, which she then steered to safety. Trading in her picture books for an Uzi, Miss Trish is one teacher you don't want to cross!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miss Trish is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Season 3 Kickstarter campaign. A Zombivor version is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
