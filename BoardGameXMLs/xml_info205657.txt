							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bradley&#039;s Sentence Builder</name>
									
			<description>This game consists of a large number of small rectangular chips, each printed on both sides with a full word rather than a letter. The words range in length from two to eight letters. Some of the words start with capital letters, and there are some chips with endings like -ing and with punctuation marks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is clearly educational in nature, flowing from Milton Bradley's devotion to that cause starting in the late 1860s. While undated, the plain box and cardboard word chips suggest 19th Century publication. The box is labelled with the address of the company's Boston office at 120 Boylston St. rather than the usual Springfield factory location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to form coherent sentences from selections of words from the box, but absent a copy of the rules, it is not clear how word cards are picked or distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
