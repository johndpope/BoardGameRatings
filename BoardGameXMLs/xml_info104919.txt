			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctor is counting on YOU to help win a nerve-wracking game of trust, treachery, and terror in Mission to Venus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveling in the Tardis, you and the Doctor materialize with a crash in a most unusual place: the belly of an in-flight spaceship. More eerie are the tall glass jars you find there, filled with jelly-like plants that desperately want out... but why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Doctor ponders that question, you meet the crew - a suspicious, vicious, and mutinous lot. Will they reveal the plants' true purpose and the ship's destination? But that may not matter after all - the spaceship has been struck by an enormous meteorite and now you're flying out of control on a collision course with Venus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is precious little time for you and the Doctor, and perhaps everyone else. It will be a true test of your ingenuity to avoid becoming galactic statistics as you Find Your Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other gamebooks in the Find Your Fate series, the Doctor Who series uses dice, and visual puzzles in addition to the reader making the decisions in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
