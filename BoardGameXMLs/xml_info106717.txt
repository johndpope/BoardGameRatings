			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROWOWOR is a word puzzle game created by Flash developer Tonypa.  In this game you are given two letters and must place five more to create at least one three or more letter word.  The letters must be placed in the order given, and you can only see the next two letters that you will place.  Bonus points are given for longer words and using every letter in a word, and after the board is full, two new letters are placed and you start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The catch is that, per game, no word can be used more than once.  This makes a large part of the challenge making sure you have the ability to form a word you haven't made already, and even remembering what words you have spelled.  The game ends when no new words are spelled after seven letters are on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
