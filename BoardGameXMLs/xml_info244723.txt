			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burial Plots includes five all new adventures for your CRYPTWORLD game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condition Critical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Howard Eastman has called a press conference at his remote research facility to announce a medical breakthrough that will &amp;ldquo;eradicate human illness and suffering forever.&amp;rdquo; But what if the cure proves to be worse than the disease?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unquenchable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three days ago, a group of hunters failed to return from their annual deer hunt near Akron, Ohio. Your team of expert trackers and investigators has been brought in to assist in the search. But there seems to be an undercurrent of unease amongst the police who whisper of a disturbing discovery they&amp;rsquo;ve made. Is there something sinister lurking in the forest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death in the Dust&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1888, the silver-mining boomtown of Weaver, Arizona, was abandoned after a series of unexplained disasters, and the town was left to crumble in the desert sands. Today, the former ghost town has been revitalized as a historical attraction. Is history about to repeat itself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forget-Me-Not&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrific axe murders recently committed in Oregon's Tillamook State Forest are identical to those committed by the legendary &amp;quot;Paul Bunyon Butcher&amp;quot; 40 years ago. However, the original killer &amp;ndash; now elderly and feeble &amp;ndash; remains behind bars. Has a copycat killer surfaced, or is this the work of something even more sinister?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Christmas season is typically a time of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men. But one THING has decided to make this year's Yuletide visit to relatives a horrific holiday from Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
