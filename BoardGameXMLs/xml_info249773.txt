			<description>Atlantic Storm: Admiral&amp;rsquo;s Edition is the updated and revised version of Ben Knight&amp;rsquo;s competitive strategy card game Atlantic Storm that recreates the tension and surprise experienced by Allied and Axis sailors during the Battle of the Atlantic from August 1940 through December 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players fight a battle for each convoy, and each player joins either side in the battle by playing Allied or Axis force cards from his hand. The battle winners keep the convoy and enemy forces as spoils of war. Plenty of table talk makes the game exciting as players negotiate to win the most spoils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Admiral&amp;rsquo;s Edition Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tarot-sized force cards&lt;br/&gt;     Added more convoys, and five ways to build Convoy Deck for a variety of play&lt;br/&gt;     Revised and added new events and force cards&lt;br/&gt;     Increased chance of fighting each round&lt;br/&gt;     More instances of claiming &amp;ldquo;fate&amp;rdquo; against victims&lt;br/&gt;     Special rules for solitaire play&lt;br/&gt;     Regular, team, and chronological versions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
