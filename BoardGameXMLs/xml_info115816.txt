							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spawn Of Non-Terrifying Beasts of Legend!</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Lazy GM Spawn of (Non) Terrifying Beasts of Legend. Within these pages we have taken the creatures from the original Non-Terrifying Beasts of Legend, updated them to Pathfinder, and added some entirely new horrors. Unlike other books in the Lazy GM series this product does not contain hundreds of statistic block variants. Instead, it is more in the line of a standard monster book. Fifteen pre-generated foes are contained within. All of them, with one exception, are created using only the rules found in the Pathfinder Reference Document (with some bending of what templates can be applied to). All of them can be used as the basis for an encounter, even a mini scenario in some cases. The question is, would you really want to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
