			<description>Weevils is a quick, cooperative card game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up. Players work together to grow a beautiful garden in time for the Summer Festival. But watch out for the Weevils... they&amp;rsquo;ll eat your precious plants!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players will take turns drawing, playing cards to the Garden or Compost pile, and discarding from the deck to complete the Growth requirements for Plants. Whenever Weevils are revealed, they are played to the Garden and will eat Growth cards and Plants on every turn, minimizing your chance for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete five Plants in the Garden and win, but if the deck runs out, the game ends in defeat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
