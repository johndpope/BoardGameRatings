			<description>&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Pantheon and other Roleplaying Games is a 24-page book that includes 5 self-contained role-playing games for 3-6 players and designed to be completed in 1-2 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pantheon introduced a system called Narrative Cage Match (NCM) that differs from traditional role-playing game systems in that there is no referee or gamemaster. Players control a character that co-operates and competes with other characters to try to steer the course of the story so that their character finishes in a better position that all the others. Players influence the narrative outcomes of the games they are playing using a bidding mechanism that uses beads and traditional six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pantheon includes 5 games called:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Grave and Watery - action and horror in an undersea base&lt;br/&gt;     Boardroom Blitz - players battle for control of a family megacorporation&lt;br/&gt;     The Big Hole - modern-day gangsters in a tale of crime, revenge and blackmail&lt;br/&gt;     Destroy all Buildings - Giant monsters ravage Tokyo&lt;br/&gt;     Pantheon - create the universe&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pantheon_(role-playing_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
