			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Final Frontier. You are about to embark as a Starfleet officer on a Federation starship headed for the unknown, to boldly go where no one has gone before. As a Starﬂeet ofcer you are among the best and brightest in the Federation &amp;ndash; commanders, pilots, scientists, engineers, and doctors. Your starship, a vessel of great speed and power, is the pinnacle of space exploration technology allowing you and your crew to investigate new spatial anomalies and support Federation worlds through the Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Trek takes place in a future in which Humans have formed an alliance with hundreds of other worlds to support one another and explore the Galaxy, pushing the boundaries of both known space and knowledge. Scarcity of resources is no longer an issue: replicators synthesize meals and equipment. Peoples of all worlds travel faster than light between systems, at warp, crossing whole sectors of space in days or weeks. Away teams are teleported instantly to the surface of a planet or between starships. Energy weapons are used by both security personnel and starships, and energy shields protect vessels from damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United Federation of Planets is surrounded by potentially hostile powers on all sides. In the Alpha Quadrant, the Cardassian Union and the Federation enjoy a tenuous peace as their border is hit by militant colonists calling themselves the Maquis. In the Beta Quadrant, the allied Klingon Empire is a powerful militarist civilization spanning hundreds of light years. The Romulan Empire, further toward the center of the Galaxy, has been an adversary for centuries, indeed since before the Federation was formed. The Neutral Zone is a buﬀer between the Federation and the Romulans. And through a wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant thousands of lightyears away, the Dominion poses a new threat to everyone in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Trek Adventures is a roleplaying game using the 2d20 System. This quick start guide summarizes rules for the game of discovery and adversity on alien worlds and beyond the stars. You should read these rules before running the sample mission in the second part of this booklet. The mission itself introduces key concepts as you play through the encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
