							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunter &amp; Harvesters Helper Volume 2: Rainforests</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ranger wants to go hunting, the druid wants to pick some berries, the alchemist wants to find a few useful herbs, and you, the GM, get to tell them what they come back with. Sure, you could keep things vague with a deer, some berries, and some useful herbs or you could give them an array of interesting choices based on the area that they are in. If the second option sounds more your speed then this publication is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find dozens of tables detailing the game, reptiles, mammals, birds, fish, fruits, vegetables, and herbs found in the rainforests of the world. Each table has between 12 and 25 different options to choose from (or rather roll from) for plenty of variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
