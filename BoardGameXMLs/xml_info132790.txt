			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The years from 1860-1900 saw vast areas of the world under the domination of the British flag.  Victoria's armies had fought campaigns as far afield as China, Afghanistan, India and the Continent of Africa, occasionally suffering defeat but never to be vanquished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Wars 1860-1900 Wargame Rules hope to capture some of the flavour of the period and provide the playability we all seek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include army lists for some of the period's main protagonists, and a points system to allow for ahistorical battles to be fought between roughly equivalent forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many miniature rule sets, the designer has defined both the ground scale (and consequently, the figure basing parameters):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground Scale:&lt;br/&gt; 25mm - 2cm = 10 yds&lt;br/&gt; 15mm - 1cm = 10 yds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn sequence calls for simultaneous movement and is defined as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Declare charges and test for them&lt;br/&gt;2. Carry out movement simultaneously&lt;br/&gt;3. Adjudicate fire&lt;br/&gt;4. Test for morale caused by firing&lt;br/&gt;5. Adjudicate melees&lt;br/&gt;6. Carry out all other morale tests&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
