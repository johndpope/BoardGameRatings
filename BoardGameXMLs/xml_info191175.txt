							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Draculas Dossier</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the terrifying world of The Esoterrorists, a loosely affiliated international conspiracy of that name works to rip open the membrane that keeps the ravening demons of a dread dimension called the Outer Dark at bay. They do this by exploiting the psychic power of cognitive dissonance, powering summoning rituals from the sense people have that reality becomes crazier and less controllable by the day. Only the player characters, dedicated agents of a virtuous counter-conspiracy called the Ordo Veritatis, stand between them and their worldending goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign frame lays out a narrative that uses Dracula Unredacted and the support materials contained in the Dracula Dossier Director&amp;rsquo;s Handbook to run an interlocking series of scenarios for The Esoterrorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this version, the annotated copy of Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s original Dracula is a hoax, cooked up by two allied Esoterror cells. As people around the world, mostly in the West, come to accept its reality, a formerly waning class of Outer Dark Entities known as spirotum use belief their to reconfigure themselves. Each becomes an embodied projection of the vampire myth. As they spread unease, further strengthening themselves, they identify the ultimate prize&amp;mdash;to manifest as the vampire lord, Dracula, and rule the world from his Romanian castle. An event of this scale would irrevocably drive awareness of the supernatural into worldwide human consciousness, destroying the membrane.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
