			<description>Players control gangs of nasty flees out to prey upon unsuspecting dogs that are wandering through a seedy section of the city. The fleas are placed on a 7z7 grid while the dogs wander the streets between the rows and columns. Fleas are placed picture-side (flea-side) up, with no identical fleas allowed on adjacent squares. After the grid is filled, the fleas are turned over, displaying the color of the player who placed them. The player with the most fleas on both sides of a street captures the unsuspecting dog on that street. Points for captured dogs are totaled, and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
