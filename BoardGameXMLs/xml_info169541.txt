			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hobby game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple, easy to play interpretation of Association Football (Soccer). The design of the playing pieces harks back to the early days of tabletop football games like Subbuteo, where the 2-dimensional card players were known as &amp;quot;flats&amp;quot;. For the first time this game is supplied with 12 full teams!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for two players where each player mans a team of eighteen players, eleven of which are on the pitch at any one time. Each team tries to score goals in the oppositions net. As with real football the game is split into two halves of 45 minutes with a break in between, with teams swapping ends at half time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses player piece positioning as well as D6 dice to create some randomness, in the form of &amp;quot;scattering&amp;quot; the ball a random direction. Players move their pieces up to a specified amount and if they are next to the piece with the ball may tackle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules, tables and diagrams for throw-ins, dribbling, kicking, shooting and other football terms are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
