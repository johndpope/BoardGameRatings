			<description>The players are divided into two teams and have to compete in 18 categories. The players try to fulfill tasks requested by cards. Most of these categories require the players to explain or tell something with a handicap, such as letting your tongue hang out while you pronounce a difficult word and such, forming a sentence which contains the same word twice in a row, etc.&lt;br/&gt;For each fulfilled task, the team moves up ten percent on a kind of &amp;quot;fun indicator&amp;quot; (Stimmungsbarometer in German). At certain intervals, a &amp;quot;fitness test&amp;quot; is required before the team's pawn can move on to the next sector on the game board or eventually cross the finish line to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
