			<description>A dice rolling game in which each player owns one (or two) lane(s) on the game board. These lanes lead outwards from a center which all players share. There are no player colors, just tokens (&amp;quot;nuggets&amp;quot;, coins etc., depending on the edition) which everyone can use to move forward. One player rolls, then the player who owns the lane with the number corresponding to the roll proceeds two squares. If a player is in the same square in the opposite lane, his token moves backward one square. If a player reaches the ninth field in his lane, he can keep the token as a victory point. The game proceeds until all points have been won. &lt;br/&gt;There are some special rules for some of the squares, such as &amp;quot;move player in the opposing lane back to space one&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
