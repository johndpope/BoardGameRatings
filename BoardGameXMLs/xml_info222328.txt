			<description>Typer Shark Deluxe aims to improve your skills by letting you use the keyboard as a weapon. You play a diver who faces sharks that attack and prevent you from taking treasures in the ocean depths.  There are two game modes: Adventure and Abyss. In the Adventure mode, the game increases difficulty (more sharks or sharks that require longer or more words to be typed) as players progress through the adventure map.  In the Abyss mode, the difficulty increases the deeper the diver goes.  The game also features a tutor to teach players how to type and practice typing.  The game can measure a players typing per minute and adjust the difficulty based on the player's typing skill level.&lt;br/&gt;- User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
