			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap in and prepare for lift off, with the first adventure compendium of Daring Tales of the Space Lanes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple Ace Games presents five epic space adventures where fighting evil crimelords, dodging bounty hunters, and evading asteroids while blasting at enemy fighters is all part of a day&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waylaid on Wayland: When a senior political figure offered the heroes a tidy sum to deliver a small package it seemed like easy money, but that was before people started trying to kill them. What begins as a simple cargo run quickly has the heroes involved in a running battle over who gets to control a powerful political organization on the industrial world of Wayland. Trash incinerators, acid rain, high speed chases through chimney stacks, and a showdown where the scenery is just as dangerous as the opposition await!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunboat Diplomacy: Sure, helping a guy being blasted at by an armored goon was the right thing to do, but it&amp;rsquo;s embroiled the characters in the start of a potentially nasty situation. When an entire space navy is trying to kill you, you know it&amp;rsquo;s not a good day to take to the stars! Space Dangers: A special appendix detailing numerous space hazards you can throw into your own space tales. From asteroids to gravity wells to wormholes, that cargo run just got a whole lot more dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Debts: Life in the spacelanes is hard, and spacers have to go where the money is. In this case, that means tracking down the kidnapped daughter of a senior member of the powerful Galactic Trade Assembly. From the explosive energy crystal world of Kerexi IV to the gas processing spacestation known as Dante and onward to a secret starship controlled by a powerful criminal fraternity, the heroes are plagued by vicious bounty hunters led by the ruthless and cunning Pandit Morg, an alien psion armed with a very deadly weapon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot Rumble: When your trip to Lux III hits &amp;quot;difficulties&amp;quot; your patron suggests a way you can repay him and avoid his lawyers. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple enough task, on the surface; all you have to do is infiltrate a criminal gang, discover who their boss is, and put him out of business. But there&amp;rsquo;s a drawback, and it&amp;rsquo;s a big one. The gang operates in Tin Town,a robots-only slum, and fleshies just aren&amp;rsquo;t welcome there. But fear not, for your patron has a solution; you&amp;rsquo;re going to enter Tin Town disguised as robots!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Journey of the Exodus: A man condemned to a terrible fate for his crimes possesses a long forgotten secret: to repay the heroes for an act of kindness, he reveals to them the location of the Exodus, one of the legendary &amp;quot;Lost Ships&amp;quot; with which the Human race began the colonization of the universe thousands of years ago. But strange things, a ruthless madman, and a race against time await the heroes within the hull of the ancient ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daring Tales of the Space Lanes are a pulp space adventure line for the award-winning Savage Worlds by Triple Ace Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
