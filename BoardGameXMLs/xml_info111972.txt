			<description>The ancient legends speaks about the mythical area G7, which will give the absolute dominance to the Empire will conquer it. For thousands of years, two opposing Empires try desperately to find the area. Effortless, because Gods have hidden this mythic area well. Until one day, the scouts bring good news to Emperors: the area G7 is finally revealed.&lt;br/&gt;The Empires are preparing, the armies are gathering around the mythic area for the battle will judge the supreme conqueror...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G7 Conquest is an abstract strategy game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;Every player has under their command different martial and Empire units. This can be done by conquering the G7 square or its surrounding squares or by capturing the enemy throne. The game-play has some similarities with the classic chess but it has many prototype elements, such as statistics of strength and dexterity depicted in any unit, powerful cannons which can turn 360o and fire at all directions.&lt;br/&gt;The strength and dexterity attributes of every unit can be changed by the Emperors of  each side, with their magic auras when they sit on their thrones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer of the game says that G7 Conquest will be called as the next generation Chess game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box contains:&lt;br/&gt;1 game board&lt;br/&gt;30 martial units&lt;br/&gt;4 cannons&lt;br/&gt;6 Emperors&lt;br/&gt;6 markers for the Emperor's auras&lt;br/&gt;2 player aids&lt;br/&gt;1 manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
