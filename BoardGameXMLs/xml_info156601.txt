							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninth Inning</name>
									
			<description>2 player quick card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game consists of players taking on the role of being the hitters vs the pitcher, in the 9th inning of a tied ball game. After three outs, players reverse roles and play the bottom of the ninth inning. Can you outscore your opponent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each at bat the pitcher tries to deceive the hitter to swing in the wrong area. However, the longer the at bat goes, the advantage swings into the hitters advantage. The longer the inning goes, so too will the hitting team get to know more what the pitcher is throwing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
