							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiger And Goat</name>
									
			<description>The Tiger and Goat game is an ancient two-player strategy board game played across the world in the genre of hunt games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has several different variations, all of which share the same basic rules. In The Tiger and Goat game, we present two of these variations, 'Bagh-Chal' (literally, the walk of the tiger), which is the national game of Nepal, and 'Aadu Puli Aatam' (literally, the tiger and goat game), which is a popular game played in south India. While each of these variations uses the same basic set of rules, they manage to be unique and enjoyable, and each require a different set of strategies to conquer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the game are very simple. If you're playing Tigers, you need to kill a specified number of the rival's Goats. However, if you're playing Goats, you need to block the movement of all Tigers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is core strategy. It requires a fair understanding of the principles of attack, defense, and teamwork, and is suitable for players of the ages 6 and up. While it takes just a few minutes to learn, it can take ages to master. This is a challenging game, and will test your strategy skills to the hilt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is configured to play at three different levels of difficulty. If you're tired of playing alone, invite someone to play on your iPhone or iPad, or connect to someone else on their iPad or iPhone using Bluetooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
