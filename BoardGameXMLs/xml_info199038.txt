							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Achievement Feats</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieve New Feats of Villainy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a villain isn&amp;rsquo;t about the powers you have, or the equipment you possess. Being a villain is about all of the horrible, terrible, and ultimately vile things that you do. The ability to cast fireball doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you villainous, but casting fireball on an orphanage run by nuns will change your alignment to evil real quick. This book presents 21 new achievement feats for villainous characters: feats whose prerequisites require you to complete heinous and nefarious deeds in order for you to be able to take them, providing the players of evil characters with encouragement and tangible rewards for being as evil as possible, and even giving them evil goals to strive to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you will find&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Cannibalistic Consumption, a feat that provides combat bonuses for eating the flesh of members of your own race.&lt;br/&gt;    Dark Possession, a feat that lets you overtax the bodies of creatures you possess, enhancing them while you control them and weakening them after you discard their shells.&lt;br/&gt;    Ritual Mutilation, a feat that allows you to mutilate corpses before turning them into undead in order to make them more powerful.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
