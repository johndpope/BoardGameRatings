			<description>Move your token from one of the center spaces to any corner space and back again.  You get to move whenever you're the first person to guess a word or phrase from clues provided by two players having a &amp;quot;Bialogue&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When having a &amp;quot;Bialogue&amp;quot;, your goal is to get one of the other players to guess a word or phrase from a card before the timer runs out.  One player says the first word of a sentence intended to provide clues about the word.  The other partner says the next word, and they continue back and forth, alternating one word each time.  They cannot discuss the word or the clues they're going to give.  The rest of the players all try at once to guess the word or phrase.  Everyone calls out ideas as fast as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles are earned or stolen from other players.  These tiles are placed on the game board to block token movement or to remove blockages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
