			<description>Summit was originally published by Minden Games, 1992. It was republished in Counter Magazine Issue 10, August, 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summit is a positional card game based very loosely on mountain climbing. The object of the game is to lead your expedition safely to the top of the mountain (21,000 feet). Equipping your party, establishing base camps, waiting out the weather, and making the final assault are among the important elements of gameplay. Through planning and the proper use of your cards (and a bit of luck) you may reach the summit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a map of the mountain and eight pages of rules. A token or marker, one six-sided die, and a standard 52-card deck are needed for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
