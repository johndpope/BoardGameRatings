			<description>This innovative game will help your child to develop critical thinking and problem solving--important math skills to have at any time of the year. This game was developed by a Kindergarten teacher and a speech-language pathologist. Players flip over a secret number card, listen for clues and use the arrows to uncover the secret number. You&amp;rsquo;ve got three chances to find a strategy and win the secret target. You can play &amp;lsquo;Double Digit Duo&amp;rsquo; and arrange the cards to make the largest double digit number possible. You can play &amp;lsquo;Secret Memory&amp;rsquo; and be the first to claim the most matching number cards. Multi-level play variations include skill building games, 44 self correcting double sided puzzle pieces, 42 secret number cards, 21 English and Spanish word cards and 22 wiggly arrows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
