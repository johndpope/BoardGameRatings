			<description>Game published in the The F.A. Book for Boys 1954/55.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play this football game are two counters and a die. Throw the die to see who kicks off first - highest begins. Then each player throws and moves in turn. When a player lands on the tail of an arrow he moves directly to the head of that arrow. The white arrows are good passes and take you more quickly to the goal. The black ones are free-kicks awarded against you and take you farther from the goal. If one player lands on top of another, this is a foul and he must go back 7 positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score a goal, you must throw the exact number required to reach the &amp;lsquo;Goal&amp;rsquo; circle. If a number is thrown that is too many, you must go backwards for the number left over and await your next turn before you can shoot again . . . and so on until you get the exact number to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try seeing how many goals you can score against a friend in half-an-hour (you can, of course, make it longer if you like). You might also form a local league, but if so all games should be the same period. Whatever the time-limit, the most goals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
