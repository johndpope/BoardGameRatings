			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange and Mystical Things for Any Fantasy Game Where the Fey Might Be Encountered&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed specifically for people playing 5e campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuing the combination of utility, imaginative content, and deep research found in Unpleasant Discoveries, Evil Beagle's resident scholar and master-of-cleverness, Michael Surbrook, brings another useful toolkit to bear for Game Masters who want to elevate their games. In this case, Feywild Discoveries is an extraordinary treatise on how to incorporate the mysterious and oft-times dangerous Fey into your fantasy campaign, including - &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Tons of information about what Fey might be enountered, how and when they might come into a game, what they might be and do, and why they act as they are wont to&lt;br/&gt;    Guidelines for introducing and roleplaying various Fey entities the heroes might encounter&lt;br/&gt;    An eleborate table for generating various Encounters and *Discoveries in the Feywild and anywhere magic holds sway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That last part is the true meat of the product, as it can enhance any fantasy game with a couple of simple rolls, making it an invaluable tool for any GM hoping for some quick-and-easy help in elevating their scenario with the magic, wonder, and possible terror of the Fey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
