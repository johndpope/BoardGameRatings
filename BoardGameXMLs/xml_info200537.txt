			<description>Word Game is one of a series of educational card games published at the turn of the 20th Century by Cincinnati Game Co.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of 111 half-size cards, each bearing a single letter, with the number of each letter varying from 1 (j, k, q, v, x, y, z) to 12 (e). The rules booklet describes a Primary Exercise for first-year students, three Group Games and four Class Exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Group Game 2, for instance, one of each vowel is placed face up on the table, and the rest of the vowel cards are distributed randomly to the players and also placed face up. The rest of the cards are distributed face down as equally as possible. Each player draws a hand of five consonants, and then in turn try to form words using cards in hand and vowels on table. Players may also play cards from hand that add to existing words and make new, longer ones. The first player to empty his hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule booklet concludes with rules for using this deck to play Niloe, a word game published separately by Cincinnati predecessor Fireside Game Co. in 1896.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
