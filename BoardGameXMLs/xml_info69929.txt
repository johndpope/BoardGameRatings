			<description>It is not just a board game, the packaging consist of a comics and it reaches beyond the classical board games - it is a helping hand for people in Africa. They make each and every one of the Kiumbi characters, which are in the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is mainly focused on children as it the whole design. It contains five characters, that are amazingly designed and handcrafted. They &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; on one side of the box in a little space with holes, so they can breathe.&lt;br/&gt;It plays quickly. The game board is round, with five pathways to centre and nine points, that leads to victory. On start of each pathway you put one Kiumbi character and secretly choose one of them, who you will support.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets three cards with symbol, that matches one game character. When you play this card, that character moves one space to the center. But there are influences between characters - water tames fire and so on, so when you play fire, fire character moves one space forward, but another two characters move too - one forward and one backward. These influences are nicely shown on the board.&lt;br/&gt;When first of kiumbis reaches the centre the game ends and who has supported this character wins. Game can also end sooner, when somebody guesses another players secret favorit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
