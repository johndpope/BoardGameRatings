			<description>Celestialzy (pronounced celestial-zee) is an LDS dice rolling game somewhat similar to Yahtzee but with a few significant changes. Players roll five dice up to three times to score in 12 categories. The dice have symbols instead of numbers that are relevant to the LDS faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sun - The Celestial Kingdom&lt;br/&gt;Moon - The Terrestrial Kingdom&lt;br/&gt;Stars - The Telestial Kingdom&lt;br/&gt;Dipper - The Big Dipper &amp;quot;points the way&amp;quot; to the North Star.&lt;br/&gt;Cloud - Earth (2nd Estate)&lt;br/&gt;Comet - Messengers from God (Angels)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scoring and categories used on the card are different from Yahtzee with some symbols being worth as much as 25 points per die. Also included are categories for rolling different dice (large and small universe). The player with the highest score wins, unless someone rolls five suns in which case that player wins immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
