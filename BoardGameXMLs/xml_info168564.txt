			<description>Journey to the West, published in 16th century, is one of the four major classic novels of Chinese literature. In the story, Master Xuanzang and his four disciples traveled west seeking sacred religious scrolls in India. Long after the fellowship passed the Mountain of Inferno, they came to meet another fierce challenge in the Cavern of Gossamer ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavern of Gossamer is a 2-4 player  micro game based on this chapter in Journey to the West. In the game, players are characters in the novel using their abilities and other disciples, spiders, etc. to rescue or slay the Master. The goal of the disciples is to find their Master and rescue him so they can continue their journey.
