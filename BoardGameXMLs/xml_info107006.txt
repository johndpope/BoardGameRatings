			<description>From publisher's catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIGHTER COMMAND gives you the thrilling opportunity to rewrite or relive the strategies of one of the greatest aerial battles ever fought: The Battle of Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the German commander you'll try to lure up R.A.F. fighters by bombing British airfields, radar stations, planes, and major cities.  It'll be up to your own fighers such as the ME-109s to engage the formidable Spitfires and Hurricanes.  Every squadron, or groupe, is rated for experience and morale, and the computer will immediately calculate the increases (or decreases) in each after a mission is flown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As British Commander your goal is to knock the attacking German planes out of the sky.  You will assign squadrons to patrols and to different levels of readiness, keeping in mind the trade-offs between quick mobilization of planes and loss of morale due to exhaustion.  You'll also have to define tactical orders for each type of aircraft.  Like the Germans, you'll have intelligence and readiness reports to give you results of each day's fighting.  Colorful Hi-Res graphic displays let you view the entire southern half of England in one map or three different close-up maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play the entire 34-turn campaign or choose any of three shorter games (including the explosive, one-turn &amp;quot;Eagle Day&amp;quot; scenario).  Furthermore, you'll never lack an opponent with this game because the computer is always ready to take over the German Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Charles Merrow and Jack Avery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
