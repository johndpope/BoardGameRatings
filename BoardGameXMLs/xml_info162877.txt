			<description>Counter Terrorist Warfare in the 21st Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rules set has been developed primarily to focus on an infantry existence in modern day war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules used for fighting a battle with miniature figures on tabletop terrain revolve around basic functions, each of which has many ramifications. A general description follows, and this will offer an overview of what actions a tabletop game covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book and The Gun is a realistic small unit action war game that is easy to learn and relatively quick to play, while containing the depth needed to meet the players' desire for a realistic tactical tabletop miniatures game. Vehicles and aircraft rules have been abstracted as support for the infantry fight and to that end players should not attempt to recreate large scale mechanized actions with these rules as you will be disappointed.&lt;br/&gt;Players should look at how the rules can be modified to accommodate armies of these periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no reason, with proper modification, why these rules cannot be used to portray small-scale infantry actions in Vietnam, Korea, and WW2. Indeed, these rules can portray small actions such SWAT rescues and police actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, it is present day, and anywhere in the world you want to take your fire team or squad and fight is up to you and your imagination. Collecting a large army is not necessary in order to play. All it takes is a minimum of 3 soldiers per side and a little bit of model terrain to enter the firefight of your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 full turn equals 2 minutes game scale. Each player turn is one minute in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troop scale is basically 1 figure represents one man and one vehicle model represents one vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
