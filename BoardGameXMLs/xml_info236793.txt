			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rooster's crow wakes you all. Well, Wisdom is a bit slow waking up, but that's normal. Before you open your eyes, you quickly review your day. You have several things you'd like to do before breakfast, which is in an hour. After breakfast, you have a most pleasant prospect, today is payday. Before you pick up your pay, you have agreed to meet a young squire, Roderick by name. He says he needs your expert advice. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma always have plenty of that, you're looking forward to helping him out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you pick up your pay, you must decide what to do with it. Again, you have quite a few ideas for the disposition of your hard earned gold. But first, you must decide what to do now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
