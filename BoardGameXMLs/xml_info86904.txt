			<description>Fifth title in the Famous Five Adventure Games book series. A &amp;quot;make your own adventure game&amp;quot; based on the Famous Five children's book, &amp;quot;Five Go to Demon's Rocks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start at the first paragraph and roll the Famous Five die to select the first step on their adventure. In subsequent paragraphs, players receive instructions about how to proceed: they must make decisions about which way to go next, roll the die, or solve clues using the included playing cards (in the shape of various tools, such as a torch or a codebook). The more clues solved, the better chance of unraveling the final mystery. And running out of provisions (picnic cards) automatically ends the adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this original series of Adventure Game Books, YOU decide what they do and whether they solve the mystery or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to play the game is contained in your own Adventure Wallet. Inside it, you will find a book and a selection of playing cards including a codebook, measure card, torch, map, and rucksack &amp;mdash; and to refresh you in your adventure, a lunchbox and picnic cards! There is even a special Famous Five dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played over and over again, as many times as you like. For there are a variety of routes to the solution and each route involves different clues and adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
