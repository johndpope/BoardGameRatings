			<description>Flipp! is a game where you came up with words that are difficult for the opposing team to explain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are divided in two teams. Then dice are rolled to determine which letters teams have to use in their words. Then hourglasses are turned and teams formulate words based on the letters given earlier. The opposing teams has exactly the same amount of time to figure out the words that your team spent formulating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team gets a point for every word they guess. For every word that is not guessed the opposing team gets two points. Both teams have a pawn that is moved forwards on a game board when they score points. The first team to make it to the finish is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nordic version has seven dice of which four are language dependant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
