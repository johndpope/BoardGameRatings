							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Expresso</name>
									
			<description>Each card of 'Expresso' contains five words on the front and five words on the back of the same figure of speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, the 'Expresso' cards are mixed and then placed in the center of the table. Players are divided into two teams of similar size on both sides. The starting player chooses one of five colors that correspond to words that will be played throughout the game: blue, green, pink, brown, or purple. He draws a card from under the package that held vertically between the thumb and forefinger so that both teams only see one side from the the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams must find the word of the opposite team. All players are so many proposals out loud as they want and when any player has the word that is written on the other side of the card, he wins and gets the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player or the first team to get seven cards wins the round. Obtained two rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
