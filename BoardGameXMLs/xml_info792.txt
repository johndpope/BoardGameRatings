							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Megiddo</name>
									
			<description>Megiddo is played on a round board consisting of six rings connected by six spokes. Each player in turn places a stone on one of the intersections in an attempt to get six pieces in a row in one of several configurations. A row of six could be either along a spoke, around a ring, or most interestingly, in a spiral from innermost to outermost rings. A win could also be achieved by capturing enough pairs of opposing pieces by bracketing them on either side.&lt;br/&gt;Megiddo won the &amp;quot;Best new game&amp;quot; at the International Toy and Hobby Fair held at Olympia, London 1986&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEGIDDO GAME REDESIGNED FOR A NEW GENERATION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This challenging game of strategy was first developed by Steve Baldwin in the mid-1980's. It became very popular with players around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, Steve&amp;rsquo;s son Josh decided to re-release Megiddo with an updated design and new innovative rule change. Kl&amp;uuml;ndt | Hosmer re-designed the look of the game for a new generation of players. A redesigned board, instruction booklet and packaging brought new energy to this timeless game, named after an ancient Hebrew city where numerous historical battles were waged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Megiddo will be available for purchase on Amazon.com and will soon be available as an app for iPhone and Android smart phones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We love design. And sometimes it really does feel like a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Klundt Hosmer website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
