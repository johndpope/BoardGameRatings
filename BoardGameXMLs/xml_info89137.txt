			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard Fire is an arcade title developed by Data East and the direct sequel to Gate of Doom. The game is set in a fantasy world in the IV Century AD. An evil wizard plans to take 101 lives to open the Dragon Shrine, and it falls to the Shining Knights of the Wizard Fire to thwart his machinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard Fire is an RPG style beat &amp;lsquo;em up, with hordes of enemies attacking the players in every level. Players can either quest solo or as a two person team, and there are five characters to choose from &amp;ndash; the Knight, Wizard, Bard, Dwarf, and Elf. Each character has unique strengths and weaknesses that differentiate it from the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levels are shown isometrically, and characters are able to attack in 8 directions. Players cannot attack and move at the same time, however. Many stages are capped with boss fights, and treasure chests litter the maps. The chests contain artefacts that upgrade a character&amp;rsquo;s stats and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
