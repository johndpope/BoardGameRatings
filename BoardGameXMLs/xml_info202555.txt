			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our story begins with a rash promise made by the well in the castle courtyard. The princess was playing with her golden ball on the edge of the well when the ball fell into the water. The princess was sobbing&amp;hellip; in her despair, she even promised the frog who hurried to help her that in exchange for the ball, he may go with her to the palace. &lt;br/&gt;The frog helped gladly, hoping that this girl would finally break the curse and turn him back into a handsome prince once again with her kiss, but when the princess held her favorite toy in her hands again, she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to keep any of her promises anymore, and she left him. The frog went after her to remind her of her forgotten promise&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player plays with a frog figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting from the 4 corners of the maze , frogs advance on tiles that are laid face down. When your frog lands on a tile path is discovered. &lt;br/&gt;Make sure you avoid the maid though, she chases the frogs.&lt;br/&gt;When a frog is caught by the maid, it has to start again from a corner of the maze and the path will be hidden again so memorizing what is on which tile is important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     the  first player to reach the castle via the path (avoiding the maid) in the middle of the board may kiss the princess, the frog will become a prince now and that player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
