			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occult rituals, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, bring magic to the masses, with lengthy and difficult to perform magical rites which can be performed even by non-spellcasters, but which come with a cost, as well as the risk for terrible backlash to occur for those who meddle in things they do not understand. Unlike traditional spells, only a handful of occult rituals made it into that book however, which begs the question of what other strange and unknowable rituals might be lurking about in obscure tomes lost to history and memory. Tomes like this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a collection of 10 brand new occult rituals for use in your game, all of which are thematically linked to mirrors and the folklore surrounding them. Presented in the guise of a fictitious tome that player characters might stumble across, the book also includes a flavorful introductory section that can be read aloud or handed out to players, and suggestions for how to incorporate the book into your game. The rituals in this book allow players (or NPCs) to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Alter a creature&amp;rsquo;s reflection, or remove or grant a reflection.&lt;br/&gt;    Afflict foes with a powerful curse, binding their life to a hand mirror and eventually shattering their body like glass.&lt;br/&gt;    Cause a mirror to reveal the deepest desires of anyone that views it, or show those creatures&amp;rsquo; true forms.&lt;br/&gt;    Step from one mirror directly to another across vast distances.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
