			<description>Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers is a 1999 adventure game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Infinite Ventures and published by Kemco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowgate 64 has the same first-person view of the first game, though this time the static screens were replaced by a full 3D roaming similar to that of the first-person shooters. Despite the change of perspective the core game is similar: the game relies mostly on solving puzzles and riddles rather than fighting enemies. The warden and dwarf-like guards are the only enemies to be found, and they have to be avoided. There are many instances in which Del can die, such as a fall from a moderate distance or dropping into deep water. The player must find ways around everything through interaction with the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the extensive menu-based actions of the first game, Shadowgate 64 simplifies most of this actions down to two buttons, one as a generic action command, while other uses items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
