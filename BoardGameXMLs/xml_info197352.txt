			<description>Flash Assassins is a easy-to-setup, moderator-free update of the classic game Assassins. To play, just deal the assassin cards out, shift the target tokens, draw your character, and start hunting your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flash Assassins has a number of improvements on the classic game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Three minute setup.&lt;br/&gt;     It can be played with 3-30 players.&lt;br/&gt;     Games can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 years.&lt;br/&gt;     There are a variety of weapons to choose from - one for every setting, level of physical activity, and desired duration of game.&lt;br/&gt;     It can be played almost anywhere: at home, in a park, in a pub, in the car, and in the office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;After characters and targets are assigned using the Flash Assassins character cards and target tokens, the game begins and players try to assassinate each other following the rules for each weapon while avoiding being killed themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can only assassinate their target. Once they kill their target, they acquire the target of the killed player. The killed player should tell their killer the name of their target and hand over their Target token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is not played in rounds or turns but continuously within whatever time and place boundaries the group agrees on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player left in the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
