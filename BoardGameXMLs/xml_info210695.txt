			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1992. Pablo Escobar&amp;rsquo;s ascent in drug trafficking has reached its peak.&lt;br/&gt;His empire has expanded, reaching the USA, saturating the market with Colombian cocaine.&lt;br/&gt;Colombia&amp;rsquo;s response is the Search Bloc, a Special Operations group.&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a side in this war, trying to overcome the other, while avoiding the intervention of the USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will use cards to influence the control of 7 different regions, while controlling asymmetric factions.&lt;br/&gt;Carrying out &amp;ldquo;orders&amp;rdquo; that are formed by the juxtaposition of 2 cards, one a destination and the other the actions for that destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pablo will want to produce and sell his cocaine while the Search Bloc will try to stop production and seize some it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While both sides amass casualties, those of the Search Bloc will eventually lead to the intervention of the USA, which will be one of the challenges of the Search Bloc player, while Pablo needs to get a continuous flow of money to pursue his operations. &lt;br/&gt;Money used to play cards and influence and secure a spot in the political dealings of Colombia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you rewrite history?&lt;br/&gt;Will you stop Pablo&amp;rsquo;s ascent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
