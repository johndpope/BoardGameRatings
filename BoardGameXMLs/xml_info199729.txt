							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lord of the Fries: McPubihan&#039;s Irish Pub Deck</name>
									
			<description>This is an 54 card expansion deck for Lord of the Fries continuing the Zombies working in a restaurant theme to an Irish Pub. Ingredients: bread, potatoes, stout, whiskey. veggies, cow meat and fish meat are combined in various humorously renamed Irish recipes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics are essentially the same as the base game with the addition of the &amp;quot;stew pot&amp;quot; a collection of face-up cards created by a discard of a single card by each player after the initial deal. Players may, on their turn, exchange one card with one from the stew pot prior to filling an order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides being an expansion to Lord of the Fries, this can be played as a stand alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
