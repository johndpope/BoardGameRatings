							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Circle Soiree</name>
									
			<description>Circle Soiree is a tablet-based party game for 3-10 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, each player must place one finger in a circle and never leave or let go of the circle. Once the circles start to move and animate, the players must work as a team. They all have to keep their fingers in the circles as long as possible, this means they have to climb over and under each other, as well as keep moving all the way around the tablet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
