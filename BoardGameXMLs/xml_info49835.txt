			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Lurks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know the history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All have read about the founding of America. This history shows what led to the American Revolution and the cry for independence. The history is clear, and there is no real dispute over these events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or is there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a secret history, and this history deals with events that took place in the shadows. These events played a role in the history of the American colonies and the Revolution that few know about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The truth is hidden, and plots are afoot. Events are moving behind the scenes, and lurking in the shadows are agents with their own agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is coming. The Siege of Boston is lifted, and General Washington is leading the Continental Army to New York. The enemies are many, but as to who they are, you do not know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonial Gothic is a supernatural historical horror roleplaying game set during the dawn of the American Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the original version (1st ed) of the rulebook. A revised version (Colonial Gothic Rulebook (Revised)) also exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1776&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is fractured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colonies are in the midst of a great Rebellion. &lt;br/&gt;Lady Liberty's fire burns brightly day and night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in the shadows, darker threats wait to prey upon the &lt;br/&gt;Innocent. They were here before the Colonists arrived. &lt;br/&gt;They were here before the Natives tamed the Land. &lt;br/&gt;They will remain long after both are Dust&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are Immortal, and they only have one desire &amp;ndash; to erase &lt;br/&gt;the Living Stain that pollutes their ancient Prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two Battles are about to be joined.&lt;br/&gt;No one knows who will win. One Battle is fought with &lt;br/&gt;Gunpowder and Bravery &amp;ndash; the other is a Ware of the Soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fought in Boston's Alleyways, Savannah's Docks,&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania's Frontiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few brave survivors record desperate fragments of&lt;br/&gt;information, warning whomever will listen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no such thing as Freedom, only War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the story of the Thirteen Original Colonies,&lt;br/&gt;a tale not told in history books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
