			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dangerous Hunts is a first-person shooter in which the player goes on hunting trips. The game features &amp;quot;Quick Hunt&amp;quot;, which lets players jump right into the action by choosing equipment, a hunting tag and hunting the required animal. In &amp;quot;Action Zone&amp;quot;, you start off in a small portion of a map and a certain amount of a dangerous animal will appear. Once the animals are hunted by the player, a portal opens to the next round. &amp;quot;Career Mode&amp;quot;, allows players to create a profile and then customize their stats, age, and appearance. In all three modes there are penalties for non-game animals, which will result in failing. Terrain is another thing the player must pay attention to. Falling into deep streams or off of high ledges can result in an injury and failing the hunt. Aggressive animals such as bear, cape buffalo, and leopard will attack you, which too results in injury and failure. The player also has an energy limit. After a while of hunting, the player will become tired and need to slow down. This effect can be reduced by carrying lighter equipment and conserving energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
