			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this Blueprint you&amp;rsquo;ll find maps for four locations in the Ruined Town.&lt;br/&gt;Set your band of adventurers for exploring the famed Dungeon of the Gray Stones, or take them to the occupied Temple of the Black Moon. Your party may want to seek the wisdom of a retired adventurer living in a small farm or maybe they want to solve the mystery of the strange lights seen during the night in the crumbled farm...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Blueprint contains maps used in the Iron Crown Enterprises&amp;rsquo; adventure module &amp;ldquo;A Wedding at Axebridge&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small Farm (located just east of #19, Temple of the Green Sister on the Ruined Town map)&lt;br/&gt;This farm is the home of a retired old adventurer. Nobody knows his actual name; he introduces himself simply as &amp;ldquo;Jim&amp;rdquo;. Many believe &amp;ldquo;Jim&amp;rdquo; is actually a very famous hero of the past who, for unknown reasons, retired in such haunted and solitary place...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crumbled Farm (#21 on the Ruined Town Map)&lt;br/&gt;Something sinister happened in the crumbled farm. Strange and odd lights are seen during the night and people swear to have seen ghostly figures lurking in the ruins of the farm...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temple of the Black Moon (Northwest section of the Ruined Town Map)&lt;br/&gt;This temple was plundered and destroyed during the war, but recently a young priest of the Black Moon occupied it along with a bunch of followers. He intended to reconstruct the forgotten cult but something strange happened...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circle of the Gray Stones (Northeast section of the Ruined Town Map)&lt;br/&gt;This circle of stones already existed before the town was founded. It was a sacred place for all the inhabitants of the Town who made their living from the earth and from the animals...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon of the Gray Stones (Northeast section of the Ruined Town Map)&lt;br/&gt;This very ancient dungeon was once an underground temple devoted to a long-forgotten deity of procreation. Wise druids sealed the temple when they discovered a disturbing thing: the underground temple was built by using the stones of much older evil temple...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
