							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faldor: World of Adventure</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faldor, a primitive planet only a few parsecs from the borders of the Imperium, but remote in terms of society, technology, and culture. For centuries isolated at the behest of sociologists interested in charting the progress of cultures stranded on the world long ago and reduced to the verge of savagery, Faldor has only recently been opened to contact with traders from the stars. The hazards of dealing with primitive cultures and natural hazards require a courageous and skilled breed of adventurer to meet the challenges of this new world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventures come to Faldor as part of a company trading team, making a routine call at the planet to take on cargo and check on the well-being of company employees on the planet. A routine stop on a routine voyage. But routine can be deceptive, and it's possible that some of the those who come to Faldor may never leave...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faldor - World of Adventure lies ahead. It is a place of primitive peoples and of potential wealth. But it is also a world full of potential danger...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
