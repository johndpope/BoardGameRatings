			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 2122, and Earth has been defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mecha: Reign of the Descended is a game of furious mecha combat. You struggle to survive on a war-ravaged Earth that has been enslaved by a powerful alien race. You play one of the few survivors&amp;mdash;lucky and unlucky by turns&amp;mdash;of the terrible events surrounding the aliens&amp;rsquo; arrival, a two-hour period that saw 90 percent of humanity eradicated by powerful alien weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mecha: Reign of the Descended is primarily a game of survival in a world controlled by strange aliens. There are as many ways to survive as there are humans left on this world. A few find comfort working for their alien masters. Some will hunker down and try to protect their families and those closest to them. Others will find that their skills as merchants or builders are needed in this new world. Still others will take the fight to the enemy using powerful mecha. After all, the Descended are creatures of flesh and blood. Shoot them and they will die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, rest easy, human&amp;mdash;hope is not lost. Before the Descended came, the limited infinity drive flung humanity to the stars. Earth&amp;rsquo;s colonies may yet be marshaling their forces for a counterattack, to free their home world and drive the weird aliens from this universe. Only time will tell. In the meantime, how you spend your time on this Earth is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
