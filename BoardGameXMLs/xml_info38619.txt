							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medieval Castle Siege</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;A well-built castle could control the surrounding countryside and was very difficult to capture. If you couldn't take it by trickery or treachery your best option was to wait for disease and starvation to force the garrison to surrender.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If the castle was well provisioned, or the attackers were in a hurry, then a direct assault might be attempted. The tactics used were basically unchanged since ancient times. Moats could be filled, a ram could bash in the gate, and catapults and trebuchets could knock down the walls. Ladders or a siege tower could also surmount the walls. Another popular (and dangerous) tactic was to undermine the walls with a tunnel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted one per stand. Free print-and-play paper miniature soldiers and siege engines are also provided for use with the rules, as is a paper castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The siege weaponry and implements portrayed in the game includes the ballista, boiling oil, catapult, covered ram, siege tower, mantlet, and bombard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, the attackers must take control of the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
