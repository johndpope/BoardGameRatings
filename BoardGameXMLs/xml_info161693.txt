			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the first feast of the summer in amber-dale glen. First, everything is fun and lighthearted. However, now a few dibbuns have gone missing&amp;hellip; Where are they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Snake, not ready to devour them yet, has captured the dibbuns, the snake has left three toads to guard them. The toads are unwilling servants of the snake, wishing they could get away, but knowing that the snake could track them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elders of Amber-dale glen have chosen to search for the dibbuns. They have created parties of  townsfolk to search; the PC&amp;rsquo;s are such a party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs will meet up with the snake; or, will they find the dibbuns and think that the toads captured  them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
