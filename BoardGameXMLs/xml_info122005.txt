			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action adventure game in which a Troll must collect crystals while avoiding Goblins and their deadly touch. The Troll has holes in his pockets, which he can throw on the floor to warp himself to a new chamber, or to trap a goblin. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;HUMGRUFFIN, a large and amiable Troll, has accidentally stumbled into the netherworld of Narc, an eldritch land of crystal caverns populated by a race of manically malevolant Goblins. Knowing his only chance of escape is to reverse the spell that put him in such a predicament, he realises that this can be done by taking the key crystal from each chamber and placing each one in its amulet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by Palace Software, later sold as a budget by Kixx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
