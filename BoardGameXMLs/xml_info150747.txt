			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;A TRAVELLER ADVENTURE FOR 2-6 PLAYERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from about the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;A derelict starship of unknown origin has shown up at the edge of the sector. It has no apparent damage, and it is absolutely massive - roughly half the size of a small moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its existence has been noted by a number of major players in the system. Each of them is preparing a team to board the ship, and hopefully score whatever treasures it possesses before the others can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, something horrific is lying in wait aboard the vessel. It has the simple mind of an uncompromising, pure predator &amp;ndash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feed, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t reason, it just kills. While it is dormant at the beginning of the adventure, eventually one of the many parties boarding the ship will wake it up. At that point, the job of capturing the ship becomes much, much harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
