							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Ride Kursk: Advanced CSS Maintenance</name>
									
			<description>For those playes of the Death Ride Kursk series who want a bit more detail in the play of the game and a feel that puts a player on the team in the seat of the S4, this enhancement package will provide you with a simple, uncomplicated, inexpensive way to make the play of the game more interesting, more realistic, and more thoughtful.  This package includes:&lt;br/&gt; a 1 page DRK rules supplement for the enhancement of maintenance operations&lt;br/&gt;a Maintenance Track to hold the wrecks as they are being repaired&lt;br/&gt;a Maintenance Chart that determines how long damage will take to repair and at what level (bn, Regt/Bde, Div, etc)&lt;br/&gt;(3) unit counter sheets with some Recovery untis and wreck markers&lt;br/&gt; This package will be good for all 3 Death Ride Kursk games and there will be no need to purchase a separate one for each game.  This package serves all.  The package comes in a photo envelope and is meant to be added to one of the other games for storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features the need for players to go and recover the destroyed units and bring them back to either their HQ, or maintenance units for repair.  Those repairs will take various times to be complete.  This will provide some additional critical thinking to decide how to recover these wrecks so that they don't get destroyed themselves and where to place them so that they can recover the wrecks in the most efficient manner possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
