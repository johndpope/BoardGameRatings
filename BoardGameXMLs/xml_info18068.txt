			<description>Two players/teams compete to make anagrams. A phrase is drawn and a minute timer set for the recommended length. Tiles are used to spell the phrase on each console. Players/teams then try to rearrange the letters into successful anagrams of the phrase. 2 points are scored for every &amp;quot;self explanatory&amp;quot; anagram, with 1 point for anything demanding explanation from the opposition. Depending on the difficulty, a number of cards are played until the final scores are tallied and one team is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
