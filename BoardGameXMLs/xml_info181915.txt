							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebels of Krobon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the revolution against Krang wages on in the Krobon Empire, many heroes have proven themselves in the fight against the despotic Promethean. However, the crew of one particular warship in the rebel fleet is regarded as a particularly apt example of the stern stuff the Krobon freedom fighters are made of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crew of the VSS Indomitable is a cross section of the races of Krobon who are standing defiantly against Krang the Merciless. They&amp;rsquo;re led by a maverick Vanusian noble, Prince Dakon, with a Lion Man warrior, Tereon, as his security officer, a former Chiropteran pirate, Vesper, as his pilot and a Vegetable Man ,Viridi, as his engineer and science officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Showing an unusual degree of initiative and succeeding repeatedly at bold operations that were deemed by High Command to be &amp;ldquo;crackpot&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;too risky&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;simply suicidal&amp;rdquo;, the Indomitable has gained the reputation as the ship that can get almost any mission accomplished no matter the odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These characters are ready to be enemies, allies or NPCs in your ICONS game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
