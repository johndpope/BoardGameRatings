			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Steel: A Spinward Marches Adventure Sequence for Traveller From Comstar Games and the Author of the Spinward Marches Sourcebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Steel&lt;br/&gt;A controversial initiative to open up a continent of the world Steel for Imperial development. Fraught with political compromises and operating on a shoestring budget, the project offers a chance to reduce tensions between the Imperium and the Sword Worlds, perhaps averting future conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;br/&gt;Arriving on Steel to join the project, a freelance exploration team heads out into the wilderness on what appears to be a simple surveying mission. What they find is a complex situation requiring good judgement in a desperate situation. Their decision will have consequences for the future of the project and everyone on Steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Range War&lt;br/&gt;As civilization begins to flower on Steel, the settlers face a new threat. Brutal raiders are advancing on the half-built starport, apparently determined to destroy the fledgling colony. As the Imperials dig in for a desperate last stand it falls to the travellers to buy enough time for a miracle born of honor and mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mouth of Hell&lt;br/&gt;As the Steel Project recovers from the raider attack, a team of adventurers must cross the mountains to rescue a stranded survey team. This simple task leads to the discovery of Steel&amp;rsquo;s terrible secret. In a desert canyon far from aid or assistance, the travellers must battle for their own survival and the salvation of everyone on Steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
