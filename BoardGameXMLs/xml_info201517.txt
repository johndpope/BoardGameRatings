Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect Dark Core was intended as a sequel to Perfect Dark, but development only got as far as a prototype. Perfect Dark Core would have brought some drastic changes to the franchise. Perfect Dark Zero was developed by the remains of the original Perfect Dark team. During development of Perfect Dark Core, the team made drastic changes to this original concept. The player did no longer control Joanna Dark, but a male character that was also seen in gameplay footage that was leaked in 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
