			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again the fires of war burn throughout the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Terran Empire has ruled over most of humanity for the last 100 years. Unlike earlier despotic governments the Empire makes no claims to be beneficial to the people it dominates. There are no illusions of equality, fairness, freedom, or prosperity; there is only obedience and suffering. To be a common citizen in the Terran Empire is to endure a life without hope, meet death alone, and to have ones lifeless body used to feed the countless multitude. But then you are not a common citizen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a role player in the Omnigon universe, a player character is able to choose his character's race from a diverse group of alien beings (humans included). Each race is presented in a way which outlines that races innate &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; abilities. Also each race has a complete historical background and cultural belief system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnigon's system for player character skill development, character class definition, psionic usage, and combat are unique. These systems are easily understood and simple to manipulate. The vast weapon selection is highly detailed and allows the player to tailor the weapon to his needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnigon is excellent for role-playing your favorite science fiction table top battle games. With a minimum of effort players can use Omnigon to recreate almost any future setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
