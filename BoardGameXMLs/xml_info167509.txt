			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Girl Fight is a fighting game where the entire cast is female. Each of Girl Fight's characters can tap into customizable &amp;quot;psi-amp abilities&amp;quot; which give them access to various powers such as becoming invisible, regenerating health with each successful hit landed, or dealing bonus damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an in-game currency called &amp;quot;Combits&amp;quot; which accrues every time a player executes a move properly. Combits can be used at the in-game store to purchase extra abilities, unlock cast members' stories, alternative costumes, or bonus artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The online &amp;quot;Wager System&amp;quot; will give players random challenges before a match; players who fulfill these challenges will be rewarded with Combits, even if they lose the overall match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scientific organization collects female subjects across the world with powerful psionic abilities. The women are plugged into a virtual world where they must fight to survive and return to the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
