							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tilt: The Star of Card Games</name>
									
			<description>Tilt is a self-published card game system which utilizes a 66-card deck. The cards are divied into eight suits (A, B, F, L, O, R, S, U) with eight cards per suit (HIGH, DOUBLE, 4, 3, 2, 1, TWIN, LOW). Two other cards are included, the ROYAL E and a WILD card, each of which have a rank of 0 when necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 34 page rulebook describes seven games:&lt;br/&gt;Regular Tilt&lt;br/&gt;Reverse Tilt&lt;br/&gt;Double Tilt&lt;br/&gt;Royal Tilt&lt;br/&gt;Chain Letter&lt;br/&gt;Vocab&lt;br/&gt;Tilt Crossword Solitaire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tilt family of games are trick-taking games where certain ranks are worth 1 or 2 points. One suit per player, plus one extra for a dummy hand, are used. Players bid for the right to name a trump suit, and the winner draws two cards from the dummy to improve his hand (and discarding two unwanted cards). The different versions change the rules or scoring in various ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chain Letter is a stops-style game where players try to discard their hand by matching the last-played card. Only suits count, not ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vocab is a spelling game where players use the cards as letters, trying to make three-letter words. The TWIN cards count as two letters, so TWIN L is LL, TWIN A is AA, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tilt Crossword Solitaire is as it sounds, a solitaire game where the player fills an 8 by 8 grid with cards. Points are earned for letters in words or abbreviations, while they are lost for empty spaces in the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game and rulebook are copyright 1946 by William H. Mulder. The place of publication is Grand Rapids, Michigan. No manufacturer is listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
