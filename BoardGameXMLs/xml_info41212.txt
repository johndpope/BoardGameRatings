			<description>Por'rika(c) (Sacred Waters) is an old Schelati(c) game. The Schelati are a species of amphibians that have, since the beginning of recorded history, laid their eggs in the Sacred Waters. These Sacred Waters, however, happened to be located in the prime hunting territory for the Ser'ra(c), large birds of prey that were the Schelati's only natural enemy. The game is based on this conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the copper side is to get both Egg-Carriers into the Scared Water spaces. The object of the silver side is to stop that from happening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entry into the About.com: 2002 Unequal Forces Game Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
