			<description>From the rulebook (translated):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kaiten: Die Sushi-Bar every player takes the role of a sushi chef. Collect the correct ingredients, produce different sorts of sushi and take care of your guests!&lt;br/&gt;Full people are happy people and the tip will be generous - sometimes.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, the player owning the most money wins, called the most successful sushi chef!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to buy and combine ingredients (wooden cubes) following different recipes (combinations) to make sushi (earn sushi tokens). These will be placed on player-colored plates onto a sushi-belt (the board) to feed up hungry guests. The guests - represented by guest cards and mostly with unique special rules - take place around the sushi-belt wishing for a variety of different sushi types.&lt;br/&gt;On turn, players can choose from different fixed actions like buying ingredients, making sushi or cleaning dirty plates. Or they can roll a die to perform special actions (for example changing plates places on the belt) or to activate events like new guests or moving all the plates on the belt one field clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends instantly when the last guest leaves the restaurant and the player owning the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
