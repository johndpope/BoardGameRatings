			<description>Bologna, XIIIth century. The Empire, the Papacy and guilds of arts and crafts are the powers that govern the city, with its ancient university and its population of 60000, it is the fifth most populous city in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these years, Bologna is the largest textile center of Italy and its complex network of channels provides energy to the silk industry by connecting the city with the rest of the land, from the river Po to the Adriatic Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bologna is a rich and cosmopolitan city where you eat well and drink even better, but it is also a city plagued by extreme social differences, political conspiracies, wars and plagues. In short, life is never boring!&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls people and resources in order to claim the most important and coveted place of power in the city: &amp;ldquo;The Throne of Bologna&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;Claiming the Iron Throne would be a piece of cake in comparison. No weapons and no means are barred:will you be able to fulfill your goals and become the King of Bologna?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME GOALS&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a role in the fictional version of Bologna depicted in &amp;rdquo;The Throne of Bologna&amp;rdquo;: to select their role, each player draws a Role card, which they must keep secret from the other players until the end of the game. Turn after turn players roll their dice to gain goods and resources or to unleash devastating effects against their rivals (or even upon themselves!): The game&amp;rsquo;s strategy depends on the role you are playing and on your own experience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
