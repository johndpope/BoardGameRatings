			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the tenth entry in our line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2336, the small Boone based company Boone Starship Industries embarked on a program to modify the Rucker-class merchant vessel in order to improve cargo handling capability and to bring down monthly costs for operators.  After a year of successive failures to bring this vision to reality, the design director took a proposal to the company board that a new design was what was needed instead of attempting to modify an already successful existing design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board of directors agreed and design work commenced on a new merchant ship (simply called type one) that included the cargo handling improvements initially proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the six months of design, the initial three hundred tonne design was increased to four hundred tonnes to improve cargo capacity. Outwardly the type one was inspired by the style of the larger Atlas-class freighter which was license-built and maintained by BSI&amp;rsquo;s main shipyard orbiting Boone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The type one became the Lee-class merchant vessel and is now one of the most popular new options for carrying cargo throughout Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lee-class merchant vessel is an ideal ship to be used for merchant characters within Clement Sector or in any Traveller setting.  The ship's versatility allows it to be the home vessel for a variety of character groups from merchants to pirates to those simply needing an efficient vessel to get from Point A to Point B.  The vessel has been designed to be used by a group of player characters and will become a valuable asset for Referees to use in any sort of Traveller game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 10: Lee-class Merchant Vessel comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The Lee-class is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the Lee comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Lee-class could easily be used in any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
