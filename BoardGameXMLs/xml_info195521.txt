							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hoplomachus: Origins â€“ Staging Mat</name>
									
			<description>Our Hoplo: Origins Staging Mat is something we offered along with our Origins Kickstarter. While not exclusive, it was ordered in limited quantity and will not always be kept in stock. The mat plays no strategic role in the game and is simply a nice way of protecting your chip faces by always having them on a neoprene mat. This staging mat has room for each of your drafted units as well as a place to stack any that have fallen. It fits right next to any of the 3 Origins arenas and is a great addition to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
