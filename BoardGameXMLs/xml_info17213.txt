			<description>Each player draws a card to determine their playing colour, which remains secret during the game. The players try to distribute 40 pawns in four colours in such a way that each field on the board (8x5) will be occupied only by one single pawn.  The eight rows will be scored at the end of the game. Players reveal the colour and receive victory points for having the most pawns in their colour per row. The player with the most victory points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edition Spielbox No. 57&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
