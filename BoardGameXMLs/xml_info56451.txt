							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Questers of the Middle Realms Character Assistant</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questers of the Middle Realms leaves character creation very open for players to model whatever concept they like, using the setting as a framework and inventing Qualities to suit. That&amp;rsquo;s great if you have a clear concept and a decent understanding of the system, but new players often find the lack of guidance daunting - and even the most creative of us has off-days. This Character Assistant is designed to help you along the way by providing lists of different character aspects: occupation, homeland, talents, skills, personality traits, etc. You can skim the entries to see if something kicks off some inspiration, or roll randomly. It also introduces six divisions of magic to help you home in on the right Arcane Quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
