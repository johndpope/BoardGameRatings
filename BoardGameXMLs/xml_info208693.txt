							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bandit Wizard</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bandit Wizard is an action-packed, whimsical adventure for any fantasy roleplaying game. You'll find the adventure has plenty of opportunity for roleplaying and courageous battle. Conversion into your favorite game system or setting is a snap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darek Flugthorn, a notorious troublemaker wizard, has been banished from his home, Coluris. Now, in the dry dusty Southlands, he is intent on proving that he truly is a great wizard -- by robbing from the peasants in the countryside. His ingenius strategy is filled with magic and mischief, but how long will it last? Enter the heroes, ready to kick some wizardric butt and send Darek back home. As one might guess, evil goblins are intent on making the whole process a little more difficult than advertised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure comes in a 6-page PDF. Artwork is from LPJ Design's great Fantasy Anthology. Written by Nathan J. Hill (Barbarians Versus, Eldritch Ass Kicking, Lawn of the Dead), pick up your copy today for $.99.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
