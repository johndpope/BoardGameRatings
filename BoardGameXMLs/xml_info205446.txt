			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We don't get many travelers in these parts except adventurers and tax collectors. The former find death more than they find glory or reward. As for the latter I hope they fall short of coin when it comes time to pay the devil his due. The folk here have done more for the Baron than he's ever done for us. What hardship has he known? How many failing seasons has he faced? How many of his kin and neighbors has he buried in the ground by his own hands? Out here we are on our own and when times are tough you do what you must to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
