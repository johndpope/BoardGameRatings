							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pyramid</name>
									
			<description>Each player receives 24 stones in one color, of which 3 are to be used as blockers, and 2 dice each and a dice to increase during the game. The playing field consists of 2 pyramids and a cube area. In a pyramid are 21 boxes for inserting individual stones. The aim of the game is that each player uses his 21 stones in the pyramid of the playing field by throwing dice and then dices out of it. The insertion is done with two dice, with one stone each in the corresponding floor of the pyramid (from above) is used. The withdrawal must begin with a 1. Thereafter, the stones with the appropriate number out of the row can be diced or moved up. The blocker can be used with a rolled 1 in the top of the opposing pyramid. The opponent must not throw any more stones out until he can eliminate the blocker with a 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
