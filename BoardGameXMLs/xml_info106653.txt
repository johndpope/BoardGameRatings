			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infestation, written by Rob Manning, is part of an ongoing series set in the Great City. This is not a numbered adventure in a path, but instead, it concerns a mysterious event that will forever alter the Great City, setting the tone for future events. Throughout the year, &amp;Oslash;one games will release a number of short adventures whose various plots are all somehow entwined with the event. Each will be a stand-alone adventure, designed to be played independently without a specific sequence and can be completed in a single evening&amp;rsquo;s play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the days following the wake of the Great City's recent devastating events, Father Malkmus sent his congregants to take temporary shelter in the rarely used Temple of Harvest. Upon their arrival, they found the temple newly inhabited by a displaced gang of vile, parasitic humans known as roachkin. Father Malkmus calls upon the PCs to investigate the temple, seek out survivors, and drive the roachkin out. Unfortunately, the task proves more difficult when PCs uncover the horrific and terrible unholy raising of the gang's former leader by one of his depraved and devoted followers. Can PCs save the Temple and defeat this creatures before he attempts to spread his ghastly infestation through the Temple Ward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infestation is an Adventure for the Pathfinder RPG System for 1st-level Player Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
