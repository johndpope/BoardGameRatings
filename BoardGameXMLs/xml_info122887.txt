			<description>Publisher summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a small out-of-the-way town a master blacksmith lives. He would be happy to just live his life, take care of his sister and work his forge. However a new minor noble has marked him as an enemy, a tax collector thinks he is a traitor and his Dwarven forge brothers are having problems of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He could probably use an adventurer about now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
