							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is a 2D platform video game developed by Imagineering and released in 1991 for the NES. It was later ported to the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version was the only version released in Japan, where it was published by Altron in 1993, though the name was shortened to &amp;quot;Killer Tomato&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the children's cartoon Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series, which itself was based on the movie franchise Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Another Attack of the Killer Tomatoes game was released for the Amstrad CPC, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's protagonist is Chad Finletter, a young boy is on a quest to stop the evil scientist Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. During his journey he must fight through legions of mutant tomatoes, although this is a feat he will take on alone as the citizens of San Zucchini are too afraid of the mutant tomatoes to aid him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like other platform games of its time, the main method of killing the enemies is to jump on them, in this case squashing them, or breaking them into smaller tomato enemies. There are several bosses to take on including Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (1991 video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
