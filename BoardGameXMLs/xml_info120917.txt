							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pac-Man World 3</name>
									
			<description>Pac-Man World 3 is the third game in the Pac-Man World series and the only one in the trilogy that was not released in Japan. It also marks the 25th anniversary of the Pac-Man arcade game. This game features more fighting and more melee combat than the first two Pac-Man World games. It also features a speaking Pac-Man for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a search for power, a short evil genius called Erwin has found a way to suck raw energy out of the world of the Ghosts (the Spectral Realm). He has created a syphon that can penetrate into the Spectral Realm. This is causing the Spectral Realm to collapse into the real world (Pac-Land), bringing about an environmental catastrophe. Meanwhile, Pac-Man is celebrating his 25th birthday with his family when he is teleported by Orson, a former nemesis of Pac-Man from the first Pac-Man World video game. Orson communicates to him and tells him about the Spectral Realm (after Pac-Man complains to Orson about messing up his party and throwing him into a trash pit). Pac-Man is attacked by fiery Spectral monsters of the orange, green, and purple varieties which have been driven mad by Erwin's hypnosis with Inky and Blinky have been kidnapped as part of Erwin's evil scheme, but Pinky and Clyde managed to escape.  Now Pac-man must join forces with the ghosts, Orson, Pinky, and Clyde to stop Erwin before he destroys both the Real World and the Spectral Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cutscenes pop up throughout the game, and instead of having just subtitles, the characters speak as well. The subtitles are configurable in the game's settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pac-Man retains his moves from the previous two Pac-Man World games, like the butt-bounce and the rev-roll, and he gets the ability to punch. Now, butt-bouncing three times in a row will create a shock-wave that will affect enemies circling in on Pac-Man. However, the shock-wave won't go out very far, so it's not very useful. Also, when Pac-Man rev-rolls, pressing the jump button will not make Pac-Man stop rev-rolling. He will jump as he's rolling instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normal attacks don't work on Spectral monsters, but Pac-Man can eat a power pellet, turning the ghosts blue, just like the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a museum accessible by the main menu. where you can look at Pac-Man game history, and play Pac-Man itself. The game is a port of the original, and, unlike the previous Pac-Man World games, there is no border around the vertical game screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pac-Man World 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
