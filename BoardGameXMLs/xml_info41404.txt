							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Prix Auto Race Game by Jackie Stewart</name>
									
			<description>This is a fairly simple racing game in the general mold of Speed Circuit. Each car is a (randomly-generated) mix of maximum acceleration, maximum deceleration, top speed, and braking ability. Speeds for each turn are written simultaneously on the included record sheets. Curves have maximum posted speeds, but also have &amp;quot;apex lines&amp;quot; through them which, if followed precisely, allow one to go faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above description is of the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; game. The beginner's game is a simple roll-and-move exercise. There is also a &amp;quot;super advanced&amp;quot; game which adds rules for slip-streaming, blocking, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was one of six in RGI's Play the Pros series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significantly modified version of the game is included as part of Sports Spectacular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
