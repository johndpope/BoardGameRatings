			<description>The Chaps from Amsterdam has been formulated through years of hard work, in bedrooms, front rooms, pubs, clubs, raves, festivals, police cells and prison cells. Over the past decade we have taken an idea and given it life, transforming it into the product that we are proud to show to you today. Hard Impact Board Games is a street orientated company that has created a game that is not only realistic but also enjoyable to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by a maximum of 6 players, with 6 characters to choose from, Billy, Bob, Sid, Charlie, Eedid and Grief. Their aim after leaving Amsterdam is to take to the streets and off load their SPACE...Making as much money as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep your wits about you! Trust nobody and never be to flash with your cash as like in real life the police, courts and informers are waiting for you around each and every corner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game and is not a promotion for illegal activities, all information contained within the game is for educational, recreational and historical purposes ,it is not our intention to incite the use of controlled or illegal substances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
