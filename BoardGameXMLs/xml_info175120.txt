			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Pen of Julian Neale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I think of fey creatures, I think they should be one or more of the following: wondrous, enigmatic, creepy, dangerous, or (sometimes) funny. They should make for great encounters, whether that involves combat or not. Compared to other types of intelligent creatures in the Bestiaries, there are surprisingly few of them, especially at higher Challenge Ratings. Disappointingly, many do not match the expected values for their CR. Fey are defined in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary as &amp;ldquo;...a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to some other force or place. Fey are usually human-shaped.&amp;rdquo; In other words, they do not have to be nature spirits, but they do (or should have) supernatural abilities. Potentially, they can be anything that can be imagined. There can even be lawful fey, and ones that have DR of a material other than cold iron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with Enhanced Undead, this book aims to give fey creatures a boost to make encounters more memorable and (hopefully) challenging. As a side note, it&amp;rsquo;s important to realise that the descriptive elements (&amp;ldquo;fluff&amp;rdquo;) of the creatures in the Bestiaries can be changed if you want to use particular fey in a different way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book presents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The enhanced fey creature template&lt;br/&gt;    A brief discussion on applying it&lt;br/&gt;    And several stat blocks are provided with notes to demonstrate how the stat blocks match the CR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
