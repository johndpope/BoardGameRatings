			<description>From the document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As mentioned in the game book, The Constitutional Convention of 1787: Constructing the American Republic is available in three versions: Standard (three or four weeks), Mid-Size (five or six weeks), and Full-Size (eight or nine weeks) (all lengths include setup and debriefing). Besides duration, the three versions correspond to three levels of play: Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced. This is the instructor&amp;rsquo;s guide for the Full-Size, Advanced version. The role descriptions likewise differ depending on length and level; the game book, though, remains the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[This] Full-Size version of The Constitutional Convention of 1787 is the longest game in the Reacting to the Past repertoire. If supplemented by lectures before (e.g., the Revolutionary period) and by lectures after (e.g., the Bill of Rights and the party-politics of the 1790s), this single game is big enough to be its own course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is used with the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; implementation of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
