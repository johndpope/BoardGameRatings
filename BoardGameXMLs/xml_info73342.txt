							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Hydra Den</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE MODULE&lt;br/&gt;Operation Hydra Den is the second installment in the Al Mahara campaign modules for the Terror Network Role-Playing Game. Designed as a Mission module, Operation Hydra Den takes players across the globe and into the sweltering heat of Saudi Arabia, one of the known locations of the terrorist group Al Mahara. A Covert Ops group has been assembled to investigate a deadly operation being conducted by two Al Mahara cells, the Cobra cell and the Lion cell. Their task is to eliminate the leaders of each cell, in retaliation for the attack on the Dallas Federal Reserve a few weeks ago. The players must eliminate the cell leaders (and any other hostiles involved), and they must gather enough physical evidence to initiate an international investigation. While this module is part of a series involving the Al Mahara terrorist network, it can be played as a stand-alone, without any prior knowledge of events. If players are continuing from the first module (Operation Hydra), they can keep playing their characters if they like, but it is strongly advised they choose characters from a CIA or military background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
