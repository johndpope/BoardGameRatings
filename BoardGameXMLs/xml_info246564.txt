			<description>Le jeu aux mille titres (&amp;quot;The Game with a Thousand Titles&amp;quot;) is a memory game in which tokens are placed face down on one side of a double-sided game board. On a turn, a player tries to locate a matching couple, but the main hook of the game is that players are encouraged to create a stories as they do so based on where the tokens are located. Did you find the boss in prison and the employee at the park? Tell us why!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This storytelling potential is carried through with the packaging of the game as each cover of the game is unique! In the first edition of the game in 2015, each game also bore a unique title, such as &amp;quot;The Mother in the Clouds&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Vampire in the Yard&amp;quot;, but this made it difficult for people to identify the game. The second edition in 2018 carries the Le jeu aux mille titres title at top, along with a unique title for the artwork along the bottom of the box, as if the art were a painting in a museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
