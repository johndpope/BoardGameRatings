			<description>A children's card game, rather like Memory, where you have to win pairs of cards. Complete luck at first but as more cards are revealed (and then placed back face-down), memory comes into the game. An easier version for very young children is also provided. The company also suggest that Snap could be played with the same cards.&lt;br/&gt;44 cards, illustrated with characters from the Rupert comic strip and the Rupert Annuals that appeared every year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
