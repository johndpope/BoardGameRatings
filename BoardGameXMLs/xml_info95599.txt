			<description>The Majors Pro Baseball is a baseball video game for Sega Game Gear. It features battery-based save and a Major League Baseball Players Association license. The teams themselves are not licensed and are only listed by city name. The umpire's calls are notable for being uttered with a Japanese accent. This game would have benefitted from stat-tracking for the season mode but at least it provided a season mode. Players cannot choose a pitch but they are delivered clearly and accurately in terms of realism (for the era that the game was released in).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Majors Pro Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
