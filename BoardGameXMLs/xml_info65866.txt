			<description>The player will be able to state the definition of major terms used in obstetrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player receives seven cards dealt one at a time. The remaining cards are placed face down with one turned up.&lt;br/&gt;     The cards in hand are arranged in pairs by matching the word with the definition, each having the same number.&lt;br/&gt;     The word and the definition must be read before discarding cards.&lt;br/&gt;     Moving counterclockwise, each player discards pairs first and acquires one additional card in one of three ways: by asking another player for a specific card; drawing an unknown card from the deck; or drawing the top card from the discard pile. A discard card must be played unless the player is going out.&lt;br/&gt;     The player who goes out first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;100 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
