							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DRAGUT: The sack of Rapallo July 4th 1549</name>
									
			<description>Dragut is a two players game recreating the sack of the Ligurian city of Rapallo on July 4th 1549.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On that day, at dawn, a fleet of several galleys at the orders of the famed Ottoman pirate Dragut arrived at the shores of this sleepy harbour; the pirates beached in three areas (Porta delle Saline, Imbarcadero and Nagge, all depicted on the map) and started the sack; no resistance was encountered, as no garrison nor alarm drills have been organised by the city council, despite the Genoese Senate had advised of pirate activities in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only brave act was performed by Bartolomeo Maggiocco, a local boy who saved its sweetheart, Giulia Giudice, struggling the pirate at the Porta delle Saline. The only escape way was fleeing to the hills and several citizens made it, and more others were captured by the pirates and put in slavery in Berberia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you manage to avoid the sack of the city and save its inhabitants?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or will you sack the city and gain reputation among the Pirates?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 24 colourful units to be cut and glued, 18 nice cards, a gourgeous map to be printed on A3 folio and the English   rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
