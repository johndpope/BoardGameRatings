							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Way of the Yakuza</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey with us on the Way of the Yakuza!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organizations initially created for the protection of their communities, the Yakuza have evolved into a unique culture fiercely loyal to their traditions. Easily identified by their colorful tattoos, Yakuza brethren are a hard, violent lot given to drink, gambling and lechery. They practice extortion, engage in smuggling, sell powerful narcotics, and regularly force women into prostitution. Yet, despite their numerous faults, they view themselves as folk heroes, warriors fighting for the common man against the dangers of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Way of the Yakuza presents a wealth of information for players and Game Masters alike. This 36 page PDF contains an extensive overview of the Yakuza culture, Yakuza character options (including archetypes, traits, feats, spells, enchanted tattoos and more), and a new method for creating unique Yakuza-gang stat blocks. Additionally, for GM's looking for a quick adventure, there is even a Yakuza controlled mountain village, complete with map and adventure seeds. Whether you want a Yakuza centric campaign, or just want to add flavor to your setting, this book has something for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
