			<description>This 2008 version of Mattel's Fisher-Price branded Ice Cream Scoops of Fun is similar in appearance to their discontinued 2000 version (see Ice Cream Scoops of Fun); but has sufficiently different rules, pieces, and mechanics to make this a different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player to get four scoops of ice cream.  Each player, in turn, uses the Ice Cream Scooper to randomly pick one of three ice cream flavors, yells out the flavor picked, and flips over one of the face-down Ice Cream Scoop Cards; if it's a match, the player adds the scoop to their bowl after screaming &amp;quot;Ice Cream!&amp;quot; otherwise the scoop is flipped back face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically this is a preschooler-oriented memory-matching game where what you want to match is picked randomly and you get to do a lot of shouting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
