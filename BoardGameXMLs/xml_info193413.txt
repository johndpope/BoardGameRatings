							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Close Order</name>
									
			<description>Close Order is an arcade shooter with one simple goal: become a badass armada! It&amp;rsquo;s not about you. It&amp;rsquo;s about other ships around you known as minions that exponentially increase your firepower!&lt;br/&gt;Defeat enemies for parts. Combine those parts into minions. Move them around your armada however you please. Become badass!&lt;br/&gt;Play through a short, episodic narrative in Story mode to discover the fate of humanity, or boot up Survival mode for fast-paced action!&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;Grow from a single ship into a massive armada!&lt;br/&gt;Plays like a shooter, feels like arcade, acts like tower defense, relies on strategy, and is always distinctly bullet hell!&lt;br/&gt;Experience the remnants of the galaxy post-Earth in Story mode.&lt;br/&gt;Tackle the story your way: missions are set up in an episodic fashion through interconnected hub worlds.&lt;br/&gt;Not in it for the story? No problem! Boot up Survival mode where you start with nothing and must grow your armada in order to survive.&lt;br/&gt;Duke it out in Simple Survival, where levels have pre-made waves of progressively stronger enemies.&lt;br/&gt;Too easy? Take it one step further with Custom Chaos, a customizable version of Simple Survival that allows you to choose the level you&amp;rsquo;d like to play, the type and difficulty of enemies, and the amount of enemies you wish to face.&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want a powerful story or a badass gameplay experience, Close Order has it all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
