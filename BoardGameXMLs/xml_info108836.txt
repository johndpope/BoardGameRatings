			<description>A battery operated British game. In the 1930's, Speedway was a tremendously popular sport so companies were quite keen to add a Speedway game to their portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game of chance, no skill required at all. The board has a wheel with six different coloured speedway bikes on it. Players are invited to put their bets on to a Roulette-like board. You could play for real money or buttons. When all the bets are placed, you flick a switch and the wheel will spin. As each bike goes past a connection, their colour light flashes on, so with a fast spinning wheel, the lights all flash, adding to the excitement. When the wheel stops, there will be one light on and that is the race winner. Winning punters collect their bets and another race can start. The winner must be the one who has the most money when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
