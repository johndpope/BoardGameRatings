							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Macho Women with Guns (Diet Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; The most politically incorrect, chancy and thoroughly tongue in cheek roleplaying game comes to PDF! Macho Women With Guns Diet Edition strips away the excess flab and leaves you lean, mean and...well, we can't actually say that. If you think that bust and cup size are important character stats or you secretly wonder what spandex underwear feels like then Macho Women With Guns Diet Edition is the game for you. Whether it's Renegade Nuns, Batwinged Bimbos, Oddzilla or the plethora of other zany characters, this is one game you won't want to miss! 99 pages packed with Macho fun...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To quote one recent review: 'I laughed, I cried (mainly from laughing too hard), and I think you will too. Of course, you need to have a sense of humor before reading, and you can't take what you read seriously. After all, the author's first two rules of the game are that the rules are not important, and that you have fun. The moment you start playing this game seriously, you have already put too much thought into it. MWWG is meant to be a unique RPG. In fact, I think 'unique' is the best way to describe it.' -Melissa Piper &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
