			<description>Everyone is familiar with memory games. With their simple rules and the excitement of rivalry, memory games appeal to both children and adults, and older players do not necessarily have an advantage over younger ones. Ever since they first appeared in the 1950s, games that involve looking for pairs of identical objects have enjoyed unflagging popularity and thousands of versions have been produced. While ZnajZnak &amp;ndash; Pamięć continues this long tradition, it also introduces a certain element of novelty, because players acquire knowledge automatically while playing.&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of 48 cards. There are 16 pairs of the symbols of recent Polish history and also 16 cards with the names. Among the cards players have to find a pair of the same symbols and then point one of the 16 cards with the names of symbols. &lt;br/&gt;A historical commentary on each symbol is provided in the enclosed brochure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
