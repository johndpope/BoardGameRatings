							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curious Calibres</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the archives of Darkisle, the sort-of English and definitely fictitious island that was a byword for all things unnatural and eldritch....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucius Carnford was the island's leading expert on firearms during the 1920s, and Curious Calibres is one of his irregular publications about some of the more interesting guns that were available. It features information on six unusual types of pistol, lovingly reproduced in the original sepia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed as a resource for any RPG set in the mid-20th Century, Curious Calibres gives full information on using these guns in your game, with specific stats for use with Call of Cthulhu rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
