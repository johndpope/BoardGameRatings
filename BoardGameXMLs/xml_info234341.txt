			<description>Red Peter presents the political struggle in Petrograd during the run up to the October Revolution.  Players represent a political faction, and spend political influence to gain control over centers of power and to resolve the many crises that threaten to derail the revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control of centers of power can provide special abilities and generates political influence among the four main demographics: soldiers, workers,&lt;br/&gt;peasants, and bourgeoisie.  Helping to resolve a crisis generates victory points in the form of votes, and can slow the growing chaos level that weakens the political factions.  Votes are also gained at four randomly occurring &amp;quot;elections&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A faction wins by gaining an absolute majority of votes by game end. Revolutionary factions also have the option of staging a high-stakes military coup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
