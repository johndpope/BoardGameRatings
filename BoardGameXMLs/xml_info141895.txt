			<description>Chess Game for 2, 3 and 4 Players, from Germany, Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme: As described in the rules of the game, 2, 3 and 4 Players play chess clockwise. Most of the classic chess rules apply here. But anyway, Schach4 has its own rules which are brief and which are quick and easy to understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play: It's fun to play chess on one board with up to 4 players. Everybody can fight against everybody. Team play is also possible. It's a challenge for beginners and advanced chess players. And professionals will break sweat when they encounter 2 or 3 armies on the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: The player or the team whose pawns are standing at last on the playing field wins the chess match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
