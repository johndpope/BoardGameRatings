			<description>Raw Danger!, known in Japan as Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 2: Itetsuita Kiokutachi (絶体絶命都市2 -凍てついた記憶たち- lit. The Desperated City 2: Frozen Memories?) is a survival game that  follows six characters as they try to escape a city that is being flooded by torrential rains.  The game is a sequel to Disaster Report. A further sequel, Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3, was released for the PSP on April 23, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2010. The underground city, Geo City, is a project put together to design the safest and most advanced city ever built in the world. The newly-opened city is working great and the Mayor's Conference to commemorate the opening is going well, aside from a bit of rain outside. Joshua and Stephanie are just two of the waiters helping make the conference go as smoothly as possible. But, when the nearby Levee breaks and the Hudson River begins to flood the city from above, the building the conference is being held in begins to be pummeled and destroyed by the raging rapids. The city and everyone in it are in total panic and turmoil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must think on their feet and utilize creative survival skills to have any hope of seeing their family again. Body temperature and health decrease when players are wet or in cold weather too long. They must find places to warm themselves and gather food, and find dry clothes or make them. In the end, players must run, climb, jump, and crawl their way out of this devastated city, while constantly trying to piece together information from emergency broadcasts and other victims of the disaster. The choices that the players make within the game affects the main storyline and dialog, and ultimately the ending of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is able to interface with the Konami Para Para Paradise controller. This allows the player to design their own hand movements to be used when summoning rescuers. Players may also use the controller to simulate the &amp;quot;fireman carry&amp;quot;, used to move unconscious characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joshua Harwell is a college student working as a waiter at the Geo City Inaugural Ceremony Banquet when disaster struck. After the flooding starts Joshua is trapped in the banquet hall basement with another worker named Stephanie McMurrough. Joshua takes her along with him to escape the ill fated city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stephanie McMurrough is a college student working part-time as a waitress at the &amp;quot;Geo City Inaugural Ceremony Banquet&amp;quot;. When the flooding starts, Stephanie gets trapped in the banquet hall basement, only to be rescued by Joshua. She tags along with him, going through many hardships along the way. Stephanie likes to be self-sufficient, even though her family is very wealthy. Her father even sends a major search party out to find a trace of his beloved daughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amber Brazil is a university student as well as a suspect for murder. She arrived at her brother's crime scene right before the murderer fled. Because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, she is the major murder suspect and is being held prisoner in the Geo City Police Station. She broke out, however, when the Geo City Police Station collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aidan Chase is Goldstein's assistant. After the city began to flood, Aidan met Amber Brazil and saved her from the ongoing chases from the police. He later joins her to escape the city, survive, and to figure out the truth behind David Brazil's (Amber's brother), murder. It is later revealed that he was the one who murdered David. The player can cause his death or let him live so he can go to prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isaac Schiller is a thirty-six year old taxi driver who hears about the &amp;quot;Geo City Inaugural Ceremony Banquet&amp;quot; from some customers inside a convenience store. He later meets Sophia Briggs in Downtown Geo when she asks for a ride in his car. He and Sophia must escape the city and uncover the mystery behind NorCal's ambitions...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sophia Briggs is a reporter for Capital Weekly magazine. She was writing a cover story on the Geo City Inaugural Banquet before disaster struck and the whole city went topsy turvy. Before the flooding she bumped into Joshua while he was working and asked him to get her a waitress uniform so she could go undercover and get behind the scenes with the staff. After that she hitches a ride with Isaac and the two of them try and discover what NorCal is really up to. She seems to know Jaden Bradford, a NorCal employee, and Keith Helm, a survivor of the Capital City disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paige Meyer is a sixteen year old student at Del Ray High School.

When the flooding starts she gets trapped under a piano from the school's music room, Paige saves her and the two of them make their way to the evacuation point you will see her again in the third Disaster Report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ivan Kozlov is a researcher for NorCal Pharmeceutical Geo City. He finds himself waking up shortly after the minor floodings not knowing where or who he is. Sitting at his side is a young woman who he does not know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sierra Young meets Ivan when he wakes up. Sierra is David Brazil's girlfriend and apparently knows Ivan through David. Ivan does not remember her because of his amnesia. Sierra asks Ivan to come with her to help her solve the murder of her boyfriend. Ivan agrees and tags along with her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keith Helm is one of the survivors of the earthquake 5 years ago in Capital City (in Disaster Report).
