							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Living Adventures: Fantasy Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of these rules is to allow structure to a game involving imagination. It should be kept in mind that all players participating are players just like yourself and should be treated with respect and curtesy. Out of game strife should be left out of game and in game strife should remain in game. These rules have been created for a Live Action Role Play game with a focus on Role Play. The goal of the game played by these rules should not be to harm anyone or to become better than, or beat the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
