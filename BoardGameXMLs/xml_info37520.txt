							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who: Eye Spy</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Doctor and Sabbath are both looking for the scattered remnants of the Elementals, the Lords of Time who never existed. Chief among these artifacts is a black sun, the EYE.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;He who controls the EYE controls the new dynasty of Time Lords for the universe. But while the Eighth Doctor has looked without for the Eye, he has not tried to first look WITHIN.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The TARDIS was once infinite, but now only a small part of its interior is accessible. And Fitz is hearing strange sounds behind the unusual walls that have partitioned the TARDIS' interior. And now a door to the mysterious cloister room has opened. Could the EYE have been in their all the while? But one challenge stands in the Doctor's way of&lt;br/&gt;exploring the cloister room and unveiling its secrets: SABBATH!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;One Player plays the Doctor. His goal is to move from the CONSOLE ROOM to the CLOISTER ROOM. The other plays Sabbath. &lt;br/&gt;His goal is to prevent the Doctor from reaching the cloister room.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
