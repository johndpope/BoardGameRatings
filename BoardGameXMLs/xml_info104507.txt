			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The G.I. Joe Team must protect a top-level nuclear scientist in OPERATION: STAR RAIDER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your code name is Wiseguy, because you are able to think fast and make snap decisions under pressure. Snake Eyes, Spirit, Blowtorch and Ripcord are among the Joes in your outfit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your assignment: to keep Dr. Newton FitzSimmons safe while he visits the U.S. Defence Department with the plans for his new nuclear anti-missile device, called the Star Raider. You are to meet the great scientist at a New York airport and transport him safely to Washington D.C. You must make sure no one can get to him - especially Cobra!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you live up to your nickname? You begin to wonder when you see a Cobra helicopter circling in the sky. And that's only the beginning. Hungry wolves, the Cobra crimson guards, and even a very unusual dog will test your shrewdness, Wiseguy. Do your best to make the right strategic decision as you FIND YOUR FATE...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eric Affabee is a pseudonym used by R. L. Stine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
