			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone is John is a humorous, competitive roleplaying game about playing the various personalities of John, a man from Minneapolis, Minnesota who hears voices in his head that have the power of suggestion over him.  Some might call him unbalanced or even insane, but the voices simply add a colorful personality to John. In Everyone is John, one participant is the Game Master, or GM. In Everyone is John lingo, this translates to &amp;quot;Everyone Else.&amp;quot; All of the other players take on the roles of the voices in John's head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone is John uses six-sided dice, commonly referred to as a d6. Although a game can be played with only one d6, it is recommended that every participant has one during a game to minimize down time between rolls and narration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its heart, this is a narrative role playing game.  Unlike traditional RPGs where characters take turns fighting a common foe or gathering information using a variety of skills and weapons, in Everyone is John players control a central character with full interactivity in the world around him, take on a &amp;ldquo;voice&amp;rdquo; in his head and the session progresses much like a story being told by a narrator.  The GM is the narrator and will describe both the actions taken by John and the reactions and dialogue of the people around him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
