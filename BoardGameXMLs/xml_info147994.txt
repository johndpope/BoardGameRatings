			<description>COLONY 9 is a board game for one player (a solo game) with an approximate duration of 15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must create your colony and have it operational before the arrival of the first convoy from the planet Earth. To do this you must deploy different resources (building materials, biological, technological) in several colony buildings, as well as automate them assigning a robot if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During game you will have to face several random events and build required buildings in time. For this you have different possible actions that you can choose with dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at the last turn, when the convoy arrives, you have built all the required buildings, you get victory points for the other buildings. The victory conditions vary depending of the colony that you are building and game difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colony 9 uses a 3x3 tile board game for building, three dice, several color cubes that represents resources (technology, biology, building materials) and several pawns that work as robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose different actions to play from a 3x3 action chart. He throws three dice and use two of them to choose an action, and then use the other die to asign materials to a structure. To build a structure you choose an action and deploy resources in that build. The player must build mandatory structures (radio, vital systems, spaceport, etc.) before a specific turn or he'll lost the game. In addition he can build other structures (factory, control station, missile base) to gain victory points and to defend colony from alien attack or asteroids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2013 Solitaire Print and Play Contest results:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Greyscale Printed Game&lt;br/&gt;1st place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Medium Sized Game&lt;br/&gt;2nd place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Deck / Pool Building Mechanic&lt;br/&gt;1st place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
