			<description>In Kerno each player starts with a hand of five cards and eight cards are placed face up on the table. The cards show between two and six dice (for instance a one, a three and a five) as well as a point value (for instance 7). Each player also receives 20 tokens for bidding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling six dice. After the dice have been rolled, they are auctioned off. The highest bidder pays tokens to the player who rolled the dice (or the bank if the highest bidder was the rolling player). The highest bidder has a chance to re-roll dice, and then chooses cards from their hand and/or table which match (some of) their dice. These cards are placed face up in front of the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the player is done, the player refills their hand up to five cards, and the table is refilled up to eight cards. The turn then passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, at the end of a turn, a player has five cards face up in front of them, the game ends. End score is calculated by combining the point values of the face up cards of each player and the remaining tokens they have. The player with the highest point total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
