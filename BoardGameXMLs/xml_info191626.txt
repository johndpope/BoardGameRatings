							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Runner: The 9th Layer</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Runners is a game set in the not so distant future, at the end of the 21st century. The year is 2099. After WWIII ended in a coalition of Asian nations, led by China and Japan, the world has been forever changed. Massive government sponsored corporations rule the world. Technology has advanced in leaps and bounds. The wait for the flying car has finally come to an end, but information control is more potent than ever. However, the world isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the highly advanced future that everyone was hoping for when the new millennium rolled around about 100 years ago. The Information Control Act of 2045 ended the war and put a choke hold on the internet. Access to information, by the people at least, is highly restricted. However, large corporations have achieved unimaginable technological gains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
