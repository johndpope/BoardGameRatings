							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drew and the Floating Labyrinth</name>
									
			<description>Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hand-drawn 3D third-person puzzle-platformer for PC, Mac and Linux platforms. Control Drew, a lost young girl trying to find her way back home, through a series of abstract levels requiring you to use clues in the environment to find invisible paths, gaining color to her black-and-white character as you progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why It&amp;rsquo;s Unique:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Featuring hand-drawn HD frames of animation to bring the main character to life. Drew uses over 1,000 frames of animation to achieve her presence from multiple angles. Only possible using modern hardware requirements, this method inspired from older pseudo-3D games is updated for the current generation, and allows artists to make virtually any game, any genre, with hand-drawn art. Since it is achieved with individual images, this method can bring traditional, stop-motion, Claymation, live-action, and other animation styles in 3D games in a way never seen before.&lt;br/&gt;     What if you played a platformer where the level was invisible? Simplistic yet full of potential, levels will use a variety of visual clues to help the player find their way to the end of each environment, requiring you to look before you leap, and be constantly wary if where to go next. A game of patience and observation.&lt;br/&gt;     The simple narrative will show that Drew isn&amp;rsquo;t where she thinks she is, leading to an emotional conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
