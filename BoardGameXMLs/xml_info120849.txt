			<description>Conquer the ancient Greek world in Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece, the critically-acclaimed strategy wargame that expands and refines the original Hegemony: Philip of Macedon with new content and features. Experience the full range of warfare from reconnaissance and raids to field battles and mountain blockades as you campaign across a continuous satellite-accurate map of ancient Greece. Siege and starve your enemy by cutting their supply lines or burning their crops, all the while commanding your armies with new tactical options against an ever-changing military landscape. Play as Macedonia, Athens, or Sparta in the three historical campaigns, or choose one of the 26 factions in the epic new sandbox mode and forge your own empire. With dynamic new diplomacy options and the series' trademark strategic zoom, Hegemony Gold sets the new standard for ancient warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
