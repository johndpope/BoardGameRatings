			<description>The Mind&amp;rsquo;s Lie is a game about how our minds consistently look at situations in biased and misleading ways.  The goal in this game is to spot these errors and convince the other players that you are correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mind&amp;rsquo;s Lie is normally a game for 3-6 players that can be played in 30 minutes or less.  Players take turns reading scenarios and then attempt to identify the biases inherent in each situation.  Players then vote in secret and, after the reveal, try to convince each other to change their positions.  The player who is most successful at convincing other players to vote as the player votes wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, it is expected that players will gain the ability to identify and mitigate the effects of common cognitive biases in everyday life, thereby improving their critical thinking and decision making skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
