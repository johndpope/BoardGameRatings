			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Five Star Stories: The Role-Playing Game is presented online in HTML format.  The game is divided into nine major areas, eight of which are divided into several topical areas, as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Entry: Welcome, Mamoru Nagano&lt;br/&gt;     Act I: Introduction, How to Role-Play, Playing Materials, Role-Playing Session, The Rules, RPG Terms&lt;br/&gt;     Act II: Creating a Character, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Character Skills, Skills List, Personal, Physical, Scientific, Technical, Pilot, Military, Weapons&lt;br/&gt;     Act III: Hand-to-Hand Combat, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3&lt;br/&gt;     Act IV: Psionics, Ability List, Ability Descriptions, Levels 1 through 10&lt;br/&gt;     Act V: Equipment &amp;amp; Mechanics, Clothing, Food &amp;amp; Rations, Utilities, Electronics, Weapons, Body Armor, Bioware, Bioware Implant List, Bioware Weapons, Bioware Equipment&lt;br/&gt;     Act VI: Gamemastering, Creating a Scenario&lt;br/&gt;     Five Star Stories World: The Prologue, The Setting, Joker Star Systems, Timeline, The Knight/Headliner, The Diver, The Fatima, Mortar Headds, FSS Glossary&lt;br/&gt;     Game Forms: Character Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most respects the game is a fairly typical attribute/skill RPG.  Character builds are assisted by the selection of a template, which is similar to a class but not nearly as restrictive.  Skills are divided into several functional areas and depend upon attributes and training.  A number of skills are unique to the setting.  While the &amp;quot;Five Star Stories World&amp;quot; section of the site does detail the setting to a considerable degree, the very-long-running manga series upon which the RPG is based clearly will provide much more background for interested gamers (links and resources are provided on the site).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
