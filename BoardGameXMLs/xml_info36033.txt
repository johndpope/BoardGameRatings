			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players take turns changing the district lines in order to win the election.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Each square represents a city block. At the start of the game, 100 Block Chits are randomly placed on the map. These Block Chits are randomly created by rolling for four characteristics: Income, Party, Race, and Issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player supports a candidate running for office. The candidate has eight profile characteristics: Income, Party, Race, two Allied Races, and three Issues ranked for priority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four phases to the game. In the first phase, district lines are drawn by the players taking turns placing 1d6 District Markers on the map until all fifty District Markers have been placed. In the second phase, District Lines are redrawn &amp;ndash; the players are able to move a randomly determined number of District Markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third phase is the Census, in which the Block characteristics of the fifty blocks marked as part of the District are totaled. The fourth phase is the Election, in which the District votes for each candidate are calculated based on the Census data and the profile characteristics of the candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose candidate gets the most votes in the election wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
