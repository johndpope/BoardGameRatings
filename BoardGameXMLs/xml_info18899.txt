			<description>This is a very simple game. The game board depicts a mountain, which the players have to climb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you draw a card and play a card (you don't have ANY hand cards). You move your pawn according to the card drawn. There are green cards which allow you to climb up the mountain, red cards which make you fall down and blue cards (which depict mountain climbing gear) that can safeguard you against future red cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition there are red spaces where you automatically glide down and green space where you automatically go up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What we have here is the innovative variation on 'roll and move' called 'draw a card and move.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
