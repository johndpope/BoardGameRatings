			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Needs Heroes.... The DemonWars Saga is a grand tale of adventure and intrigue, one that takes place on the fantastic world of Corona. But Corona is not your typical fantasy world. Among the goblins and giants and demons that populate the evil armies are Bloody Cap Dwarves, cruel creatures that take pleasure in inflicting as much pain and suffering as they can. And the forces of good, led by the Abellican Church, struggle more to control the world than to destroy the armies of evil. Now, more than ever, Corona needs heroes. Heroes to take up the cause and heroes to face the darkness. The DemonWars Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide includes three new Player Character races, a dozen new classes and prestige classes, and a host of new gems, magical items and creatures native to the world of Corona, giving players and game masters more options and more choices in their adventures across Corona. Additionally, a section dedicated to the DemonWars: Trial by Fire limited series comic gives everyone a new and different look at this unique world of adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
