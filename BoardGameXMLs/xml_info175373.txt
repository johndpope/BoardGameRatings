			<description>A wild-west adventure with Benjamin Bl&amp;uuml;mchen and his friends, Otto, Chief Black Feather and his daughter, Red Feather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve Cattle were stolen and must now be returned home. But the way home is hard to find: you turn right, then left and sometimes there is no way! You have to look closely and build the way anew, relocating the game boards if nescessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, the 16 large game boards are laid out in a 4x4 grid on the floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each cattle is assembled by putting the die-cut cattle in a colored standee. Then, the cattle are randomly distributed between the players. All players start at the same spot on the grid, Mike Donalds Ranch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, a player throws the die and moves his pawn along the way, one field for each pip. The goal is to reach the color-coded pasture, matching the color of one of his cattle. To do this, it is allowed to change the grid of game boards to open up new paths and maybe hinder the other players on their plans. The first player to place all his cattle in the right pastures wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
