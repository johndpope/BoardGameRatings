			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever wanted to be a pirate? The Le Games is here to help with your latest book, Unorthodox Pirates! Inside this fantastic book you will find six new pirate classes with full flavor descriptions and stats for a full 20-levels. That's not all! This product also includes Pirate familiars, twelve Pirate themed magic items, gun rules for your fantasy campaign, and a pirate theme song from our friends at Bailey records!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core classes in this book includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Freebooter: The Freebooter is the quintessential pirate. Freebooters are excellent sailors, trained from their youth in the art of living, surviving and fighting at sea. Not even the scurvy dogs that make up the civilized navies can out-climb a Freebooter in the rigging, and no man alive can best them in melee while standing on a slippery, pitching ship's deck. Freebooters are the people that society has forgotten or cast away because their race, class, or conduct was seen as unsuitable. &lt;br/&gt;     Ghostly Buccaneer: They say in whispers at dockside taverns and on the late watches of the seafarers that dead men tell no tales. They speak of deals that desperate sailors have made with the evils spirits deep within the blackness of the ocean depths. Most sane watermen dismiss these as mere legend and hearsay, but a few of the more grizzled and wary sailors know the truth. &lt;br/&gt;     Privateer: Some men and women are simply born to lead, and their natural charisma almost always carries them to positions of power. Privateers are the pirate equivalent of these people. A Privateer usually captains their own ship and crew, and possesses a letter of marquee that acts as a kind of diplomatic immunity, giving official sanction to their raiding and plundering. Privateers embody many different leadership styles - some lead from the front, while others are content to let lackeys do all the work - but they all share a common obsession with reputation and fame. &lt;br/&gt;     Ravager: The Ravager is the kind of pirate that other pirates fear. Whenever there is murder and slaughter to be done, the Ravager always takes his work a little too far - and enjoys it a little too much. Ravagers are the classic landlubber's idea of a pirate: fierce, horrible, bloodthirsty savages. They have no need for mercy, fine words, or logical reasoning, and they enjoy nothing more than wading into battle with a sword in each hand and another clenched between their teeth. &lt;br/&gt;     Swashbuckler: Some pirates live only to kill, rape, plunder and drink themseles stupid. Swashbucklers look down on these scurvy dogs; for a Swashbuckler, it's all about style. This type of pirate knows that it's not what you do, it's how well you do it. Theirs is the sword-whirling, chandelier-swinging, over-the-top school of combat, and they never pass up an opportunity to show off their skills or spin a tale of their latest daring escape. When a swashbuckler enters the room, he or she commands attention - especially from the opposite sex. &lt;br/&gt;     Wavelord: The Wavelord is at one with the ocean. He is a living conduit for the power and magic of the sea, a kind of nautical druid. Old sea dogs whisper that, &amp;quot;Whenever a child is born at sea and the mother cannot keep it, it is tossed overboard to be claimed by the waves. Years later a Wavelord will emerge - a man with saltwater for blood, who can make the currents change at his command.&amp;quot; So say the old-timers (to anyone who will listen). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And much much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
