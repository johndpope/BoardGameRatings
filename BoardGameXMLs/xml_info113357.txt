							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Terminator (SNES)</name>
									
			<description>You play as Kyle Reese trying to stop the Terminator from killing Sarah Connor. The main levels are side-scrolling shooters, the two sub-levels are pseudo-driving levels where you have to shoot the Terminator to stop him from shooting you. The game is very difficult due to the length of the levels and the fact that you get no continues if you lose all your lives. There is very minimal music in the game, as the sound effects tend to be much louder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Terminator computer and video games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
