			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dark dream; Nuclear Detonations open portal to another realm, opening a way to the denizens to pour into ours. The Barrier was cracked first somewhat by the Nazi nuclear test in Ohrdruf, Thuringia on 4 March 1945, and the smallest of the future Openings. Then it was damaged by the Trinity test by the United States Army on July 16, 1945 on New Mexico, at the White Sands Proving Ground. This Opening is similar size as the latter ones, but less active for some reason. The Barrier itself was finally pierced by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, which also, by some odd symmetry detonated the still dismantled Fat Man Nuclear device at the same moment at Tinian, one of the three principal islands of the Commonwealth of the Northern Manianas Islands, the principal airbase for the United States B-29 Superfortress bombers. The cancerous growth that Kaiju produce makes the flora and fauna take strange turn here and maybe on other places too. Flora gains odd coloring, smells and growth patterns, fauna mutates to new, strange ways. The detonation area soon changes into what seems like Alien Landscape, becoming extremely hostile to all human life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
