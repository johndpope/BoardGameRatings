			<description>From the Editors Notes:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the second issue of The Shadowrun Supplemental. I want to thank everyone who has read issue #1, and hopefully welcome some new readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I received a fair bit of feedback from issue #1, but, I want more! As long as you continue to write and tell me what you like and dislike, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can keep the magazine up to your standards, and provide something that is both helpful and entertaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not many serious changes from last issue, really. Most of the feedback was positive, so I have to assume I&amp;rsquo;m doing a relatively good job. Some people raised concerns about the formatting, and not being able to read it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope the PDF format will please you. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty of switching some of the fonts around, hopefully to make it easier to read and more creative. We all love fonts, don&amp;rsquo;t we? The other big beef was &amp;lsquo;white space&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to minimize the amount of dead space, but otherwise things tend to get cluttered together. In this issue, columns have been removed, which should make it more compatible with other word processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know who I am, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it, you&amp;rsquo;re about to learn more than you care to know. Most people know me as Fro, but my full name is Adam Jury. I am Assistant Fearless Leader of the ShadowRN mailing list, channel manager of #Shadowrun on Undernet IRC, a member of the Internet Roleplaying Game Society, and a few million other things. I&amp;rsquo;m seventeen years old (As of the day I write this) and have been playing Shadowrun for just about 3 years now. If you want to know more, get to know me better. : )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
