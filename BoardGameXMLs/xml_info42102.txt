							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spot the difference lotto</name>
									
			<description>This game takes the traditional spot the difference puzzle and turns it into a lotto game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with four double-sided player boards, each with space for nine tiles.  The game is played as lotto - draw a tile and find the matching board - but instead of spotting a picture and finding the relevant board, you're spotting the difference and finding the relevant board.  The differences aim to teach pre-reading and pre-maths skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the easy side each board contains nine almost identical pictures, but with slight differences - such as different numbers of balls juggled by the clown, or a different animal in the window of the house, or a different arrangement of colours on the kite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the hard side each board contains nine shapes, each coloured in the four primary colours, but with different arrangements of the four colours.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
