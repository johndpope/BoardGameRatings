			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first collection of Do-Gooders &amp;amp; Daredevils releases, this book gathers over 30 heroes and a variety of (mostly) benevolent organizations to interact with the player characters, or for players to take on as their own, along with some new rules to toy with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All content from the first four Do-Gooders &amp;amp; Daredevils releases are collected within (Do-Gooders &amp; Daredevils: Mixed Heroes, Do-Gooders &amp; Daredevils: Oddities, Do-Gooders &amp; Daredevils: Good I$ Capitali$m and Do-Gooders &amp; Daredevils: Champions.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within, you&amp;rsquo;ll not only find the mercenaries, fallen heroes, lost souls seeking redemption, and true and blue do-gooders you&amp;rsquo;d expect, but also legendary figures returned from the dead, former assassins, and organizations that straddle the fence between the moral and self-serving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranging from the Once and Future King of the Britons, King Arthur Pendragon, to Heaven&amp;rsquo;s bounty hunter, Purgatory, to the mutated astronaut-come-monster, Starbound, this heroic collection offers a bit of just about every sort of good guy a Gamemaster could hope for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the game statistics one would expect, the characters and organization are accompanied by a number of adventure ideas to get them up and running in your game as quickly as possible. Each is also assigned a rating based on the included Metahuman Threat Scale, allowing Gamemasters to quickly browse the book for heroes who offer a comparable level of interaction without overshadowing the player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Do-Gooders &amp;amp; Daredevils Collection your game&amp;rsquo;s potential for creative heroics will know no bounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
