			<description>24 cards are distributed evenly to all fellow players.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; - card puts these on the table and begins the round, by pulling a card of any fellow player. Afterwards this Turn player is now to pull with a fellow player etc.&lt;br/&gt;If he pulls a point card, he puts it wordless to its other cards. He must show an action card and had to fulfill  it immediately. As soon as a player pulls the &amp;ldquo;stop&amp;rdquo; - card, the round is terminated, and everyone recounts the points, which he holds straight on the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
