			<description>The game consists of a number of wire supports for a wire 'basket' into which is placed coloured balls. Each player chooses a colour. Then someone spins the 'top' which will career around and hit some of the supports and the ball in those supports might be dislodged. After the top has stopped, the player with the most coloured balls still on their supports, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This would be a ridiculously short game if a winner is decided after just one spin, so it would be sensible to award a point to that player. Then the first player to get, say, five points would be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was made by the Lord Roberts Memorial Workshops, set up to give work and support to invalid soldiers after World War 1. Lord Roberts was a distinguished officer who had won a Victoria Cross in 1857.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
