			<description>Bowlem The parlor bowling game. The scoring for this game is exactly the same as regular bowling. (Although given the rules, the game is actually more like CANDLEPIN Bowling, a form of bowling prevalent in the North East portion of the country - especially in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and Maine - In Candlepin Bowling the ball is much smaller (ball has no holes and fits in the palm of your hand) and you get 3 tries to knock all the pins down. The pins that are knocked down but remain on the deck stay there during the remainder of the frame. (Those pins are called deadwood and can be used to deflect the ball to help knock down the remaining pins to help you make spares.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are ten dice representing the pins, each having a spot on some sides of the dice.  Each player has three shakes. Rolling 10 spots with one roll is a strike. You put aside dice that have spots on them and then re-roll the rest. if you get spots on the rest of the dice you make a spare. You then have a third roll if you make all ten spots with the third roll you score a 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
