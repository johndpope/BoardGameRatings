							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dystopia Rising Tabletop Corebook</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dystopia Rising explores the grim realities of our potential future. A cruel, savage land is all that's left, punished by generations of radiation and crude survival after civilization collapsed in the wake of a zombie apocalypse. Still, even in amongst the ruins and squalor picking through the remains of rusted-out strip malls and decaying suburbs, there are survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kit-bashed shelters and improvised scrap technology are the tools of these rugged individuals trying to find a way to live in these dark times. Each survivor must choose how to live in this lawless, uncivilized world. Will you fight as a paragon of humanity, rebelling against the dying light of civilization to build a better tomorrow, or will you succumb to the harsh cynical realities of the world and prey on those without the killer instinct to survive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dystopia Rising is a fast-paced roleplaying game designed for 3 to 8 players. This core rulebook provides all the of fundamental mechanics required for building characters and running adventures within the broken world. Dystopia Rising's combat system focuses on team tactics to survive against the hordes of NPCs found without this book and is designed to be quick to learn for novice gamers and veterans alike. A comprehensive world section also illuminates the wide variety of local regions, denizens, and adventures your survivor might find themselves facing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of a growing series of sourcebooks further exploring the fallen world, this book is your first step into a unique and new gaming world that offers epic combat, intense character roleplay, and years of growth to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surviving the apocalypse was the easy part. Can you survive the wasteland? Prove it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
