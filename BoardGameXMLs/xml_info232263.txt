			<description>It must be very exciting to get across the Alps riding an elephant like Hannibal, to conquer the greater part of the world like Napoleon or to subdue Napoleon like Kutusov. Still in is more interesting to be able - like a mighty general - to command one's own modern army, to purchase arms, tanks, and soldiers and fight battles against the armed forces of an imaginary country. The game can be played by two or more players, more partners can overcome the enemy with allied forces led by mutual chosen commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are neither children nor adults who not be taken by a victory, that is due to their own skillful, cunning strategy and their clever quick decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
