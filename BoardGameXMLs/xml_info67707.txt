			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Royal Chess is like playing a game of poker and chess at the same time. It makes chess more exciting and fast-paced, while keeping the challenge of planning every move. It's the perfect combination of strategy and chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game contains two decks of 50 cards and is played with any chess set. The object of Royal Chess is to capture the Royal Family (the King and Queen pieces). You pick up five chess cards and if you have the corresponding chess piece, then you can move it like regular chess. But because your opponent does not know what cards you have, they may make very risky moves and may even try to bluff you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you play a card, you pick up a new one and always have five cards to choose from. There are also two Jester cards (wild cards) which can be played to re-claim or move any of your pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
