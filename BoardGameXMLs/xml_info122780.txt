			<description>The &amp;quot;thief of stars&amp;quot; in English is a cooperative game where players play together against the mage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mage Fedor has stolen all the stars. Player must recover and hang these in the sky before he regains his powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player rolls the dice and advance the number of boxes. There are squares where the stars could be hanged or bad squares where player help the mage regain his power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends in two ways:&lt;br/&gt;Either the players have hung all the stars in the sky and win.&lt;br/&gt;or the mage Fedor has regains his power and the players lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
