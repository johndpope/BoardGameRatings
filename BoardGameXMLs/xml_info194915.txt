			<description>From Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Avalon Game&amp;rsquo;s brand spanking new Newsletter.  For those of you that used to subscribed to our old letter, you will find that things have changed a lot, including the fact that you can find copies of this newletter now on RPGNow, Drivethru RPG and War Game Vault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan to offer free content in each and every letter, and in many cases a free sample of an up coming product, or some odd bit of this and that which we have laying around.  In all the newsletters you will find great gaming stuff, as well as a look at upcoming releases from Avalon that month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So keep an eye out for this and other newsletter, which will arrive the first of each month.  As always have a seat at the round table of fun with Avalon Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
