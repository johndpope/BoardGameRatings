			<description>&amp;quot;7 Major International Companies are developing the Worlds Ocean Resources. Players buy stocks in these companies and control how they grow. Board Game for 2-7 players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 10x10 grid using tiles and cubes. Also required for play are Stock cards, paper money (or any reasonable substitute), and a scoring track. The board is randomly filled with tiles at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lasts for five rounds. During each round there are seven turns. Each turn starts with the players bidding for control of a single share of stock from one of the seven companies. The player winning the bid operates the company for that round (represented by placing cubes on the board). These operations determine the value of the company, which in turn determines the amount of money paid as dividends to the stockholders for that company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once seven turns have been played, one for each company, the round ends and dividends are paid to stockholders. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
