							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Empires</name>
									
			<description>Alien races with varying powers compete to control twenty worlds. The Alien Race which establishes control over all of the Worlds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck used in the game includes three types of cards: Force cards, Race cards, and Event cards. Each player also requires a uniquely colored set of fifty or more Control markers. The game may be played on any hex map with the twenty World markers distributed as the players see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your quest for galactic conquest starts from the home world of your choice. In addition, you begin the game with three Race cards that define abilities, traits and powers that your alien race will possess throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
