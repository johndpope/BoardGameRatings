			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intelligence? Artificial. Heroism? Real!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a synthetic man, made by the villainous Nekrotron, Paradigm's (PL 10) morality is still evolving. Since his acceptance as a Sentinal, he has proven his worth to the team, and to humanity as a whole. However, his strange attration to his teammate, Violet, confuses him. But hey, how awkward could it be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
