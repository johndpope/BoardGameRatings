							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toot: The Automobile Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a very early automotive-themed card game. It consists of a deck of 56 cards, divided into four colored suits with card values ascending from 1 mile to 14 miles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a well-shuffled suit, and the first player then turns over the top card. If it is a 1 mile, he starts his &amp;quot;Speed Pile&amp;quot; and can turn over the next card. If not, he places the card in a &amp;quot;Delay Pile&amp;quot;, and the turn passes. No player may have more than three Delay Piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player then has the choice of turning over the top card in his deck or adding the top card from one of his Delay Piles to his Speed Pile. Each time a card is added to the Speed Pile, the player gets another play. When a deck runs out of cards, all cards in that player's Delay Piles are shuffled together and become the new draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete his Speed Pile in sequence from 1 to 14 wins the hand, and gets points equal to the number of cards left in the other players' hands or Delay Piles. First player to 50 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
