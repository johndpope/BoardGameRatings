			<description>AiaGaia is an hilarious, fast paced party game, appropriate and enjoying for children, and funny for adults and gamers. The game is entirely language independent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to score points by putting in play the animals of a farm, or special characters like the Farmer and his family, playing Foxes and Moles against other players, and trying to avoid the terrible black Wolf...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card in play has a value in points, as every card in hand entail a penalty... &lt;br/&gt;In addition, many animals (and all the characters), have special &amp;quot;effects&amp;quot; based on the other cards on the play field...&lt;br/&gt;But beware! When you put a card in play, you have to simulate the &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot; of the animal (or character) on the card: if you forget, or if you mistake, the card jumps back in your hand, and you lose your turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High interaction, many laughs and a bit of tactics are the recipe of this game, designed by Marco Valtriani and illustrated by Angelo Porazzi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME IS OUT OF STOCK and will not be reprinted. It has been restyled (rules, graphics, illustrations) and published by Red Glove.&lt;br/&gt;New page here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165651/merry-yard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165651/merry-yard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
