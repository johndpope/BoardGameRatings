							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jazz Core (Version 2.2)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jazz Core provides the basic rules for a generic, universal game system.  It is assumed that Jazz Core will be supplemented with a &amp;quot;genre module&amp;quot; for Jazz of which several were contemplated but only JazzSupers was produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Jazz are defined by Concept and Ability.  Each Ability has a number of &amp;quot;dots&amp;quot; which give a visual indication of how capable the character is with that attribute.  Characters will distribute from 25 to 75 &amp;quot;dots&amp;quot; depending on the type of game being run.  Characters also have Complications, which describe non-ideal aspects or relationships.  Some character build options yield additional &amp;quot;dots&amp;quot;, such as writing a Background or taking a substantial Complication.  Characters also have Traits which represent areas in which the character has special training or ability.  Traits have numeric ratings from 1-7.  Characters are assumed to have several Universal Traits which are &amp;quot;things generally known by everyone in a specific culture or time period&amp;quot; (Driving, Native Language, etc.).  Characters may also have Talents, which are exceptional abilities (Night Vision, Danger Sense, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution depends upon a dice pool of D6.  The number of dice in the pool will depend upon the underlying Attribute, Trait, or Talent and its rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
