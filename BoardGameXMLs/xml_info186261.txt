			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic system of Fantastic Horizons is extremely flexible. There is no set list of spells which can be cast; rather, the imagination of the caster is the only limit. Naturally there are some guidelines for casting spells, but these should be taken as a basis for development rather than as an absolute limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic is accessed through a character's Spellcraft Skill.  Magic is divided into Disciplines.  Spells have a point cost that is calculated by looking at the desired Range, Volume, and Damage.  These rules presuppose that spells will be used offensively and there is almost no support for non-damaging spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
