							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Town Called Nowhere</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Howdy, stranger, I'm Ma Johnson. I used to run a lodging house back east. Ran a couple more in different towns on route out here, too. Seems to be the way, that once a town starts gittin' big it starts attracting the wrong sort. That's why I'm here talking to you now. The last town I was in turned bad once some mean critters started calling the shots. I knew it was time to move on when the mayor appointed the town drunk as marshal. We're way out in the middle of nowhere here, so hopefully the bad seeds will fall short.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A Town Called Nowhere, you take the role of a pioneer settling a new town in the Old West. There'll be business opportunities aplenty for folks with an eye on the main chance and pitfalls too for those who don't cover their tracks. As you'd expect, there&amp;rsquo;ll be saloons, gambling, and gunfights. There'll be a jail, a bank, and a gunsmith. There'll be a marshal, a schoolteacher, and a lady called Ruby; the bank will get robbed, the corral will burn down, and some big shot will run you out of business so he can build a grand hotel where your wash house stands. Once the dust settles, that same big shot will paint his name on the town sign and say, &amp;quot;If anyone has any objections, they should speak up now&amp;quot;. Will you say anything? Course not, you'll head back to your washboard and eke out a meagre existence scrubbing miner's socks. Of course, it doesn't have to turn out that way. I mean, no one's even driven a stake yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on the grid map of the Town of Nowhere, which is empty at the start of the game. As players take their turns and the game progresses the map will become populated with all the buildings and businesses you'd expect in the Old West.  Each player controls the movements and actions of their gang of associates as they move about town taking care of business and business can be anything from manning the counter at the dry goods store to gunning down the marshal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game wins and gets to name the town after themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
