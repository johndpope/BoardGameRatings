			<description>Symbol-8 is the Math game which uses some difficult functions as multiples, logs, square roots etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basics of the game involve using the cards in your hand to change the number(not a number card, just a known number between the players) to another number which is integer between 0-100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of game:&lt;br/&gt;The one who plays all cards from his hand first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of players:&lt;br/&gt;2-4, more if you play using more sets of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 36 cards divided into 2 kinds of cards:(Reset cards, Functions cards)&lt;br/&gt;1. Reset card:  have 4 different kinds of cards&lt;br/&gt;   a) 8 CARD: Reset the number to 8.&lt;br/&gt;   b) PRIME CARD: Reset the number to any prime number, eg.2,3,5,...89,97.&lt;br/&gt;   c) 3 CARD: Reset the number to the multiple of 3. eg. 3,6,9,...,99.&lt;br/&gt;   d) 0,64,100 CARD: Reset the number to 0, 64 or 100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Functions card: contains 5 kinds of cards.&lt;br/&gt;   a)MULTIPLE CARDS(x2, x3, x5, x10) : Each of difficult cards multiple the number to x2, x3, x5, x10. Eg. the number on table is 14. You can play x5 to change the number to 70. But you cannot play x10 because it is out of the range 0-100.&lt;br/&gt;   b)DIVISOR CARDS(/2, /3, /5, /10) : Each of difficult cards divided the number to /2, /3, /5, /10.&lt;br/&gt;   c)ADDITION or SUBTRACTION CARDS(+1, -3): Add or subtract the number same as the number on the card.&lt;br/&gt;   d) SQUARE CARDS(X^2, X^(1/2), X^3, X^(1/3)): Square the number follow the card. eg. you use the card &amp;quot;X^2&amp;quot; to change the number from 8 to 64. Then the player next to you can use the card &amp;quot;X^(1/3)&amp;quot; to make the number 64 to 4.&lt;br/&gt;   e)LOG CARD (log, log^-1): To log or log^-1 the number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beside two kinds of cards in function, there are 2 different color backgrounds on the side of the function.&lt;br/&gt;BLACK BACKGROUND: The function cards except &amp;quot;addition or subtraction card&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;BLUE BACKGROUND: The reset cards and &amp;quot;addition or subtraction card&amp;quot;(function cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
