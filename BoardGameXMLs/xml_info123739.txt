			<description>Once upon a time, there was two kids. One is a hero, another is a magician. But they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough the power for the battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyday, as they win the lord of the Death somewhere, they have the training in the little cave near their village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative card game.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of every round, the monster card is drawn. And each player opens one magical card on the table from the start player. When the weak set of the monster card is made, the players win it. But when the players open more mistaken card, the monster attacks them, and removes one ore more magical cards. When the players win all monsters, the game is success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
