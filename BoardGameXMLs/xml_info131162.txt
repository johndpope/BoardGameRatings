			<description>The Tiki are back in the latest installment of the Tiki Games Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiki Poker is an easy-to-learn card game for four people.  It is a poker game with some fun twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you have been chosen to represent your Polynesian tribe at the annual Poker Showdown. You've been given the awesome responsibility to play a high stakes poker game to collect valuable sand dollars for your tribe. If you win, you will live in luxury for many years... but if you loose you'll be looking for a new home.  The stakes could not be higher!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not your normal poker game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tiki Poker you'll make decisions that affect future hands, play multiple hands from the same deck, and decide if you want to bet that you have the best or worst hand... or both at the same time!  You'll need all your wits when you play because while the Tiki can bring you some luck, you also will need to plan ahead.  Because the deck is used for more than one hand the cards that are played early are not available later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, all the fun of poker is here, the betting, the bluffing, and the joy of winning all those sand dollars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So put on your best lei, don your Tiki Poker face and dive into a fun, fast paced card game that is both familiar and fresh at the same time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
