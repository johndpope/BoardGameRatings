							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Depths of Courage, Volume 8: The Raids on Algeciras</name>
									
			<description>Starting in December of 1942, and again in May and July of 1943, the Italians used an interned freighter, the Olterra, as a base from which their &amp;ldquo;frogmen&amp;rdquo; limpeters commandoes conducted daring night-time raids against Allied shipping in the harbor near Gibraltar. The raiders&amp;rsquo; base of operations was never discovered until Italy surrendered on September 8, 1943. During the time they were active; the Italian commandos sank or severely damaged many Allied ships, making them one of the most daring clandestine raiding forces of WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the three or four, two-man crew S.L.C (siluro lenta corsa) Maiale (Pig) class mini-submarines. You must endeavor to overcome the Allied defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or escaping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Depths of Courage, Volume 8: The Raids on Algeciras  is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One 11 by 17 inch point-to-point map.&lt;br/&gt;     22 double-sided, un-mounted counters&lt;br/&gt;     2 pages of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player will also need a standard deck of playing cards and a six-sided die to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
