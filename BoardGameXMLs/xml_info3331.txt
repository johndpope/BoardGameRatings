			<description>The object of the game is to bring pearls to Scheherazade. An Arabian Nights themed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, every player receives a secret color card. The color of the secret card designates the color of the harem's room to be reached. Each round is divided in two phases. The first phase determines who can move, in the second phase, 1 camel and the bedouins are moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Buying the right to move.&lt;br/&gt;The players do not move one after the other, but must buy the right to move every time. In order to buy the right to move in Phase 2, the players make bids in secret by taking any number of pearls into their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: Moving the caravan&lt;br/&gt;The caravan leader must move a camel and may move all of the bedouins belonging to that camel. He may move bedouins of all colors. Bedouins and camels can only move forwards. The caravan leader alone decides, which bedouins he takes along or leaves behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who is first to place a bedouin of his color into the correct harem's room and can give Scheherazade 3 pearls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
