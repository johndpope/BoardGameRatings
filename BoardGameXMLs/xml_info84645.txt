							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arm Wrestling</name>
									
			<description>Arm Wrestling is a 1985 arcade game developed and released only in North America by Nintendo and a spin-off of the Punch-Out!! series. Since it was created by the same development team who made the Punch-Out!! series, Arm Wrestling features many of the same features such as a dual monitor system and quirky computer opponents. It was Nintendo's last arcade game they independentally developed and released. The game was almost exclusively released overseas, with only a few machines available in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arm Wrestling (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
