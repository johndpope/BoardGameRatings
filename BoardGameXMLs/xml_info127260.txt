			<description>This is the 4x4 version of the game Connex'Oh which uses a grid of 6x6 tiles and was also released by EdiGames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 players face each other across a large plastic board that contains a grid of 4x4 square plastic tiles. All tiles are divided into a black and white triangular half, with a landing space on each side for the playing piece of that color. Tiles have a handle stuck in the middle that enables them to be lifted up, twisted round and replaced without the risk of having pieces slip off. Both the black and white player have 4 stones of their respective colors that start on opposite sides of the board. All tiles initially face the same direction, so that no two touching sides have the same color and hence no &amp;quot;connections&amp;quot; exist on the board at the start of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By twisting tiles, players can create &amp;quot;connections&amp;quot; of identically colored halves, creating a corridor along which pieces of that color can progress. Each turn players either twist one tile in the aim to improve the available route, or move a stone along one of those routes. Players try to remove all stones in their color from the other side of the board. The first to do so is the winner. A tile that has just been lifted gets a red marker on it. It prevents that tile from being turned by the player who is next. Additionally, it also prevents 1 or 2 neighboring tiles from being turned, as long as a connection in that player's color was created to the neighboring tile(s) by the newly placed one. An elegant rule that prevents stalemates and adds another tactic to employ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
