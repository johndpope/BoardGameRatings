			<description>A game from the Pelikan bookcase series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes two map boards (beginning and advanced) and also includes a plastic divider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The divider is similar to those used in navigation except this one is fixed and cannot be adjusted. The player places one of the points of the divider in the start hole. The divider is then rotated until a hole matching the radius of the divider is found. There are multiple hole at this radius. One of the holes is chosen and the other point of the divider is rotated until another hole is found and chosen. This continues alternating points of the divider until the goal is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting solo game that seems more like a puzzle. Re-playability is somewhat limited as there are only two different boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game could be extended to multiple players by keeping track of the number of times that the divider points are placed in new holes. The player with the fewest number wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
