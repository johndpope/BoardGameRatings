			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spellbook Games has posted a new free adventure site, 'Temple of Modiboga.'  This is another in an occasional series of iconic dungeon locations. rooms that should be found in any megadungeon.  Temple of Modiboga is a small, self-contained, ruined temple, consisting of a main room, two elevated areas, and several small rooms of the main level. Although the original worshipers were slaughtered long ago, the temple area is now being used by Goblins to sacrifice to their tribal patron. The adventuring site is suitable for a small group of Adventurers of L2-L4. Modiboga is written using Spellbook Game's 'Portal to Adventure' rules but can be used as-is by Games Masters using most old-school rules (not suitable for 3E/4E).  Available as a PDF (only) from the Spellbook Games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2015 update:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small adventure describes the ruins of an underground temple built centuries ago by the Priest, Modiboga, and later desecrated by barbarian invaders.  This is a location suitable for setting in any underground site, and can be run in a single game session (or less). It is intended for Adventurers of low to moderate experience Levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
