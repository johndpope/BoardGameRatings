							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alternity Bughunters Conversion ShoreCon Adventure</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Outline&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is written for the Alternity game set in the Amazing Engine world of BUGHUNTERS by TSR, Inc. In this setting, players take on the role of space marines and play out sequences not unlike the films Aliens and Starship Troopers. They work for UTRPF, the United Terran Reconnaissance and Protection Force (see Handout 1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP: UTRPF HQ receives word that the small colony outpost Konois 5 in the Beta Hydri system (5th planet) recently became victim of an electrical storm, which blew out their agrodome, and repairs are not going well. A backup engineering crew and lots of food supplies are being prepared to be shipped to the colony. A small marine crew is sent as escort and to lead the mission and assure compliance from the frantic colonists. The players take the parts of the pregenerated Marine force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
