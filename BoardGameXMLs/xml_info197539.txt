			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Double Spiral War, Warren Norwood's chronicle of interstellar combat is a powerful, graphically realistic epic on a vast cosmic scale. When mankind left behind their old home to seek out new lands beyond the dark spaces between galaxies, they hoped to leave behind them the conflict and chaos that has been their heritage since they first spoke tales of their histories. However, it wasn't as easy as that. Even amongst alien species, mankind still found cause to war amongst itself. Several decades before, the Sondak Confederacy worried about the growing power of the United Central Systems, a group dominated by humans genetically modified to have a much longer life span. As a result, they launched a war that waged for years tearing at both societies until finally they forced the U.C.S. to accept humiliating terms in exchange for peace. The Sondak Confederacy is complacent and unaware that the U.C.S. is on the verge of finally seeking vengeance for the loss of the previous war. And in the churning wake of these two giants, all the races of the galaxy and the lives of many individuals shall be turned upside down. But the question is whose vengeance is being sought? Is it that of a nation's or could it be that of a single person? This setting book for the Traveller game engine is your chance to make a difference in the war, do you have what it takes to turn the tide of the war, or even hold your faith in the midst of the worst conflict of all time. This product contains information on careers, ships, worlds and equipment as detailed in the Double Spiral War trilogy for the Traveller Role Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
