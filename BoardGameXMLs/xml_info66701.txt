			<description>Low level battles against the imperialist aggressors in Zululand, 1879.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules are to provide a framework for wargames that simulate the wide range of small battles that were fought when the British Army launched an unprovoked invasion of Zululand in January 1879. The famous battles are well known, but the emphasis of this set of rules is on the smaller actions typically between 500-2000 Zulu and a company of 120 or so of British.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is intended for use with toy solders at the 1/300 scale, although it could just as easily be played at other scales or even with counters on a map.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The fundamental assumptions are that the firepower of a formed line of British infantry is very devastating, and that the determination and tactical handing of the fighters on both sides is critical to the outcome of each battle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
