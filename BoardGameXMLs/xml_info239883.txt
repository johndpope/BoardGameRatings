							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bear Went Over the Mountain</name>
									
			<description>It's a lovely fall day, and Bear wants to go for a hike to see what she can see. Two to four players each build their own hikes full of animals, trees, hills, and valleys by laying out a landscape of cards. Bear knows what she likes, and the player with the most interesting hike wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bear Went Over the Mountain is a card-laying and set-collection game for preschoolers, ages 4 and up. Players choose goals, such as spotting the most bluebirds, squirrels, or skunks, then select and play cards into a landscape. Scoring relies on counting, as well as simple addition and subtraction. Although some reading skill is helpful, pictures and color icons are on every card for those still learning their ABCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed as part of the 2017 Children's Game Print and Play Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Big kids' may opt to play with variant rules for a more difficult card-drafting multiplayer game, or attempt a solitaire version, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
