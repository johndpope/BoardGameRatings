							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of Life and Tomb of Death</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two sample lairs for use with Races of Faer√ªn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs may find themselves in one or both of these sample lairs for two of the races detailed in Races of Faer&amp;ucirc;n. The first details the ancient fortress tower of Tiru Tel-Quessir, an elven creation that was originally meant to serve as a place where ambassadors of the various elf subraces could meet in a friendly environment and discuss the state of their empires. The tower was abandoned at one time, though it now serves as a bastion of defense in a hostile land. The second lair details a Netherese tomb that has been discovered recently and partially settled by a tribe of unruly orcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each lair provides a history and a description of the major areas of interest within, along with abbreviated statistics for the denizens of the lair. You can develop these barebones nonplayer characters (NPCs) as you see fit, molding and changing them to fit your campaign, no matter what world it takes place in. You can also adapt the areas for any levels, swapping out creatures as needed to suit the level of your player characters (PCs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
