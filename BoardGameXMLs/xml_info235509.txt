			<description>Opale Noir is a game where you play as precious stones hunters. &lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to acquire a collection of stones among the rarest and most prized of the planet: Alexandrites, Benitoites, Jadeites, Painites.&lt;br/&gt;In this game all the moves are allowed; you will have recourse to the crime, to the magic of the stones (in other words Lithomancy), to the political manipulations of the Metropoles, to negotiation and other subterfuges to reach your goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players with the most Prestige points win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mining empires can quickly ascend and be of a formidable power, but here all power is more or less an illusion and many empires have only a fear, see their inconsistency unraveled, end up disfigured by some birds of prey until the fragments of their formerly imposing forces eventually turn against them. Bluff, audacity and deterrence are essential compensating factors for the success of such empires.&lt;br/&gt;It would be sage to mention that these empires share their intrinsic apprehension with the clarity, ruthlessly attract players fanatic of the order, suspecting and nosing without intransigence or even players without morals that such parasites survive to them.&lt;br/&gt;Let us mention again the Lithomanian players who under the blindness of their autarkic devellopement bring to their entourage the severe weight of their misdeeds and spells.&lt;br/&gt;zEach puzzle of these great strategic currents offers their pieces, free to each of them to arrange on the woof of an original and inventive strategy.&lt;br/&gt;We are dealing here with a fierce competition for limited resources, whose pecuniary values and interest in terms of objective correspond to a tight and fluctuating timing.&lt;br/&gt;Within this latent tension it is up to the players to contain their disconveniences because expansion and margins of actions are amply dependent on a collaboration of good quality, sometimes forced, if not imposed.&lt;br/&gt;A world where raptors and wolves live under the cover of a lamb will be very sad if the spirits of the stones are displeased by so many lithurgical vacarmes and human activities, mingle with the party, leaving their apparitions to their disappearance that a trail of desolations, whose effects will be crescendo with the power of the players, frequencies of irruption will go along with the frenetic appetite of the players for the inestimable stones.&lt;br/&gt;- The Prestige, A balancing act&lt;br/&gt;This game will still be far too wise if there was this subtle tension of the tightrope walker on his rope, handle this wrist of markers &amp;quot;Useful to do everything&amp;quot; and which at the slightest false step sticks crumpled after crumb at the bottom of a chasm, offers salt and pepper to the most deceitful.&lt;br/&gt;Players will judicieusemet, meticulously, split their markers to see the immobilized on options broken down between the game board, the recruiting board and their personal trays.&lt;br/&gt;- The Prestige, deep strategy&lt;br/&gt;Like a game of chess the order is reversed here, the beginning of the game wide open, the abundance and the adaptability of the choices (however tempered by some pecuniary need&lt;br/&gt;and the always too measured coming of the stones) nourish the naivet&amp;eacute; of the player, alas for the most part the net does not close too quickly, the voices of survival is reduced and the actions which there will be no need for an interest in an andean are gradually taking on a disproportionate importance.&lt;br/&gt;The players will end up breathless, until the last final moment, but is it not out of breath that it builds the prestige of a victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
