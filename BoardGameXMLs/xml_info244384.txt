							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crabs (1983)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agility is the key to successfully guiding Herbie (the halibut) through the maze, avoiding the deadly gaze of sonic crabs while feeding on delectable night crawlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more you eat, the higher your score.  Each time you clear the maze of tasty morsels, you will receive more time, additional lives, and a new group of night crawlers, as the game of survival continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware! With the passing of time your presence becomes increasingly aggravating to the killer crabs who lurk within, improving the accuracy of their menacing sonic waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set at beginner or advanced levels, each game is played in a totally new maze, and may consist of any number of rounds that start identically for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crabs can be played using your VIC-20 keyboard or joystick, and will work on all standard VIC-20 memory configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
