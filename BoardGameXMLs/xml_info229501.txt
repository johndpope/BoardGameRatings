			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find yourself a member of a small-town cult. Excitement is in the air as the day of reckoning looms - though some members have fallen into disbelief, and seek to escape the cult before that day arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Believers strive to keep the membership strong enough to survive until Achieving Glory, while Runners work secretly to escape before they become a cautionary tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt secret character and loyalty cards. For five rounds, you all have the opportunity to play actions and purchase cards with the aim of earning points for your team. Bluffing is critical to the game, but be careful - if caught, you lose your anonymity and valuable action options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the Runners prevail and return to safety, or will the entire town perish at the hands of the Believers? The clock is ticking, and the time to run is running out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
