			<description>The Synestructics company sold the building toy of the same name, which was a set of hollow rods of various lengths and connectors with various numbers of prongs, which together could be combined to build three-dimensional frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NetResults is a game which uses Synestructic pieces - one type of connector and one size of rod (in three colors).  Starting with a simple triangle, players take turns adding pieces to a common structure, attempting to complete polygons of any shape.  Points are awarded for the polygons based on the number of edges, with extra points awarded for completing polygons that use pieces from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by 2-3 players as individuals and 4 or 6 players in teams of two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
