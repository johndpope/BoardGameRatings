							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unfortunates of Tozlandia and the Tablet of Doom</name>
									
			<description>You and 14 others have decided to create a new life on the peninsula of Tozlandia. The land is lush and plentiful, however after settling life, a dark, secret tablet is uncovered. After years of deciphering it is revealed that the land of the unfortunates will be ravaged by disasters predicted by the Tablet of Doom and that time when these things will unfold is drawing near. It dawns on you that you and your Tozlandianites are the unfortunates! You quickly re-read the tablet and realize that you only have time to build safe houses to survive the onslaught that&amp;rsquo;s about to happen. All of the other unfortunates are looking to you to help them get to the safe houses and avoid disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;To have more than half of the unfortunates survive the events predicted by the Tablet of Doom. Unfortunates survive by making it to a safe house, however more than half of the unfortunates must make it to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing The Game:&lt;br/&gt;Turns are broken down into a few parts, first you take your action phase and then you tempt fate and roll two 6-sided dice and do what happens on the Matrix of Doom. Finally you check to see if you have won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns continue in the fashion until all unfortunates are in safe houses, all safe houses are destroyed, or no more unfortunates can move.  If you've gotten the required number of unfortunates to safe houses you've won the game, otherwise the game is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed for the 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest placing 3rd in the Category of &amp;quot;Best Small Game&amp;quot; -- 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Results Post&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
