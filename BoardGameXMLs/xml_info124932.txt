							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alortun: The Crown of Skulls</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years before Exa I crowned himself King of Agyraea, a group of knights loyal to Exa discovered an ancient Dwarven temple; inside, hidden under the altar, was a locked trapdoor that led to a room housing a single Darkwood chest. Unable to open the chest they brought it to Exa believing it to house some important treasure. Even the most powerful magic user Exa could call upon was not able to open the chest. The night after the magic user gave the chest back he took it with him into a temple where he kept a nights vigil, the first of many he kept before major battles. In the morning he rode out, with an open Darkwood chest, at the head of an army. Two weeks later he rode back at the head of a victorious army wearing the treasure from inside the chest, a spectacular crown, the same crown that ten years later was placed upon his head when he was crowned King Exa I of Agyaea; the Crown of Victors, not the ancient Crown of Agyraea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
