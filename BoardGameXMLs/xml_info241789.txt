			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mad Bomber you are faced with aliens in a huge ship hovering overhead.  They have bomb racks which they constantly fill with bombs.  Your object is to move from side to side on the ground and zap the bombs in the bomb racks or as they fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, the aliens fill up their bomb racks more quickly and the bombs fall faster.  You lose after ten bombs have hit the area which you are defending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad Bomber can be played by one player solor or by two players as a team or as opponents.  Two skill levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
