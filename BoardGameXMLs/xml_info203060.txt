							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fylgjan Record</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those of us that are committed to the truths that may be held within these pages are drawn to the poignant and unusual nature of many of the entries. The events recounted in these entries are novel, unique, and often quite extraordinary. Some of the readers find themselves more personally invested in the project than previously expected due to these fascinating elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The avant-garde, free-form game is hosted at a shared site that purports to present discovered artifacts.  Players are encouraged to examine the artifacts and make contributions of other artifacts, as well as make comments and speculation about the collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
