			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Deluxe Issue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 11 threat on his own, Rayzer is almost never alone. As a Renegade, Rayzer acts outside the law and by his own code. Whether the players see him as a villain or hero will very much depend on how they relate to him and the actions he takes. Rayzer is presented as a special deluxe-sized issue of Rogues, Rivals &amp;amp; Renegades with a map of his base and gorgeous art of his amazing submersible vehicle, the Karkarius! You'll also get details on &amp;quot;Rayzer's Raiders,&amp;quot; the devoted soldiers who have allied themselves with Rayzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
