			<description>&amp;quot;Pelles riddarspel&amp;quot; (Pelle's knight game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the childrens book &amp;quot;Pelle hj&amp;auml;lper en riddare&amp;quot; (Pelle helps a knight), the object is to be the first one to run through the castles different obstacles. The most imminent threat is the dragon. If you happen to stay on that circle you have to almost start all over again. The game is suitable for smaller children and the dice is the only tool. So there is no skill what so ever needed to be able to play the game. Some reading knowledge might be needed to support the first round to be able to solve what is written. But even the smallest children will get the point after the first round. The advantage of the game, that it is very easy to play, might also be its disadvantage. It gets boring quite fast. Even for the smaller children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
