			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QADD Excursions are short self contained solo adventures for QADD: Quick And Dirty Dungeons. The adventures will usually have a quest to complete or an explore an area withing a given time frame. You ma use the any version of the QADD rules or the abbreviated version below. QADD works with any kind of dice as long as you use all the same sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gift of Gzntyt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been entrusted by Prince Khladnareeeeeen to deliver a special jewel encrusted bottle, a gift for the beautiful Princess Gzntyt, to the city of Gihn. To do so however you must travel across the Mahalhakkki desert(I didn't know it existed either). The journey will take 15 days and only 15 days, any more will unleash terrible portents for you(The Prince's words). You will be outfitted with15 daily rations, 15 daily allowances of water(actually they are magical tablets of hydration, lighter to carry than all that water), and a portable shelter to protect you at night. Tonight you have been given a luxurious room in the palace with all of the amenities you could think of. Enjoy yourself because your journey begins in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
