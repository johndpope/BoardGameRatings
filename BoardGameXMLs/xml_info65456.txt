			<description>The learner group consists of junior varsity football players who play the positions of defensive linemen and linebackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer, called &amp;quot;coach,&amp;quot; controls the play cards and gap cards. (A gap is an area of the interior line for which a defensive lineman or linebacker is responsible.) The coach deals seven of the position cards to each of the players. The coach exposes the play card, waits five seconds, then exposes the gap card. If a player holds the card of the position that is responsible for that gap, he may put that card face down on the table. The players have five seconds to put their cards down after the gap card is exposed. On the command of the coach, any player who puts down a card must turn it over. If the player is correct, he gets a point. If wrong, he loses a point. If a player has no points and is wrong, his score becomes a negative number. Players who put cards down may get a new card from the position deck. The cards that are put down will be collected by the coach. If necessary, the coach will check the results against the play sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get ten points wins the round and gets to be coach for the next round. The previous coach then becomes a player; however, he will need 12 points to win the round after being the coach. Rounds may continue as time permits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;64 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
