							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chip</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of 60 numbered color disks (five colors, numbers 1-6, two of each number in each color). 25 of these are shuffled and placed face-up on the table in a 5x5 grid. A pawn is placed on the chip in the center. &lt;br/&gt;The players now take turns rolling a 1/2/3 die and moving the pawn the respective distance over the grid (orthogonally only).At the end of their move, they can pick up the chip they are standing on and replace it by a new one.&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until there are no replacement chips left. Then the players count their score: Each set of three chips in three different colors with the same number and each set of three with a sequence of consecutive numbers (i.e. 3,4,5) counts as many points as the sum of the numbers. A set of only one color counts double. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
