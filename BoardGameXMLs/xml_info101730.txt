							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horse Race Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a fun game for 2 players. You are trying to race a horse to the finish line, but along the way some of the holes will &amp;quot;swallow&amp;quot; up your horse and you have to start all over with a new horse. First one to the finish wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Be the first to get a &amp;quot;horse&amp;quot; peg to the finish line&lt;br/&gt;Rules: Each player selects a color. Players alternate turns rolling the single die. From the starting position move a peg the number of holes as on the dice roll. Note that SOME of the holes in the board have no bottom. A horse that lands here will fall through he board into the box and be out of the game. Player must then start at the beginning with a new horse. Winner is the first person to reach the last hole on an exact roll, or if a player loses all his pegs, the remaining player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Alternate play rules: You may enter more than 1 horse of your color on the board. You must make a legal move every roll, and 2 horses cannot occupy the same hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
