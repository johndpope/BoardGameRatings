			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;What is Oceans RPG?&lt;br/&gt;Oceans RPG is a roleplaying game where you play a team of thieves engaged in a series of jobs. Each player controls a &lt;br/&gt;number of characters on an elite crew of misfits. The entire game is managed by a gamemaster (GM). Each job is it&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;br/&gt;adventure, similar to a dungeon in a traditional RPG design. A series of jobs is a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;Oceans has an unusual dice mechanic derived from Craps.  Two dice are rolled, 2 being a failure and 12 being a critical failure. 7 is the standard target number and skill points are used to modify the die roll to make it equal to 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players give the GM a number of chips that are used to construct the challenges for a scenario.  The GM also uses these chips in play to bolster a target's defenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
