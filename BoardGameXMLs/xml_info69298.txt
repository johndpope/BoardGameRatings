			<description>The Getta Goff Challenge games are a series of milk cap games (also known as Pog) with special rules and instructions meant to add a more educational twist to standard Pog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional Pog is played by stacking a variety of milk caps (aka Pogs) on top of a playing mat. Players then take turns throwing a &amp;quot;Slammer&amp;quot; (which is usually a much thicker plastic or metal Pog) onto the top of the stack in an attempt flip as many of the stacked Pogs upside down as possible. Generally, players then take  ownership of any Pogs that flipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Advanced Math Getta Goff, for example, the players must carry out mathematical operations based on the instructions on the flipped Pogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
