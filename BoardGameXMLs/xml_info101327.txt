							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Bitter Harvest</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bitter Harvest is designed for 3-6 characters in their second careers, although the difficulty level can be changed for groups of other sizes and experience levels. It can be run independently or inserted into an existing campaign. It is a rural adventure, involving social interaction amongst commoners, outdoors travel and some magic. A party without stealth skills will have a very hard time. Familiarity with Greenskins and someone with Magical Sense would help but are by no means necessary. Careful roleplayers can complete the adventure with only one easy combat. Clumsy ones and/or PCs with an overwhelming hatred of Goblinoids (e.g. an uncontrollably deranged Trollslayer) will find themselves losing Fate Points in a full-scale battle. While most kinds of characters will have something to contribute, very urban-focussed or upper-class characters will need careful roleplaying and gamesmastering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure can take place in any hilly area within a day&amp;rsquo;s travel of a town on a major river, although if the campaign is set after the Storm of Chaos it should be placed towards the West and South of the Empire where the economy is relatively undisturbed. It takes place in late summer or early autumn. The players will need to show initiative to get the most out of the adventure. The first part is linear, but with numerous roleplaying opportunities during which the PCs can learn what is going on. What they discover will then inform their decisions in the much more open conclusion. Completion should take 2-4 sessions (8-16 hours of play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
