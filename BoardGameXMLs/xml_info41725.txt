			<description>The design&lt;br/&gt;Processing born from a contest to design a game that uses only 4 tiles or 4 cards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408/page/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408/page/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the conception to the end of contest didn't improved very much on concept, just having a better written rules and hi-res tiles replacement.&lt;br/&gt;The concept, beta testing and initial manual was designed by baalrukh, and while the contest still going JoffW entered into the project to test it further and totally redesign the manual, giving it a cleaner look with a user friendly language. JoffW also helped a lot in finding some holes in the tiles and clarifying the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story&lt;br/&gt;You just finished your program, right on time. Now you only need to process it through the computer and print your report; it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a major breakthrough for mankind.&lt;br/&gt;As you go by the hall, you see that strange fellow that works at the other end of the laboratory, and, of course, you never liked him. As you walk you realise he is going to the same computer room as you. He also realises this and, running, you both enter the computer room.&lt;br/&gt;You argue, the lab rat responses, &amp;quot;I was here first!&amp;quot; Just as the dispute was going backwards in evolution, the technician says the stupidest thing: &amp;quot;Why don&amp;rsquo;t we share the computer?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;You agree, but you know that the computer only has 4 slots for 8 computing boards; you intend to be smarter than him and have your program processed as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Processing is a free Print'n'Play game that ended in 3th at the contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/391766/page/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/391766/page/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
