			<description>You and your friends are business moguls and there is a new plot of land in the city that is ripe for building!  You want to build the most floors, have the tallest sky scrapers, and screw over your opponents.  Each tunr you take your fortune into your own hands by choosing more or less risky bets on what numbers will be rolled and what resources to collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporate America was built on ruthless tactics and stock photography.  The dark humor and art reinforces this point with leadership cards that players strategically utilize to gain ground on their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Metropolis is a 3-4 player worker game that features worker placement and resource collection.  Inspired by Settlers of Catan and Small World, My Metropolis is a fast paced and cut throat gaming experience with varied strategy and unique artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
