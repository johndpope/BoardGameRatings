			<description>SP Ski jumping is a free PnP solo/competetive sport game that recreates Ski Jumping events. The game adopts International rules by FIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No dice are required, the game is driven only FAC (free action cards). The cards manage the 4 phases of a ski jump: in-run, lift-off, flight and landing.&lt;br/&gt;In each jump each jumper receives also the 5 marks of Judges and the correct wind correction. Both of this are driven by FAC. &lt;br/&gt;A display sheet included in the game components helps to drive each phase of jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a card for several jumpers. In each jumper card are printed information about statistical lenght of jump, rank, medium mark, nationality and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's possible to recreate an entire World cup of this discipline or other venues or a tournament between players using a team of jumpers from different nations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each event a jump sheet is used to write all information about each jump and mark. Copy on sheet the event, date and k point of the facility used, then the name of jumpers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sort jumper cards marked and turn several FAC for each jump. &lt;br/&gt;After calculate by FAC the lenght of jump, points are gained, like in the official rules of FIS (Ski jump federation) by the lenght of jump, correction of wind (tail or head) and marks of judges. A temporary standings is formed after the first jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the 30th better ski jumpers cards can make the final jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sum the points for the first and second jump and an official standing is formed for each event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
