			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Stage One: Brennan Taylor; Stage Two: Samuel Briggson; Stage Three: Adam McConnaughey&lt;br/&gt;Stage One and Two Title: Nomenklatura&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santa Claus                        Lucifer&lt;br/&gt;Kris Kringle                        The Devil&lt;br/&gt;Father Christmas                    Satan&lt;br/&gt;Saint Nicholas                        The Morning Star&lt;br/&gt;Kerstman                        Beelzebub&lt;br/&gt;P&amp;egrave;re No&amp;euml;l                        Prince of Darkness&lt;br/&gt;Sinterklaas                        Iblis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you honestly think that any of those are the true name of those beings? The name that their lover moans in bed? The name that their mother used when scolding them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Names have power. A being who knows your true name&amp;mdash;your Nomen&amp;mdash;has mystical power over you. They can see your essence, can summon you, and with a little know-how, they can exert some amount of control over your actions. That's the reason why beings of power are known by so many false names. It defuses the influence and control that others have over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nomina (that&amp;rsquo;s the plural) of mortals are useful in the mortal sphere. Nomina of creatures of power&amp;mdash;well, those get you a little something extra. The Nomen of a truly magical being can grant its user a little bit of the being&amp;rsquo;s power. These Nomina are therefore of particular value. There's nothing you can do to lessen the impact of your true name&amp;mdash;you can only hide it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s the service we at Anonym provide. For a reasonable fee, we guarantee that no one&amp;mdash;be they meddlesome warlock, frisky entrepreneur, dead god, or any other identity thief&amp;mdash;will discover your Nomen. Open an Anonym Silver account, and our Memetic Specialists will monitor your identity and see whose prying eyes are trying to find you. We will inform you of all dangerous internet searches, library use, and occult rituals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if someone does manage to somehow unearth your Nomen, we promise to neutralize all memetic threat and fix all damage within 48 hours&amp;mdash;or YOUR MONEY BACK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
