			<description>The conquest of B-Xion takes place during several game turns and its duration may vary between games.&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player rolls the dice, activates events and uses the points obtained to carry out corporate actions, and may also spend credits to use corporate activities and sector activities. Once the player finishes performing all his actions he passes the corporate actions card to the player on his left who will play his turn.&lt;br/&gt;During the game each corporation (player), sends new spaceships to the galaxy, mobilizes its fleets, fights with rival spaceships, infiltrates agents in planets, mobilizes its agents to gain influence or control of the sector and can also explore new sectors to expand the Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;Players will explore and consolidate sectors during the course of the game and at the moment that any player manages to consolidate its fifth sector the game ends immediately, then check the victory points obtained by the consolidated sectors.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most victory points at the end of the game will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
