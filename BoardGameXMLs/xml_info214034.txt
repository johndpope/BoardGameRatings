			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time of a game, players put themselves in the shoes of a homo sapiens clan leader and send their hunters to seek food for the tribe. However, in these fierce ages, competition with other tribes is tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 2 packs: the pack of hunter cards and the pack of food cards. By playing their hunter cards, players will try to retrieve the best foods for them and leave the bad foods for others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally yours strongests hunters will leave with the good foods, and yours weaks hunters will try to avoid bad foods. But it's not that simple, because sometimes strong hunters can lose, and weak hunters can become strong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch the short video to understand the principle (on youtube or vimeo) :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK4KZEOS1iI&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK4KZEOS1iI&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;feature=youtu.be&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/192649809&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://vimeo.com/192649809&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
