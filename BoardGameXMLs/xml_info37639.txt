			<description>The Towers of Babylon is a game by the designer of Crazy Diamond and Karatino. The large, modular board consists of the center tower with areas surrounding it. Players win the game in one of two ways: capture one of the three tower Princesses and then conquer the Citadel, or gain 50 crown points. Crown points are earned by successfully attacking other knights and holding certain territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While described as a family game, there are some more serious aspects of the play that make this questionable. Knights must be trained before they can be brought into your army, and having access to on oasis is necessary to make this happen. This requires planning and a strategic eye toward how others are building their resources. There are different rules for attacks based on the relative location to the palace. Attacks are made using cards, and this is true when attacking other knights or trying to conquer the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
