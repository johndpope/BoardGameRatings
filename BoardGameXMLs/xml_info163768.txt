			<description>I Don't Need to Outrun the Zombie is a game that combines press your luck dice rolling with the need to anticipate your friend's choices. Will they try to come to your aid, leave you to fend for yourself, or outright stab you in the back? Every player must choose what will best help them survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play happens in phases. In the first phase of each round, the players (in turn order) roll their dice and attempt to get the best score possible. A given die may be rerolled any number of times until a) the player accepts the number on the die or b) the die rolls a 1. If the die rolls a one, that die is locked at one for the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once each player has their starting roll for the round, the scheming begins. Each player must choose to help or hinder an opponent with five possible outcomes (3 outcomes if there are only two players left).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcome 1 - Player A helps Player B: Player B adds 3 points to their score for the round.&lt;br/&gt;Outcome 2 - Player A hinders Player B: Player B subtracts 3 points.&lt;br/&gt;Outcome 3 - Player A helps Player B and Player B helps Player A: Each player adds 6 points.&lt;br/&gt;Outcome 4 - Player A hinders Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Each player subtracts 6 points.&lt;br/&gt;Outcome 5 - Player A helps Player B and Player B hinders Player A: Player A subtracts 6 Points and Player B adds 6 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the second phase, the player with the lowest score in the round loses a die. Players gain bonus chips adding 1 point to their score for the next round for each player with a higher score in the current round. The player with the highest score goes first next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when only one player is left with dice. All others have been eaten by the zombie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
