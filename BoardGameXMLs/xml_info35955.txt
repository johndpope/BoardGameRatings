			<description>A bidding card game in which the players control airlines. The object is to have the most money at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck consisting of 110 cards of three different types: Planes, Landing Rights, and Events. Landing Rights cards are also called Terminals. Also required for play are a ten-sided die and a paper and pen to record profits (or play money may be used to represent profits instead).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 50 million dollars, one Boeing 737 or one McDonnell Douglas DC-9, and landing rights to two Minor Airports. The game ends when there are no cards left in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
