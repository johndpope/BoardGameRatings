			<description>Fantasy Fame &amp;amp; Fortune is a free print&amp;amp;play dungeon crawl card game. From one to four players venture into different areas to fight monsters, evade traps, find treasure, and complete quests. The game can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player chooses a hero (Warrior, Wizard, Rogue, or Druid). The heroes each have unique traits (e.g. the warrior can carry an extra treasure) and strengths/weaknesses to certain types of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players draw a monster card roll dice to fight the monster. If they win, they get a treasure. Treasure can be weapons, armor, trinkets, potions, or just other things. Unwanted treasure can be sold in town for gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also quest cards that act like missions. The first player to complete the card's quest gets a gold reward and collects the quest card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to collect a certain amount of gold or quest cards. The first player to reach the set amount wins. When playing in teams, the first team to reach the specified amount wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Fame &amp;amp; Fortune is completely free. All you need is to download the PDF files, print out the card sheets, and then cut out the cards. Then, just get a pair of dice and a pencil and paper for scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
