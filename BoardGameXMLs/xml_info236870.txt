							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Poison Apple</name>
									
			<description>The Evil Queen wants a poison for the poison apple. But only the rarest poison based on a dragon's blood will satisfy her needs. The only problem is, the last dragon alive was seen some thousand years ago...  So she turns to a covenant of witches for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take role of the witches that compete to concoct most bottles of the rarest poison in the game (out of 3 kinds). While the total amount of poisons in the game is changing, the rarest type of poison also changes, so the winner is uncertain until the very end. When the 5-th bottle of any type of poison is made, the game ends, and only the rarest poison is counted toward victory condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 action tokens that players may pick, and they represent the actions that each player will play on their next turn. You can not pick action token that are in possession of other player(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will collect ingredients for the poisons from the game board by rolling dice. But ingredients are expendable and the sources will eventually dry up. So in time, it is harder and harder to collect new ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must discover rituals that can convert certain ingredients into a dragon's blood, necessary for concocting the poisons. Players build their gameplay based on the rituals they have discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with one Secret Ally card. If the player finish the game on his turn, and that makes his secret ally player to win - they both win! This eliminates the &amp;quot;kingmaker&amp;quot; mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
