			<description>Assemble an alphabetical sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns choosing to take or pass a card, which they must place on a single line, keeping it in alphabetical order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letters will often be skipped and can't be later inserted. So if you go from N to R, you'll never get to play O, P or Q. Is that a sensible move?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe not given the likelihood of an O, but it also depends how many cards you already have, whether anyone else wants the card, how close the round is to ending...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once someone gets 11 cards, everyone scores a point for each card and you start a new round. If someone accumulated 26 pts total, they win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of many games playable with the Wibbell++ deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
