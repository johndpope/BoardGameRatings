			<description>The lonely dweller of the lighthouse was sailing back to his lookout packed with food when a huge, all-consuming storm started. The raging waves consumed the ship and its load, too. Luckily, he escaped and pulled through the storm on a lonely rock. Four sailboats set out after him competing with each other to hurry to his aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is six wind strength discs (which mark the steps), that lay face down at one end of the board. First player turns over any of the wind strength discs and takes as many steps as shown on the disc. After everyone has looked at the disc, he turns it back over immediately. There is two rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The total number of steps on the disc have to be taken.&lt;br/&gt;     You can step forwards or backwards, but only in one direction at a time, you can&amp;rsquo;t change direction while in motion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If somebody steps on the field where the guard of the lighthouse got shipwrecked, he has to place guard in the boat and continue the trip with him (since the aim is to reach the goal together with him)! If player placed him in the boat, he has to mix the wind strength discs at once, before the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn. This makes the game harder, since the discs memorized so far change their places. The goal is still to arrive on the field where the guard or the ship transporting the guard is standing. According to some rules, the guard can change the boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first docks at the isle of the lighthouse with the guard sitting in his or her boat, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
