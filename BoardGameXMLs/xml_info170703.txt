							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Character Pack (3rd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third edition of a Character Pack for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1st Edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack contains 50 character sheets for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, plus a reprint of the 16-page booklet on character creation from the first edition character pack, providing additional random tables for determining hair colour, family members, distinguishing characteristics and so on. (The booklet was later also reprinted in Apocrypha 2: Chart of Darkness.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cover is more or less identical to the second edition character pack, including the map of Graf Manfred Inn on the insides instead of the typical dress of the first edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back cover is also updated to reflect the changes in the contents from the second edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
