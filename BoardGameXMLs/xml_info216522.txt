			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Perrenland Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two men stood facing each other on a windswept hilltop; so similar in appearance that they had to be brothers. The younger brother looked at the elder with anger in his eyes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So this is how you want it then?  Well, know this &amp;ndash; I will never forgive you of this betrayal. We were brothers, but from this time forward we are no longer!&amp;quot; The younger man disappeared in a flash of shadow. The older brother watched the younger brother disappear with a tear in his eye. &amp;quot;No brother, it was you who betrayed me! But you are my brother, and I forgive you,&amp;quot; he whispered to the wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A woman appeared by his side with a faint rustle of leaves. She placed her hand on his shoulder. &amp;quot;Come, husband, it is time to go. Business will not take care of itself.&amp;quot; He smiled sadly, nodded, and they both disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ancient temple found, a pirate conspiracy foiled, and innocent man saved. Now, the final part of the drama is ready to be played out. Do you have the cunning, strength of arms, and the charisma to end this tale of a brother's love lost? This is a Perrenland regional adventure, which begins in the city of Meerstadt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is for APLs 6-12. Sea legs may be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is Part 3 in the Brother&amp;rsquo;s Love series of adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
