			<description>Contents &lt;br/&gt;4 Boxes of Puzzle Pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Central Pool Puzzle Pieces.&lt;br/&gt;1 Set of Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A game of skill and chance that combines the fascination of Jig-Saw construction with the thrill of a race game.&amp;quot; says the box and going on to say &amp;quot;Not just an ordinary Jig-Saw, but an entirely new idea that leaves the result of the race a speculation to the last piece.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one of the colour coded boxes of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;There is also a central pool of pieces for the water jump.&lt;br/&gt;Players begin their puzzles - This forms part of their race track. Once their piece's are used up,the water jump is made, using pieces from the centre pool. The winner is the first one to complete their track the fastest (including the water jump).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest that counters may be used For side stakes if required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
