			<description>VAIPA QUARTERLY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Issue #3, The Polish Never Quit!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VAIPA QUARTERLY, issue #3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For two decades after WWI Poles drank the sweet elixir of freedom. But envious neighbors saw them not as a country, but as a prize. Finally, the storm clouds broke and armies from East and West marched into Poland.&lt;br/&gt;The Poles fought hard for their country. For six long years they fought. They fought in Poland, they fought in France, they fought in Norway, they fought in Britain, they fought in North Africa, they fought in Italy, they fought in Russia, and finally, they fought in Germany, all the way into Berlin and the Brandenburg Gate. They fought in the air, they fought on the seas, they fought on the land, and they fought behind enemy lines.&lt;br/&gt;They had hoped that their unwavering opposition to the Axis would earn them the right to freedom after the war. Their motto was, &amp;quot;We don't ask for freedom. We fight for freedom!&amp;quot; However, only one of their foes was conquered. The other was now master of Eastern Europe. It would be four more decades until the Polish people would taste that sweet elixir again.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The Polish Anvil (1939)&lt;br/&gt;    * In The Frog Pond (1940)&lt;br/&gt;    * In Limey Land (1941-1945)&lt;br/&gt;    * The Polish Comrades (1943-19454)&lt;br/&gt;    * The Warsaw Ghetto (1943)&lt;br/&gt;    * The Home Army (1945)&lt;br/&gt;    * Warsaw's Warriors (An Up Front&amp;copy; Variant)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The magazine&lt;br/&gt;    * (Insert) 93 Uncut Character cards&lt;br/&gt;          o 1939 Polish Infantry&lt;br/&gt;          o 1939 Polish Cavalry&lt;br/&gt;          o 1939 Polish Airborne&lt;br/&gt;          o 1943 Warsaw Ghetto&lt;br/&gt;          o 1943-1945 Home Army&lt;br/&gt;    * (Insert) 76 Uncut Vehicle cards&lt;br/&gt;          o 1939 Polish&lt;br/&gt;                + AFV's&lt;br/&gt;                + Soft Targets&lt;br/&gt;                + Rail Cars&lt;br/&gt;          o 1939 German&lt;br/&gt;                + AFV's&lt;br/&gt;                + Soft Targets&lt;br/&gt;          o 1944 Polish (Warsaw Uprising captured and homemade vehicles (Chwat, Magda, Kubus, etc.))&lt;br/&gt;    * (Insert) 45 mounted game counters, already separated&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The variant includes rules for 10 Polish armies (1939 Polish Infantry, 1939 Polish Militia, 1939 Polish Cavalry, 1939 Polish Airborne, 1940 Polish/French Infantry, 1941-1945 Polish/British Infantry, 1944-1945 Polish/British Airborne, 1943-1945 Polish/Russian Infantry, 1943 Polish/Jewish Warsaw Ghetto Infantry, and 1944-1945 Polish Home Army Warsaw Uprising Infantry/Partisans), spreadsheets (like in Desert War) showing which cards to use for the original scenarios, partisan scenarios, and new 2-player, 3-player, and solo scenarios.
