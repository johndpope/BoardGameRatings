			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2114, Professor Hybrys invented a new extreme game and announced a fabulous price of one thousand Kronurs to whomever would be able to beat the 80 levels of his new invention, Titan. He conveniently forgot to mention that all the playtesters died during the game. A lot of adventurers have since tried to win, none if them have come back. Do you have enough skill to succeed where so many others have failed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Titan is an arcade-puzzle mix. The player guides a ball across the levels and must either destroy every brick of the level, or push the ball through the exit tile if there is one. Hazards are numerous, including tiles deadly to the ball but not to the player (and vice versa), disappearing walls, teleport traps, walls that allow only the ball to pass through... The player can put the ball in a loop, or catch it and release it later, giving time to study the level and look for a solution. The player can also hold the space bar down to slow down the pace of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version notes:&lt;br/&gt;The Amstrad CPC cassette edition has only 16 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
