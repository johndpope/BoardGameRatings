			<description>Robot Unicorn Attack 2 is the latest implementation of the Robot Unicorn Attack franchise by Adult Swim. It was released on IOS on Thursday, 25 April 2013. This sequel expands upon the original's template by adding new maneuvers like the &amp;quot;Rainbow Savior&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Gallow's Gallop.&amp;quot; It also introduces enemies, missions, and the option to customise your unicorn's appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also introduces the ability to fly, by equipping wings that you unlock in game, to your unicorn. The core gameplay remains the same as in the original browser game, the unicorn will run automatically, while you control the jump and a dash attack. But while the controls are the same, the game has also been fleshed out with a number of new ideas. You can collect coins that can be used to customize your robotic steed with everything from a flaming tail to demon wings, and there are missions that you can complete to unlock new content and abilities. There are even enemies now in the form of giant, laser spewing golems, and friendly cyborg-unicorn-whales that flies past in the background. The visuals have also received a makeover. The unicorn itself is much more detailed and fluid, and the painted backgrounds also have much more depth and detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first Robot Unicorn Attack that includes in game purchases, in the form of buying credits to upgrade your Unicorn and additional sound-packs. Also Erasure's seminal song &amp;quot;Always&amp;quot; - which was a main part of the original game - is not part of the default package and must be purchased separately for $0.99. &amp;quot;I will never be able to separate Always from Robot Unicorn Attack,&amp;quot; wrote Kieron Gillen back in 2010. &amp;quot;I can't even imagine wanting to do such a thing. It'd be like decapitating the Mona Lisa. It merges with the sparkles of sound effects and the explosions of light and makes it complete. ALWAYS IT WANTS TO BE WITH YOU.&amp;quot; The song is not included with the default game due to copyright, and as adult swim wanted the game to be free-to-play they made it an in-game purchase. Also a message that reads &amp;quot;To offer Robot Unicorn Attack 2 for free, we had to make the licensed music an in-app purchase,&amp;quot; displays when you first open the options menu. Other songs are available for purchase too by such bands as Blind Guardian, Slade, Limahl and Corey Hart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Robot Unicorn Attack&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
