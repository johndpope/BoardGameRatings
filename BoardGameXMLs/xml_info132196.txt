			<description>Translated from the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind. - JFK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warsaw, 1964, the conflict which began in 1914 has not ended in 1918. After half a century of war, belligerents have mostly withdrawn from the conflict. Two totalitarian empires remain: the Komingrad (last incarnation of the USSR) and the NeuReich (the legacy of William II's Empire) facing each other relentlessly and without mercy. These two blocks, engaged in a destructive war of attrition, are now fighting in Poland, especially in Warsaw. The country is locked, surrounded by huge walls. Poland has become a vast no man's land between the two armies. A no man's land populated by civilians, resistance fighters, a forgotten population and prisoners of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This confrontation has led to terrible pioneering innovations. Zombie soldiers, insane with superhuman abilities, gun wrapped Zeppelins which ravage the last sections of wall still standing in the martyr city. Completely isolated, the city has been forgotten by the rest of the world, which simply waits cautiously for the end of the conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People have joined a faction (resistance patriots, smugglers, anarchists or deserters) and try to survive. You're one of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warsaw is uchronian pulp, a kind of battle of Stalingrad with degenerated inventions and mechanical monsters. A city in ruins, inhabited by packs of cannibals and soldiers altered by rusty prosthetics. In this metropolis surrounded and besieged by foreign armies, what are your choices? Simply survive, fight the invader, enrich the black market or try to bring peace, that peace which now exists only in banned history books ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
