							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OverThrone: A Game of Cards</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four noble houses fight for control of a kingdom. Whichever of these powerful families sits on the central Throne is regarded as the ruler of the entire land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game you are a trusted close advisor to the Throne and are instrumental in maintaining a form of peace, through a mixture of negotiation, bribery, threats and promises (playing the cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However the time will soon come (each turn represents one year) when you&amp;rsquo;ll need to choose between honour and duty to the realm and your own personal well being. Anticipation, planning ahead and making the right moves at the right time will be key to your survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OverThrone is a solitaire game played with a standard pack of cards. The aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards by playing them, one at a time, according to the rules dictated by the ruler at the time. If you manage to place all the cards then you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
