							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Career Companion</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Career Companion expands the already rich Clement Sector setting with addition of several new elements such as uplifts and altrants.  Need an uplifted dolphin to interact with your characters?  Perhaps a human altered to handle toxic environments?  Now you have the tools to include them in your Clement Sector adventures or even allow one of your players to create an altrant or uplift character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Career Companion also includes eight career tracks covering national navies, system defense navies, pirates, journalists, spies, explorers and orbital construction. The Career Companion brings you our new Clement Sector themed character sheet as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the Career Companion delves into more detail concerning rules presented in Clement Sector concerning the wealth held by characters and the slowed aging process within the game.  We also present optional rules to allow for character advancement which let your characters continue to grow long after character creation is finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this is presented with stunning artwork by outstanding artists Bradley Warnes and Ian Stead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, while all of this is aimed at our Clement Sector setting, the information presented here could easily be added to any Traveller campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expand your universe today with the Career Companion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
