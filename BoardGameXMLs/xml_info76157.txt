			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s Token Set is the first of many accessories we are producing for DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS. Created in cooperation with Wizards of the Coast, this set contains everything a DM needs to manage combats and track the status of a dungeon&amp;rsquo;s denizens as they battle intrepid adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After unwrapping this treasure trove of tokens, the DM will find that these accessories are contained in a handsome wooden box. Inside, the box is divided into compartments to sort and store your tokens and any other items the Dungeon Master will be using; dice, pencils, miniatures or whatever! The lid of the box is lined with felt, turning it into the perfect dice tray to keep wild rolls under control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each full-color token is made from thin but durable acrylic and the back is covered with a layer of felt to protect your tabletop, map and miniatures. The 22 dragonscale-shaped tokens are designed to nest against the base of your DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS miniatures and indicate which game effects they might be under. The 18 scroll tokens act as handy reminders for status and ongoing damage effects. These tokens are designed so the DM may mark them with a wet erase marker (available from any office supply or stationary store). The set also includes 5 drop-shaped Bloodied tokens and 5 corpse markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
