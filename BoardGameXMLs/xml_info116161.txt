			<description>&amp;quot;Sinking&amp;quot; is a board game in which every player is the commander of a pirate ship that is sinking. To do so you have to give orders to your crew so that they can create opportunities to attack, defend and take water out of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is achieved through blind-bidding. Each turn the players hide their boards using the provided shields and bid on the several actions and functions (attack and drain water out of the boat) so that they can gain more resources or affect the other players's bids. Then they all reveal the boards and compare their bids. Only one player solves each action so be sure to pay extra for the ones you want. At the end of the turn the ships sink according to the amount of water the players let into the boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
