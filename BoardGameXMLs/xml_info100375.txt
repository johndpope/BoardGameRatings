			<description>In Air-musement Park the ride through the amusement park can be played alone or with others. Single players can work through each maze to improve their skills and improve their time.  With multiple players, time each player's attempt and the player with the best time wins! If the player loses air control of the ball, the player must start over. Players can physically move around&lt;br/&gt;each maze as they manipulate the ball through each challenge run; however, the player can not touch or move the maze itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
