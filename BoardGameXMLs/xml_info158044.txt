			<description>user summary&lt;br/&gt;Steve Keller designed Dynamo during National Game Design Month (NaGaDeMon) 2013.  His criteria were a rules-light, fast-playing superhero game system that would be easy to run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is built on a system using FUDGE dice and a fixed format for play.  The game takes place over four discrete, self-evident, sequential stages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Character Creation&lt;br/&gt;     First Confrontation&lt;br/&gt;     Investigation&lt;br/&gt;     Showdown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resolution mechanic uses an novel pairing mechanism which counts a set of + &amp;amp; - together  as a single success.  Dice are divided into three pools based on the attributes Attack, Defence and Pluck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beta version represented here is missing examples, game mastering and campaign creation material which were added to the subsequent release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
