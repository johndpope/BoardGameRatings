			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure for 4 to 6 players, 7th to 8th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past year, misfortune and calamity have befallen the party. Where once they had scoured dungeons, cleared threats, and rescued those in trouble, now they know only poverty, ill-placed mistrust, and disastrous ends. This is no mere twist of mercurial fate, but the doing of a malevolent being who has set its sights upon the party, each and all. At the end of their ropes, and unable to escape the curse of the Hag Auntie Blackgums, the party finds itself on the road in a torrential downpour, a physical manifestation of their mood and fortune it seems. In the distance, the lights of a forlorn castle beckon; perchance there is some shelter to be found there. Maybe there is a chance to turn their lives around at Hero Hill. But at what cost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
