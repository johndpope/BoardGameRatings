			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home is a story roleplaying game about soldiers in a fantasy world returning home from a long and costly war. Being on the losing side of the war, the characters must overcome adversity, national tension, and a lack of resources as they navigate the roads and wilderness. With only a few coins in their pockets, their long trek home begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
