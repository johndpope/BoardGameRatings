He comes into the game fully build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players using their normal action can send maximum of 1 hoplite from any region (this rules will be different for 2 players) under Atlas. They stay there until all 6 slots will be covered (building monuments have no effect on them). Once 6 slots are fully covered, all players sacrifice hoplites to Atlas and in return he steals Golden Apples from Garden of the Hesperides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will get as many Golden apple tokens as many hoplites he had under monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden apples can be &amp;quot;consumed&amp;quot; at any time of the game and will have various effects: From healing hero wounds, saving hoplite's, adding strength to battle to more powerful effects if you will choose to consume more then one apple. &lt;br/&gt;Reminder - Atlas Overload rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion will negate winning condition, that the game ends once any monuments gets fully build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will place Atlas miniature next to a Board with Atlas Overload board and place &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot; token on 0 on the track. Whenever a new temple / part of monument or monster will appear on the Board - you will be adding weight on Atlas shoulder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once weight token will reach 12, Atlas systems shut-down and his crisis procedures are starting. From now on at the end of every players turn, you will decrease the weight value by 1. Once it will reach 0 - Atlas systems shut down completely and world falls apart. All players loose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you can help Atlas carry his weight! You will put &amp;quot;Aid to Atlas&amp;quot; quest token in one of the regions. Players can delegate their heroes to help atlas - if they will, they are removing their hero out of the board for the rest of the game, but increase the weight track by the value of their strength (so &amp;quot;add turns&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion will change a little bit dynamics of the game and create a ticking &amp;quot;clock&amp;quot; that will count the time before the inevitable end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
