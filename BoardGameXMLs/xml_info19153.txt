							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saving Private Checkers</name>
									
			<description>Checkers with an explosive twist for two players. Kinda like a cross between normal checkers and the D-Day invasion....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: There are two goals: 1) To get as many of your checkers to the other side of the board and back as possible. 2) To capture as many of your opponent's pieces as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A Poker deck.&lt;br/&gt;    * The checkers from a checkers set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is very much like normal checkers, except that you're trying to get your checkers to the other side of the board and back without either being captured or blown to pieces. (The cards act as 'live squares' -- when you enter a square, you may be blown away.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/86/saving-private-checkers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/86/saving-private-checker...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
