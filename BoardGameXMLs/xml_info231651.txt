			<description>Once upon a time &lt;br/&gt;A beautiful new city is being made near the hills. At the launch meeting, we have you, the budding mathematicians, engineers, artists and visionaries to build roads to connect it. Use your math skills to master mountains, build tunnels and make long bridges over new lands. You can also improve existing roads. The longer the road, the more points you earn. So what are you waiting for! Get...set...build.&lt;br/&gt;In this exciting arithmetic strategy game, you will use number tiles to make math equations. Starting from a basic arithmetic equation like 2+3=5, you can make very complex, long equations. Kids develop a completely new way to look at numbers. Perfect game to combine skill and imagination. Hours of non-stop fun is guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math skills &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Addition &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Subtraction &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Multiplication &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Division &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; BODMAS &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Equation Balancing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other skills &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Strategic thinking &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Spatial recall &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Group dynamics &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Cognitive and Developmental skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Practice jump &lt;br/&gt;7 times over class time and worksheets &lt;br/&gt;At Logic Roots, we are passionate about Math and work with the vision of Reinventing how kids practice Math through gamification of its concepts.
