			<description>Fog of War Fantasy Wargame is a tabletop miniatures wargame set in a fantasy world. Two players command opposing armies of miniatures and clash in a variety of scenarios. In a basic game, victory is achieved by routing the enemy army or destroying it entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It differs from the normal tabletop wargaming format by using an action point system, where a number of points are assigned to the player at the beginning of the turn by a dice roll. These actions are then used to activate army units, which can then choose from a number of actions to perform. Basic actions include moving, shooting and charging, but most units have their own unique actions, such as 'Shieldwall', which affect how they are used in the game, and command units have access to actions that affect other units, such as 'Rally'. This system adds an element of tactical depth whilst reducing the length of the game turn, making for quicker games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single book, called 'The Tome', is the only reference point for the game, and contains all the lore, rules, army lists and other information required to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
