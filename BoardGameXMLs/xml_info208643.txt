			<description>The players are animal rights activists, who have the goal to save as many endangered animals from extinction. Only when they work together on strategies and skillfully utilize the available resources, they succeed to retake the habitat of the animals. Animal welfare is teamwork!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards represent the threatend species from three different habitats (green: land, blue: water, orange: air). &lt;br/&gt;There are 5-6 (depending on the number of players) animals laying face down in the middle of the table, so every player can see the habitat, but not the needs of the animal (like &amp;quot;2 air and 1 money&amp;quot;). &lt;br/&gt;Now the players have to choose a &amp;quot;strategic card&amp;quot;, which gives one player a special move (like switching a card on the table, or looking at a card).&lt;br/&gt;After that, the players have to play ressources from their hand face down on an animal of their choice. When each player has played their card (now communication allowed at that point), the animals and ressources are revealed and all animals, where the ressources match the needs are saved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
