			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, agents&amp;hellip; We have suffered a breach in security. Twenty-four hours ago, unknown parties broke into one of the Guardians&amp;rsquo; facilities in Jerusalem. Two agents were killed. More importantly &amp;mdash; and I do not lightly dismiss the loss of personnel &amp;mdash; an important artifact was stolen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The precise identity of the item is need to know, and you don&amp;rsquo;t. For that matter, I don&amp;rsquo;t. All I know is that the package is old &amp;ndash; extremely old. It&amp;rsquo;s a piece of cloth, dating back at least 2,000 years. The Guardians claim it has great power, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t saying what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Guardians recovering from the shock of the attack, it falls to us to recover the package. Should you fail, all mankind may suffer for our carelessness. We have monitored outgoing traffic from Jerusalem over the past twenty-four hours, and we&amp;rsquo;re convinced the package has not yet left the city. You are to travel to Jerusalem and recover the relic, by whatever means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, agents, and God speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
