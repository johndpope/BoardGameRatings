							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Once Upon A Time: A Guide to Fairy Tales (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, in a land far, far away&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fairy Tales is your guide to playing in the surreal and often macabre world of fairy tales. Many of us are familiar with the cartoony, G-rated versions of classic fairy tales, perhaps thinking that these stories are meant for the entertainment of children. However, a few know the terrible and bloody genre of the original folk tales that these &amp;ldquo;family friendly&amp;rdquo; stories are based on. Prepare to journey to a strange and but bizarrely familiar land of danger and treachery. The fairy tale campaign is a place where the world of ordinary life collides head first with the world of evil villains and frightening supernatural powers, a world that too often shows us the dark side of human nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game master will find everything that he or she needs to transport the characters to a world where the fantastic and the ordinary collide. There is a big difference between a folk story and an epic fantasy. While there are many books out there that can help you build an epic fantasy, this book is focused on the wondrous and often frightening world of fairy tales and folk stories. Whether your fairy tale is set in a nameless Renaissance village or the mean streets of a modern city, everything you need to bring your adventure to life is right here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be able to get the most out of their fairy tale characters with new advanced classes. The book also includes new skills and feats, as well as an in depth discussion of which skills and feats are most useful in a fairy tale game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fairy Tales provides gamers with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     GM advice for capturing the feel of the fairy tale genre, including common themes, the elements of a fairy tale, and the fairy tale setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Talking animals and fairy tale monsters&lt;br/&gt;     Random Encounter Chart with four custom NPCs&lt;br/&gt;     Six new Advanced Classes&lt;br/&gt;     New Skills and Feats&lt;br/&gt;     New Drawbacks&lt;br/&gt;     Fifty random storylines for the fairy tale genre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
