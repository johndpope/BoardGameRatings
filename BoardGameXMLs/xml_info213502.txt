			<description>A Starter Adventure to Teach New Players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Knights of the North are in need of your aid! Word has reached your party that a band of Orcs has attacked their outpost and is holding them in a siege, slowly decimating their numbers. Rumor spoke of the Knights protecting an ancient relic that the Orcs may want to use in their continued assaults. The village you are in now does not have the resources to aid them, but you can. Travel due north at all speed, overcome whatever obstacles in your path and turn the tide in this battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 6-hour adventure for 1st - 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
