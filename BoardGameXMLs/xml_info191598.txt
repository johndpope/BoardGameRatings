			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;On a cold winter's night, four adventurers huddle around their campfire and ready themselves for a mighty adventure... tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you'll never role-play the venture into the Icy Mountain Halls of the Frost Giants to challenge Braggadir, Slayer of Jarmulkost, Reaver of the Frozen Seas, Beloved of Hela; that's because this poem is concerned only with role-playing that winter's night huddled around a flickering campfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What hopes burn hot in the hearts of these brave heroes? What cold fears gnaw at their bellies? What tasks occupy frozen fingers and numbed minds on that blasted glacier? What destinies await these adventurers on their return? What cruel wounds received on the bloody ascent need tending?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this role-playing poem we stay the usual headlong rush into adventure in order to savour the richness of the role-play, for that is what is best in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
