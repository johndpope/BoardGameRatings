							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhino The Game</name>
									
			<description>Rhino The Game&amp;reg; is a trick-taking card and token game for 2 to 6 players. A Rhino deck consists of 55 premium playing cards: a special set of 52 playing cards numbered 0-12 in four color suits, along with two &amp;quot;Big Five&amp;quot; Bonus cards, and one Super Safari card. Each player begins the game with their own set of five special character tokens representing the &amp;quot;Big Five&amp;quot; African mammals - rhinoceros, elephant, lion, leopard, and Cape buffalo. Each token has unique properties to influence game scoring and may only be used once during the course of the game.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to bid correctly on the exact number of tricks that a player will take (win) in each subsequent round of play. Points are awarded for a correct bid and are either zero or negative for an incorrect bid. The player with most points after all rounds have been played is declared the winner. The game is played in 13 rounds with the number of cards dealt per round varying from seven to one and back to seven. Player strategy combining with statistical probability (chance) interacts the effects of dealt cards, Bonus Cards, and the character tokens. Multiple skill levels of play and a partner option with 4 or 6 players is available. Designed for ages 14 and up. However, younger precocious children may also pick up this game rapidly especially when guided by an experienced player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
