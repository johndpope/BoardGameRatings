			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifty years ago, a magician known as Melchior the Despoiler, rumored to be consorting with dark forces near the town of Southfork was investigated by a troop of militia and a priest... all of who returned from his tower as undead attempting to slay their own families. They were defeated, and after a petition for aid, the Duke lent the village his trebuchet and his men leveled the mage's tower. Shortly before this assault was mounted, Melchior&amp;rsquo;s apprentice Xander escaped with a few books, a wand and a magical blade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that Xander has died. His apprentice, Aurelia, together with her henchmen, have returned to find the master's library. Unknown to them, goblins have been living in the ruins for 30 years...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the Fallen Tower is an Introductory Adventure for Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Continual Light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
