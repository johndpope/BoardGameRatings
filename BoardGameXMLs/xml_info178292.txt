			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution. Change. Progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes looking back helps move us forward. Tim Wallace has taken some of the best open game content from previous editions of this game and brought them forward into the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book Tim updates some of his favorite Monte Cook creations, specifically races and classes from the wildly popular Arcana Evolved as well as some feats that were never updated for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as with most other d20pfsrd.com Publishing products, at the end of this book you&amp;rsquo;ll find some &amp;ldquo;bonus&amp;rdquo; content- rules and mechanics from products created by other publishers that is complimentary to the content of this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S INSIDE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Races: This chapter introduces dracha, faen, giants, litorians, mojh, sibeccai, and verrik as new playable races. In addition, many of the new races include new racial equipment or special racial feats or spells..&lt;br/&gt;    Classes: This chapter presents the Akashic and Runeblade classes, as well as rules for Runic weapons.&lt;br/&gt;    Feats: This chapter includes twenty-one feats that were created for a previous edition of the game but which have not as yet been updated to the rules of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;    Bonus Content: The bonus content for this product includes stuff for faen and giants. The content was originally created by Total Party Kill Games and Rogue Genius Games, specifically in the Feybinder and the Gruesome Guide to Giants products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
