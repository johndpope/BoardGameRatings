			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take Your Game To The Next Level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing &amp;ldquo;Alternate Paths: Social Characters&amp;rdquo;. This book is designed with the very experienced player in mind as it presents alternate rules and classes that are more suited to their needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Civilized vs Primal is back.&lt;br/&gt;    Urban deities are thing now.&lt;br/&gt;    The social caste system is off the hook.&lt;br/&gt;    We made using social stuff like verbal duels in combat SUPER easy, impactful on combat, and rules light with our social combat section. &lt;br/&gt;    The noble base class is a social option monster. Takes social combat to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;    The legionary base class is all about a citizen soldier who gains political advantage from his service. Combat, skills, social stuff- it&amp;rsquo;s got it all (in measure).&lt;br/&gt;    Showman is a magical trickster / conman and is just absurdly fun to play with when used right.&lt;br/&gt;    7 new spells and a new magic item.&lt;br/&gt;    20+ new feat (lots of them social).&lt;br/&gt;    Ever want to know how much it was to arrange a marriage or have someone killed (...or both at the same time?)- we got you covered with our services section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Base Classes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Noble: D8, medium BAB, and 8 + Int skill points. It kind of plays like a social-heavy rogue if you squinted really hard and just looked at the math. It&amp;rsquo;s got talk down, which is basically super-social combat. They can forgo damage to control enemies a bit and even give some allies temporary HP. They are tied to an organization and it influences how they can use some resources. I&amp;rsquo;m skipping over a lot (because I know I&amp;rsquo;m rambling) but they get &amp;ldquo;social graces&amp;rdquo; every other level, which is basically akin to a fighter getting their combat feats every other level except these are utility/social ones. These characters make devastating utility/option-based social characters (like a... social wizard kind of) or can be a straight battle-noble. Lots of fun (we&amp;rsquo;ve play-tested the hell out of it), very versatile, and a great addition to any table.&lt;br/&gt;    Legionary: One of my designers described it thusly: &amp;ldquo;if the noble is the social wizard, the legionary is the social magus&amp;rdquo;. It draws from the idea of the citizen soldier- the politically motivated warrior who advances as he goes. The terminology is taken from Roman soldiers from the 2nd punic war but it fits with anything if you file the serial numbers off it. They are a straight up martial character: d10, full bab, good will. They kind of play like a flexible fighter (they retrain a small number of &amp;ldquo;tactics&amp;rdquo; each day&amp;rdquo;) with a lot of equipment based abilities (&amp;ldquo;If you are mounted I get a bonus&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;If you and I have the same weapon, I get a bonus&amp;rdquo;, etc). They also get a small compliment of social abilities (some skill bonuses, something like social graces from the noble, etc).&lt;br/&gt;    Showman: The &amp;ldquo;magical social character&amp;rdquo;. They are more magical conman / mystic trickster than mundane noble or rogue. As a caster they have a lot of mind affecting and illusion stuff. They are kind of circus / theatrical themed and have a cool weapon that you have to &amp;ldquo;roll to disbelieve&amp;rdquo;. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into it a lot but their class features, if used right, are just absurdly fun to trick people with (the person who figures out why &amp;ldquo;Liar Liar&amp;rdquo; is such a clever talent gets a cookie). It&amp;rsquo;s also got a &amp;ldquo;ringleader&amp;rdquo; archetype which is almost a hybrid class with our multiman from gonzo 2 (it gets the clone class feature).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
