							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Places to Go, People to Be (Issue 7 - Apr 1999)</name>
									
			<description>In this issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, we're very happy to publish an article by our celebrity guest writer, Andrew Rilstone. He takes a hard look at the limits gaming can feasibly expect to reach. Meanwhile, we have a humorous rant on the state of the industry, and then settle down for two history lessons: the end of the Dallas' story and the penultimate History. You'll notice a few other changes around the zine, as lack of resources is requiring us to prune back a little. We need articles from you, and more importantly, shows of support through the forum and the survey, which we're extending to look for more responses. The prize still stands, so please, take a moment to tell us what you think. And then enjoy the issue!
