			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lace up your skates and prepare to face off for the NHL Edition of SCRABBLE. Assist yourself and score high with an exclusive NHL dictionary as you power play your way through the most action-packed SCRABBLE game ever!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Scrabble, players draw letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word earns points based on points of the tiles, and any bonuses. A word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Scrabble NHL Edition, the board looks like a hockey rink with many NHL symbols on it and a grid pattern. The double letter spaces have the NHL logo, the triple letter spaces have the Western logo, the double word spaces have the Eastern logo on it and the triple word spaces have another NHL logo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also Bonus Words that are allowed that are hockey related (NHL, Wild, Pads, Net, Save, etc.) that are worth an additional 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also terminology and team names that are allowed as bonus words for 10 points (Kings, Senators, Hockey, Coyotes, Faceoff).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally there is a section of special rules : Pre-Season, Trades, Trade Deadlines, Delay In Game, Too Many Men On The Ice, Pulling the Goalie and Offsides, designed to make the game feel more like hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
