			<description>Choose your EVOKER and evoke powerful ENTI to defeat your rival. ENTI (plural for ENTIS) are powerful beings from another realm, the Dream Realm, who aid you in battle. You can also call upon hordes of monsters in the meantime to protect and strike for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Play Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Each player must have a deck of at least 30 cards. At least 1 of those cards MUST be an EVOKER card. The minimum is 30 but you may have more, as many as you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-There are no doubles allowed of EVOKER or ENTIS cards (you may have 2 cards of the&lt;br/&gt;same name as long as the illustration is different) but you may have up to 3 copies of all MONSTER/BOSS and SKILL cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Each player starts with 90HP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select an EVOKER to start then shuffle your deck and draw 5 cards (this applies to both starting players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll a dice to see who plays their EVOKER first. If its you draw a card and play an ENTIS or MONSTER/BOSS card(s). You may not attack on your 1st turn (this applies to both starting players).&lt;br/&gt;When both players have set-up defenses, ENTIS or MONSTER/BOSS card(s) then another dice roll is done and whoever has the highest dice roll may attack and have their 2nd turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, turns just alternate accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How a Battle Turn Goes...&lt;br/&gt;1.Draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;2.Play an EVOKER, ENTIS and/or MONSTER/BOSS card(s).&lt;br/&gt;3.Play any Add-Ons or SKILL cards.&lt;br/&gt;4.Attack (Enter Battle Mode)&lt;br/&gt;5.Play ONLY any other SKILL cards you wish.&lt;br/&gt;6.Turn end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Encounter (the entire course of your game) proceeds until one of you loses all their HP or a player can no longer draw cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;02/02/11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        NEW**&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme Decks out!&lt;br/&gt;Starlit Night Deck: Use a deck brimming with the chaotic energy of the stars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harness the unpredictable power of the stars (Star-Type Cards) in this all new strategically structured theme deck. Use &amp;quot;Affuse&amp;quot; to evoke and then re-evoke fallen Enti all the while playing lady-luck by using Star Monsters and their random, high-risk effect Abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like to tempt fate (while using &amp;quot;Marlain&amp;quot; to redo your die rolls) then this deck is for you. Watch as your opponent's well laid plans crumble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkside Moon Deck: Decimate foes with raw power and the inverse strategy of dark matter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness and destruction await all those who face the power of the moon (Moon-Type Cards). This deck while lacking in Enti power relies on hordes of Monster/Boss Cards particularly &amp;quot;Cronie&amp;quot; a dark bird who returns automatically once defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master dark matter and increase your attack power, all the while using inverse tactics to raise your HP and reduce your opponents. Without having to lift a single finger...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
