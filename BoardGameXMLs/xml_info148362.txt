							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pandemic: On the Brink Replacement Deck</name>
									
			<description>The Pandemic On the Brink Replacement Deck contains all of the cards from the new edition (2013) of Pandemic On the Brink: 8 Event cards, 8 Virulent Strain Epidemic cards, 7 Role cards, 4 blank cards, 3 Mutation Event cards, 2 Mutation Cards, 1 Epidemic Card, 1 Reference card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork and card backs of the 2013 version of Pandemic and On the Brink are different than in the original, making the old version incompatible with new expansions like In the Lab. Z-Man Games issued replacement decks for both Pandemic and On the Brink so owners of the early versions could update their games and make them compatible with In the Lab and any future expansions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
