			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After years of The Chimera&amp;rsquo;s experiments, some have begun to migrate to wreak more havoc than usual. People in affected areas have abandoned their homes and livelihoods. In many cases, the creations stripped the land around them of edible plants and game, then moved in to attack the residents. The PCs must defend Moon Valley from their encroachment, discovering the reasons for these new attacks if they can.&lt;br/&gt;Moon Valley is a 1-Sheet style scenario that focuses on the adventures of a band of Witchmarked heroes in the Accursed game setting. The adventure may be played as a standalone, or it may be used with the Plot Point Campaign included in Accursed. The adventure features brief scene descriptionss, with necessary game mechanics and opportunity for tasks that can be resolved in a variety of ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accursed provides additional details about the setting used in this scenario, and is required to fully make use of the game mechanics presented. Savage Worlds and the Savage Worlds Horror Companion are also required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF uses layers for ease of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
