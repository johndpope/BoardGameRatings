							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Broken Promises</name>
									
			<description>After a year of chaos and fighting, the new Governor-General has finally forced the city into an uneasy peace. His Predecessor might have stopped there, content with there, content with the illusion of control, but Franco Marlow has bigger plans. Under his leadership, the Guild has tightened its iron grip on Malifaux City, and the Masters of the Guild have but one choice, obey his commands or suffer the consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divided by their own internal conflicts, the other factions of Malifaux have been unable to stop him. Distrust spreads like wildfire through the Arcanists, Nephilim slaughter Nephilim beneath the dark boughs of the forest, and the agents of the Ten Thunders murder each other in the streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everywhere, promises are broken and loyalties are tested, only one thing is certain: nothing will ever be the same again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring exciting new models, two new upgrades for every master in the game, and great stories, Broken Promises adds more options to the Malifaux universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for new models for your Crews, a new way to play your favourite Master, or to delve deeper into the Malifaux worl, this book has something for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
