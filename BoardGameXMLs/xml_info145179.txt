			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Telumar is an Earthmaster site located in the gap between the Sorkin and Anadel mountains on the northern edge of the Kingdom of Melderyn in southeast H&amp;acirc;rn. The site is the location of one of the most curious phenomena known to those who study the arcane lore of H&amp;acirc;rn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site contains five buildings from the Earthmaster era, many of which were damaged and partially covered by a landslide 13 years ago. A ruined Khuzan stone wall dating from the Atani Wars is nearby. The range of the Chindra Gargu-hyeka (a species of orc) surrounds Telumar as does that of the Bujoc tribal nation. The site is occasionally visited by the Ruthuba and Moym gargun and Pagaelin tribesmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Telumar article includes a history of the site, floor plans and details of its buildings, and a description of Lepridis, the mage studying the mysterious lights that the site is known for. Also includes full-page color maps for GMs and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classic and was originally published in 1984 as part of Encyclopedia Hârnica 11. New illustrations have been added and maps and plans redrawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
