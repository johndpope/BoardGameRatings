			<description>Battailles de l'Ancien Regime 1740-1763 (BAR) is, despite its French title, a set of miniatures rules in English designed to simulate European land warfare in the mid-18th century.  The players supply the figures at any desired scale.  The hallmark of these rules is the highly detailed and historically meticulous system for portraying the various types of military organization during this period.  Units consist of variable numbers of figures and constitute infantry battalions, cavalry regiment and artillery batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its deliberately &amp;quot;Old School&amp;quot; design (i.e., large-sized units, figure removal, historically accurate rules on movement and changes of facing), the rules use modern mechanics and so do not require the writing of orders.  Existing miniature armies need not be re-based to use this rules set.  The rules book is self-published but has been produced to a high standard of quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*  72 pages including the color cover&lt;br/&gt;    * Quick Ref. Charts for large/small games, miniatures and/or tables.&lt;br/&gt;    * If you know the 18th Century, you can play right away with just the Quick Reference Charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
