			<description>From the back of the book (4th edition):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... And they didn't even kiss you first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you weren't born stupid. The only reason that SSDC picked up your contract in the first place was a hunch that you might survive to pick up your first paycheck. And if that doesn't happen, and you wind up very dead ... the company is still assured of picking up it's paycheck. But it's not going to happen to you. You have been preparing for this moment for your whole life. You have signed on to make a difference. You know you have what it takes. And if not, then you probably won't know what hit you ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the survivors of your team are battling just to stay alive as you pursue an elusive enemy across the galaxies. Where you'll finally end up you can't possibly imagine, and what you'll find when you reach there ... you can't begin to believe. However, the fate of millions depends on what you do next!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Injection takes you into the world of the Battlelords of the 23rd Century, a place of untold dangers and mysteries.
