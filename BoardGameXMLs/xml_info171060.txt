							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NOLA Is Burning</name>
									
			<description>Your boss, The Bull, the most dangerous gangster in New Orleans, has a job for you. Rescue your kidnapped lover--officially The Bull&amp;rsquo;s lover, but unofficially yours--before dawn. Slaughter everyone who stands in your way, including other gangsters, cops, and the Triad, as you slink across the underbelly of New Orleans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOLA Is Burning is a blood-soaked interactive noir thriller where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you outwit your enemies or take it to the mattresses with your trusty sawtooth? Will you earn respect as NOLA&amp;rsquo;s most infamous headcrusher, or will you retire to Mexico on a huge pile of cash? To be honest, you'll probably die. But in NOLA, death is just the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
