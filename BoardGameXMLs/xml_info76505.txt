			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something lurks deep in the heart of the Lark and Wren theatre. Tobian deQuillus, one of The Gates's most prominent playwrights may be in danger. A recent series of accidents has come dangerously close to claiming his life. Some of his closest friends have grown suspicious. Tobian, himself, refuses to believe anyone would actually want him dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Tobian doesn't know is that older and darker forces than he ever imagined dwell in the City-States. Their thirst for power is insatiable and their vengeance is swift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are plunged into all the pageantry, chaos and danger of life in the theatre. They must unravel a complex and winding mystery if they are to save Tobian's life. They will soon learn that no one is safe in the City-States. No matter what happens, the show must go on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Play's the Thing is a Nobis adventure for 1st level characters. The adventure is compatible with version 3.5 of the world's most popular role-playing game and other OGL products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
