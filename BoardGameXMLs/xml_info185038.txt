			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fable - A Free, Universal Role-playing System is distributed as a single MS Word .DOC file.  It is usable by neophyte players and includes an excellent and concise introduction to roleplaying methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Traits which are narrative tags describing their abilities--Characters typically will have two to ten Traits, usually about Five.  Each Trait has an associated Level which determines the type of die the player will use when that Trait is utilized, from d4 to d20, but typically in the d6 to d10 range.  Characters also have Karma Points that may be spent during play to alter outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unopposed actions have a Difficulty assigned by the GM and characters must roll over the Difficulty to succeed.  Opposed Actions (including combat) use a Trait vs. Trait approach but otherwise work the same way.  Wounds occur in nine stages, from &amp;quot;Just a Scratch&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Mortal Blow&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
