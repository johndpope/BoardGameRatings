			<description>1/15/2007: The Living Earth Games website appears live, and Living Landscapes is available directly from the publisher as well as from a specific retailer in the UK: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.eco-logicbooks.com/index.cfm?fa=book_details&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.eco-logicbooks.com/index.cfm?fa=book_details&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;book_id=995&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living Earth Games is a now defunct game company that made ecologically aware games printed in 100% recycled materials. The company appears to have been on the web until 2004.  The following information was on their website concerning Living Landscapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living landscapes introduces in a playful way into the sometimes abstract relationships between the human needs and what you find in a rural landscape. Color frames around some card images distinguish the red human needs cards (food, shelter, climate regulation&amp;hellip;) and the green cards that distinguish important landscape elements from the rest of the set. Laying down families of 3 or more cards (we give lists of examples), the players build up the design of a landscape and they can exchange cards between families.The game ends with a set of card families laid down as a draft landscape design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
