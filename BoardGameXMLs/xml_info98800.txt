			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kidnapped Canine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Louie, the junkyard guy, was just settling down to his regular Sunday afternoon lunch: a foot long head-cheese sandwich with tons of mustard, six garlic pickles, a two-pound bag of potato chips and a diet soft drink. (The diet soft drink was because Louie was watching his weight--nobody likes a fat junkyard guy.) The phone rang and Louie picked it up, even though his mouth was full. He listened a few moments, and then sprayed crumbs of bread and head cheese all over the office. A dastardly dognapper gang kidnapped his best pal Scraps, the infamous Scrapyard Dog! If Louie doesn't hand over the deed to the junkyard, Scraps is dog-gone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Louie played along, and told the kidnappers he would bring the deed to the first checkpoint to receive further instructions. But it's unAmerican to knuckle under to kidnappers and terrorists, and Louie won't do it! He's going to go to the checkpoint and find out the location of the gang's headquarters, then he's going to rescue Scraps and rid the town of the puppy purloiners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a few useful items for weapons (mostly old cans), Louie sets out to save his buddy Scraps. Can Louie save his cruelly captured canine, or will little Scraps end up dog meat? Find out, and help Louie save his Scrapyard Dog!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrapyard Dog is seventeen levels of constant jumping, running, and throwing action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to defeat the gang of criminal kidnappers and rescue Scraps. The kidnappers leave instructions for Louie at each of sixteen checkpoints. Louie has a specific period of time to reach each checkpoint. Along the way he must dodge rats and other annoying obstacles like rolling tires. Louie must also collect as many weapons and other useful items as possible. Weapons prepare Louie for the more difficult higher levels of Scrapyard Dog, and will ensure his success when he comes face to face with the leader of the evil dognappers. Items such as shields will protect Louie from harm. Louie begins his quest with a single shield and five cans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six rounds in Scrapyard Dog. Each of the first five rounds contain three levels, Junkyard, City, and Sewer. There is no sewer in the final round, but the city and junkyard are more hazardous than ever. Louie must scrap his way through each round to answer the phone at the end of the round. That's where Louie receives his instructions on how to progress to the next level. The last round of the game takes place in Mr. Big's warehouse. There Louie receives a special challenge that he must overcome before he can rescue his pitiful pooch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
