			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every good GM wants to customize their maps. Icon Packs provide dozens of unique features and objects ready to drop into your geomorph dungeon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeons in Blue series brings classic blue maps to the virtual tabletop! These ready-to-fill maps are packed with rooms, corridors, pits, and caves; all judiciously sprinkled with tricks and traps. Every geomorph tile seamlessly connects to every other tile in the series, providing the megadungeon builder tremendous freedom and flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains over 75 map icons designed for use with Dungeons in Blue geomorph tiles and your favorite virtual tabletop software. Icons are drawn using the same style and scale (100px per five foot square) as the original maps, allowing you to quickly and easily customize your map. The icons in this pack include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Trees, altars, statues, and pillars&lt;br/&gt;     Boulders, individual and arranged in piles and markers&lt;br/&gt;     Slime patches and stalagmites&lt;br/&gt;     Grates, curtains, and cages&lt;br/&gt;     Pits, wells, stairs, and pools&lt;br/&gt;     Normal, trap, and false doors&lt;br/&gt;     Wall and floor tiles to cover unwanted features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product also includes a copy of the latest map key. Note that some icon sequences may appear incomplete. Icon types are numbered sequentially across all Dungeons in Blue icon packs. Missing icons are in another icon pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
