			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplaying at the Office&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tangibles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pencils and paper and a standard deck of playing cards without Jokers. I recommend a deck of cards with a corporate logo. If you really want, you could make a poker deck with business cards and some markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting Prep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Employee possesses three Assets which have point values. You get three points to divide among them (zero being a valid Asset).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these Assets has a countering trait, called a Liability. Each Liability's value is always (4 - countering Asset).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, you grab five cards. You can never have more than five cards in your hand at one time. If you are told to draw more cards, you discard cards of your choice down to five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no GM. This is simply a game of Employees trying to stay sane and under the radar of upper management. In fact, an Employee can't even lose her job unless she quits or does something absolutely drastic and strange. She'll most likely keep getting demoted until she's stuck in the basement with leveraged hardware from the 80's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the best hand gets to introduce the first Issue to the Employees. Try something simple at first, like a broken printer. The winner's Hand is placed face up in the center of the table. Everyone else discards their Hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the person on the winner's left, and proceeding clockwise, each Player concocts some method to solve the Issue. Friendly and cordial groups may ignore turns and simply freeform roleplay until a good solution is found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have a solution, decide which Asset or Liability best fits your approach. What you do next depends on whether you are using an Asset or Liability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
