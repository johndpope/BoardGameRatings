			<description>To all budding chefs &amp;ndash; utensils ready, set, cook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either on your own or in teams, complete the challenges in L'atelier des Chefs set by the chef and become his right-hand man. Separate eggs, sabre champagne, flip as many pancakes as possible &amp;ndash; in your hands the cards will become kitchen utensils and fine dishes. You will have to throw them, catch them, look at them, sort them, put them on top of each other...all under pressure from the egg timer! You will have to combine dexterity and ingenuity in order to beat your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep the game going over a hot stove with ten interactive recipe cards, concocted by the Chef's kitchen experts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
