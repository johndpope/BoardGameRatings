			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an audacious bid for power, the Cult of the Dragon, along with its dragon allies and the Red Wizards of Thay, seek to bring Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells to Faer&amp;ucirc;n. To this end, they are sweeping from town to town, laying waste to all those who oppose them and gathering a hoard of riches for their dread queen. The threat of annihilation has become so dire that groups as disparate as the Harpers and Zhentarim are banding together in the fight against the cult. Never before has the need for heroes been so desperate...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily the job of a DM has never been easier with the Tyranny of the Dragons [sic] DM Screen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This screen has been specifically built with the Hoard of the Dragon Queen module in mind. One side boasts evocative artwork from the adventure, while the other displays helpful charts, maps and character illustrations for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
