							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soap Opera Challenge:  General Hospital</name>
									
			<description>[From back of card deck:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Challenge yourself and your friends to remember great moments from General Hospital including the stormy marriage of Alan and Monica and the adventures of Anna, Duke and Scorpio.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a trivia game consisting of 54 cards and a &amp;quot;drama die&amp;quot;.  There are 6 categories of trivia questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Love Affairs and Friendships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  The Family Tree&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Characters and Circumstance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Disappearing Acts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  It's a Crime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.  Challenge Plus (extra-difficult questions)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each face of the die has a logo corresponding to one of the 6 categories.  A player rolls a die and has the top card of the deck read to them, based on the category rolled.  If the question is answered correctly, the person keeps the card and rolls again.  If incorrect, the card goes on the bottom of the deck, and it's the next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when the draw deck is empty.  The person with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that due to the recycling of the cards, this can be a very lengthy game if the players are not experts on General Hospital of the mid 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for solo play (go through the deck once, rolling the die for each one -- if you get 27 or more correct, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
