							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sea Demon&#039;s Pearl</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the young fisherman's boy Asquel surprised the elders and returned alive after missing for weeks, he returned with a black pearl the size of which the coastal town had never seen.  Asquel became somewhat of an instant celebrity, and his family was lifted from the poverty from which it once languished.  Little did the boy know that the pearl was not all that he brought home.  The Sea Demon had followed its property and soon the whole town would suffer for Asquel's hubris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you help stop the curse brought about by the Sea Demon's Pearl?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is an adventure for four characters of level 5-7, but can easily be adjusted for other levels and numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
