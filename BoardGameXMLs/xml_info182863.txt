							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skyshine&#039;s BEDLAM</name>
									
			<description>BEDLAM&amp;trade; is a thrilling post-apocalyptic single-player roguelike strategy game, created for the PC utilizing &amp;lsquo;The Banner Saga&amp;rsquo; engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is cast as the mysterious Mechanic, the last known member of a once-thriving guild of intrepid travelers and brilliant inventors. As the Mechanic, you are in charge of commanding your crew in battles, managing your resources, improving your Dozer, interacting with various characters, and protecting your passengers while navigating through the post-apocalyptic land of Bedlam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember &amp;ndash; One chance and one crew to make it through!&lt;br/&gt;Think you have what it takes? Then grab the controls, equip your Dozer, load your passengers, assemble your diverse battle-ready crew and prepare for your journey to a new destination on the far edge of Bedlam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to travel from the futuristic metropolis of Bysantine through the chaotic realm of Bedlam to reach the rumored utopia of Aztec City with as many of your passengers and crew intact as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But here is the challenge: with no game saves, you get one chance and one crew to make it! The game is designed for single-session playthroughs, with randomly generated encounters and discoveries to ensure a new experience each time you play!&lt;br/&gt;The path through Bedlam is filled with peril and uncertainty, with numerous obstacles you must prevail to complete the journey. Your reputation and reward depend on the majority of your passengers surviving, so make every action and decision count!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat in BEDLAM is turn-based and incorporates our exciting blitz battle system, which has three main features: no turn-order for combatants, powerful Dozer upgrades (various abilities your crew can use on the battlefield), and a primary Dozer weapon that can turn the tide of a battle in an instant!&lt;br/&gt;During battle there is no turn-order among your crew members, allowing you to select anyone on the battle board to move and/or attack each round. Combat plays like carnage-filled chess, with different classes (melee, shotgun, pistol and rifle) that each have a specific movement distance and optimal damage range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
