			<description>Smarty Party - Gamers' Expansion adds dozens of new categories focusing on boardgames and card games...and not those silly mass market games, but the games you love that your fellow Board Game Geeks play! Smarty Party! has long been a favorite party game for gamers, and this expansion seals the deal. A must have for BGG readers and serious (and not so serious) gamers of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is available for free to download and print. Express permission to create this expansion was received from R&amp;amp;R Games. Two printed copies exist: &amp;quot;Special Gathering Edition 1 of 2&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Special Gathering Edition 2 of 2,&amp;quot; one of which (1) was made available at the 2008 Gathering prize table, while the other one (2) was made available for play during the 2008 Gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
