			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &amp;quot;Usquam Praeterquam Hic&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earth is a marvelous place to be full of wondrous sights, exotic locales, and fascinating people, and technology has never made it easier to see it all. With a single plane ticket, you can be half way around the world, scuba-diving through the sunken island of Okinawa within hours of leaving home. Stay at the hotel at the bottom of the Marianas Trench and watch the dark dwelling creatures of the deep swim by. Experience Aurora Borealis so close you can reach out and touch it in one of the many skybound resorts. Safari in the deepest parts of the Amazon and hunt cloned dinosaurs! If construction stays on schedule, you'll even be able to watch the earth rise from the viewing deck of the Lunar Riatta vacation colony located conveniently close to the Sea of Tranquility. All of these adventures and more await you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...if you can afford it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and you can't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
