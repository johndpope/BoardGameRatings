			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Readers can imagine themselves as the main character of this interactive story, a girl who has worked hard to become a good diver. She's one of the best on the team, until her spot is threatened by the success of a friend. Does she switch sports and try something else? Does she swallow her pride and support her friend? And if she sticks with the diving team, can she ever be satisfied with second place? With more than 20 different endings, girls will enjoy this addition to the Innerstar University series again and again to see how their decisions change the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
