			<description>This early game from John Jacques featured a very unique method of determining the winner of the race. The game itself was a large wooden box. It had up to 8 horses attached to the box with wires. A hand crank on the side of the box attached to the horses by a variety of gears was turned resulting in a different horse winning the race. Players bet on which horse would indeed win the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
