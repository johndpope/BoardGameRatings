							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Insanity Dice</name>
									
			<description>Cthulhu Insanity Dice comes with two different dice. One has green tentacles and is used for immediate effects when a character is traumatized and suffers a temporary insanity (the Temporary Insanity die). The other has red tentacles and is used for longer term phobias (the Phobias die).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 6th and 7th editions of Call of Cthulhu, an investigator suffers a temporary insanity when they have suffered 5 or more sanity points at one time and passes their idea test. Afterwards, a mild phobia is applied to the investigator. For other game systems, apply an insanity or phobia when the rules apply some mental trauma or when a character loses control of their actions, such as failing a fear test. The duration of the insanity should be proportional to the horror the character is facing; the more terrifying, the longer it should last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(taken directly from dice literature)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
