			<description>Cover blurb:&lt;br/&gt;This module has been created with the specific intent of introducing a new player to the ADVANCED  DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS rule system.  It is designed specifically for a single character and Dungeon Master,  however, if the Dungeon Master so wishes it may be expanded upon to provide a challenge for an entire party.   The module is intended to stand on it's own, or may be incorporated into an existing campaign.  It was  originally created to help an associate of the author's to learn how to play ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND  DRAGON&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes for the Dungeon Master:&lt;br/&gt; This module has been  designed to assist new players (and hopefully new Dungeon  Masters as well) become acquainted with 1st Edition  ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS(tm) rules for combat  and role-play.  The module is designed for ease-of-play, and  while the encounters herein are best suited for a single player,  an enterprising Dungeon Master can expand upon the  adventure to include more classes and (obviously) more  players as well.  For the solo Dungeon Master and player- character, the adventure itself is fairly &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot;, in that the  encounters should prove neither too difficult nor too easy for a  clever player to cope with.  That said, it must be emphasized  that if this module is to be used as a tool for teaching a new  player, it is imperative that the Dungeon Master let the cards  fall where they may - death can come swiftly for the unwary in  a world inhabited by orcs, goblins, evil wizards and worse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
