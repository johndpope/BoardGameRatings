			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ascension to the Throne is a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements in which you play the role of Alexander, king of Airath who was banished beyond the borders of his country without relatives, friends, armies, or money. As the last offspring of the ancient family Illiar, which has ruled Eden for ages, you must fight to regain control of your land. In real-time turn-based battles, you must gather an army to crush the traitorous enemies who have slaughtered your family. Instead of giving orders and watching the battles from a safe place, you participate in the fight yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
