							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Divine Alligator (OSRIC Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Two hundred years ago was the time of Raerciminar, a dragon furthering the agenda of Itzquizatl, a draconic deity of death and decay. His chief method was infusing as many creatures as possible with dragon blood. Leaving several dozen half-dragon children in his wake, Raerciminar retreated into his distant lair and slumbered into deep sleep, waiting for his children to reach maturity by themselves and instruct them later... The Divine Alligator is a 1st edition OSRIC fantasy adventure suitable for four 7th level player characters. A ranger or druid is highly helpful, as is someone with good Charisma, plus the ability to speak Draconic. Characters of higher or lower levels can also take part in the adventure.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
