			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I like lizardfolk because I like dinosaurs, and the idea that there are still wild and primitive places in the world. My own campaign world of Desteon is peppered with &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; places where dinosaurs, and lizardfolk, still rule. While they&amp;rsquo;re less sophisticated or &amp;ldquo;civilized&amp;rdquo; than warm-blooded humanoids, lizardfolk are a far older race. Rather than making them corrupt and degenerate, I like to play with the idea that they&amp;rsquo;re actually more pure, because they&amp;rsquo;re part of nature. To me, they&amp;rsquo;re guardians of the wetlands, marshes, and swamps, the places that become polluted and destroyed so quickly when humans and their mammalian cousins come stomping through. Even the evil lizardfolk I&amp;rsquo;ve presented here demonstrate that nature is something to be respected, and even feared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For story purposes, I often build plots that go completely around lizardfolk,, rather than dealing with them directly. They&amp;rsquo;re indigenous tribes in the Amazon, or endangered species. Elves and druids argue on their behalf, trying to protect them from the incursions of the &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; world, while in truth the lizardfolk would kill and eat those self-appointed allies as quickly as they&amp;rsquo;d put down anyone else who trespassed in their territory. Those that don&amp;rsquo;t really care about the lizardfolk, and simply want their land and its resources for their own, find that there&amp;rsquo;s no need for hippie elves and druids to fight their battles for them, because the lizardfolk are ferocious and can take care of themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, you need to get past all the giant crocodiles, mosquitoes the size of condors, man-eating plants, and yes, carnivorous dinosaurs before you even get to see the lizardfolk in their native habitat. Because I like dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are cool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
