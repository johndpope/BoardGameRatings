			<description>Record Of Lodoss War: The RPG is a fan-made roleplaying game about the Lodoss War setting.  From the opening of the Eternal Edition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the Age of Eternity...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Record of Lodoss War is an epic fantasy anime series (Japanese Animation), chronicling the adventures of a party of heroes. Based loosely on the American RPG D&amp;amp;D&amp;trade;, a Japanese RPG called &amp;quot;Sword World RPG&amp;quot; came to life, developed by Ryo Mizuno and Group SNE, and became very popular in Japan. Lodoss War was a supplement for Sword World, and consisted of three books -- Lodoss War Companion I, II, and III. A novel series and manga series (comic book) were written and produced, based on the RPG campaign by Group SNE. In 1991, these stories were finally adapted into a 13 part Original Animation Series (OAV) title &amp;quot;The Record of Lodoss War&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;Lodoss Island War Record&amp;quot;, in its literal translation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lodoss War RPG uses the Fuzion RPG system, jointly developed by R.Talsorian Games and Heroes Games. Why Fuzion? Fuzion is used in dozens of anime RPG, including Bubblegum Crisis, Usagi Yojimbo, VOTOMS, and Dragonball Z all of which are anime RPGs. It is only logical for Lodoss War, yet another anime series, to utilize the Fuzion mechanics system. Furthermore, the Fuzion core rules are Free, yes free. You need not buy anything, just download the web-book (HTML or .PDF), from the Fuzion Labs Website. Also, please visit my Atomik Fuzion Website and download the&lt;br/&gt;Atomik Magick plug-in, you will need it (all addresses are given on the previous page).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is Lodoss War RPG Eternal Edition. The previous Prologue Edition was an early release. The Eternal Edition contains more information and many corrections, including details on monsters and new locations. As back ground, this final edition of the Lodoss War RPG uses OAV episodes 1-8 and the Chronicles series as background material. The events which took place in OAV episodes 9-13 are ignored, as they did not happen as such in Chronicles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
