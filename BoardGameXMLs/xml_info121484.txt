			<description>The box says &amp;quot;An Exciting 3 Dimensional Game.&amp;quot; Aimed at children under eight years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a race to see who can get through their 'cheese tunnel' first. Luck and colour recognition are all part of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles are placed face down. Players draw a tile - If it matches their colour they can move their mouse along the tunnel. If it is not their colour, return it to the pack. There are penalties for drawing a cat card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get their mouse to the end of the cheese tunnel, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;4 - 3D Cheese Tunnels&lt;br/&gt;4 Mice Holes&lt;br/&gt;4 Mice&lt;br/&gt;24 Mice and Cat Tiles.&lt;br/&gt;1 Cat Backcloth.&lt;br/&gt;1 Set of Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
