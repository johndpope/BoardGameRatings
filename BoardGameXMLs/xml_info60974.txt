							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dryden: Hero or Horror?</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the Dryden? Fertility spirits of the dark forest primeval? Being born of a Pandora's womb of science? Base and lustful demons from beyond the known stars?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dryden is an 'adults only' product for gamers who like their games without limits. Offering dozens of ways to use the Dryden in your game, this book contains rules for the never-before seen Dryden racial class. Usable as both a player class and a monster template, the Dryden offer a frightening window into the life of a creature who's drive to mate colors its very existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy gamers can play as the decedents of woodland fertility spirits that were given flesh. Modern gamers can play as either Dryden running from the government lab they were born in, or as agents sent to discover and shutdown a Dryden 'family' before they breed out-of-control. Future gamers can fight against the dark tide of extinction as their people are mated to their new Dryden masters, and destroyed from within by their spawn. You can even mix and match, and do things like using the Future Dryden in a Fantasy campaign. Deal with the horror in a demonic invasion of a most personal and frightening kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you weren't offended yet, just wait: &lt;br/&gt;It has tentacles too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, this product is for adults only, and can be guaranteed to offend, frighten, or disgust some readers. If for any reason you feel you cannot handle the dark topics of this book, then it is recommended that you do not purchase it. If you purchase this book and are offended, then you were warned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
