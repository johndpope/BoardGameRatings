			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 3-5 hour adventure is inspired by the video game Playerunknown&amp;rsquo;s Battlegrounds. It is best for 3rd-4th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The adventurers have been arrested and find themselves fighting nineteen other teams in a fight-to-the-death battle royale. The winning team receives a full pardon from their lifelong sentence and won&amp;rsquo;t have to endure the hell that is Stonegate Penitentiary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party battles ogres on a bridge, goblins in a shack, and bandits at an airdrop ambush. In the end, they face off against a cult fanatic and his three orcs, where they learn not everything is as it seems on the mysterious island of Granjel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes a unique looting system with an accompanying chart that fits the tone of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
