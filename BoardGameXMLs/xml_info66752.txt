			<description>This game is a remake of &amp;quot;The Euro Game&amp;quot; shopping and sums by MAJORA.&lt;br/&gt;For children from age 7 and up, the game teaches them how to deal with money and especially how to manage it. They&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to do a number of every day errands such as shopping, going to the bank, recycling, using a cash machine and crossing the street safely so they travel between the various places. The game is meant to be both educational and fun, so children can learn and grow, by doing things that usually belong to the domain of adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the author: &amp;quot;Designing this game was a totally different challenge from inventing my other games. Actually, the game was meant to be a remake but when I started working on it, I made so many changes the game became a completely new one!&lt;br/&gt;I tried to preserve the simplicity of the original game and keep the bills and coins the center of attention. New features were introduced, such as recycling and crossing the street safely. I hope this game is a source of fun and learning for all children and their parents. Have fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
