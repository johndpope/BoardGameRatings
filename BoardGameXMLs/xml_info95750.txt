							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wizard of Oz: The Game</name>
									
			<description>The Wizard of Oz : The Game (Kids version) is an entry-level game with the objective of collecting three token cards while travelling down the path of the Yellow Brick Road and arriving first at the Emerald City. The game is played on a colorful board with beautifully reproduced scenes from the movie. This is a roll-the-die-and-move game with different spaces on the Yellow Brick Road where you collect your tokens and perhaps encounter the Wicked Witch (who causes you to lose your turn) or Winged Monkeys (who you must battle using competitive die rolls - win and you gain a Token card, lose and you miss your next turn). There are also spaces for drawing Toto cards which provide players with special abilities.  Landing on an Emerald City space allows you to draw an Emerald City card and a corresponding Token card. Corner spaces are considered &amp;quot;enchanted&amp;quot;. The Glinda corner space lets you move ahead 6 spaces. The Ruby Slipper space allows you to double your movement that turn. The final corner space is the Wizard of Oz and allows you take a Token card.  For kids 6 years and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relive the most beloved motion picture of all time as you follow the Yellow Brick Road through the Land of Oz to reach the Emerald City. As Dorothy, Cowardly Lion, Tin Man or Scarecrow, you will defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, battle winged monkeys and collect your corresponding tokens. Help Dorothy keep her Ruby Slippers, Tin Man find a Heart, Scarecrow a Diploma and Cowardly Lion his Medal of Courage. Then, continue on to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard of Oz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a different game from The Wizard of Oz: The Game.  Notably, that game is a family game, whereas this is children's game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
