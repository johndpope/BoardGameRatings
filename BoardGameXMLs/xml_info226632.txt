			<description>A strategy game with strong economy aspects.&lt;br/&gt; You begin as a Lord of one realm and try to conquer the rest of the world by using your deadly armies or by uniting kingdoms to form a country.&lt;br/&gt;Test yourself in a supply and demand market. Create pacts with other lords to make your way to the crown faster and easier, then break them and destroy opponents by sending spies to their lands. Expand your kingdom by building villages and cities. Protect it by raising castles and wizard towers. Every move you take influences the happiness of your people. When it reaches the top you can form a country, but when it falls to the ground your people will assassinate you. Will you accept the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;â€‹&lt;br/&gt;Rule book will be in three different languages: English, Polish,  and Italian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to &amp;ldquo;Form a country&amp;rdquo;.

A turn is split into 8 phases.&lt;br/&gt;In each phase Players perform their own actions before they can move to the next phase.
