			<description>Silpheed​ (シルフィード, Shirufīdo?) (pronounced &amp;quot;Sil-Feed&amp;quot;) is a video game series developed by Game Arts. It made its debut on the Japanese PC-8801 in 1986. It was later remade for the Mega-CD and has a sequel called Silpheed: The Lost Planet for the PlayStation 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silpheed is the name of the spacecraft that the player controls. Like many shooter games, the story involves using the Silpheed as Earth's last effort to save itself from destruction by a powerful enemy invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Silpheed game was created for the PC-8801 in 1986. Another version for the FM-7 was released in 1988. In the same year, the game was brought to the United States for the first time by Sierra On-Line who ported the game to PCs and other platforms. Despite the rather limited hardware used, the game featured real-time 3D polygonal graphics and a tilted third-person perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Silpheed&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan's Hottest New Action Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for Silpheed, the action game that grabs you and never lets go, from the first note of its fast moving soundtrack to the ultimate showdown with Xacalite, the evil warlord.
