			<description>publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From its conception, the Blue Sky Game Series was designed to be an expandable system that would allow players to simulate and explore the challenges of aerial warfare throughout the 20th century. With this supplement players can now field Polish, French, and Dutch aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the maps, info counters, charts, dice and Flight Stands from Black Cross / Blue Sky are used with this supplement.  Players do not have to continually re-purchase these essential components. Some of the aircraft counters from Black Cross / Blue Sky are also used. All of the scenarios can be expanded with additional aircraft counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So put on your parachute, and remember to bring your foreign language dictionaries, for there is a battle to be won over the skies of Europe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
