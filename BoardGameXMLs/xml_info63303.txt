			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blurb:For Those About to Die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a collection of over 50 pre-generated characters, complete with Skills, Vital Stats, Character Types and more, all ready to go (die). The characters are perfect for use as PC's, NPC's, Cast, Walk-Ons, Bad Guys or even just for dressing up in paper outfits, tacking up on the wall and tossing darts at. Intended for use with Horror Rules, The Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game, the material in this book can easily be adapted to fit any modern-day RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six sections, one for each Character Type (Action, Con, Labcoat, Propellorhead, Regular Joe and VIP), each with a detailed overview of the Type including career choices, suggested Skills, how to spend your Vital Stats points, equipment guides, and a handy ?What This Character Does for the Group? tip section. For your convenience, each character sheet is included in two formats, a pre-generated ready-to-play character and a blank sheet on the reverse for you to customize as you see fit. Also included is a page of handy quick reference Character Power cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
