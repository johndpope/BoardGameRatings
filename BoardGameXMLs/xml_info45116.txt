							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slayer&#039;s Guide to Demons</name>
									
			<description>Evil, chaos and destruction; depravation, insanity, unmitigated cruelty. Pain, horror and madness. The ultimate incarnations of darkness, this is what demons embody. As malignant as a necromancer or a demonologist may become, they are still no match for the limitless evil of the lowest dretch. There is no redemption for these outsiders, as they seek only the destruction and corruption of all that exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages you will find a wealth of information concerning demonic essence, the Abyss and other haunts where these creatures thrive and the brutal society in which they exist, giving an additional level of understanding on how these outsiders interact with the rest of the world. Players will learn how to detect and eradicate demonic influence on the Material Plane and the perils of taking the fight into the depths of a demon&amp;rsquo;s home. Games Masters are presented with guidelines on how to introduce these foul creatures into their campaigns. They will also benefit from material demonstrating how to actually portray demons to their players, thus giving their campaigns and scenarios much greater depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demons fight an eternal and brutal war to impose chaos and darkness upon everyone and they have an eternity to wage it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
