							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1940: Objetivo europa</name>
									
			<description>A wargame covering the second world war in Europe. The level is strategic. The goal is to win with the axies or the allies in three different ways: military (destroy all enemy units), technical (control of reinforcement hex) or politic (at the end of 1945 the side who control more cities). There are different scenarios and four levels of complexity. The mechanic is I go you go, first, the axis moves his air units, then the naval units and finally the ground units, after this the allies do the actions. There are rules for weather and politics (very simple). The counters have firepower (attack and defense) and movement numbers,the map has hex for movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
