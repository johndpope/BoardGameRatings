			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short adventure is designed for four characters of 2nd level, or a solo character such as a fighter, paladin, or cleric of higher level. It was intentionally made generic in setting content so that it could be inserted into any campaign setting. Many years ago, when humans were still new in the area, a noble family of warriors strove to protect the countryside, bringing justice and safety to those who had none. Far and wide their name was known. In time however their name faded from memory. With that passing eventually came the passing of the knowledge of the clan&amp;rsquo;s burial chambers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now their long forgotten tomb lies undiscovered amidst a small glade in the forest, its once honorable occupants changed into horrible undead creatures by the power of a passing evil artifact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
