							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavalier Orders</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside are 12 new cavalier orders, each beautifully illustrated in full color! In addition, each cavalier order gets 1-4 new feats that complement that order. For example, the order of the flagon can select drunken strength as one of his cavalier bonus feats to boost his strength after taking a swig of a strong drink!&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a new archetype: the dual sworn knight. He ditches the horse and picks up a second order. After all, we think the order is the coolest part of the cavalier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what cavaliers orders are there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Black Rose, commander of undead and slayer of positive channelers!&lt;br/&gt;    Claymore, wielder of a mighty greatsword and challenger all who dare think they are mightier than he! &lt;br/&gt;    Cold Iron, slayer of demons from the Abyss!&lt;br/&gt;    Flagon, lord of the mug!&lt;br/&gt;    Fortune, mercenary with a wide range of weapons at his disposal!&lt;br/&gt;    Luck, (un)fair knight of Lady Luck!&lt;br/&gt;    Road, traveler of lands pleasant and not!&lt;br/&gt;    Scorpion, whip-wielding defender of the great desert crypts! &lt;br/&gt;    Sea, captain with a fine ship and a finer crew!&lt;br/&gt;    Sun, smiter of undead and those who dare raise them!&lt;br/&gt;    Truth, knight of honorable word and combat!&lt;br/&gt;    White Rose, protector of the weak!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
