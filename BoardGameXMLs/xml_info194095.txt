							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shaya&#039;Nor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nation of Shaya'Nor. This guidebook will teach you the history of the one-time Dwarven kingdom that is now home to the Corrupted Fae, Vainar the Wise and his Necrolords.  The Dark Church is the only religion and all must show their belief or suffer a horrible fate.  The undead serve in various roles with zombies tilling fields and hauling cargo and Vampires sitting atop the food chain...er, society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leave your superstitions at home and find the beauty within this bleak country. The Shayakeim are the lords and masters of the land, ruling over the Terraheim and the other races are little better than serfs.  Amongst the horror a few lights shine.  The Starwatchers are a strange and rebelious cult or perhaps powerful prophets who may be the key to Shaya'Nor's salvation.  Politics here are deadly serious and death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you.  Within these pages you'll find everything you need to create a character from Shaya'Nor.  New racial and professional edges provide for interesting role playing options and GMs will find the history very revealing.  There's even some secrets revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
