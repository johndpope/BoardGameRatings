			<description>Side Effects May Include... is a Screw Your Neighbor party game for the overmedicated. Players take on the role of pharmaceutical companies attempting to pass their drugs through a government review process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round a condition is flipped over. Players receive medication cards to treat that condition but medications always come with side effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Side effects are dealt to players and they choose whether to switch with their neighbor or keep the one they have. Once each player has 5 side effects the medications are passed to the dealer who is the reviewer for that round. The dealer decides which medication is the least harmful; that medication is passed and treats the condition. The first player to treat 3 conditions wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And sometimes the treatment is worse than the cure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Side Effects May Include... Uncontrollable laughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
