			<description>Our young birds, recently born, are preparing their first challenge in life, to learn how to fly! This is where you'll need to help them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With one touch easy mechanic, touch the screen to make them flap their wings. Not so easy though, the forest they are is filled with obstacles including trees, spikes and forest folks such as Bees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
