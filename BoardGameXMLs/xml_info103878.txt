			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On safari with President Theodore Roosevelt...&lt;br/&gt;Captured by a warlike nomadic tribe...&lt;br/&gt;Charged by a man-eating hippopotamus...&lt;br/&gt;Riding on a train through&lt;br/&gt;the African savannah...and&lt;br/&gt;learning a lesson in the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between man and nature...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are only some of the adventures you will have as young Indiana Jones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1909, and you and your parents are traveling through British East Africa, invited to spend time on a friend's coffee plantation.
