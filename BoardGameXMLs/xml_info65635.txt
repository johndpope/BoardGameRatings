							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Dumb Tables</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is it about random tables that gamers love so much? Perhaps it's the sense of danger, like the rush a gambler in Vegas feels when he's bet it all on one roll of the dice. Or perhaps its the limitless potential those columns represent, the unexpected ways to break out of a gaming rut. Either way, QAGS: The Book of Dumb Tables has all the tables you need to spice up your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need an idea for a game? Try the PC Group Table or the High Concept Table. Need a name for your silver age super-hero? Need to know who would play him or her in the movie? GM, do you need a plot twist? A random encounter? A sound effect? A Bruce Willis movie? The Book of Dumb Tables has all these things, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QAGS: The Book of Dumb Tables includes 35 tables, not including the Table of Contents. It is designed for use with QAGS, the Quick Ass Game System, but can be used with nearly any game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
