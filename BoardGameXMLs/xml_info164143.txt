			<description>Scary Cape Creatures is a card game for 2-4 players, ages 8 to adult. The object of the game is to score the most points after every player's hand is empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses the same deck, which is separated into four suits that consist of cards representing various monsters and legends from the Cape Cod area. Each player selects all the cards from a given suit, or all the cards from 2 suits for a 2-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards have a symbol in each corner, representing seasons and elements. Points are scored by placing cards with matching symbols beside cards currently in play. Cards also have numerical values that affect scoring and gameplay. Each suit also has special characteristics or powers that can be used to affect gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rollickin' fun card game using 52 of Cape Cod's spookiest characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather around the campfire with this game of strategy using Cape Cod's spookiest entities as pawns - altogether 52 of the peninsula's scariest and most infamous pirates, ghosts, witches and indigenous spirits, calling upon their mastery of the fourfold powers of nature to defeat your opponents(s). Boldness, skill, and timing are needed to enter a mysterious realm populated by a host of weird creatures drawn from the Cape's eerie legends, history, and lore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
