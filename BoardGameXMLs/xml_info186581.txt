							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Woman... Also Featuring Spooks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIVES INTERRUPTED... AND JUSTICE BY SPOOKS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A college professor confronting a colleague about an embezzlement scheme... a young woman rushing to deliver important news to a greiving father. Both lives came to violent conclusions, but that was only the beginning of their stories....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Woman... Also Featuring Spooks contains three fanstastic, forgotten stories from the Golden Age of Comics, a time before &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; in the comic book genre had been set, and creativity was allowed to run wild. Two of the tales feature Spooks, a jaunty justice-seeking ghost, who is one of the earliest works by Dave Berg, best remembered for his gentle ribbing of American culture in 20 years worth of MAD Magazine issues, and the third is one of the richest horror stories in the entirety of the Golden Age. In 8 short pages, wrtier/artist Bernard Bailey sketches out a world of undead werewolves, restless spiritsm and monster hunters--all against the background of heart-breaking personal tragedy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the comics, this book features two all-new templates that will permit d20 System player characters and villains to continue past the moment of final death and pursue their unfinished business &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Disembodied: A spirit who won't call it quits and which can take control of the living when it needs to. &lt;br/&gt;     The Vroudulakas: A werewolf-like undead that rises from the corpse of a serial killer.&lt;br/&gt;     A new talent tree and feats that expand the Disembodied template, allowing ghostly player characters to grow into their new existence they continue to gain levels. (Although designed with OGL d20 Modern in mind, these templates are useable in most d20 System-based roleplaying games where undead stalk the living.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEATH IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
