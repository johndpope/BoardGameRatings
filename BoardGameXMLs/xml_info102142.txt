			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you ever dreamed of designing your own computer adventure game, pinch yourself. You are not dreaming now. You are holding in your hands ADVENTURE CREATOR, a remarkably sophisticated software program that can make your dream a reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVENTURE CREATOR is, quite simply, everything you need to design a challenging adventure game for you to enjoy--or a friend to attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start by building an adventure-world: up to 100 rooms are at your disposal. Make them as perilous as you please. Build complex mazes. Booby-trap them with heat bars and populate them with ferocious and friendly creatures. Hide the treasures cleverly. Use every trick in the program to make the quest a difficult one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the environment is prepared, the quest is on. Either you or a friend must use cunning and skill to explore the rooms, navigate hazards, outwit creatures, and emerge victorious, laden with treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may also choose to let the computer design the adventure for you. Just collect your supplies--a creature detector, time nullifier, energy points, and more--and you're off on your quest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any way you play it, you'll find ADVENTURE CREATOR complex, creative, challenging--and utterly addictive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
