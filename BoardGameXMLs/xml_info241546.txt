			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stimulating Apple Hi-Res game in which the player must try to drive a Formula racer over an increasingly harder course.  There are 5 spectacular courses that change after the completion of a lap.  You are in a race against time!  Watch out for the course obstacles which include oil slicks, razor sharp turns, and difficult to negotiation overpasses.  This game is sure to provide you with hours of pleasure as you try to cut second off your score.  Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
