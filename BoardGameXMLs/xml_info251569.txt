			<description>The game can be crudely described as Monopoly meets Scrabble. The premise is based on property development, but tile placement and scoring is similar to Scrabble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of tiles, set up on a tile stand. Each player in turn has the opportunity of placing tiles on the board alongside and tiles already on the board. Each tile placed on the board automatically makes a row (or &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;) longer. At the very least a new street consisting of two tiles is formed when a new tile is laid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player so manages to lengthen a street by placing a new tile on the board, he scores the new total arithmetical value of the street, for as far as it extends in a straight unbroken line. Each successive tile added on to a given street will score more and more as the street increases in length and value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles must be matched to the board by color and number as a general rule, but there are a number of &amp;quot;joker&amp;quot; tiles that do not conform to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
