							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Friendzee: Christian Character Edition</name>
									
			<description>Players move game pieces around the Friendzee game board by rolling cubes that direct them to draw from three sets of cards:&lt;br/&gt;1) LIVE OUT LOUD--surprising and meaningful experiences challenge participants to tell stories, sculpt clay, write, sketch, perform charades...and more.&lt;br/&gt;2) DIVE IN DEEP--gets them digging into Bible passages and studying God's Word together on a more personal level.&lt;br/&gt;3) RISKZEE--a roll of the dice directs players to do both wacky and Bible-themed activities as they explore Scripture.&lt;br/&gt;All three cards guide teens around the game board and to the ENDZEE. There are no winners and no losers--the game ends when everyone reaches the ENDZEE and commits to a challenge for the week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Christian Character Edition encourages teen to deepen their faith by discussing Courage, Integrity, Humility, Grace, Compassion, and Perseverance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
