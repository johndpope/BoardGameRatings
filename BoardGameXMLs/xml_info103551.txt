			<description>BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available on Apple's App store now, our groundbreaking fusion of a great arcade game with a full blown comic book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been launched with sixty levels, ten worlds full of challenging obstacles, hidden levels if you're good at the gameplay part and master levels for the guy who's done with the story mode and still can't stop playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6th Planet features a full ten track ambient soundtrack by renowned artists also heard on the hit game Osmos (buy it, by the way) and a comic book story created in cooperation with Vivifilm. Vivi-who? They're an animated movie production company with two Oscar nominations on their impressive resume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story starts off when Hawaiian scientists notice Saturn, the sixth planet in our solar system, is starting to terraform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Earth's resources running out and overpopulation becoming an ever growing problem, this could be a new start for mankind. But they have one question to answer&amp;hellip; what's causing this change. Religious leaders claim it as the work of their god, alien believers think their day has finally come and military leaders want to check it out with a bunch of armed missiles, just in case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the debate heats up, NASA bumps up its 'monkeys to mars' program and sends in Darius, a genetically altered chimp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
