							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Time Lord Companion Express Edition (Third Edition)</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This, the third edition of this booklet, was designed as a set of rules to allow published adventures from FASA Corporation's Doctor Who Role Playing Game to be used in the Time Lord environment. To do this, the GM controlled characters and pre-generated Player Characters (PC's for short) need to be converted over to the Time Lord game system. This booklet provides the rules, tables, and guidelines to do this. Included in the booklet are statistics for the Eighth Doctor, presented in May 1996 in a made-for-TV movie shown simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third edition streamlines the rules and corrects the vast majority of errors in the Second Edition. This edition replaces all previous editions. For sake of brevity, the character creation rules created by Ian Marsh and Allen Shock do not appear in this document. They are available on the Internet at the website address at the end of this document. The first edition of this document originally had their rules included with these, but were removed when the Second Edition was published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
