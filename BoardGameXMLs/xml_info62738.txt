			<description>This educational game will reinforce the important information of Roman history that students would typically be tested on during History tests. Learners will reinforce important names, dates, and events, while gaining a deeper understanding for the difficulties of expanding an empire and costs to maintain it. Thus, the students will learn from their own successes and failures while emulating the Roman Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Julius Caesar (or Caesar Augustus if you prefer) and you begin the game in Rome, preparing to conquer all of Europe (at least as far as the greatest extent of the Roman Empire). The goal is to conquer all of the territory the Romans once conquered, province by province, by overcoming your enemies, barbarian tribes, and devastating sea storms without being overwhelmed by the swelling costs of maintaining an empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Caesar to conquer all of the Roman provinces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game board&lt;br/&gt;     Player cards&lt;br/&gt;     Province reference sheets&lt;br/&gt;     Question cards&lt;br/&gt;     Fate cards&lt;br/&gt;     1 6-Sided die&lt;br/&gt;     Denarii (money)&lt;br/&gt;     Colored game pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
