							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bad Boys Collector Game Cards</name>
									
			<description>This was one of the games published in TSR's &amp;quot;Comics Modules&amp;quot; - it appeared in Warhawks Comics Module #5, which is called Warhawks 2050 Part 1 on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of a deck of 24 cards depicting characters, places, and objects from &amp;quot;Bad Boys,&amp;quot; the backup feature in the  Warhawks book.  These are used to play two games, one (not given a separate title) which is rummy-like, and one, The Hunt for El Presidente, which is similar to Old Maid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first game, the cards can be combined with those from other TSR comics - Buck Rogers, 13: Assassin, RIP: Avenger of the Dead, Black Barney, and the Warhawks main feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
