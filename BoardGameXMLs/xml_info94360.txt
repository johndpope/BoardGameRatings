							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Global Futures Game</name>
									
			<description>The Global Futures Game is a simulation intended for classroom use at the high school or college level. The players are divided into eight teams representing various regions of the world. The game is played over nine rounds, each consisting of a ten-minute negotiation session and a five-minute calculation session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each region starts with different levels of population, food production, and technology. Small amounts of population can be sent to other regions with their consent. Food and technology can be given to or traded with other regions, and can also be traded off inside each region. Investment can be made in education, which provides delayed benefits (two turns - 10 years - later).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to keep your region fed and with a reasonable level of technology, and ideally to achieve zero population growth, all while avoiding world destruction points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
