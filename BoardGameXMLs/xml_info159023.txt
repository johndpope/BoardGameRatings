			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some say the gods expelled the grotesque and the weak from their ranks at the beginning of time, denying them entrance to the lofty heavens. Demons all of them, they fled to remote places where they had palaces built in which they could dwell and prosper in the glittering shadows, and that among these places, the 1001 Pagodas of Doom of the Yellow Springs Island are supreme, sheltering countless horrors and ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AN ORIENTAL ADVENTURES COMPANION, A MONSTER MANUAL, A TOME OF WONDROUS MAGIC, AN ASIAN-THEMED CITY, A SOLO CAMPAIGN AND A DM'S AID &amp;mdash; ALL IN ONE BOOKLET&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you looking for an Oriental Adventures Companion? A Chinese-style monster manual with a twist? A tome collecting a hundred brand new mundane magic items? An Asian-themed urban setting? A game aid to help you fill in the gaps when improvising? An endless campaign that you can play solo or with your family and friends without a DM? Good, because you'll find all this gathered together in one nifty package right here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;br/&gt;In a nutshell, Mad Monks of Kwantoom features a wondrous Asian setting with new character races and classes, crazy unique creatures inspired by matchbox pictures coming straight from ancient China, alternative petty magic items, tables for random dungeon generation and simple house rules for all of this to run smoothly. In addition, you'll find campaign rules to help you flesh your characters out and embed them in the setting, which they can change and mold according to their whims as they proceed to glory, prosperity and &amp;mdash; who knows? &amp;mdash; immortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT ELSE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninjas, tengu player characters, the revised monk character class, the City of Innocent Deaths, the Lucky Charm of Many Ghastly Friends, the Style of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists, Pa'kua kobolds, the Monkey King himself, a game that your partner can play and enjoy with you &amp;mdash; and you alone, the 1001 pagodas of doom and actual rules for becoming the Noble Jade Empress or the head of the Shrine of the Purple Lady of the Latrines if that's your thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LABYRINTH LORD POWERED OLD SCHOOL RENAISSANCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is officially compatible with Labyrinth Lord and the Labyrinth Lord Advanced Edition Companion. Since these systems emulate the Basic and Advanced editions of the original Old School rules, you can play it with them or with any Old School Renaissance gaming system instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
