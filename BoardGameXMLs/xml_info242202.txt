							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey: Heroic and Azoic</name>
									
			<description>Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is a new take on the collectible non-collectible KB line, with Jeffrey Neil Bellinger once again putting the rabbits through the grinder. Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Odyssey is not collectible or random. Players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic and Azoic contains the Elementals, Energy, and Technology starter decks, as well as 3 limited edition promo cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
