			<description>The players move their pawns on a grid, determined by dice rolls. They are trying to reach a location chip which was assigned a location (for instance, an hotel, an airport lounge, a living room etc.). The first two players to reach the chip have to have a verbal argument befitting that location. The third player takes one side. The other player(s) have to decide who is the winner. That winner gets a ring over the pawn (so does a player who took the right side); the loser places and names the location chip again. The first player to have three rings is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
