			<description>Frog Family Fun-Pack is an educational game for children, with various math and reading modules, all using the same rules and board.  Players take turns choosing a card and attempting to answer the question on the card.  If the answer is correct, they move their pawn on a track the number or spaces printed on the back of the card.  If the answer is wrong, the card is placed back in the middle of the stack.  Extra turn spaces and shortcuts also appear on the track.  The first player to reach the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
