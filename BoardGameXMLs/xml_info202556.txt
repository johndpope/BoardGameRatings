			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Every evening, Uncle Bob takes the two dachshund siblings, Spot and Louise, for a walk. While playing with her brother in the park Louise s ball rolls away. Louise runs after it, but she is so tiny that she gets lost among the bushes and objects of the park. When she realizes that she can not see Uncle Bob anymore, she starts to look for them right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime Spot also starts searching for Louise. Which doggie will find the other? A strategy game for children who love to play hide and seek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The goal is to find the opponent's dog (pawn) before it finds you.&lt;br/&gt;         Pawns (dogs) moving on a grid of 5 &amp;times; 5 squares of 7 &amp;times; 7 squares depending on the selected difficulty level. Each row and each row contains a decorative element: a leaf, a kite, etc.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         On your turn, you roll two dice. The pink dice shows how many questions (1 to 3) you can ask. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are of the &amp;quot;Looking to .... what do you see? &amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;We can look to the city (north), the park (south), River (west) or the road (east). With luck, the answers may give the exact location. Often uncertainty remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can then move the maximum number of spaces shown on the black die (1, 2, 3, 3, 4 or 4) to try to reach the opponent's piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game of hide &amp;amp; seek the player who finds the dog of the other player before his dog is found wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
