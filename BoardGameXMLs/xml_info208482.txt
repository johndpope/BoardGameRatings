			<description>Dragon Kings is a deck building game consisting of 55 cards. In Dragon Kings, players develop a deck by using mana to purchase and cast new Spells/Dragons from the Dragon Pit. The Dragon Pit is the set of powerful neutral cards that belong to neither player, placed in the center of the play area. With the aid of the Dragons and Spells purchased from the Dragon Pit, the players' ultimate goal is to reduce their opponent's life to 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons Kings is a 2-player game (or 4 players with 2 decks) that introduces players to deck building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
