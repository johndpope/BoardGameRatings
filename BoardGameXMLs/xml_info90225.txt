							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Houses: The Guild Hive</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in a canyon hidden by forest boughs, giant vermin live and die among their faen caretakers while snakes and toads slither and crawl amidst the web-strewn canyon. The Venomer&amp;rsquo;s Guild Hive. Their mark is found on many a mysterious bottle, but even the knowing dare not speak of it. Among the piled-high husks of wasp bodies and shredded wings of giant moths, these unusual sprytes and faen make their home. Something attracts a few rare, twisted members of this race to dissect giant insects for their deadly poisons. Woe betide the lone traveler who forces through the thick brush and thorns ringing the canyon looking for a cheap source of spider venom. They may never return home. The breeding swarms of normal-sized insects buzzing in the air nearby is but a hint of what flies within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location fits well in any wilderness setting, as a sidelight to an urban adventure - especially where there are thick woods or jungles nearby - or when a surprise at the end of the trail is in order. The Guild Hive could be a source of rare or signature poisons in the Lands of the Diamond Throne. Assassin&amp;rsquo;s guilds, harrids, the Jarren, machiavellian politicos, Nightwalkers, and all manner of unsavory organizations and individuals may either be affiliated with or rivals to the Venomers. The Hive&amp;rsquo;s suggested location is near Thayn in the Elder Mountains. In the past, the Guild has killed off those who have revealed their secrets and often even those who merely learned them, so few in other organizations speak of them to any but their most trusted confidantes. PCs who wish to use the Wasp Totem Warrior class described later might train at the Hive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
