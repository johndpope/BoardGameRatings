			<description>Front of the box: &amp;quot;Get the most yield from any field with Dan the Answer Plot man.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a promotional game that was created by Croplan Genetics and their Answer Plot program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From jackplotvegas.com:&lt;br/&gt;JackPlot! is a CROPLAN GENETICS and Answer Plot based board game. The game is based on a year in time. Just like in real life, growers have to withstand the elements of winter, spring planting, growing season and harvest to hold onto as much yield as they can. Hopefully with the help of their local agronomist and by attending the Winter Grower Meeting and the Answer Plot Knowledge Events, growers can plan well and gain enough insight to protect and increase their yield. The player with more yield than other players (the neighbors) at the end of the game (the grain elevator), wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
