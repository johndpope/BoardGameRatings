			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Listen, understand, do and have fun at the same time. A game conducive to language development and communication and also good for shape comprehension and for training fine motor skills.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially a two-player game, this can be played with more players by forming two-teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two players (or teams) sit opposite each other and each player is given an identical kit with 26 wooden elements (cubes, prisms, bridges, etc).  The lid of the game box is setup as a vertical screen between the two players so that their wooden pieces and building projects in front of them is not visible to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is chosen to be the master builder and the other is the apprentice. The master builder begins building a structure with his/her pieces (not visible to the other because of the screen) and verbally describes it as precisely as possible, as the building progresses. The 'apprentice' tries to follow the description givenby the master builder and attempts to build a replica of the structure with the pieces on his/her side of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its exciting to compare the buildings when the screen is finally removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A further version (for players with practice) is &amp;quot;sign language&amp;quot;, whereby the players may only use their hands to communicate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
