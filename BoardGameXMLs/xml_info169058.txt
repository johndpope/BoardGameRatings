							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Housing Crisis</name>
									
			<description>Housing Crisis is a light two-player strategy game where you assume the role of overwhelmed real estate brokers trying to place lodgers into a new suburban development without wasting any housing space or upsetting them by cramming too many into one plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tokens are drawn at random from each players private store so that two are always to hand and ready to be placed, which keeps the luck/skill balance well proportioned. Additionally, as the token values are fixed for each player, as the game progresses and the board starts to fill, it becomes easier to guess what the other player might be holding, increasing the chance for a strategic play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing game tokens (representing the daily clients calling into the office) onto the shared game board, housing them as effectively as possible within the parameters of the rules. The winner is the agent with the most points after each player has placed all their tokens down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
