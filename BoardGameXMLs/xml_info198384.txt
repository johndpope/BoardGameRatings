			<description>Reinos e Rel&amp;iacute;quias is a fantasy card game in which players take the role of a hero from one of three kingdoms (Light, Darkness and Neutral) trying to defeat heroes from other kingdoms and, by doing so, stealing relics to his kingdoms. Players can equip new itens, cast powerfull spells and recruit new allies playing cards from their hands. Each weapon/spell has a different range and power and, if the defending player does not evade or absorb the damage by using his armor, he subtracts his hitpoints. When a player reaches zero life, the attacking player takes one  relic from the pile and one from the defeated player.&lt;br/&gt;When all the relics are gathered, the players score relics for their kingdoms (based on the value for that particular kingdom printed on each relic card). The players with the most points (in other words, the kingdom with the most points) at the end, shares the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
