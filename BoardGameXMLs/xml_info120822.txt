			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradigm City is known for its heroes, the powerful, colorfully-clad men and women who always swoop in and save the day. You're not one of those people. Sure, you're got a power (or at least a schtick), but it isn't particularly awe-inspiring, or even all that useful. You don't have a fancy crime-mobile, an ultra-modern headquarters, or a high-priced publicist like the big boys. But you've got heart, and sometimes that's all you really need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All-Stars is a game of low budget superheroics designed for use with the QAGS Second Edition rules. It includes an overview of Paradigm City, including history, places of interest, and important people; rules for character creation, and for super powers; a guide to creating your super team; GMing advice; sample characters (The Human Spork! Plushy Master! Singing Swordsman!); super-hero naming tables; adventure ideas; and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
