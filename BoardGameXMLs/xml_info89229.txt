			<description>This game is unique because it's a self destructing game! The game was published with six paper boards that self destruct after you play the game! It has a cycling theme, the mechanic is that you have to touch with a burning cigarette the starting line of the cyclist, the line of the rider that's burned up first is the rider that wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
