							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spells of Magic</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are spells and there are spells. The Jeshatan are masters of magic in many areas, but their supremacy in the realm of magic is paramount about all. For them, it is not merely a way of life, but of survival, for the harsh conditions of the Elemental Dimension of Magic would quickly render them dead unless they took extreme measures to protect themselves from it. Beyond that, their decadent lifestyle and enslavement of refugees and castaways to their isolated plane make it paramount that they, rather than anyone else master the truly infinite secrets of Magic. These spells are only taught to Jeshatan Masters, for it is understood that physically speaking, the Jeshatan are not much different than humans. It was the training and culture that made them different, and with Spells of Magic, they are very different indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
