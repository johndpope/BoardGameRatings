							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Temple of Issoth</name>
									
			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You must help me. The priests of Issoth have carried my son away. He is to be sacrificed to their dark god this very night. I will pay you 100 gold talents if you go to the Temple of Issoth and rescue him.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your blood chills at the mention of Issoth's temple. You have heard only rumors of that dark and forbidding place. Horrible stories of demons and the undead. The priests of Issoth are said to be fanatics that sate the great beast Issoth's every fiendish appetite. This man asks you to risk a great deal and offers very little in return. Do you dare enter THE TEMPLE OF ISSOTH?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire adventure is suitable for a single humanoid warrior with 20-30 combat adds. You may bring whatever weapons, armor, or equipment you wish. Three pregenerated characters are provided if you do not have one that fits the requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of Issoth is designed to be played using the Tunnels and Trolls&amp;trade; game system. You will need the T&amp;amp;T&amp;trade; rules to play this game. A free PDF starter set of the rules is available from Flying Buffalo here at RPGNow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
