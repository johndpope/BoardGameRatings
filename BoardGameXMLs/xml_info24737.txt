			<description>Based on the game show of the same name hosted by Gene Rayburn, which ran on NBC from 1958-60.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was played similarly to Name That Tune, but with only the first three notes of a popular song being played, and players then bid on their ability to guess the song correctly. The game cost more than the typical board game for the era due to including a small, eight-note xylophone which players used to begin each song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
