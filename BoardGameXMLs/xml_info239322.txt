			<description>For the next seven days, the campers at Camp Merriment will enjoy the wonders of nature like never before. They will partake in filling meals cooked over an open flame, kayak in beautiful rivers, and see wild, yet friendly, creatures native to the forest. Their week will be spent in utter bliss, with campers taking home naught but fond memories&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a shame you won't be joining them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Camp Bearfoot; the abandoned camp ground where your instructor has accidentally led your group. With no provisions, and no sign of help arriving anytime soon, will the four of you manage to survive a week? Sexy antics and tensions are sure to rise as the days without help go on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt; - Play as a male or female protagonist &lt;br/&gt; - Fanservice visual novel with lighthearted comedy&lt;br/&gt; - Lesbian subplot between two of the girls&lt;br/&gt; - Potential romantic encounter with one of the girls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
