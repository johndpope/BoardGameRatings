			<description>Race game simulating the struggle of African-American trying to win the race to have the blue-ribbon cake. This game's imagery may be considered as racist, but try to view it as a historical testament to the age in which it was released. Please, if you have any further info on the game (such as the rules), post here or the forums within. Thanx!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
