			<description>2-6 players start with 18.500 gaming money and when the first player goes bankrupt, the game ends and the player with the most money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this game is 1 color-die and 6 dice in the colors shown on the color-die. There is also a paying board, which shows numbers from 4-20 and the corresponding payout amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of several dice throws, done by the &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; player. The inactive players can place fix bets (of 100) before each dice throw and all winning amounts are to be paid by the active player!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice throws are done by using the following procedure: the dice with the color showing on the color-die is placed on the paying board and it's number is added to the numbers of the dice already there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the active player goes on throwing the remaining dice, the other players can retire and let them give the won amount from the active player. Fortunately, the active has also a winning option: when the color-die shows a color of a die already on the paying board, his turn end immediately and he collects all bets from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
