			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every player character's life, the day arrives when it has to face a horde of beings that will trample it... either at a sporting event just as the home team has list 476 to 0, or the Teleport spell goes sour and deposits the character in front of a herd of stampeding wildebeests, or the other characters in the party rout at the sight of a hideous monster. Such a situation presents a lot of  trouble for the player character, but it poses even more problems to the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the best way to handle the trampling of a player character in a NUELOW game? As we asked this question, different game solutions came to mind. Among them was The Dramatist Approach in which the GM would say, &amp;quot;Yes, you ARE completely annihilated by the horde of reporters and NO, I do _not_ have to roll dice to determine this&amp;quot;; and The Chartmaster Approach in which the GM would say, &amp;quot;Wait, 2^m beings trying to trample your character. Give me a roll on table TT-241, adjusted by -2.3 for dark conditions, multiplied by (m-2)^2 and adjusted for your encumbrance, their encumbrance, the weather conditions, blah blah blah....&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since none of the approaches that we might steal were well suited for the NUELOW game, the idea to create a new rule was born. (As NUELOW players know, the Design Team is loathe to create new rules; we prefer to cut-and-paste from previous NUELOW gamebooks.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published as text in 1994; shortly thereafter published as HTML; published in 2008 as PDF (possibly by a third party).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
