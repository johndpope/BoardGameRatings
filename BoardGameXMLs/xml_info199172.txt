			<description>The game is a deck of cards, each with an adjective and three questions related to that adjective. The instructions include i) a Headbanz-style game in which a player tries to guess the word that is pasted to his forehead as the other players act it out, ii) an Apples to Apples-style game in which a player guesses which of the other players played which adjectives that describe him, and iii) a Balderdash-style game in which the guesser guesses which players wrote which answers to one of the questions on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
