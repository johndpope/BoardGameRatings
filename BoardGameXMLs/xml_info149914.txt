			<description>from the scenario introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in the Eye of All Seeing Wonder #6, this version has been slightly modified to improve internal consistency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Notes for the Referee:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for conventions, using the Gardásiyal rules, where it can introduce new players to Tékumel. It is set in Jak&amp;aacute;lla in late 2365, about a year after Dhich'une's acension to the Petal Throne, with all PCs members of the Clan of the White Crystal, an old and respected high status clan. The most common occupations for this clan are medium-level priests and bureaucrats. The scenario calls for two players who are experienced Tékumel hands, each assigned a so-called 'senior PC' character. These senior PCs are designed to be subtly opposed to one another during the game, and each has a secret to keep. Neither is intended to actually engage in heroics (In fact, one of them has no combat or sorcery skills): their role instead is to serve as sources of information for the other PCs, and to help move the plot along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
