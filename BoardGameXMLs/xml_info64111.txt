							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cavernous Lake Set</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set comes on the heels of the Cavernous Rivers and Walls, and the pieces from the two sets have been designed to work extremely well together. In fact, the walls from the Cavernous River and Walls Set line up well with the shoreline of the Cavernous Lake Set allowing created bodies of water to lap against the walls of your cavern creation. However, the Cavernous Lake Set can stand freely on its own by allowing collectors to assemble underground lakes inside their cavern layouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all DF products this set comes expertly hand-painted with felt bottoms, and it is completely enclosed in a sturdy container for years of transporting. The pieces themselves are made out of rock-hard polyresin and the paint used bonds extremely well to the surface of the pieces. As a result, these collector items are heirlooms that can be passed down to future generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set consists of the following pieces:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;x3 Cavernous Lake Corner 1&lt;br/&gt;x1 Cavernous Lake Corner 2&lt;br/&gt;x3 Cavernous Lake Straight Bank 1 &lt;br/&gt;x1 Cavernous Lake Straight Bank 2&lt;br/&gt;x1 Cavernous Lake to River Conversion (Right)&lt;br/&gt;x1 Cavernous Lake to River Conversion (Left) &lt;br/&gt;x1 Cavernous Lake to River Conversion (Middle)&lt;br/&gt;x1 Cavernous Lake Open Water&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
