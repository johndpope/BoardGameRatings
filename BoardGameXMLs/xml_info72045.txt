							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkstone</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Darkstone is an action role-playing game created by French developer Delphine Software International and released in 1999. Darkstone has many similarities to Diablo, particularly in the user interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game world is divided into the town (where you can trade weapons, armor, magical items and so on) and five Lands - Ardyl, Terrnya, Marghor, Omar and Serkesh. Each land contains the entrances to two dungeons, as well as other features associated with the various quests. Each of the first seven dungeons is associated with a quest and all of these have four levels. Completing a quest will result in your character recovering one of the seven crystals. The last dungeon leads to Draak's lair.&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons contain many corridors and rooms. There are also many crates, vases and chests that can be opened or broken to reveal useful items. Wells abound, where characters can restore health or mana.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Darkstone,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
