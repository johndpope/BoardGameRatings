							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sundered Land</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's web page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sundered Land is a series of 5 single-page games plus 2 supplements set in the Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery ruins of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Doomed Pilgrim is designed for online play. You play the pilgrim, and your friends on the internet try to see you to your doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other four games are designed for face to face play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Caravan Guards, you&amp;rsquo;re guarding a caravan on the Burnt Road, and the Hazard player creates monsters and other dangers to try to destroy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Night Watch, you&amp;rsquo;re passing the night by telling your comrades stories from your past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In At Ends, you&amp;rsquo;re down to your ambition and your wits, trying to make your way on the streets of a city of intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Warriors, you&amp;rsquo;re meeting your enemies in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two supplements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Restless Ambition adapts Caravan Guards to three different circumstances: a necromancer trying to summon, enslave, or defeat a powerful ghost; a lover trying to keep a forbidden tryst; and one wronged seeking redress or revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplaying in the Ruins of the Future recommends stringing the games together, cultivating the skills of play, and creating new Sundered Land games of your own. It also includes a ludography and thanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games are mutually compatible and overlapping, but self-contained. Each game plays in 20-60 minutes. You can play them in whatever order you like. You can bring the character from one game into the next, or create a new character whenever you like. Each of the games has a GM, but you should take turns from game to game to game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can see A Doomed Pilgrim in action here: The Sundered Land: A Doomed Pilgrim in the Ruins of the Future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
