			<description>Trenches is a fast-paced card game for two players, set in the trenches of late WWI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will fight off for the best of 3 conflicts in order to win the campaign. Each conflict is decided using victory points, that are awarded by breaking a stand-still between two sides of trenched foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each conflict represents a battle to hold 5 different objectives. To win the objectives, each player drafts a hand of 6 cards that will be played by turn (face down) on a chosen objective, until all players pass or finish their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the players reveal the cards and start activating the special actions, in ascending order. Each side tallies the objectives they have obtained to determine if they broke the tie and won the conflict!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a unique intense experience of drafting, deploying, deceiving and triumph!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
