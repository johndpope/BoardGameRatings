			<description>When your two choices are make laws, or go to prison, you&amp;rsquo;ll scrape the bottom of the barrel to stay free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACHTUNG! is an abstract strategy game about creating a multitude of pointless laws and annoying rules for everyone in the game to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players draw and play cards, the number of laws continues to build until it becomes impossible for the average player to follow them all. When a player breaks a law, and someone else notices, they get called out by having ACHTUNG! shouted at them, and they must discard from their hand of cards. Once a player loses all of their cards, they&amp;rsquo;re put in the gulag and must catch someone else breaking a law to re-enter the game. The game is over when a lone lawmaker remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is separated into 5 distinct card types: Global Laws that everyone at the table must follow, Directed Laws that only effect a single player, Amendments that modify the text of cards already on the table, Filibusters that interrupt the main-game for a chance to win valuable cards, and Abolish cards that remove other cards from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACHTUNG! is currently in its second edition. The second edition contains updates to the first edition rules and cards, such as allowing players to place markers on law cards to point out individual laws to play. Adjustments have also made to the Filibuster cards in the second edition to speed up gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
