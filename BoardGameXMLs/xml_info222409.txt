							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kingdom of Richard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Richard is the first in a series of gazetteers fleshing out the Darkfast Dungeons setting. Designed to fit into classic fantasy games, elements of this setting can be used &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo; or bits and pieces can be adapted to fit into on-going campaigns or sandbox games. This book is designed as a stand-alone product and contains stats that can be used for Darkfast Dungeons and Swords and Wizardry: White Box (or any other old school role playing game based on the classic edition.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This gazetteer opens up the Darkfast Dungeon game to more &amp;quot;theatre of the mind&amp;quot; game play, but it will require a GM to referee the game. It's a whole new way to play Darkfast Dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure includes four new character class for Swords and Wizardry: White Box and Darkfast Dungeons and write ups for eight new opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom of Richard helps flesh out this setting that I created as my original D&amp;amp;D campaign back in 1981.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
