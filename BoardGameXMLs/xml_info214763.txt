			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the Blood of My Ancestor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient sorceress Semiramis threatened Stacy Sanders during a fight with several heros. Why was she there? Because her husband is none other than the arachnid-based hero, Recluse, and Semiramis used her against him. What the evil queen did not know, however, is that Stacy is an ancestor of the legendary Crimson Blade (PL 9), warrior of the Goddess Ishtar! During the conflict, Crimson Blade took over Stacy's body and battled Semiramis herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since this encounter, Stacy has studied and researched, seeking a means to tap into the power of her ancestor and gain control of her own destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
