							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Hall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a 48 x 20 inch, Battlemap of a City Hall Lobby , it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;They say you can&amp;rsquo;t fight city hall, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about BLOWING it up! Ah ha ha! When the mayor&amp;rsquo;s speech ends, tick tock stop and then BOOM!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;The Arsenalist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Hall includes a single level interior map of a city hall with a podium and a larger room with 32 chairs set up for an audience for the mayor&amp;rsquo;s speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Hall is intended for use in modern and supers games. It could also see use in horror games where the citizens meet up to discuss strange happenings in the town. Perhaps they even come face to face with the source of those supernatural occurrences as it becomes attracted to a location with so many people in one place. The mayor could also be involved in a cult devoted to the bizarre entity and the mayor&amp;rsquo;s role in the cult is suppression of the cult&amp;rsquo;s activities from public knowledge in the media until the final ritual is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Speech:  The Arsenalist is an insane super villain with a grudge against the mayor of Broadhampton. He has spent hard time in Broadhampton Prison for the crime of blowing open the Broadhampton Bank vault with explosives and was caught trying to escape with the cash from the vault by a superhero after the heist. The Arsenalist is delusional and blames the mayor for not pardoning him for his crime of armed robbery and blames her for all the years spent in prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He has planted a bomb in Broadhampton City Hall with a unique sonic-based trigger mechanism. It will only begin with the mayor&amp;rsquo;s voice being amplified by a microphone. The bomb is rigged to explode if the mayor stops speaking for longer than a minute after activating. The bomb is obvious once triggered, making a &amp;ldquo;tick tock; don&amp;rsquo;t stop&amp;rdquo; recording that repeats on a loop in The Arsenalist&amp;rsquo;s voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arsenalist is on hand outside to prevent any superheroes from interfering with his plan. He is looking for the superhero that caught him and put him in jail, hoping this lure will draw out his true target, who happens to be one of the superhero player characters who rush to the scene to diffuse the bomb!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
