			<description>The He-Man and the Masters of the Universe Spin Action Grayskull Game is a game included on plastic lollipop covers. Each player has a lever-actuated spinner showing various characters from Masters of the Universe. Each character has a point value (positive for good characters, negative for evil characters and higher values for more powerful characters). On his or her turn, a player spins and adds or subtracts the value of the character that appears in the window to his or her total. Each player must continue spinning until a positive value comes up. The first player to reach 10 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
