							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Air-Sea Rescue</name>
									
			<description>This game was published with a license from the RAF benevolent fund and was published during WWII (exact date is unknown). The manual describes some aids used to facilitate pilot rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move a downed pilot up a track. Once the pilot reaches a certain point on the track a spotter plane launches from the other end of the track. The player may only move the pilot or the spotter plane.  Once they meet at a specified point on the board, then a rescue ship is launched from the end of the track and must go meet the pilot at which point they move to the end of the board and rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
