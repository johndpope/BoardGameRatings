							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Lion in the Ropes (Castles and Crusades)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover of the A Lion in the Ropes (d20) entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boots wet from crossing the river, you tramp up onto the remnants of an old Imperial road. A small village lies before you. Its cottages stand arrayed in neat order along either side of the way, muted and dark. The dinner hour is just passed, but no laughter or chatter isturbs the steady drizzle soaking your cloaks. Only the gentle clanking of weapons on armor and the ragged breaths of your band echo in the still quiet. A horror stalks the land, and it is left to you to unravel the mystery that is &amp;quot;A Lion in the Ropes&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lands of Lord Galveston are plagued by murders. Rumors abound that a fiend from the Twilight Wood is responsible. When the deacon of Four Saints Church is found floating in the river, the terrified people under Galveston's protection cry out to him for aid. Brave adventurers are needed to delve into the secrets of th eland, to investigate suspicious monks and aged battle lords, and to combat menacing foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Lion in the Ropes is a mystery. The module is designed for 4-8 characters of levels 2-4. A cleric would be extremely helpful, as would a ranger or some character with rudimentary tracking skills. The adventure occurs in the lands of Lord Galveston, largely within the village of Capendu, and specifically in and around Four Saints Church. It requires some overland travel however, between the other villages and the tower of the aged Lord Galveston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the d20 System / OGL Product (D&amp;D 3.0 Compatible) Item see A Lion in the Ropes (d20).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
