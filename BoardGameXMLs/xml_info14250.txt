							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Susceptibles</name>
									
			<description>The game is played on grid in the shape of an X or a cross. The object is to get your leader to the goal on the opposite side of the board. The players choose the red or yellow pieces. Each player starts with a set of ten pieces: one Leader (a larger disc), four Companions and five Aids. There are also six additional Companions of each color and eight white Susceptibles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Susceptibles are stationary pieces that start on designated spaces. A Susceptible may be captured, at which time it becomes an additional Companion piece for the capturing player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, all pieces except for Leaders are subject to being captured by moving onto the square the piece occupies. Leaders and Aids move only one space at a time, while Companions move any distance over unoccupied squares. Leader pieces may not capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
