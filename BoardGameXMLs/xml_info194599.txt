							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Urban Riot (System Neutral Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riots provide almost limitless opportunities for adventure. However, few adventures feature riots because they are problematic to flesh out. Designing all the rioters and the many minor events the PCs witness would take more time to prepare than even the most diligent GM has at his disposal. That&amp;rsquo;s where Campaign Events: Urban Riot comes in. Presenting copious notes on the rioters themselves as well as minor events and dressing along with hooks, opportunities and complications it takes the hassle out of running an urban riot and lets the GM concentrate on the important details of the campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
