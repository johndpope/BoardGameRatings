			<description>Square Play is an abstract strategy game played on a board of inset squares.  Each player takes turns placing one of seven tokens in the hope of creating a square with four tokens.  If they fail in that effort, players take turns moving a token to create either a square with four tokens or a straight line with three, whereupon they can remove an opponent's token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until either a square is formed or until a player is eliminated due to having only 2 tokens left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
