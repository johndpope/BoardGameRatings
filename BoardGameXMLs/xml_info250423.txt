							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Straight to VHS Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A werewolf stalks the streets...but not for much longer, not if former prostitute turned nun Gloria Vendetta has anything to say about it. Never mind her cybernetically enhanced buddy in the precinct who suspects the werewolf is being protected by Yakuza. If only former heavyweight champion Tucker Smash could regain his memories. He was the only one who knew the antidote to lycanism, and now the plague is spreading...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends can now indulge in your own asinine bitchin&amp;rsquo; story with Straight to VHS, an easy-to-learn and fast-paced tabletop RPG inspired by bad movies. You&amp;rsquo;ll create a character by mixing and matching tropes and perks inspired by countless awful movies. Do you wanna be a voodoo master with bionic legs, or maybe a streetwise preacher? Straight to VHS will let you! The Director (or &amp;ldquo;game master&amp;rdquo;) will narrate the action and provide challenges and something resembling a plot for the characters to smash and seduce their way through. Players also get opportunities to tweak the Director&amp;rsquo;s script for their gain and amusement. Straight to VHS is a work in progress, but is already sure-fire fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
