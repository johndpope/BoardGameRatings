			<description>Just as the Kinderspiel des Jahres-winning title Wer war's? was subsequently recreated as a portable non-electronic game, the Wer war's? follow-up Wer war's? L&amp;ouml;st das R&amp;auml;tsel von Schr&amp;auml;ghausen! now has a portable version of its own: Wer war's? Das 2. Abenteuer - Mitbringspiel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, a goblin has cast a spell on all the children in town, locking them in their houses and &amp;ndash; more importantly for the game &amp;ndash; making them forget who owns the dog Bronco. Your goal is to find out which child owns Bronco so that the pooch can go home, get something to eat, and perhaps even wrangle a bit a ear-scritchin' from his young owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the town, lay out ten houses in a four-row grid, with intersection tiles placed between the houses. Shuffle the children tokens, then set one aside and place one next to each house. Shuffle the ten keys face-down, and place one on each house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you first roll the die, which allows a peek at a key or a free move of Bronco to any house, or forces the clock to advance an hour or the intersections next to Bronco to rotate, possibly cutting off access to nearby houses. The player then moves Bronco to an adjacent house, if desired, then reveals any key on the board. If that key matches the house where Bronco is currently located, that child is freed and the number of suspects as to who owns Bronco drops by one; if the key doesn't match, return it face-down to its previous location and advance the clock by one hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends one of two ways: Either the players free all of the children and therefore deduce which child remains as the owner of Bronco, or the clock hits 12; in this latter situation, the children can make one guess as to who owns Bronco, then reveal the hidden child. If correct, they win! If not, Bronco heads to the pound to live out the rest of his life filled with sorrow and self-loathing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Wer war's? Löst das Rätsel von Schräghausen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
