			<description>The game features a path through a landscape, with small circular pictures showing a wood, a river and other features. The first circle, called the Horn Book, reflects one of the teaching methods of the time. Players must stop here to learn the letters of the alphabet. There are various forfeits and rewards along the way. These include punishments for boasting, wasting time and pride, and rewards for repentance, patience and diligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are to be provided with a Teetotum having 8 sides, marked 1 to 8, and each player with a traveller (marker) and 8 counters of which 4 are to be put into the Pool. The highest spinner begins and to proceed regularly to the right hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
