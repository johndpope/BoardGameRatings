			<description>&amp;quot;Hammer of the Gods is a 1994 turn-based strategy  computer game developed by Holistic Design and published by New World Computing for MS-DOS. The events of the game take place in viking age Europe, with a Norse fantasy setting. Hammer of the Gods is one of the games that spawned the creation of the Heroes of Might and Magic strategy series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hammer of the Gods is an empire-building game with a focus on military strategy. The goal of the game is to build an empire through expansionism while completing a set of goals that are specified by the gods of Norse mythology. The game is won when a player completes the quest of Odin, the highest god in the Norse pantheon. Upon starting the game, each player chooses to control one of four races: human, elf, troll, or dwarf. Each race has unique characteristics for military units, and each is presented with a different hierarchy of gods which set different goals to meet. When the player meets each of these goals, the gods will present the player with a reward at the end of that turn. These rewards vary in nature, and can include powerful military units, magical flying ships for fast transportation, or higher income from conquered towns, to name a few examples.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hammer of the Gods&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
