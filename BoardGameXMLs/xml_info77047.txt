							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellcasting 201 - The Sorcerers Appliance</name>
									
			<description>Following the events of Spellcasting 101: Sorcerers Get All The Girls, we find young Ernie Eaglebeak as a sorcerer's apprentice - which however quickly turns out to be a training simulation which our protagonist was taking part in during his first sophomore days at the Sorcerer University. Things have changed at the university since last year: the campus is being extended, Ernie's advisor Otto Tickingclock is now the university's president and Ernie himself has decided to pledge fraternity. Having settled on Hu Delta Phart, he begins participating in hazing rituals that are to prove him worthy of becoming a member, and quickly finds out that Chris Cowpatty, the Pledgemaster, dislikes him a lot and the tasks he gets assigned are much more difficult than those of other candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellcasting_201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellcasting_201&lt;/a&gt;:_The_Sorcerer%27s_Appliance,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
