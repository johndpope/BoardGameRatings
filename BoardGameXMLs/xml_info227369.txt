							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Media Game</name>
									
			<description>The Media Game was inspired by Careers and was designed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as a teaching tool for their National Spot Sales department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to earn the greatest number of Market Share Units and Media Efficiency Units by going through various &amp;quot;clients&amp;quot;.  At the end of the game the player who has the greatest number of Units and Profits will be the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board by the value of one of two dice (player's choice). Depending on which square they land on, they will either receive 'credits' or 'penalties'. There are three types of &amp;quot;units&amp;quot; a player can gain points in and a player scores their lowest of these three, so they must try to maximize each unit type equally in order to win. Random effects through the drawing of event cards will also occur. While each player has little control over which credits and penalties they receive in the game, the overall purpose of The Media Game is educational. It was designed for employees of the CBC Sales department as a way to make them familiar with company terminology, policies, and marketing strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
