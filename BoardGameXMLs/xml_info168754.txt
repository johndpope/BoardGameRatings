							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lone Wolf: The Battle for Magnamund</name>
									
			<description>Greywood Publishing have teamed up with Gary Chalk, the original artist for the first 8 Lone Wolf books, to bring you Lone Wolf: The Battle for Magnamund.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Lone Wolf, the last of the Kai Lords. Or perhaps you are Prince Pelathar, heir to the throne of Sommerlund. Or maybe you are the infamous Giak warrior Kootak, sent by the Darklords to raze the land. Now you can be all of these... in a hand-painted (by Gary) tabletop wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle for Magnamund is a fantasy wargame for two or more players. Each battle pits good against evil, and players may control either an entire army or a single brigade on one side at a time.  The goal is to allow you to re-create any battle or scenario from the classic Lone Wolf books, and the game comes with pre-made scenarios to start you on your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core game set consists of flat cardboard figures (3 mm thick and die-cut) in a plastic base, played on card maps that are grid-based and modular.  The maps are the same material as in Cry Havoc, a previous (and popular) game of Gary's. In addition to being fun, Battle for Magnamund is a showcase for Gary Chalk's inimitable 2-D artwork: all components are illustrated by hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
