							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Navron&#039;s Sinister Stair</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old-timers still speak of Narvon the Charmer, albeit in hushed tones, as if the long-dead cleric might hear his name as an invitation of some sort. This is, of course, absurd, but also gives eloquent testimony to how feared Narvon was in life. Long ago, Narvon established a strange cult in chambers carved within stony Stolkoya. For a time, the cult flourished, but after only a year, during a night full of strange lights and bizarre lightning, the cult came to its end. Intrepid investigators found almost all of the cult's members atop Stolkoya, mutilated and charred. The few survivors proved irrevocably mad, gibbering about &amp;ldquo;frogs from the sky&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;wings that never flap&amp;rdquo;. As for Narvon, all that remained was his head affixed to a spike. Investigators reported that Narvon's face in death bore an expression of purest joy. Since then, no one has dared climb Narvon's Sinister Stair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
