			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Duchy of Urnst Regional Interactive Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumors are running rampant &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s been several months now and even Lady Annora can&amp;rsquo;t hide the fact that Duke Karll has gone missing. He&amp;rsquo;s never been gone for more than a few days without letting her know where he&amp;rsquo;s been going and keeping in touch, so what could have happened to Duke Karll that&amp;rsquo;s kept him away? Despite his absence (or perhaps in direct relation to it), the politics in the Honorable Chamber grind onwards &amp;ndash; what would happen if Duke Karll never returned? There are several pressing issues that need the seal of the Duke... A special session of the Honorable Chamber was called and word is trickling out that they convened to discuss who to appoint... but the vote was inconclusive. What influence can you have on coming events and can you prevent the Duchy from descending into confusion and civil war? A one round Duchy of Urnst Interactive for APLs 2-16.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
