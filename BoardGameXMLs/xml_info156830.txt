			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventuring characters do an awful lot of traveling. Adventures take them far and wide across the kingdoms, forcing them to go from town to village to city. Along the way the solve problems, or sometimes make new ones. They get involved in doing various heroic (or dastardly) things. As characters near a settlement, there is a certain expectation on the part of the player: what kind of trouble will we get ourselves into here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a while, even good GMs tire of coming up with something interesting to do in every single place the players want to water their horses or have a meal and rest. Towns then end up all looking and feeling the same&amp;hellip; an inn to sleep in, and here&amp;rsquo;s the equipment section of the core rulebook to buy stuff. This isn&amp;rsquo;t fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s something we all find ourselves doing eventually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book consists of a table designed to help take some of the burden off the GM&amp;rsquo;s shoulders. As the players approach a town, village, or city - roll on this table to see what interesting is going to happen to them when they get inside. Sometimes this will result in a complete side plot mini-adventure&amp;hellip; filling the entire game session with something you didn&amp;rsquo;t plan. Sometimes it just results in some fun role-playing opportunities. Whatever happens, it&amp;rsquo;ll be fun and memorable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
