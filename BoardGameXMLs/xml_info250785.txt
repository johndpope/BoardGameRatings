			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hold in your hands the ultimate resource: the guide to Advanced Dimensional Green Ninja Educational Preparatory Super Elementary Fortress 555, the best cartoon series that never was. Between these two gloriously colorful covers, every piece of information that fans of the show could gather together has been collated, codified, cross-referenced, and other verbs starting with the letter C. Every character, every location, and every hilarious joke and sight gag ever shown in the series is described so that you can remember the amazement and joy the show brought to you is presented in such detail, you'd think we somehow managed to get ahold of the Writers! (Of course, we all know this is untrue, as the Writers have not been heard from for diggety-six years, after absconding with all of the original recordings of the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are picking up this book, then you are interested in playing the Advanced Dimensional Green Ninja Education Preparatory Super Elementary Fortress 555, the game based upon the TV show of the same name, the most popular television show of all time. No matter how old you are - whether you are just out of diapers or just ready to get back into them again - the shows three seasons were on, brand new, and amazing. You would wake up every Saturday morning, put on your feetsie pajamas and grab a big bowl of Hyper Sugar Covered Frosted Chocolate Bacon Honey Syrup O's (now with Marshmallows!) and sit a foot away from the TV (since sitting close to the TV makes you feel like you are really there) and watch with excitement as the antics of your favorite characters played out on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br/&gt;Most of the previous paragraphs, and indeed, most of this book are utter lies, fabricated history and complete shenaniganry, wrapped up and presented as the Sky Cow's honest truth. There was never a television show called Advanced Dimensional Green Ninja Educational Preparatory Super Elementary Fortress 555. But there should have been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADGNEPSEF555 is a game for all of us who spent way too much time devouring media of a more youthful bent. In these pages you will find cowboys, robot girls, giant mecha, time travelers, the world's best go kart racer and, yes, even a ninja. We took some of the most iconic tropes we could find, turn them all into elementary school children, gave them phenomenal cosmic power, ore than the legal limit of sugar, shook them all up and said, &amp;quot;Go do something.&amp;quot; If this sounds like a good role playing experience to you, well, then join the crowd and come on in, we have candy, and tasty beverages (they are bitter almond flavor).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
