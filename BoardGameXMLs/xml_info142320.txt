							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Visiting Birds&#039; Nests Without Robbing Them</name>
									
			<description>Game published in the Odhams Press book, The Children's Book of Games, Puzzles and Pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will require a pack of ordinary playing cards for this game. Divide them into two separate packs, placing the Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, tens and nines into one pile and all the twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, sevens and eights into another. Put them side by side face downwards on the table&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a card from each pack, turns them over and compares them with the pictures on this double page, where are depicted ten different birds with the number of their eggs and the value of the card. For example, if you draw an ace (Kestrel) you must return all the eggs you have collected except those of the Owl, Moorhen and Kestrel. If you draw a two (Rat), it steals any one egg and you must keep this card until you draw a Queen (Owl), in the meantime drawing one card only from the pack containing the picture cards. If you draw ^ King (Moorhen) you retain her egg but miss a round.&lt;br/&gt;Each player keeps an account of tiie number of eggs he has collected during the game, and at the end of the round subtracts his losses from the total. The cards are then returned to the bottom of their respective packs and shuffled for the next round. Play six rounds and then again add up your total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect ten different eggs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find there are less cards in the picture pack and the round finishes after these have all been drawn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
