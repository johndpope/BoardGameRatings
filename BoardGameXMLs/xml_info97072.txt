			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure, designed for 4-6 characters of 5th through 7th level, is the first (of three) created for the 2009 Tournament of&lt;br/&gt;Champions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parties of adventurers are discreetly hired by a trading company to investigate rumors that children all across the realm are being kidnapped for a nefarious purpose. While investigating the matter, the adventurers discover that troupes of children are being recruited in the cities and led out to an unknown location. Heading off into the wilderness, the parties find an ancient holy site that is swarming with children. Sneaking into the site, the adventurers discover that the throngs of ardent worshipers are being misled for&lt;br/&gt;some evil reason and they set out to foil the Drow who seem to be behind the effort. Racing into the heart of the complex, the&lt;br/&gt;adventurers undercover a double-cross and must quickly react to save the lives of the worshipers and multitudes of innocents across the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure, the party is being recruited to try and track down who has been kidnapping the cities&amp;rsquo; children. Following their only lead, the party breaks into the local Thieves Guild. After working their way into the sewers, the party finds one party of children, but is too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
