							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Agency: Men in Black Dusters</name>
									
			<description>[Back cover]&lt;br/&gt;Above the Law...&lt;br/&gt;The Special Services Agency is the shadowy arm of the Union government dedicated to opposing an unseen foe.  Most folks think it has to do with those upstart Confederates... but they're wrong.  Sometimes dead wrong, in fact.&lt;br/&gt;Outside the walls of the Castle, nobody's really sure what they're up to.  If you listen to some cowpokes, even some of those inside the walls don't know the real truth.  But one thing's for certain - when the black dusters of the Agency show up in a town, you'd better head for cover!&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, you'll find all the secrets the Agency doesn't want you to know.  Of course, be warned, after you take a look at them, you're liable to sign up for a black duster yourself!  Either that, or you may just disappear...&lt;br/&gt;In addition to two Agency training manuals, you get a complete list of special equipment designed by the Agency's researchers to give operatives an edge in their battles.  In short, everything you need to know to complete an assignment and advance your spook through the ranks of the organization is in this book.&lt;br/&gt;Just one question before we proceed: Are you cleared for this, pardner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
