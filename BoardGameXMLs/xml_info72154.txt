							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sneaky Space Spinners</name>
									
			<description>Humanity has made the jump to the stars only to find that they are not alone.  We are threatened by pirates, aliens and danger at every turn.  Our only hope is to send 2-4 intrepid heroes into the unknown to find new technology that might turn the tide in earth's favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of Earth's last hope, charting the galaxy, discovering new worlds and making a profit on the side. Keep an eye out for the four mysterious alien races: The Heartiols, The Diamondias, The Clubstations and The Spadoo. These fantastic beings have harnessed the power to 'spin' their region of space and will impart that power to you, for a price.  With this power, the Human race can effectively turn away any invader that might threaten the Earth.  Only a hero with all four space spinning artifacts can save us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable with 4 space tiles, player ship tracking boards some tokens and a deck of standard playing cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
