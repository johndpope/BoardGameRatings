			<description>&amp;quot;Bumpers are for bumping.&amp;quot; - Dale Earnhardt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trading Paint is a one lap car race on an oval track. Like Pass The Pigs or Cosmic Wimp-Out, Trading Paint is a Press-Your-Luck game. To move your race car along the track you may roll the dice as many times as you wish. But if you roll the X you spin out, losing your progress for that round, and your turn is over. Unlike other press-your-luck games, Trading Paint features interaction with your fellow racers, bumping competitors and sling-shotting around your team mates. Thus there is strategy involved in your decision to either keep rolling or to pass the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
