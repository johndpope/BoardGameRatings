			<description>Shut the Front Door is a simultaneously turned, fast paced matching game about childish insults. The deck contains 50 cards each with 6 childish insults and one compliment on them. There are 30 different insults spread among the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules contain several variants but the main mechanic of each is to find matching words between cards, shout it out (Cootiehead!) and discard or add the cards to another pile faster than the other players. Variant rules include relay races, shouting out only the compliments, penalties for making mistakes and even drinking games for adult players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other decks in the series, available separately, share the same rules but have words with different themes such as Sci-Fi or Shakespearean insults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
