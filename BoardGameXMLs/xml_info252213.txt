							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ultimate Adventures of The ULTIMATE ALLIANCE</name>
									
			<description>THE CITY IS UNDER ATTACK! Super Villains, space aliens, killer robots and more. The Ultimate Alliance must spring in to action. Unfortunately, they don't have the best organizational skills and a lot of random junk is mixed in with their super hero gear. But there's no time to make excuses or search for the perfect gear. All they can do is use the first thing they grab to save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultimate Adventures of The ULTIMATE ALLIANCE, is a fun, semi-co-operative card game for 3+ players. Where each player takes on the role of a Super Hero in an attempt to save the town from the latest threat. Each round the &amp;quot;Mayor&amp;quot; or judge creates a villain by drawing a Villain card, and then powers them up with 2 &amp;quot;Bad-er&amp;quot; cards (enhancement cards that make the bad guy bad-er), and a location card to set the scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then each receive a gear card, some helpful some not, and must come up with a plan to defeat the villain. Each player then pitches their idea to the Mayor, who picks which hero to hire based off of their plans. The winning hero receives points based off of the threat level of the Bad-er cards (1-3). Heroes also have the option of teaming up with other players and their gear to win and split the points, or push their luck and go solo and claim them all for themselves. The Mayor role then rotates each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at a preset point limit, decided before the game starts. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based off of the characters and world of The ULTIMATE ALLIANCE comic books by JH Comics. The game doesn't require any knowledge of the characters to play, but will provide some recognizable gear, bad guys and locations to fans of the comic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
