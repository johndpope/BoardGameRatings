			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The waters of Malgrave Island are legendary. The locals believe that soaking in the island's baths will melt years from an aging body. This legend grew as tourists began flocking to the island to see for themselves. One such tourist was Winston Malgrave-a wealthy but sickly industrialist. With his vast wealth, Malgrave became the island's curator, guiding the island through many years of prosperity. But then the island suddenly closed its doors to visitors, and no one has heard from Mr. Malgrave or the island's residents since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it seems that Mr. Malgrave is in need of assistance. He has reached out to you, the master detective of the famed Mystery Case Files Detective Agency. Mr. Malgrave delivered a registered post to you-and to you only. No one else here dared open it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One can only wonder what's inside that package and what Mr. Malgrave needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Navigate the twists and turns of an all-new Mystery Case Files story&lt;br/&gt;     Find clues and solve puzzles as you explore a beautiful 3D world&lt;br/&gt;     All-new co-op feature allows you to team up to solve the mystery&lt;br/&gt;     Challenge friends in three exciting multiplayer modes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
