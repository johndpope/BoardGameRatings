			<description>Board at Sea is a pirate themed strategy game for 2 players that takes about half an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows 2 ships, side by side, and the rope bridges that connect them. Start by standing your stones on your ship so that your opponent can't see what they are. On each turn you'll move a piece and roll dice to resolve attacks. Your crew moves between ships, the cannons fire across the board, and the treasure tries its best to stay hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pirates win by stealing one of the treasure chests and bringing it back to their ship, and the merchants win if they can stop the pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
