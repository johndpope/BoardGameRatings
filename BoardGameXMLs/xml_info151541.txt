			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason they call it a sleepy town. It&amp;rsquo;s because everyone dreams of getting out of town. Well, not everyone. Some people have roots here. Deep roots. And some people... well, they&amp;rsquo;ve spun webs. And those folks, they aren&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the Days of My Children Hospital is a storytelling game for fans of that uniquely American creation: the daytime soap opera. Each player takes the role of two characters--a hero and a villain--and plays out the day-to-day melodrama of living in a town full of secrets. It includes rules for creating heroes, villains and tweeners, using secrets as a mechanic to control other characters' actions. AtDoMCH also includes rules and suggestions for making each session feel like an episode from your favorite soap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
