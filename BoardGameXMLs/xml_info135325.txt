			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Itras by is a surreal role playing game set in a city reminiscent of Europe in the 1920&amp;prime;s. The rule system is card based and focuses heavily on freeform and improvisation. Please also see the reviews section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting&lt;br/&gt;Itras by labels itself a &amp;ldquo;surreal role playing game&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s also been called a retro-surreal urban fable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is a city, reminiscent of Western cities in the 20&amp;rsquo;s and 30&amp;rsquo;s. In the city center, reality is relatively stable, but the further afield you get, the more it deteriorates, mutates, becomes dream-like. In the setting chapter you&amp;rsquo;ll find descriptions of dreams which have become real, mad scientists, an outline of a city strictly divided by class, sea elephants, the Machine God who lurks under the city, a gentleman with a monster in his basement, a description of the structural cancer that haunts some of the city&amp;rsquo;s buildings and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We heartily encourage each group to make Itras by their own by changing, adapting, adding and subtracting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are pulpish elements, horror elements, creepy surreal elements, all together in a strange blend we hope will inspire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System&lt;br/&gt;The system is very simple and described in a few pages. The game pioneered the use of Matthiijs Holter&amp;rsquo;s resolution cards (also featured in Love in the Time of Seid and the Swedish RPG S&amp;auml;gen), and has it&amp;rsquo;s very own Chance Card system. The resolution cards function as a resolution mechanic, and read things like &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;No, and&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Yes, and&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; etc. The results are interpreted by players after the cards have been drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chance Cards can be drawn once per session by each player, and serve to infuse the game with surrealism. Some examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cut Scene: Jump forward three hours. Describe what conditions the characters find themselves in. You&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to describe what has happened in the meantime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nemesis! This card awakens the character&amp;rsquo;s Nemesis. In some way, this arch enemy affects the situation. Exactly how is up to you. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the character have an arch enemy? Well, now she does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in its pockets? The character has something in her pocket which might be useful. What could it be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are interpreted by the player who draws them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is chock full of advice on how to roleplay, be a gamemaster, plan a campaign, make an adventure, play with surrealism and more. I think it&amp;rsquo;s as good as a beginner&amp;rsquo;s game as for more experienced players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
