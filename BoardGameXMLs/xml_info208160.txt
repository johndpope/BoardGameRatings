							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grubboonch!: Hill Giants are Bad Kings</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grubboonch is a stupid gluttounous, foul, demented monster, even by the standards of hill giants. He has taken over a small town, and it is up to the PCs to deal with him somehow, before he finishes all the cows and starts eating people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short adventure for 3-5 PCs level 3-4. It is meant to serve as a companion piece to Storm Kings Thunder. In it, there are opportunities for PCs to interact with a Cloud Giant and a Hill giant, and to participate in their schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is not a dungeon crawl. It is based around the interactions between the PCs, the Giant that threatens the town, the Villagers who fear him and the Con man who tries to manipulate him. It contains detailed background on NPCs and environment in order to support those interactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
