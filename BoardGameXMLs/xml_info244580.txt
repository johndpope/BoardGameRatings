							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Mormon: Mania</name>
									
			<description>This is a Book of Mormon themed game of Nerts. Here is the description from the back of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This fast-paced game combines the concentration of Solitaire with the quickness of Speed - and throws in a Book of Mormon twist. Each player is given one of the decks of 48 cards representing the Nephites, Lamanites, Jaredites, or Mulekites. Players try to be first to rid themselves of their pride piles by building prosperity piles in the middle of the table. The fun rises to a feverish pitch as everyone begins flipping and placing cards at the same time!&lt;br/&gt;The breathless action comes to a screeching halt when the first 'pride-less&amp;quot; person yells out whatever favorite Book of Mormon name was chosen at the beginning of the hand - if they can remember it!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
