			<description>Frigiti is a combination word/dice game in which one player creates a word from the letters she rolls on the dice, then everyone creates a definition for that word. What does &amp;quot;frigiti&amp;quot; mean? That's up to you to decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player receives a sheet of paper on which she will write definitions of created words and vote on which definitions among all the players she thinks are best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a round, the active player rolls all ten dice &amp;ndash; seven of which have consonants on all sides, and three of which have only vowels &amp;ndash; then creates a word by using at least three dice. (This word cannot be real, and if anyone claims it is, reroll the dice and try again.) Each player writes a definition for this new word, then places her sheet of paper in the center of the table. The active player shuffles these papers, then hands one to each person; the active player then reads off the definition, followed by the other players in clockwise order. A player might end up reading her own definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a reminder of the definitions, each player then gives a short keyword or key phrase for the definition she read. Players will then each distribute three tokens to the answers they thought best, with one of those tokens going to the player's own answer. (This self-congratulatory vote aids in the scorekeeping process.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each person has been the active player once, the game ends and the player with the most tokens is crowned Queen Frigiti!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
