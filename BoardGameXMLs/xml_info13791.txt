							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cowboy Roundup</name>
									
			<description>In this game players try to roundup the most cattle. You start on your Ranch space and use a spinner to advance along the track. If you land on a space with a Cattle Piece, you place it on your Ranch space. At the halfway point you must decide whether to go to the Corral or the Brush (you can't do both). You receive 6 head of cattle for visiting the Corral, but you must land on it by exact spin (thus slowing you down). The Brush need not be landed on by exact count. You then turn and race back to your Ranch, and the player who reaches it first receives a 4-cattle bonus. The player with the most cattle at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
