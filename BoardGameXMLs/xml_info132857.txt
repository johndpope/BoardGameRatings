			<description>Nakano Koichi Kanshuu: Keirin-Ou (中野 浩一監修 競輪王 Keirin King supervision Nakano Hirokazu) is a cycling video game that allows the player to control the daily life of a professional cycling athlete.  As the title says, it is supervised by Koichi Nakano, a former professional racing cyclist and ten-time world champion track racing cyclist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The player must make daily life decisions while training for the next event. The game starts on April 1, 1994 with a 20-year-old rider. However, he will advance in years as the player progresses in his career and partakes in the events of the cycling season. Players can earn up to 1,000,000,000 yen ($11,068,367.11 in American dollars) and give their rider a name in either hiragana or katakana.&lt;br/&gt;In the actual competition, the player must watch himself try to beat eight other cyclists for the race win. Nine cyclists race against each other in a velodrome and they compete for money and a championship. It is unknown whether the game makes the player retire at 45 years of age like in most modern titles or not. Riders are not always traveling at full speed or at a specific radius; making a balance between aggressive riding and passive riding a must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nakano Koichi Kanshuu: Keirin-ō&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
