			<description>Bring Home Your Bundle of Love!  Enjoy the fun and excitement of having your own 4-legged best friend! Give them tons of love as you train them to be your best friend for life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Choose your best from 8 of the most popular breeds: Husky, Retriever, Dalmatian, German Shepherd, Siamese, Tabby, Maine Coon and British Blue.&lt;br/&gt;     Give your puppy a bath, pet your kitty or take your animal friends for a walk as you monitor their health, cleanliness, and mood.&lt;br/&gt;     Feed, groom, cuddle, and play with your frisky little furball in the house or outside.&lt;br/&gt;     Sit! Stay! Shake! As you teach your puppy commands, he will start competing in obedience and agility competitions and shows.&lt;br/&gt;     Play exciting mini-games such as Frisbee, hunt for the hidden toy and fetch.&lt;br/&gt;     Teach your dog new tricks - ask, speak, fetch, jump, roll over and many more!&lt;br/&gt;     Scrub-a-dub-dub! Wash, rinse and brush your pet to keep his coat shining and in tip-top health.&lt;br/&gt;     Enjoy tons of fun outdoor activities such as Tug-o-war, jumping, fetch, dress up, farm walk, lake walk and many more!&lt;br/&gt;     Boost your bond with your best friend by petting, loving and walking them - but be careful not to spoil them as they can be harder to train.&lt;br/&gt;     Give your dog a bone - or your cat a fish! Your animal friends need rewards to help the process as you teach them tricks.&lt;br/&gt;     Collect 4 maps throughout your walk in the woods to unlock other walking paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
