			<description>The funny games of the Badgers is played two different ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come Let Us Build A Cave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players try to build a cave together. If they manage to surround themselves on all sides with bushes, they have won. If the Frechdachs, however, takes 11 shrub game pieces during the game - the badgers cannot build a cave any more - so he is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Search For The Pine Cones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And again the game begins against the Frechdachs. But this time, every badger has to play for himself and try to collect as many pine cones as possible. Whoever has found most pine cones is the winner. You only know this when all the pieces are taken out of the game, and the number of the depicted pine cones is counted on the flipped side. Did you win now? Or was it the Frechdachs again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
