							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fast 111&#039;s Card Game</name>
									
			<description>It's a fast-paced race through the U.S.A. along a route that you create. Lay out the license plate cards of the states you will pass through...choose your Fast 111's racer cards...and the competition is on! Try to leave your opponents &amp;quot;in the dust&amp;quot; while you build up your own speed. Hit the maximum and you're on to the next state. The speed and excitement of car-racing...all in a card game. The first one to complete the route wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card game version of the board game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
