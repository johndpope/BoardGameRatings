			<description>In the year 2093, humanity&amp;rsquo;s hope is dwindling. Some 20 years ago, a neurological mutation broke out, causing uncontrollable rage in every Earth-born child. No real cure was found except for an intervention that pacifies the children, but also makes them cold and lifeless. The pandemic set off a demographic crisis, making the colonization of a new world an urgent necessity. Luckily, an Earth-like exoplanet within an achievable distance from the Solar system had been recently discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pooling volunteers from around the globe, a first-of-a-kind interstellar spacecraft was built and sent to colonize the yet unexplored planet. The gargantuan ship was named Pilgrimage, embodying the hopes of all of the humanity. To everyone&amp;rsquo;s dismay, shortly after a successful arrival, the Pilgrimage went on total radio silence. What caused it remains a mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13 years later, research starship Recovery has arrived on site to investigate the fate of the Pilgrimage. The player takes the role of the space scientist River Elea Catherine Jones, a member of the Recovery&amp;rsquo;s skeleton crew. She is driven above all by a personal goal &amp;ndash; to find her husband Ethan, who occupied a prominent position on the Pilgrimage&amp;rsquo;s scientific crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
