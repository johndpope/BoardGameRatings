			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, witches have been a source of fear and trepidation. Even in this day and age, the imagery of pots of gruel, bony beckoning fingers, and turning princes into toads brings on a chilling feeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, within the pages of Mayfair's Witches Sourcebook the witch is brought to life exhibiting her magical powers. All of the necessary information for including the witch as a new character class are contained within these pages. Each of the eight distinct witchcraft traditions: Classical, Dianic, Golden Dawn (of which the famous occultist Aleister Crowley was a member), Wiccan, Voodoo Animistic, Elemental, and Deryni (based on the series of Katherine Kurtz) is outlined in the book. Each of the witchcraft traditions has its own view of the world and its own respective culture. The book also encompasses new spells, new magic items, a sample witch character, and other must-have game-related information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witches Sourcebook will certainly spark player's imaginations and enhance game play in any fantasy role-playing adventure or campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
