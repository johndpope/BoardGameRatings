							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Thermopylae</name>
									
			<description>Battle of Thermopylae is a joke game published in La Vivandi&amp;egrave;re #4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself... a map with three large hexes, and little path through mountains connecting the two end hexes. There were a handful of real strong looking Greek counters with superb combat factors and a literal horde of Persian counters. I forget how gosh-awful many you could &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; (with room to lay them out) inside a single large hex. But the shtick was while the Persians pounded away at the phalanx, at some point they began making die rolls to see if they are shown the little pass. Once they are shown the pass they come behind and the game if not literally over is pretty much a mop up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
