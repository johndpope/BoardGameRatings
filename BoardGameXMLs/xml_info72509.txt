							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Icebomb Arena</name>
									
			<description>Icebomb Arena is a strategy game of gladiatorial combat in a bomb-laden arena for 4 or more players. Each player is a gladiator in the arena.  Icebomb Arena is played with Icehouse pyramids on a chessboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consists of a planning phase and an action phase.  During the planning phase, players will determine the orientation of pyramids which will determine the actions they can take during the action phase.  During the action phase, each player will take two actions either blocking or moving on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the last player with a gladiator on the board that has health.  The players can lose health through fights with other gladiators and through stepping on squares that have bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
