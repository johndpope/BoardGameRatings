							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">USS John Young</name>
									
			<description>From Amiga Action, Issue 16, January 1991&lt;br/&gt;By the year 1997 the situation of the world has changed dramatically, and mot fir the better of the Euroeans. After the decline of NATO, European power declined as well. In a moce that surprised all the nations of the world, the Arab countries headed by Iran suddenly launched an attack on shipping,m creating an economic brockade, They had build a world wide military navy and used it to dominate the seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With living standards rapidly deteriorating in the countries that could not support themselvesdue to the lack of trading, a decision was made that something had to be done to end this evil reign, The heads of the various nations came together and devised a plan. The U.S.S. John Young, supposedly vrewed by renegade navy personnel would be sent into the confliuct areas, and would hopefully be able to move around without being attacked due to their socalled defecetion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are put in the contorl of John Young as it roams the violent seas of the world. Your objective: To seek and destroy the Arab forces whereever they may be, This is simulated in four different missions. However, it's not just other ships you will be attacking: Oil rigs will be one of your main targets; destroying these helps weakeen the enemy forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also four different map locations that you can choose to do battle in, ranging from the Persian Gulf to the Falkland Islands. Day and night time can also be chosen from, the advantage being that at night you can get closer to the enemy before they see you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
