							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Renegade Nuns on Wheels</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, just when you thought it couldn't get worse, it did!  Macho Women with Guns wasn't tacky enough for you.  You wanted more!  So, in the better interest of mankind and the BTRC coffers, the long -dreaded- awaited vehicle rules are here.  Renegade Nuns on Wheels features lots of new rules, some rehashed old ones, is completely compatible with MWWG, and is just as tasteless and cheap!  It's the tackiest game since they rolled for Christ's clothes!  Sure to be proscribed!  Don't hesitate!  Get your copy before the Inquisition does!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
