			<description>subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;a rules-ultralight roleplaying game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Sapphire is a very simple, quick, and flexible roleplaying game suitable for use in almost any setting, so long as the setting itself is fairly well understood by the GM and players. It is designed for games that don't need a lot of &amp;ldquo;crunch&amp;rdquo; and is particularly well suited to one-shot games and conventions, though it can also be used for longer-term games that don't need more detail and can benefit from flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics include a method for players to buy control of the narrative using points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game's mechanics are similar to RealTime,an earlier game by Frank J. Perricone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
