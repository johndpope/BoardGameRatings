			<description>Loop is a semi-cooperative abstract strategy game for up to six players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play involves laying cards to build colored loops, with longer loops worth more points at the end of the game.  Players accrue victory points for loops of certain colors, so building a red loop, for example, will gain either single, double, or no points for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has their own hidden agenda - even though they will naturally work together to build a loop, each of their six Victory condition cards is different, awarding different multipliers for each color.  Each loop you help to build will gain points for other players too, so some network blocking/redirecting strategy will be needed to make sure you come out on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggestions are included for team play and for family gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
