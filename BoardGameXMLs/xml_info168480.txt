							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lunte: Fire Distinguisher</name>
									
			<description>Lunte: Fire Distinguisher is an additional card for the game Lunte. It is a 10 point fire extinguishing card; the base game only comes with 6, 5 and 4 point extinguishing/defusing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lunte is a fast paced card game, in which players add cards to a burning fuse, until someone detonates a bomb or extinguishes the fire. The aim of the game is to accumulate the highest number of points, by choosing the right moment to detonate or extinguish the burning fuse. Detonated bombs gain the player points, whereas extinguished cards are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lunte: Fire Extinguisher card is a promo card that was  first released at Spiel '14, in Essen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
