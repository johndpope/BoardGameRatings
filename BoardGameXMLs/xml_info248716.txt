Full-color maps (also offered in print-easy black and white) are provided, plus all sites of worthwhile note, such as towns and major adventure sites. Floor plans of castles and other location are also offered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to this detailed write-up, each issue will also focus on other aspects of the game world, its history, important people, the Magi and gaming classes. When you add it all up, these journals take the mundane and make it magical. It is through the journals that the Arcana game world will grow, expand, and become a living place of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of the Journal will cover the following aspects of the game world:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hex 28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shimarth Woods and the Mist Mountains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glimmlor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like this, then check out other great Arcana goodies that Avalon has to offer and have an adventure or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
