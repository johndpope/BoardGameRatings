							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gazette Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The Gazette Board Game was apparently created as a promotional piece for Russell Viers' DIGIVersity.tv, which provides workshops, seminars, and in-house training on page layout and graphic design software for newspapers, print and publishing companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a promotional piece for a graphic design company, it's top-notch. As a board game, it's at about the level of &amp;quot;The Game of Life.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the role of newspaper publishers with the object to be the first publisher to get the paper out without going broke. Players start with $3360, roll the dice, and move their rocket-shaped pawns from the start toward the finish. Along the way, spaces instruct the players to either move ahead a number of spaces, move backward, or collect or pay money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions on spaces are laced with humor. Some examples: &amp;quot;Your favorite typeface is Helvetica. Back 1 space.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Your intern just cut off a finger with an X-acto knife. Back 2 spaces.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Your customer faxed you their camera-ready ad. Back 3 spaces.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Finally sold your old CompuGraphic. Collect $10.&amp;quot; Those with any familiarity with the newspaper business will find these bits amusing. All others will be scratching their heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
