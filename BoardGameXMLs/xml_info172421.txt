							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterball: Team Katanas</name>
									
			<description>During the Third World War, robotic forces first assaulted islands across the world. Usually, they were able to conquer and eliminate their human foes in short order. Not so in Japan. The Japanese military and civilians fought back with intractable resolve, and saved their greatest city: Tokyo. And when the war ended with a human victory, the Japanese people rebuilt more quickly than anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the formation of the United Globe government, and banning of advanced robots, Japan quickly retooled their industrial efforts to genetics. Today, there are hundreds of gene-tech labs in the Tokyo Metrofecture (TMF). But it was the megacorporation Honshu Tek that first engineered the Katanas team genetic template.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tapping into their rich history, Honshu Tek created a team of samurai-themed athletes that quickly became the most popular team in the TMF. Now, with many years of strong performances, the Katanas frequently break into the playoffs and have more than one championship trophy hanging in their dojo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack your opponents, repeatedly. With three skilled butchers, you should concentrate on weakening opposing teams from round one. Get your butchers and slashers into the center so they can use their mobility and power to dominate your opponents. Be sure to set up field coverage with your butchers. Their automatic carve skill can really block off entire slices of the pit. No one wants to run around those guys. After you&amp;rsquo;ve thinned out your opponents, you can have your razor snag the lonely ball and start scoring goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
