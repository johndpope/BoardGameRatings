			<description>When he came to the alphabet, Theuth said: &amp;quot;This art, O king, will make the Egyptians wiser and richer in memory.&amp;quot; This is the myth of the invention of writing according to Plato&amp;rsquo;s Phaidros, which MYTH OF THEUTH takes as base for a playful examination of media theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fantastic game you will move through ancient Athens, collecting different media in order to complete a mission. You will meet famous people who greatly influenced the development of media and cultural theories. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing shows you the limits of the image, Laura Mulvey takes a delightful gaze on your memorizing abilities, and Marshall McLuhan finally gets his well-deserved massage. Across the 12 stations, you will use smartphones, newspapers, stamps, candy, hand, feet, pairs of eyes, and other means to discover the Myth of Theuth. Whoever manages to finish the mission first &amp;ndash; with a combination of strategy, luck, and knowledge &amp;ndash; will be worshiped as a divine medium!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MYTH OF THEUTH is designed as a board game, which will be available in three different versions in English and German:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     PHAEDRUS, free available version to produce at home, needs approx. 5 to 6 hours;&lt;br/&gt;     PLATON, standard version, first edition of 500 pcs.&lt;br/&gt;     THEUTH, exclusive version, higher quality of used materials, additional game material (own game pieces, paper, pencils, newspaper articles, post-it notes, candies, LEGO bricks, blindfold, liqueur, envelopes, stamps), limited edition of 100 pcs., signed by artists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
