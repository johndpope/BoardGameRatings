			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MURDER, MYSTERY, AND HIGH TENSION!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After almost losing his fortune to griters and gangsters, retired professional football player &amp;quot;Shorty&amp;quot; Wilson teamed up with four ex-criminals to bring criminals to justice who were evading the law. As the Black Dwarf, he now wages a tireless battle against all manner of crooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Dwarf presents six hard-hitting tales of the tough-talking, streetwise Black Dwarf and his gangbusting gang. Co-written and drawn by one of the most unique artists from the Golden Age of Comics, Paul Gattuso, these tales are among those that upset Frederick Wertham and his fellow crusaders for comic book righteousness and eventually led to the creation of the Comics Code Authority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the classic comics, The Black Dwarf features an all-new ROLF! battle scenario that pits the Dwarf against his fellow ultra-violent crimefighter Veiled Avenger. It features game statisitcs for both heroes, new and modified traits and combat maneuvers--and some fun optional combat rules by game designer Rob Garrita.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: VERSIONS A and B OF THIS TITLE HAVE THE SAME CONTENT,&lt;br/&gt;EXCEPT FOR DIFFERENT COVERS AND PIN-UP PAGES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
