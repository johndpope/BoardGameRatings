							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boffin</name>
									
			<description>Boffin is a platform game released in 1985 by Addictive Games for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro. The cassette contained two different versions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a freak accident, a scientist (the Boffin) is shrunk to only a few centimetres tall. He must navigate through his laboratory to reach the antidote which will restore him to his normal size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls the Boffin by moving him around the obstacles on the levels. The Boffin can only jump short distances, but he can fall from any height by opening his umbrella to slow his descent to a safe speed. Each level ends when the player touches an owl which is usually located at the bottom of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Boffin(computer game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
