			<description>Rise! The Ballistic Expansion Pack is an expansion to Rise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an expansion available to Kickstarter Backers of Crash Games' November 2011 Kickstarter Campaign for Rise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise! The Ballistic Expansion Pack adds three new types of pieces with a more &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; element to Rise!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anchor Piece- The Anchor Piece is nearly an immovable object. The Anchor Piece doesn't move except when he meets another one of our special pieces which we'll get to in just a minute. The Anchor Piece can wreak quite a bit of havoc when placed near an opponent's freshly laid foundation of one of their towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flash Piece -  The Flash Piece moves in quickly and is gone in a flash! When placed The Flash Piece wipes out everything that is on the six tiles that surround it, except towers. Use The Flash Piece wisely though because no one's workers are safe when The Flash Piece arrives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vortex Piece - The Vortex Piece swallows everything in its path! When placed the Vortex Piece begins its timer and your opponent has four turns to disarm The Vortex Piece. If The Vortex Piece isn't disarmed, on the fifth turn after placement, the Vortex Piece wipes everything from the board from the six tiles surrounding as well as the tile it is placed on. This includes The Anchor Piece, Towers as well as land tiles. To disarm The Vortex Piece a player's opponent must sacrifice five of his workers within four turns of the initial placement of The Vortex Piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
