			<description>The Trumping card game consists of 64 cards, where half of the cards are marked with a +(plus) and the other half with a *(star).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both halves have 8 cards in each of the 4 usual playing card suits, but instead of numbers from 1-8, they have binary numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine, who takes the trick, each played card is added to (if a plus card is played) or multiplied with (if a star card is played) the first played card. The card reaching the highest total wins the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
