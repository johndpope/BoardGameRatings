			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer: Dark Omen is a tactical real-time wargame set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, like its predecessor and prequel Shadow of the Horned Rat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a series of real-time battles (some optional) linked together by a storyline told via cut-scenes and voice-acted dialogs. Between each battle, players can buy reinforcements and new units from the Warhammer universe like swordsmen or archers regiments, but also artillery pieces, steam-powered tanks, wizards, firearms squads...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are fought on a 3D map with 2D pre-rendered sprites and the rules are closely modeled after the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop game, taking into account unit formations, unit stats such as strength or weapon skill, psychological effects such as fear or morale loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The windows version of the game also includes a multiplayer mode, where each of the two players build an army according to a set budget and face each other in battle. Available armies for multiplayer games are Imperial, Orc or Undead forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
