			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rare few people are gifted with a looser connection to the flow of time than most creatures. Some of these time-slipped individuals never consciously realize they are using this gift, instead calling it good luck or excellent innate timing. Others, however, learn how to exploit their nature to speed up, slow down, or repeat short periods of time. In combat, these warriors hone their ability to control time as well as a fighter learns complicated maneuvers or a wizard learns to master arcane spells. To their foes, timebenders appear to move with bursts of speed faster than the eye can follow, strike from multiple places at once, and possess an uncanny ability to evade attacks. Timebenders&amp;rsquo; control over time itself often gives them a swaggering arrogance and a tendency to leap into action without thinking, trusting their extraordinary luck and skills to save them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Timebenders are agile front-line fighters, ducking and weaving in and out of the fray, speeding up time to make several strikes or a clever escape. Timebenders generally find other characters plodding and slow in action as well as thought, but cannot resist the opportunity to display their incredible powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 20-level base class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
