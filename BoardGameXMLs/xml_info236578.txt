			<description>In this new PDF issue of the Dispatches from the Bunker there are four new action-packed scenarios for ASL enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue also includes Tactical Tips: &amp;quot;Defend the Beach!&amp;quot; by Bob Johnson and &amp;quot;How To Kill Tigers (And Any Other AFV) With Your Bare Hands (Or Whatever Else Is Available)&amp;quot; by Carl Nogueira.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are previews of the Bunker Bash, the Albany tourney and a review of the Tussle in the Tundra and the Nor&amp;rsquo;easter along with all the usual features. The scenarios in this issue are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Krinkelterwald: What would be known as The Battle of the Bulge started with a bang in the &amp;lsquo;quiet sector&amp;rsquo; of the unfortunate 99th Infantry Division as the Volksgrenadier-Division 277 attacked. Can the GIs hold back the assault?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Block on the Trail to Hell: With the push east on the East-West Trail by the 3rd Marine Divison, they had to over- come prepared positions along the way. Can they clear the trail of the determined Japanese 6th Infantry defenders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Archery: Reacting to the German invasion of Norway, Operation Archery was put into motion to silence the gun battery on Maaloy Island. Can the British and Norwegian Commandos achieve their objectives?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Verdammten: With the war drawing to a close and the apocalypse being delivered by the 1st Ukrainian Front to the fleeing 9th Army, the situation for both soldiers and civilians trying to escape was desperate. Can they make it out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
