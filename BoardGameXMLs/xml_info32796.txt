			<description>This trivia game is based on a popular radio quiz show from the late fifties, aired on the National Broadcasting Corporation of Iceland. The game comes with ten envelopes (categories) containing 20 questions each, with categories like arithmetic puzzles, literature, who advertises like this?, the bible, old Norse religion and more. Also included is a booklet with the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to play the game, Double or nothing (where you get 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 points if you answer the five questions from chosen categorie correctly, or zero points if you answer incorrectly). Another way is Who knows what? where you mix the questions and you get 2 points for correctly answered questions (1 point if you answer a question someone else failed to answer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
