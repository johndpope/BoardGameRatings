			<description>A double-box with two games. Happy Families was one but the other was a quiz card game, associated with Wilfred Pickles (1900-1978). Pickles was a noted radio performer for 30 years, starting in the 40's. He is pictured on the box.&lt;br/&gt;The game has 29 cards. Each card has questions on them, and a score that can be earned if you answer correctly; 5 points (yellow), 10 points (red) or 20 points (blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
