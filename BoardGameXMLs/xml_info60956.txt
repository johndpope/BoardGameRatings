			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Halloween Misfits &amp;amp; Menaces special product presents a variety of villains with just the right flavor for the holiday. Ranging from the sanity-shattering horrific to the spine-tingling macabre to outright mystifying, the villains found in Misfits &amp;amp; Menaces: Tricks &amp;amp; Treats are ideal for adding a touch of horror or the bizarre to your M&amp;amp;M Superlink game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Armageddon, a long-slumbering automaton from another dimension, just waiting for something to reactivate it and bring about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction. &lt;br/&gt;    Haunting and twisting man&amp;rsquo;s dreams from his nightmare dimension is the Bogeyman, a creature who delights in and feeds on humanity&amp;rsquo;s fears. &lt;br/&gt;    A degenerate cannibal from the bayou, Carrion preys upon his fellow man. Literally. &lt;br/&gt;    Sleeping in death in his sunken city, dread Cthulhu and his cult of deep ones drive mankind insane until the day he awakens to end the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one and only Dracula is looking to carve out a new empire, even if he must uses humanity&amp;rsquo;s own methods against it to do so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Graveside has left his days of having a body of his own well behind him, and so now he must rely upon possessing corpses to get around. &lt;br/&gt;    Having long branched off from mankind&amp;rsquo;s family tree, the grendel stalk their tunnels and underground warrens, stealing people to fill their larders. &lt;br/&gt;    On a quest to free his spirit, the Horseman and his demonic steed stalk the back roads, taking heads and souls alike. &lt;br/&gt;    Possessing no memories or identity of his own, No Man must steal that of others if he is to ever discover who he is. &lt;br/&gt;    Inhabited by one of history&amp;rsquo;s most gruesome and fear-inspiring serial killers, the animated scarecrow that is Pumpkin Jack continues on with the terrifying work he began in life. &lt;br/&gt;    Adventure ideas for each character to make the product&amp;rsquo;s materials easier to incorporate into your game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
