			<description>Young children's memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player lays out six tiles where all the players can see them. Then each tile is covered with a wooden block.&lt;br/&gt;Now, a die with six coloured faces is rolled and the first player announces the tile they think is under the block with the same colour as the die roll. The block is lifted and the tile beneath is checked. If the player was correct, they can continue  with another turn. If the player was wrong, then the turn passes to the next player in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all six tiles have been correctly named, six more tiles are revealed, studied and covered by the blocks again. When all 30 tiles have been collected, the player with the most tiles, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
