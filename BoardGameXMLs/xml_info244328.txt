							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kirby Battle Royale</name>
									
			<description>Kirby is entering a tournament against his toughest rival yet&amp;hellip;himself! 1-4 players can fight in local* or online** battles. Pick from 10+ abilities and 10 battle types to compete in countless matchups. Hoard treasure in Ore Express, knock out opponents in Slam Hockey, shoot missiles at Robo Bonkers, and more! There's a single-player story mode too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you uncover King Dedede's nefarious plan, you'll unlock abilities and battle types in the Cake Royale tournament. In this competition, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn the basics of battle while earning Boost Orbs that power up Kirby, as well as nostalgic headgear to wear in other modes, and even a new playable character. Then dive into battle! 4 players can enjoy battling together via local wireless*, Online Ranked mode, or with Download Play. Compete in 2-on-2 or Free-For-All battles. May the last Kirby standing win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
