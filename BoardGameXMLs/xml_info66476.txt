							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Women&#039;s History Game </name>
									
			<description>The player will be able to match famous women in American History with their historical importance (politics, labor, author, social work, or special interest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the other three players are given decks of equal fact cards. Players choose between blue, green or yellow. As the dealer lays down a face card, the players must lay down the appropriate fact card. Each player must lay down a card whether they are sure of their response or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player lays down a fact card, the dealer notes on a score sheet who won the round. There can be more than one winner for each turn and possibly there may be more than one winner for the game. The first person to lay down a fact card correctly wins that round and gains three points. At games end the total points are added up and the person with the largest score wins. To keep track of who was first, the first person to lay the correct card on top of the face card wins that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;80 cards&lt;br/&gt;- 40 face cards&lt;br/&gt;- 40 fact cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
