			<description>Border Reiver Miniature Wargaming Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for fighting out raids and retribution between rival border clans in sixteenth century Britain. Each player raises an army of between 10 and 30 models: each represents one Reiver and ideally players will have mounted and dismounted versions of each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models are classified according to armour, weapons, and their ability to fight as border raiders. Dice are rolled to resolve combat and morale tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 scenarios are included as are campaign rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although these rules are intended for wargames set in the sixteenth century, they should provide a workable foundation for raiding games set earlier and later in history; they have worked quite well for me with Highwaymen, for a variety of &amp;lsquo;sword and shield&amp;rsquo; skirmishes, and for the medieval border wars between England and Scotland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
