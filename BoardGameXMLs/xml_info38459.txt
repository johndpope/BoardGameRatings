			<description>&amp;quot;Super Juegos&amp;quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Canguro&amp;quot; (Kangaroo) was the game included in issue 1. It was a very straightforward game in which players, who had to provided the counters, tried to align these from the inside to the outside of the circle in the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
