			<description>From cover inlay&lt;br/&gt;You are crusising through space when suddenly your navigator, Marvin, shouts &amp;quot;Holy tea bags! We're entering an asteroid belt!&amp;quot; There is not much you can do except try to dodge them. Marvin suggest, &amp;quot;Hey guys, why don't you shoot them out of your way?&amp;quot; This seems like a great idea but these asteroids split up and become twice as deadly. But the fun isn't over yet. Your hyperdrives are out of control so you are speeding up all the time. Not to mention that Marvin has triggered off a galactic alarm and two fleets of space crafts are coming to exterminate you. Happy asteroid dodging, and don't get your hyperdrive in a twist!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
