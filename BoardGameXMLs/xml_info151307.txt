			<description>Robin Hood and his gifted team of young vigilantes must help the downtrodden people of their land and deal with evil plots of the Sheriff &amp;ndash; before finally meeting up with the villain himself in a final showdown to decide the fate of the Nottingham Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fully cooperative game which takes place over a series of rounds. Players must work together, pooling their time and resources, to contend with sinister plots affecting the Nottingham Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By rolling specific types of dice (Combat, Stealth, or Diplomacy), players may choose how best to resolve the Plots. At the end of each round, the Threat Level may rise, making subsequent rounds much harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, the players will have to push forward through the Sheriff's fortress-like Factory to confront the villain himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only through careful management of the dice, tactical decisions about how to resolve the Plots, and a little luck of the roll will Robin Hood and his heroic team win the day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
