							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Icehouse: Black Ice</name>
									
			<description>Black Ice is a two-color set of Icehouse pieces.  Included were a hemp drawstring bag and a chessboard bandana with Martian Chess dividing lines. It did not include any game rules but did feature a little coupon which was supposed to be redeemable for a free copy of a booklet of rules that would eventually be created for the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set usually gets used for games other than Icehouse, and because many of those games have become increasingly deep, and have begun to require additional colors, Looney Labs released this Black Opaque and Crystal Clear set of 30 more stackable plastic pyramids.  These pieces are equally suitable for playing Icehouse as they are for Zendo, Zarcana, Focus, or any of the other dozens of I:tMCS games designed by the Icehouse fan community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
