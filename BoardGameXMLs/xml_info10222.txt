			<description>This is an update on Nine Men's Morris. The original game is played on a square board on which players take turns placing pieces. When a player places three pieces in a row, he may remove an opponent's piece of his choice. Once all pieces have been placed, players try to align three pieces by sliding them on the board. A player wins when his opponent is down to two pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version is played on a five-sided board. Once a player is down to five pieces, he can jump them from anywhere on the board to any open space. in order to align pieces or to block his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pentagonia is a two-player, board game with a very chess-like attribute. Victory is completely dependent on your reasoning and pattern recognition skills, and completely independent of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
