			<description>In Kids DOG, players use cards in their hand to move their three dogs from their start space to home. On a player's turn, they play one of the three cards in their hand, then move one of their three dogs according to what's on the card played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A colored paw moves your dog to the next space of that color.&lt;br/&gt;    Two colored paws moves you to the second space of that color.&lt;br/&gt;    A &amp;quot;dog swap&amp;quot; card lets you exchange places between one of your dogs and an opponent's dog, as long as they're not at home or in a protective kennel.&lt;br/&gt;    A double-color card lets you move to the next space of either color.&lt;br/&gt;    A kennel card moves you to the next empty kennel on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land on an opponent's dog with one of your own, and they have to start from the beginning once again. If you'd land on one of your own dogs, you can instead jump it and move to the next space of this color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all three dogs home wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
