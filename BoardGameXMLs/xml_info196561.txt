							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Haunt of Crow Gulch</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was an ancient civilization of Men that constructed the tower and other fortifications like it up and down the Eastern Coast, but who they were is lost to antiquity. Many say they were a grand people who worshiped a single, emaciated deity while others say they were cannibals and mad with power. Even the oldest of Dwarves know of them only as legend. All that remains are the dilapidated ruins of their towers and keeps, and the secrets they hold. Throughout the sea lands many folk give these sites a wide berth. superstition mixed with outright fear keep most people from exploring the fallen walls and buildings that serve as landmarks for travelers and sea voyagers. As a result, many of these have become lairs and havens for wild animals, stalwart bandits and humanoids, monsters, undead, and worse. The tower ruins that loom atop a rocky crag high over the hamlet of Crow Gulch is no different Most common folk refer to it as the Haunt and warn not to venture near it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, word of adventure and gold has drawn the characters to Crow Gulch A Gnome by the nae of Galemon has offered 50 gold pieces, in advance, to adventurers and sell-swords willing to explore the ruins of the ancient tower in search of a silver orb. He will pay another 500 gold upon success. Rumors and fireside tales speak of a growing terror that lies deep beneath the Haunt and the rocky crag upon which it rests, but this has not deterred those hungry for wealth and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
