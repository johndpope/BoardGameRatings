			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THERE HAS BEEN A MURDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you is a corpse. This person was a friend, a stranger, a father, a mother, a wife, a husband, but now they are dead, and the killer is among you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, and the people around you are trapped in some remote location, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a train, or a remote ski lodge, perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re locked in the parlor room or a steamer headed for Greenland, regardless, you&amp;rsquo;re not going anywhere, and neither are the suspects. Luckily, one of you is a legendary detective, known the world over for their uncanny ability to pick away at a mystery until the truth is all that remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the killer amongst you; discover what happened to the deceased and try your very best to not share their fate&amp;hellip;unless of course, you&amp;rsquo;re the murderer. Then your job is much easier &amp;ndash; Don&amp;rsquo;t get caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closed Circle is a Fiasco playset inspired by Great Detectives such as Poirot, Holmes, Marple, and the Locked Room mysteries they often found themselves in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
