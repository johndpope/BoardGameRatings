			<description>From the publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the age old game of cat and mouse. A simple but clever two-player game where one player plays the part of a rabbit and the other, the part of two wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rabbit's job is to hop around the vegetable patch collecting carrots to take back to its burrow, without being eaten by a wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wolves' job is to sneak around the vegetable patch, to ambush and eat the rabbit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT: This game was apparently not published in 2007 as planned because of high production costs (per John Yianni on BGG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
