							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babes in the Woods</name>
									
			<description>A simple race game for 2 to 4 players using one d6 die. The players race to the &amp;quot;Heart of the Woods&amp;quot; and back to their starting position. The players moves are without interaction. The game is driven by pure luck, there is no skill at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play is complicated by the fact that there are three concentric rings of spaces around the &amp;quot;Heart of the Woods.&amp;quot; You can move along paths from one ring to next,but you must hit the path by an exact throw. Likewise you must also hit &amp;quot;Heart of the Woods&amp;quot; and home by an exact throw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has the game board pasted to the bottom of the box. Parts include one die and four markers of different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
