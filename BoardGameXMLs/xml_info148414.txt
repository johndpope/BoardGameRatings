							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hidden Tomb of Slaggoth the Necromancer</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Mentioning the name of Slaggoth the Necromancer was once met with hastily gestured holy signs and murmurs of fear. The dead things which crawled and slithered from Slaggoth&amp;rsquo;s hidden tower were ravenous and evil. In the two centuries since the necromancer&amp;rsquo;s body was entombed deep within a mountain cave, the name has lost some of its gravitas. Young adventurers, unperturbed by ancient tales of long past evil, now think Slaggoth&amp;rsquo;s tomb ripe for plunder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Slaggoth does not rest alone. A trio of ogres and their hoard of goblin minions have settled in the caverns. They are deserters from a great army in a faraway land, and are determined to keep the freedom they risked their lives to gain. Any who enter the cavern will be sliced and stabbed, their meat hung on hooks to dry, and their bones fed to the wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
