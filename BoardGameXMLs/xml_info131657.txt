							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Splattering Egg Toss Game</name>
									
			<description>A dexterity game in which two players are each equipped with a small plastic frying pan and a squishy plastic &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot;. The opponents simultaneously toss their egg to the other person, who attempts to catch it in their frying pan. This repeats until someone drops their egg and loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a solo version in which one person sees how many times they can toss the egg up in the air and catch it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
