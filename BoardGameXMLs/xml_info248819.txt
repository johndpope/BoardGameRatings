			<description>Preparation&lt;br/&gt;The Avignon City tile is mixed in with the other land tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing the Avigon City tile and deploying the Pope&lt;br/&gt;The Avignon City tile is placed in the same way as a normal tile.&lt;br/&gt;When the Avignon City tile is drawn and laid, the player who laid the tile deploys the Pope onto the city segment of the Avignon City tile.&lt;br/&gt;The player can place the tile and connect it to another city that already holds a follower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;1 point is added to every tile of the completed city if it holds the Pope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the Pope over to another city&lt;br/&gt;Adding a Cathar tile or a siege tile to the city that holds the Pope will allow an opportunity to redeploy the Pope to any incomplete city on the playing area. &lt;br/&gt;Then later in the game another city may get the bonus points for the Pope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to Jonathan Warren for comments and suggestions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approved by carcassonnecentral and carcassonne-forum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
