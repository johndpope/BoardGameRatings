			<description>Classic trick-taking perfected in a new deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tropical fruit themed trick-taking card game deck including 2 ways to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard Parakeet game is for 4 players, with 2 partners. You bid to choose the trump suit. Points are scored by capturing certain point cards, not by counting tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fruit Punch alternate rules use the Fruit Punch cards to change the card value orders and trump. The game can be played with 3 to 6 players, everyone for themselves. Points are scored by counting tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
