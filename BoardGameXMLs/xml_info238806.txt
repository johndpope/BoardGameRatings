			<description>AceHole is a remix of the most popular card game for drinking on college campuses: Asshole. &lt;br/&gt;Despite its popularity, the game asshole was never formalized with written instructions or rules.&lt;br/&gt;AceHole fixes all that!&lt;br/&gt;What makes our game so much different and (and better) than all of the games that are being played every day across the country in countless colleges and universities (since the beginning of time)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     We have compiled all of your favorite rules and many new ones from all across the United States. We came up with over 100 drinking rules.&lt;br/&gt;     No more memorization! All the rules will be laid in front of you on our cards!&lt;br/&gt;     We have included a beautifully designed 54 card custom playing card deck.&lt;br/&gt;     All cards are from the 54-card deck and rule cards are printed on 100% ALCOHOL PROOF PVC! NO MORE PARTY FOULS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
