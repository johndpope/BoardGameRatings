							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolemaster Quarterly (Issue 2 - Aug 2006)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the second issue of the Rolemaster Quarterly! If you bought the first issue you found that a good half of it was dedicated to one article: Elementalists. In this issue, you will find the Air, Light and Water versions of the Elementalist Training Package spell lists. Earth, Fire and Ice were included in RMQ1 along with much of the conceptual theories about how to integrate them into your world or campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NPC in this issue will take a Mentalist and give an example of how to taunt your players with a malevolent merchant. Also, we&amp;rsquo;ll have a new set of Priest examples based on a &amp;quot;Holy Warrior&amp;quot; theme, one each for the Shadow World and Cyradon settings (yes, I realize this is a HARP setting) and a couple of generalized ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three unique magic items to round things out for this issue. They are items that I would probably term high-end magical items or lower-end &amp;quot;Artifacts&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a side note, I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a break from doing full issues of the Rolemaster Quarterly in the near future, but fear not&amp;hellip;the RMQ's will still be forthcoming as ICE has other authors who are willing and able to fill the need. So, until next time&amp;hellip; on to the material&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
