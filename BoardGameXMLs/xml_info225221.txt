							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wreck and Ruin</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wreck and Ruin is a short adventure designed to be played over one session. The plot is fairly linear, beginning with the wreck of the players ship. From there on the adventure takes the form of a series of strange occurrences, culminating in a final climactic battle in the Tower. This adventure is designed for relatively inexperienced characters, and is set up so that they will have to work together to survive. Further, this adventure will introduce them to the World of Legend, albeit a far flung part thereof and to the demands of a noble house of Albion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for four or five players of 1st or 2nd Rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario was developed for convention play.  The PDF features multiple page sizes, some quite large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
