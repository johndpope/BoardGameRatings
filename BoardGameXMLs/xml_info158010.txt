							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Pirates (Multiverse Adventures)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very detailed setting that brings space pirates to the Extreme Future universe. The setting includes all the Multiverse Adventures rules in this book, so it can also be played as a stand-alone game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are descriptions of life aboard a pirate spaceship, explanations for why spaceships on the Tarazet Periphery have large heat sails rigged on them and have their weapons mounted in broadsides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economics of pirate plundering, and the trade routes they prey on are covered in depth, and the strategies pirates use in their attacks are also covered in just as much detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So roll up a ship full of pirates and start plundering on the Tarazet Periphery, me hearties!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
