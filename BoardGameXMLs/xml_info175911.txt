							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princes of the Plains: Halfling Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score One For the Little Guy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Down to earth in more ways than one, halflings are a practical and quiet sort of folk, who still sometimes possess a strong mischievous streak. Though they&amp;rsquo;re known best for their small stature, their bravery and courage in the face of adversity is the subject of many a legend, as is their incredible luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, when you choose to make your player character an halfling, all that you really care about is the +2 bonus to your Dexterity and Constitution scores (and who needs Strength, anyway?), so why bother playing a halfling barbarian or fighter? Even if a +2 bonus doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make that much of a difference, it just feels so wrong to knowingly combine a race and class that don&amp;rsquo;t go well together, and, as a result, many players never bother to consider it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book aims to give players who want the fact that their character is a halfling to matter more a way to make that happen, while also providing support for halfling characters of a variety of classes that don&amp;rsquo;t typically make much mechanical sense for halflings. Included are the halfling berserker, a barbarian archetype that allows halflings to wield weapons of incredible size, and move with great speed, the halfling knee cracker, a brawler archetype that centers on focusing a lot of damage in a small package (and of course shattering kneecaps), the halfling beastrider, a cavalier archetype for halflings that form an especially close bond with their mounts, the halfling hamstringer, a fighter archetype for halflings who focus on getting so close that their opponents can&amp;rsquo;t hit them, the halfling spelldart, a magus archetype that focuses on imbuing darts and sling bullets with magical power, and the halfling wanderer, a ranger archetype for well-traveled halflings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
