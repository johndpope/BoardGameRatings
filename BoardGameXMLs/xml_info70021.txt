			<description>&amp;quot;Fatal Frame, known in Japan as Zero (零～zero～) and in Europe as Project Zero, is a survival horror video game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. It is the first game in the Fatal Frame series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game revolves around the female protagonist, Miku Hinasaki, and progresses through four chapters (or &amp;quot;Nights&amp;quot;). As a result, players control her for most of the game except for the intro chapter, in which Mafuyu is a controllable character. The characters' strength is displayed in a life bar located in the lower left corner of the screen, and the game will end if the character's strength is drained completely. However, the character can find healing items throughout the progress of the game at different locations, which restore their strength to a certain extent. Plus, a special item called a Stone Mirror can be obtained by Miku in some parts of the game, which completely restores her strength automatically one time only if her strength bar is completely depleted. Miku and Mafuyu also have a flashlight to aid them in the exploration of the haunted mansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miku's only weapon is the Camera Obscura, an antique camera passed down from her mother, which has the ability to damage and capture spirits. However, the camera also relies on &amp;quot;ammunition&amp;quot; - films, which prepare a certain amount of shots for the character. There are different types of films scattered throughout the mansion, and each type of film possesses a different strength. The camera also contains several special abilities, which must be unlocked using spirit points, which can be gained by capturing ghosts. These abilities, such as Paralyze and See, can aid Miku in fighting spirits that have different attacking patterns to the standard ghosts. During the game, Miku must explore the entire mansion and its grounds, and must obtain certain objects and solve puzzles in order to progress through sections of the game. During this time, Miku will encounter different types of spirits, either random or mandatory. Some spirits are friendly and will not attack Miku, but most are hostile. The chapters progress as Miku reaches a particular location, usually after completing a major segment of the chapter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fatal_Frame_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
