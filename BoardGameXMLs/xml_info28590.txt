							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of State Capitals</name>
									
			<description>Discs, each of which names one of the forty-eight state capitals, are dealt to the players. In turn, a spinner which indicates two of the states by number (the order in which they were added to the union, really) is spun. If the player has the state capital discs matching those states, the player must declare that fact to surrender the discs. Sometimes the spinner allows a player to surrender two discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alaska and Hawaii were added to the game when those states entered the union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to place all one's state capitals in their proper places on the gameboard wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
