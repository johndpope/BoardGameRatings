			<description>Four gameboards together in one book with magnetic pawns. All four games have an environmental friendly theme. &lt;br/&gt;Playing and learning at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game is for 1 or 2 players and the goal is to be the first to complete a family of polluters. The game board is full of what not to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game is for 1 to 4 players. It is like a game of goose, but the theme is safe our planet and learns us how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third game is again for 1 to 4 players and takes the players on vacation. It teaches how to have a good time on holiday and still respect nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last game board is for 1 to 4 players and has endangered species as theme. Players move horizontally and vertically over the board and try to reach the end stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
