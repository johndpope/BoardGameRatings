			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game about people who live in a superhero universe. Elsewhere in the setting, Solarman is punching out the villainous Dr. Thunder right now. But this is not a game about them. This is about the guys in the background, who have to deal with the everyday shit that most superheroes don't worry about. Sure, you have some superpowers, but you still gotta pay the rent, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you did what any schmuck would do: you got a job. Specifically, all the player characters are employees of Teapot Dome Superpowered Repossession Services. When a supervillain defaults on their loan, their creditors hire you to recover their collateral. (What, you thought that villains paid in cash? Doomsday weapons aren't cheap, man. They buy it on credit, like everyone else.) Sometimes, the collateral is an experimental vehicle or a giant battle robot or a cybernetic army. Doesn't matter, so long as you get it back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
