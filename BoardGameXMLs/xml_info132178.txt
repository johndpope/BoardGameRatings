			<description>from the designer's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a novel mechanism with some aesthetic appeal, along with a festive board.  It's a variant of Y on a hexhex board, but with a balancing twist.  It's for two players, played with white and black stones on the board [used by Spry].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of blue, red, and yellow borders, as well as concentric rings, each a different shade of green.   The central space is also considered a &amp;ldquo;ring&amp;rdquo;, even though it&amp;rsquo;s just one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The board begins empty.&lt;br/&gt; 2. The players take turns.  On each turn, a player must place one stone of her color onto any empty space, but not on any red, yellow or blue spaces.&lt;br/&gt; 3. If a player makes a first placement on a ring interior to all other rings with stones currently on them, then her opponent may optionally switch sides with her, rather than place a stone, on his next turn.&lt;br/&gt; 4. The game ends when a chain of either white or black stones touches at least one red, one yellow, and one blue space.  The player who owns that chain at game&amp;rsquo;s end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
