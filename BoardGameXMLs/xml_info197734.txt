							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trancers (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the future, in the year 2360. The future has many new horizons of opportunity, but it also has more terror. The biggest terror in 2360 is an organization known as Trancers. Trancers are in the process of ridding the world of normal folks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An elite fighting force, known as the Trancer Hunters, have arisen to destroy the threat the Trancers pose. The Trancer Hunters search out and destroy all Trancers that they find. Due to the help of the Trancer Hunters, most peoples' lives run normally, but for the Trancer Hunter, nothing is normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trancers 1st edition was written ca. 1994 but not published until 2014.  The &amp;quot;Pocket Edition&amp;quot; has the same contents, but has improved formatting, a different cover image, and has a different page size and layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
