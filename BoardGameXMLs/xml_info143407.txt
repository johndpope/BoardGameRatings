			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the golden era of Toonville, Fleish the Fox is the star of all the shorts recorded in this black and white cartoon world. His arch-nemesis, Mr Mintz, always tries to ruin his adventures by capturing his girlfriend Cherry, but despite his evil machinations, Fleish continuously manages to get his happy ending with her. But things are going to take an unexpected turn&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fleish &amp;amp; Cherry in Crazy Hotel is a game set in the 30s, the sunset of the black and white era. The visual elements, the sound and especially the gameplay itself, will make the player feel like being another toon. But before we delve into &amp;ldquo;Crazy Hotel&amp;rdquo;, let us check in at the reception to explain the features of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid between graphic adventure and action adventure in perfect balance with different environmental puzzles spread in the game&amp;rsquo;s 5 chapters.&lt;br/&gt;    Single-player adventure in black &amp;amp; white 2D visuals, adopting an isometric view.&lt;br/&gt;    A story with a fun and rich dialogue system, multiple characters and objects with which you&amp;rsquo;ll have to interact to achieve your goals, and use incredible skills typical of cartoons.&lt;br/&gt;    Developed with the Unity engine for PC, Mac and Linux.&lt;br/&gt;    Initially, the game will be available in English and Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
