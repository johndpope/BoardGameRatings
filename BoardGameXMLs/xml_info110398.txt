			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Labyrinth of the Lost!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like most of our other modules, this adventure features multiple hooks to draw your PCs into the story. There is travel across the different ecosystems of this interesting demi-plane. One might meet friends or foes anywhere in the adventure. There is political intrigue and real personalities clashing to add spice to the detailed locations. People live and die here, your PCs are just the ones who might be able to help rid the land of evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Hanan Pacha faces a mortal threat: evil wizards are trying to open the Black Door to the undead realms. With this gate open, the titan, Erebus, awakens from his ages-long slumber. He is angry because undead are being summoned by this foul gate. Mortals only have a limited time to deal with this threat before Erebus calls forth the other titans, who will wreak havoc on the mortals for their insolence! Characters of Levels 8 to 12, who have magic and magical weapons are best suited for this advenutre. A second file provided for your convenience has all of the dungeon maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
