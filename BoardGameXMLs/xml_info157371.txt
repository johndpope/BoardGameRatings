							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Reservoir</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 16 x 20 inch map of a Reservoir, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT (Virtual Tabletop files) for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Water is life. If you control the water, you control survival, and you control life. And people will pay any price to live just one more day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reservoir is a single external view map of a facility holding water built in a rocky desert area that could be a different planet or someplace on earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reservoir is intended for use in modern games, post apocalyptic games, or near to far future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hostile Takeover: In a post-apocalyptic future after global warming has flooded most of the world, causing most fresh water to be polluted with salt, and most desalination plants completed submerged in water, a businessman owns a water reservoir in the desert. He charges outrageous prices in food or goods for his precious water that he uses to pay for security around his facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local populace is fed up after years of oppression. A resistance movement in town is gathering members trying to find people willing to risk their lives to put an end to the price gouging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can get involved if they are part of the security force guarding the facility or if they are contacted by the resistance to help take over the facility. The Player Characters then either defend the facility or need to come up with a plan to attack the facility with the resistance or find a more indirect way of stealing the water from the reservoir than a direct assault on well-trained security guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
