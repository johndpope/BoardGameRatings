			<description>Children's card game based on the nursery rhyme:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baa Baa Black Sheep, have you any wool?&lt;br/&gt;Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full&lt;br/&gt;One for my master, one for my dame&lt;br/&gt;and one for the little boy who lives down the lane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules:&lt;br/&gt;Object To collect a set of 4 cards comprising of a Little Boy, a Dame, a Master and a Black Sheep.&lt;br/&gt;Deal each player four cards and place the rest of the pile face downwards on the table. Turn the top card over and place face upwards beside the pile. All the players look at the 4 cards in their hand to see if they already have a Dame, A Black Sheep, Little Boy or Master card amongst them.The youngest player begins by taking a card from the top of the pile. If this card is a Dame, Master or Little Boy card he can keep it to add or start his collection. He will then place an unwanted card from his hand on the pile which is face upwards beside the main pile. If he has picked up a Black Sheep card, or if he has a Black Sheep card already in his hand, he may place the Black Sheep card face upwards on the pile and turn to any player saying &amp;lsquo;Have you any wool?&amp;rsquo; If the person questioned has a Dame, Master or Little Boy card in his hand he must hand this card over in return for whatever card the original player chooses to give him. The player who has asked &amp;lsquo;Have you any wool?' then takes another card from the main pile to keep a total of four cards in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;Play then continues with the next player taking another card from the pile. If he picks up a Dame, Master or Little Boy card he can add or start his collection and must throw away any unwanted card from his hand on to the pile face upwards. A Black Sheep card may not be picked up from the face up pile, but any other card can be taken. Play continues with each player taking a turn in the same manner.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to have a Master, a Dame, a Little Boy and a Black Sheep card in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
