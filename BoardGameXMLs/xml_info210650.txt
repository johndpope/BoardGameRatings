							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Remorseless</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the moon is full and the tide is high, sailors travelling the Wraith's Sea keep their eyes down and pray to their gods. For it is on such nights that the Remorseless sails. Damned for a lifetime of crimes, the crew of the Remorseless have been denied rest, and the phantom ship and her ghostly crew sail the quiet waters seeking more victims. They say that to see the Remorseless is to be cursed with a watery death.&lt;br/&gt; A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A Phantom sloop-brig style sailing ship. The ship features a cannon-armed weatherdeck, a ghostly captains quarters and crew areas, and a dark hold. The entire ship is ephemeral and incorporeal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Fight ghost pirates aboard their ship, or be taken prisoner on the phantom vessel and try and escape before it returns to the underworld. Break the curse that holds the crew captive on the ship, or speak with the crew of wraiths to uncover clues about the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    300dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map spread across many pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    300dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing (gridded and gridless)&lt;br/&gt;    Jpeg versions include both white background and sea background versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
