							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SnailTrail</name>
									
			<description>This game is a close relative of the Slimetrail game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two players: red and blue snails. Initially snails are placed in the opposite corners of the rectangular board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The snails can be moved to adjacent cells and may not move to a cell occupied by the opponent's snail or re-visit a visited cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends up when one of the players cannot move his snail on his turn. The other player wins in this case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usually played with progressive-moves variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
