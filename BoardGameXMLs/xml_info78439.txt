			<description>Tag Line:  The exciting bump and jump game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;The first objective in a QuUMP game is to &amp;quot;QuUMP&amp;quot;, which means moving your playing pieces all from start to home in the fewest turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My understanding of the game:&lt;br/&gt;QuUMP is a Parcheesi-like game in which a player must get his pieces from his start position to the center home spot.  The game can be played by two to four players each using one of the colors: blue, green, red, or yellow.  What is unique about this game are the playing pieces.  Each piece is about 1/2 inch in height and pieces are of various shapes.  If you look straight down on the pieces from above, the shapes are: square, triangle, circle, diamond, and octagon.  Furthermore, the square pieces come in three sizes: small, medium, and large.  In the basic game, only three of the shapes are used.  Many advanced variations exist, including one in which all the shapes are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has a series of tracks that lead from the start area to home.  Each piece must follow the track that matches its shape.  The square piece must follow the square track, the circular piece must follow the circular track and so on.  The tracks connect to each of the player's start areas to the central home area and hence intersect with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain points on the tracks and intersections allow players to jump their piece over other pieces or to bump opponents pieces back along their respective tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, players can roll up to five dice (just once) to gain additional movement points.  Players must cover the numbers 1 to 6 with the five dice.  Two or more dice can be used to cover one number.  For example, on a roll of 1-2-2-3-6, the player could cover the numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6.  In this example, 3 and 4 would be left uncovered, allowing the player to move pieces an additional seven spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move all of his pieces to home is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
