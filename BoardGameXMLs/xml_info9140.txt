			<description>Each player plays one race of apes, symbolized by a stack of ape cards. Apart from that each player gets 15 apes as henchmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is for each player to harvest as many different fruits as possible in four play rounds with his apes. At the beginning of a round everyone receives an ape map and the pertinent ape chips. The fruit markers with dark background are sorted and each player receives the five different fruit sorts. The fruit markers with the bright background are sorted and laid out in piles in the table center. A play round is divided into two phases. In the first phase the players put three apes to different harvest places. These apes are called apes scouts. In the second phase the remaining apes are secretly sent to the places, where already scouts of the own race are. In addition the players take the three different kinds of fruit, at which their apes wait and lay them out next to each other behind reproached hands. At the end, they place their remaining apes against each fruit, if they wish to do so. The next step is remove the hands at the same time and the players put their apes to the appropriate places. Only the player, who has the exclusive majority at a place, can harvest a fruit chip. All other players withdraw their entire apes again. The winner may only take half of the assigned apes to his stack, the others remain at the place. If there is a draw, nobody harvests the fruit. The entire apes move then again to the players back. After four rounds that player wins, who could harvest the most different fruit kinds. Players compare their fruits and the total number decides, who the winner is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
