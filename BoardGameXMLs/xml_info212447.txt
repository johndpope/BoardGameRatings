			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citalis is a city-building simulation where you use money loaned to you to build your own city. You must monitor your inhabitants' happiness to make sure they don't turn to crime and force sections of your city to be shut down. Also you must manage water levels that, if out of control, will keep parts of your city from functioning. And you need the city to function so that it generates income to cover your increasing loan repayments, lest you lose the game by forfeiting on the loan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
