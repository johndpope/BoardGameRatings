			<description>Ernie Eaglebeak is a teenager just out of high school living in the town of Port Gecko, pining for his sexy neighbour Lola Tigerbelly and struggling in a seriously bad relationship with his stepfather, Joey Rottenwood. A break-through in his miserable life comes when he gets accepted by the Sorcerer University, a prestigious university of magic. After a dashing escape from Rottenwood's custody, Ernie makes his way to SU and enrolls as a freshman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ernie's life as a first-year SU student is split between learning magic, marveling at the rapidly deteriorating quality of the student newspaper, exploring the university and getting to know interesting females such as the university president's daughter Gretchen Snowbunny or Hillary, the young wife of his ancient advisor Otto Tickingclock. All is well until one day SU gets attacked by mysterious foes who kidnap Tickingclock and take away the Sorcerer's Appliance, a powerful magical device which could become extremely dangerous in inappropriate hands. Ernie has to recover the device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipped with his spell book and a magical guided surfboard, Ernie sets out on a mission to several islands on the Fizzbuttle Ocean in search for items that will aid him in getting into the sinister Fort Blackwand. On the Island of Lost Soles he restores the cursed souls of its inhabitants, on the Island Where Time Runs Backwards he has to work hard to avoid destroying the universe with a temporal paradox, on the Island of Horny Women he finds out that there is such a thing as too much female attention, at the Restaurant at the End of the Ocean he witnesses the six stages of a life of a restaurant and at the Island of the Gods he learns that goddesses need love too. And everywhere on the way he finds places where the Great Attachments required by the Sorcerer's Appliance to operate used to be located, but are gone now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellcasting_101&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellcasting_101&lt;/a&gt;:_Sorcerers_Get_All_The_Girls,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
