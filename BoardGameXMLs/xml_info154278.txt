			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ghost stories you've heard are true. There are things that go bump in the night and they really do want to hurt you. But you've chosen to stand up and fight back. It won't be easy, but your friends and your town need you. The world needs you. Look out, Evil: the hunter has become the hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create your own world based off of popular series where (relatively) normal people fight off supernatural threats in a modern setting, usually in secret. Draft characters with cards that define their talents, flaws, relationships and liabilities. Modify the cards as your characters grow and change organically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin playing immediately with no preparation required. There are no dice; Just tell the story you want to tell, featuring the quirks that bring your characters to life and the twists that make the genre great. All you need is a pen/marker of a different color for each player to mark the cards (there are enough for three extended campaigns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;what is in the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This boxed set comes with 108 cards and a 20-page rulebook in an easy to carry deck box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
