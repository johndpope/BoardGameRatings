			<description>Source: Wikia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.raymanpc.com/wiki/en/Rayman_2_Forever,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.raymanpc.com/wiki/en/Rayman_2_Forever,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rayman 2 Forever (known as Rayman 2 in the USA) is a port of Rayman 2 that was released only on the Game Boy Color, and is the sequel to Rayman on the same handheld console. Unlike its predecessor, whose plot was similar to that of the original Rayman, this game follows the same plot as Rayman 2: The Great Escape. All of the music is taken directly from the first Game Boy Color game, only with added beats. Instead of using a password system, Rayman 2 Forever has a save battery, and allows the player to have up to three save files. The graphics also appear less advanced, most likely due to the fact that the game is longer and cartridge space limits would not allow for more complex visuals. Despite its name, Rayman 2 Forever bears no connection to Rayman Forever, an enhanced version of the original Rayman which was released for the PC in 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
