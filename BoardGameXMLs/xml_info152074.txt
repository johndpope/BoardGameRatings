							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Christopher Clark&#039;s Rain of Terror</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the residents of the Riotous Vale, it has been an unfortunate decade.  Ten years ago, a pirate band destroyed the keep that protected them, captured their town and laid waste to the fertile valley beyond.  The pirates tortured, terrorized and enslaved the few survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But they overlooked the treasures that lay beneath the ruins of the keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That was their first mistake.  Their second was allowing the man that built the keep to fall into your hands.  Perhaps their last mistake will involve a group of clever adventurers spiriting away the treasures from beneath the ruined keep right under their very noses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rain of Terror is a fight against two forces, a cutthroat pirate band, and an approaching hurricane that will test the survival skills of your players to their utmost.  It is designed for exploration by 3 or more well-equipped characters of low to moderate level supported by both clerical and magical assistance.  It is written in a generic language to allow its use with almost any fantasy role playing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's hope they can swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
