			<description>Excavate! is a game for 2-4 players. Each player takes on the role of a unique archeologist assigned to a fossil-rich pit that was recently discovered. Players will use their tactics to manipulate the board and attempt to create the most highly Acclaimed museum. As players continue the game, the play area will be changing as the players dig through the cards and find the sets needed to benefit them the most. The gameplay is about 30-45 minutes, and because of the simple rules, children as young as 8 years old can play it and be a competitor. However, this game offers a deep strategy level so even adults can compete. Easy to play, and very little luck is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview of gameplay: players will take 5 actions each turn.  These actions can be any of the following: dig, move, display or sell. When a player takes a dig action, they take one of two adjacent cards to the piece and flip it face up on the other pile.  Any fave up cards can be interacted wroth by a player on their turn.  They can display it in their museum,  sell it for money,  or simply ignore it.  As players display various sets of fossils,  they will increase in the number of Acclaim points.  The player wit the most Acclaim points wins Excavate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
