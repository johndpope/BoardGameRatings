			<description>The game consists of square cards which have three properties: Shape, color and number. There are four varieties of each property. Taking turns, players flip open a card from their personal pile and put it on the next of four stacks of open cards in the middle of the table. As soon as there are three cards which share one property variety, players have to slam down a hand on the table - the first one who does it gets the three cards. When all cards have been played, who ever won most card is the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
