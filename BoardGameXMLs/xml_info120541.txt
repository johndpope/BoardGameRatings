			<description>Subtitle: An RPG Based on the Movie Inception &lt;br/&gt;From &amp;quot;the Setup&amp;quot; section of the rules:&lt;br/&gt;In this game you play highly illegal con men who steal information from unsuspecting people while they, and you, sleep. Using a briefcase sized technological device and specially made chemicals you and your teammates will sedate, without his knowledge, The Mark. The Architect will create up to three layers of dreams that the team will have control over in every way except for the people who populate it. The Mark will believe that The Dream is his own unless he is convinced otherwise and will generally not understand that he is even dreaming. As The Dream becomes less and less stable The Mark might start to realize that this is not his dream and if he has had proper training he might be able to turn the tables on the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
