							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ragged Edge</name>
									
			<description>A sequel to The Cold Equations, or a fascinating adventure in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb: &amp;quot;The Ragged Edge follows in the footsteps of Mongoose's Complete Campaigns for D20 Fantasy games, providing everything a Games Master and his group needs for many, many months of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Set in the universe of Babylon 5, The Ragged Edge follows on directly from The Cold Equations (though it can be played without that introductory scenario), taking beginning level characters through a rollercoaster of events that will see them becoming leading lights of the galaxy in their own right, battling against the machinations of the Psi Corps and other power hungry organisations as they try to unravel the mysteries before them.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is from the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Ragged Edge campaign is set during 2259 (the second series of Babylon 5) and centres on interstellar espionage and conspiracies, on the movements of shadow and light that set in motion the climactic events of the following years. At the campaign's beginning, the Player Characters know nothing of the twilight world of spies and secret organisations; by the end of the campaign, at the fall of night, they will find themselves the masters of a star-spanning alliance that could be the deciding factor in the Shadow War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Assuming, of course, they survive. Walking the path of The Ragged Edge will take the characters all across the galaxy, to the Centauri Republic, the Drazi Freehold, the Narn Regime, Babylon 5, and even into the murky depths of the Clark Regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Ragged Edge campaign follows on from events in The Cold Equations, though playing this introductory adventure is not essential. The Ragged Edge is designed to be started by 2nd level characters and by the end of the campaign, characters will have advanced to roughly 10th level. This book also contains new feats, equipment, influence, spacecraft and contacts for characters to encounter and utilise.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
