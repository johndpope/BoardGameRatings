			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;In the distant future, the galaxy is at war. Battle rages across the stars as campaigns are won and lost in the vastness of space. Your role in this conflict puts you as the captain in command of a customized ship, whose purpose is to engage your enemies in thrilling and strategic space combat. Successful command requires you to know how to use your ship to its fullest. Attacking with your modules, evading incoming  assaults, and maintaining the ship&amp;rsquo;s integrity is all done with the end goal of taking advantage of weaknesses in your enemy&amp;rsquo;s defense. Be strong, be brave, and most importantly, take risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;Mecha Mettle is a 2 player card and dice game where the players are engaged in space combat as captains of their own custom ships. Players build their ship by playing module cards and choosing components that give special ship abilities. Battle  takes place by firing with modules and rolling dice to resolve combat. Positioning and taking advantage of better numbers is the key to winning. The game ends once one player destroys 5 of their opponents ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
