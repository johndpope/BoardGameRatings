			<description>Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a tile-laying board game designed by Ted Alspach and published by Bezier Games. Since its release, it has won the prestigious 2015 Mensa Mind Games award, and quickly become one of the Top 50 board games on BoardGameGeek.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building amazing castles for King Ludwig of Bavaria, known for some of the most impressive castles in the world.
