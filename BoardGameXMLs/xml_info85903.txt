			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scirsevand's Black Dragon Scale is the second installment of the popular Masterwork Armor series by Heathen Oracle. The armor is meant to provide an exciting campaign feature in the way of a powerful artifact that does not imbalance the game. The dragon scale is useful as a riveting plot device which could be assembled over time (recommended), found as a complete set or scattered throughout a single dungeon, or worn by an archvillain. Although the armor is powerful, its wearer must be of sufficient level to access the armor's more impressive features. Thus, if an 8th level fighter were to don the complete set of armour, many of the most extraordinary features would be beyond his grasp. As the character gained more levels, he would be granted access to the armor's higher powers. Synergistic abilities also come into play as complementary pieces are worn together (both gauntlets, both sabatons, completed suit), etc. Armor abilities are closely tied to that of its draconic namesake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
