			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jabbertalky, the programmable word game, thrusts you into a world of language games. Two games--Alphagrammar and Cryptogrammar--are already programmed into Jabbertalky. Each is based on the program's ability to generate an infinite variety of random sentences that are grammatically correct and whose meanings range from the poetically profound to the lusciously ludicrous. (Always embrace the rubber duck. Regina's fightworthy tollbooth divorces frequently the posthumous and tight tummy.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alphagrammar uses the computer-created sentences to make the next generation of anagram games. This is not merely your ordinary game of word unscrambling; it's your extraordinary game of unscrambling an entire sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptogrammar serves you sentences, in which each letter of the alphabet is substituted for another letter. This cornucopia of cunningly contrived cryptograms produces a myriad of mind-bending, code-breaking challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One to four players (more, if you have the memory) take turns on each game before time runs out. Eight levels of difficulty make the games challenging and fun for both seven-year-olds and expert linguists alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If that is not enough, Jabbergrammar gives you the tools to create even more sentences of varying complexity, absurdity, or silliness. Jabbergrammar can be described as an editor, utility, builder program--but it is more. It is a language language. It lets you add, change, or delete words in the data files, creating entirely new and extraordinary vocabulary lists; it lets you put the vocabulary into whatever sentence pattern or syntax you wish. You can create sense or nonsense; you can use your newly-created sentences to play Alphagrammar or Cryptogrammar; you can generate entirely new words (preantiwordishness? unrutabagalihood?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Verse lets you see your creations, gives hints about the kinds of sentences generated for each skill level, manufactures party games by telling players what to do, and so on forever (almost).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play Jabbertalky, you can always have the last word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two different word games&lt;br/&gt;     Create your own vocabulary and syntax&lt;br/&gt;     For ages 7 through adult&lt;br/&gt;     Complexity: simple to extremely difficult&lt;br/&gt;     Playing time: 30 Minutes to hours of fun&lt;br/&gt;     For one to four players (more on a disk)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
