							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucky Bastard</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people are just lucky. There&amp;rsquo;s no denying that there are those individuals who, for whatever reason, seem to lead a charmed life. Whether they were born under a good omen, are blessed by god, or are just at the far end of the probability curve, some folks just deserve the nickname &amp;ldquo;Lucky Bastard.&amp;rdquo; Jealousy and envy are common reactions to people so seemingly blessed by fortune, as are some amount of confusion and disbelief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few people manage to refine their luck into an actual method of survival, counting on chance and karma to save the day when skill and strength fail. The one in a hundred shot is no stranger to the Lucky Bastard, and many become daring risk-takers because of their luck. Others are quiet in their good fortune, unwilling to &amp;ldquo;press their luck&amp;rdquo; more than they have to. After all, if luck is a commodity that some people just have more of than others, then it&amp;rsquo;s possible for your luck to run out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
