			<description>Set in the near future, Earth 667C gives 2 to 6 players the opportunity to save humanity from our sun going supernova. In twenty solar cycles, the sun will explode and destroy everything in our solar system. Use the remaining resources of our planet to construct your ship in orbit. Build it fast. Build it strong. Build it to save as many humans as you can and launch your spaceship to the nearest exoplanet before the supernova.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructing your ship is only half the game. For those that survive the solar event and launch their ships, they must face new challenges on the way to our new exoplanet home, Earth 667C. The Journey to the new planet has boosts and perils along the way, including black holes, quasars, enemy vessels, and asteroid fields. Your ship building skills and the luck of the dice combine to determine your crew and survivors' fates. Will you be the first to Earth 667C?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth 667C is a card and turn-based tabletop game for 2-6 players or teams. Perfect for ages 10 and up, the game is fun, encourages strategic thinking, and includes just enough chance and player relationship dynamics to create three game phases with unique challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Ship Building&lt;br/&gt;Purchase Ship Components from Space Dock, and construct the fastest ship carrying the most people. Customize your ship by doubling your navigation for better travel. Double your engineering department for increased speed. Or, add more food and life support to increase your capacity to carry survivors. Pick your strategy for your ship and start building. Optional Ship Components are available for purchase. Components like weapon systems, shuttle bays, and radiation shield provide bonuses or protection during The Journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: Launch Your Ship&lt;br/&gt;When the Solar Cycle hits 8, you can launch your fully constructed spaceship. Roll the dice and aim for 12 or higher to push your ship into position for The Journey. Get 12 or lower? Then you must wait, and hope that the solar clock does not tick down any further. You must launch your ship before the clock hits zero, and the sun goes supernova.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 3: The Journey&lt;br/&gt;When the clock hits zero and sun engulfs the Earth, the real Journey begins. Play a single turn journey, or an eight turn journey. Roll the dice and discover what boosts and perils await you while traveling to humanity's new exoplanet home. Encounter new enemies that attack and slow your ship, or pass a strong hydrogen cloud that boosts your engines. Utilize your optional Ship Components to ward off enemies or discover wormholes to increase your speed. This phase will put your ship building skills to the test. The events during The Journey can slow the fastest ship, and propel others to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first ship with the most survivors to reach Earth 667C and ensure the survival of the human race on our new exoplanet home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
