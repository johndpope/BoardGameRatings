			<description>Welcome to the card-based party game for adults where you create bizarre and hilarious &amp;quot;IF/THEN&amp;quot; statements, which we call Toxic Logic. The game is easy to learn, portable, and tons of fun for 4 or more adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone is dealt 5 magenta &amp;ldquo;THEN&amp;rdquo; cards. The Dealer flips over a green &amp;ldquo;IF&amp;rdquo; card with the beginning of a conditional statement, like &amp;ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up your butt &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; The other players each play one &amp;ldquo;THEN&amp;rdquo; card face down to the Dealer. The Dealer shuffles the &amp;ldquo;THEN&amp;rdquo; cards and then reads each &amp;ldquo;IF/THEN&amp;rdquo; combination:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;THEN we're in for a big, sloppy surprise&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;THEN these blueprints are all wrong&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;THEN my new nickname is 'Sharty McFly'&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;The Dealer picks a favorite &amp;ldquo;THEN&amp;rdquo; card and reads the winning IF/THEN combination out loud:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;IF you put a habanero pepper up my butt &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;THEN my new nickname is 'Sharty McFly'&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;The player of the winning &amp;ldquo;THEN&amp;rdquo; card gets a point. Everyone draws back up to 5 &amp;ldquo;THEN&amp;rdquo; cards, and the player to the left of the Dealer becomes the Dealer for the next round. You can keep your winning &amp;ldquo;THEN&amp;rdquo; cards to keep track of your own score. The first person to reach 5 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toxic Logic is great for parties with 4 or more adults. You and your friends will have hours of laughs putting together &amp;ldquo;IF/THEN&amp;rdquo; statements which are absurd and so funny. Remember, &amp;ldquo;Toxic Logic&amp;rdquo; is not for kids! Some of the cards are filthy, and some of them are bizarre. While there is plenty of adult language and potty humor, rest assured that there is no racist or hate-based content. We want it to be fun for all adults! Put it all together, and you've got almost endless hilarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
