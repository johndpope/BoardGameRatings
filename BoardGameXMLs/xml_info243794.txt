							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villains of the Week 1: Suffer, the Drow Evoker</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No one knows the rogue Drow's real name. He only goes by the moniker, Suffer. Suffer has been exiled from his family and cast out of Drow society. If he returns he will have to challenge matriarch for power. In order to successfully do this he must acquire powerful magic items and a group of skilled mercenaries to reduce his family's force of drow soldiers. He longs to visit revenge on those who stripped him of his rightful place and drove him to the accursed world above. He is very smart and very motivated to destroy his enemies. He is also a master manipulator and will seek to use parties of noble adventurers to do his dirty work under false pretenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He holds no allegience to anyone but himself but will use his natural charm and his magical staff to intimidate people into performing seemingly minor services for him. He is already accumulating power and wealth through his magic and building his network of spies and thugs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of the Villain, their background, how they encounter the PCs, their tactics in battle and what happens when they are defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
