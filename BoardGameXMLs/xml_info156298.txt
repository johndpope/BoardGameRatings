			<description>A buddhist monk needs your help in the reconstruction of the Great Wall of China. You have to errect it between observation towers. Remember that It must be one single closed wall without any inner loops. Each tower should be surrounded by the wall on as many sides as the number shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a brand new edition of a classic puzzle like Slitherlink (sometimes called: Fences, Takegaki, Loop the Loop, Loopy, Ouroboros, Suriza, Dotty Dilemma), also related to Sudoku and Minesweeper. To the best element of logical games, namely the challenge, we have added interesting graphics and relaxing background music. This is the most attractive and best touch-controlled Slitherlink in the whole of AppStore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give your grey matter a workout! Take the challenge and go through 48 stages divided into 3 levels of difficulty: EASY, NORMAL and HARD. Become a Master Architect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt; - 3 levels of difficulty: EASY, NORMAL and HARD&lt;br/&gt; - 48 game boards&lt;br/&gt; - applicable to iPhone 5&lt;br/&gt; - automatic game synchronization via iCloud&lt;br/&gt; - integration with Facebook and Twitter&lt;br/&gt; - hint mode available&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live and don&amp;rsquo;t let die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
