			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to SMAF 17, the last surviving bastion of humanity in the world! Situated on the sea floor just off the coast of California, Sub-Marine Adjustment Facility 17 is one of the last outposts of human survivors after the apocalyptic nuclear war that occurred during October 1962, when Russia placed nuclear warheads on Cuba ready for launch and America refused to back down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now home to a confusing mess of ex-inmates, former prison guards, and a few politicians and military officers who escaped in the last hour of human civilization, SMAF 17 is falling apart after five years of no supplies and poor maintenance. Society in the underwater city has collapsed, and now little gangs fight for the remaining resources available.&lt;br/&gt;You are one of those gangs! Taking on the role of a survivor, you will try and find food, water, shelter&amp;hellip; and hope. But don&amp;rsquo;t leave SMAF &amp;ndash; because everything on the surface is horrible irradiated, and you would immediately die!&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1967, and boy would this decade be swinging&amp;hellip; if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that everyone is dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
