			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if the world ended and no one really noticed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if almost everyone just picked themselves up the next day, dusted themselves off and went back to their routines as if nothing major had happened?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is what happened here. Sometime in the late part of the 19th century, something exploded in several places around the world at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists say they think it was a number of comets or some other sort of space body hitting the planet. Some people claim that we were being attacked by Martians. Some folks just didn&amp;rsquo;t really notice. The explosions caused lots of death and destruction and affected every continent in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange things live in the shadows of the world. Other worlds seem to have intruded upon ours and you are one of the few who decided to take notice and take action. Folks have names for people like you, the most polite of which is Adventurer. There is something that makes you want to notice the world and what goes on outside the daily humdrum lives of everyone else, and you have an itch to explore the dark corners and possibly even right some wrongs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been several decades since the Event and you have decided that it is time to scratch the itch of Adventure. Welcome to Skyscrapers &amp;amp; Sorcery, may your adventures be many and fruitful and may your lives be valiant and your death be bravely faced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Old School, White Box compatible game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This contains all of the player pertinent information, everything from the core book except the Referee's section and the starting adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
