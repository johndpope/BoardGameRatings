			<description>Get ready to turn up the music with the princesses of SpacePOP! Play as Athena, Hera, Rhea, Luna, or Juno as you race around the planets of the Pentangle, collecting all of the items to complete your ensemble before making your way back to the Space Bus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pick one of the five princesses and must land on certain spaces to collect the four pieces of their outfits and single Space Pet. The first player to collect all five pieces and make it back to the Space Bus wins. Activity spaces require players to dance or sing to progress. Landing on Empress Geela's space sends you to her Dungeon of Doom and you must roll a specific number to get free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fashionably fun game features unique game play that will get everybody up and grooving, as well as glitter dice and transparent character cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
