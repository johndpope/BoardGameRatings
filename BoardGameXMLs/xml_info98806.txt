			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Dad got you an afterschool job at the factory where he works. You need the money 'cuz being the most radical boarder around means you've got heavy expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The job is a skateboarder's dream come true. Miles of halls and tubes to perfect your moves. Just cruise through and turn off all the machines and lights in the factory. Hurry up 'cuz power is leaking out fast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you speed through the factory, pass each machine to automatically turn it off. You'll have to jump to turn off those light bulbs though. If you want to pass a machine that's already turned off jump over it or else you'll turn it back on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The factory is one giant maze!  Tubes are the only way to get from floor to floor. But you've got to find the right tubes.  Different tubes go to different floors. To ride a tube hold the joystick down to crouch, enter the tube, and release. If you want to change your mind in the middle, don't release the joystick until you're heading back in the direction you came from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, there's a catch. You get paid depending on how much power you save. And you've got to be out of the factory by 5:15 pm today. One second more and you'll never make the deadline for entering the Skateboarding Championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
