							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CraZmates the Relationship Board Game for Teens &amp; Young Adults</name>
									
			<description>CraZmates is the outrageously fun, party game that will keep players laughing &amp;amp; joking as they experience the ups and downs of relationships.  It's so emotionally riveting that some forget it's just a game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is to find a perfect mate (or at least a not-so-CraZ one).  There's just one catch:  Sometimes it's hard to figure out whether a new mate is &amp;quot;craZ about you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;just plain craZ&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select from dozens of mates, including your favorite celebrities &amp;amp; local hotties.  But be on the look out for highly-competitive, so-called friends willing to do anything to win, including steal a perfect mate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players Experience real life situations - ranging from the slightly bizarre to the outrageous.  They'll want to play it again an again, because each time is a new experience.  Players never know what to expect from CraZmates!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
