							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minuteman: The American Revolution in the North</name>
									
			<description>This game was included in Issue #2 of SDC's CONFLICT Magazine.  The game covers American Revolution conflict in the Northern colonies from July 1775 through potentially December of 1779.  Voluntary combat for adjacent units, with volley combat being decided on a matrix table weighing unit types and total strength factors against a die roll (similar to Lou Zocci's Luftwaffe combat table).  Additional &amp;quot;bayonet&amp;quot; combat also possible, based upon net relative strengths of attacker/defender, with terrain and die roll bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules allow for &amp;quot;command counters&amp;quot; to replace units on the map, allowing for unknown unit strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the designer notes published within the magazine, the game was a prototype design being prepared for Avalon Hill, and CONFLICT Magazine was being authorized to distribute it &amp;quot;...to assure that the test version will appear with a minimum of error and/or distortion.  We want your assistance in making this the kind of game which belongs in the Avalon Hill lineup.&amp;quot;  The subscribers and other play testers were encouraged to submit their critiques of the game to Lou Zocchi, and the six best would receive copies of the final game published by Avalon Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
