			<description>Grab your binoculars and visit our National Parks. In this  game of color matching and exploration, players collect Explorer Cards as they journey to National parks throughout the United States. They will experience many landmarks, buildings, and natural wonders while always on the lookout for plants, animals, items of interest and opportunities to care for the parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Explorer Cards include many plants, animals, and geological features. There are also cards that provide opportunities for players to help out around the park or discover some important historical or cultural facts. There are 32 cards in all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the person who can gather the most Explorer cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an extra challenge, players can look for matching plants and animals that show up on the Explorer cards. They are hidden on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No reading is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
