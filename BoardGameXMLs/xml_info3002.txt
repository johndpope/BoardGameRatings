			<description>&amp;quot;Use your skill and become Champion on the world Golf CIRCUIT&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circuit is a golf based board game made by a pro golfer in 1980. There were 500 made and they're out there somewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is due for re-release sometime this year (2002) after extensive redevelopment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a felt playing area with tournament cards and bonus/chance cards. Dice are thrown to move around the board and the idea of the game is to win money from competing in grand golf tournaments across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics of the game also uses handicaps and accurate scoring as in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
