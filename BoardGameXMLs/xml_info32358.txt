			<description>During the nineteenth century, settlers expanded rapidly across North America, from the eastern seaboard all the way to the west coast.  Players' pieces represent the wagons of a bold family just arrived from the Old World and working to reach the west coast.  Performance is based not on how well any one wagon does, but on how well players manage all of their wagons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played as a trick-taking game.  The goal of the game is to advance wagons as quickly as possible.  Every trick scores movement points.  These points propel wagons across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every hand also features a hand evaluation step.  Bidding a hand correctly scores extra movement points.  Missing a bid scores nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blocking is also an important element of the game.  By placing wagons on the game board&amp;rsquo;s prime paths, players can force each other to either go around or give up some of their precious points to push opponents forward and out of the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been self published (at prototype quality) in an edition not to exceed 200 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
