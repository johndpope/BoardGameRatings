			<description>Pincers is an abstract game for two players played on a 5x5 grid. Players each start with five crab pawns, one of which has a starfish printed on the bottom of it and another which has a pearl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving one of crab at a time. If a crab is surrounded on both sides by the opponent's crabs, that crab is pinched and flipped over. If the flipped crab bears the pearl, the pinching player wins; if it has the starfish, the pinching player loses; and if the underside is blank, the crab is removed from the board and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pincers includes a variant in which the pearl and starfish are visible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
