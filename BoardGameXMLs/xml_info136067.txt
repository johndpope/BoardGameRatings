							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crimson Hand</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Ones were once the sole masters of the world of Exodus. They ruled with undisputed power, enslaving or dominating all other races and nations beneath their sorcerous grip.  Although their civilization has fallen, there are those who still desire to see these dark, ancient beings rise once more. The Crimson Hand is one of the final few bastions of First One power, a secret organization with its tendrils tightly wound around much of the world&amp;rsquo;s nobility. It is a long game they play, but one which they believe can only end with their eventual triumph, and the re-establishment of a new era of First One tyranny. This sourcebook comes equipped with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History of the Crimson Hand&lt;br/&gt;     The Crimson Hand &amp;ndash; Operation and Motives&lt;br/&gt;     Structure, Political and Intrigue Hooks of the Crimson Hand&lt;br/&gt;     Leadership of the Crimson Hand: Valos - leader of the group.
