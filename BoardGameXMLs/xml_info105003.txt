			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s one of the great questions of our time. Which is scarier: zombies or werewolves? For generations this has puzzled commoner and philosopher alike. But now, the question will be answered. Which supernatural entity has the power to cause the most terror in the unsuspecting citizens of some nameless town? Only you can decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies vs Werewolves is a fast-paced card game for 2 players that takes roughly 15 minutes (or less) to play. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, competitive, and all about determining who can score the most Terror Points before the game ends by frightening an assortment of random Citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play begins by selecting 6 Citizen cards at random and laying them out on the table face up. Each person chooses one deck of cards (either Zombies or Werewolves) to play with. During each player's turn, they will be able to play a card from their hand and then draw back up to a hand limit of 5 cards. Cards played are either Terror cards (cards with a number from 2-6 and 8) or Special Event cards (unique cards with special abilities that can be used once a game each). Each side plays Terror cards on Citizens to try and meet or exceed the Citizen's Courage rating; the player that meets or exceeds the Courage rating first frightens that Citizen and prevents the other player from claiming them at the end of the game. Play continues until all Citizen cards have been frightened. Then the total Terror points played on all frightened Citizens is added up on each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most Terror Points at the end will be declared the victor, proving once and for all (or until you play again) that their side is the scarier of the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
