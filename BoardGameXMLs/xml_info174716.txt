			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every party of outer space adventurers is distinct, and their ships should be also. Infinite Spaceships presents the game statistic for six ships: the Assault Lander for groups which prefer fighting over talking; the sleek and stylish Comet; the scout ship and the Star Marshal patrol ship. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we didn&amp;rsquo;t forget to include the classic Light Freighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These ships are more than just a pile of statistics, they are designed to function as the group&amp;rsquo;s transportation, forward base of operations and their home. Since the characters will spend so much time on these spaceships, deck plans are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are compatible with Infinite Futures and comes with full color deck plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future is now, so play Infinite Future and last off into fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
