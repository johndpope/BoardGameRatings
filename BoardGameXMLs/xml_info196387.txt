			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world full of adventures, it is vital to know where, who, and how to get the information you need. Pulling favors from contacts, greasing palms, securing information, and gambling are all parts of your repertoire of skills but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. All that time spent in the underbelly of cities dealing with all the scum and villainy has taught you that in order to survive the urban jungle, you must learn how to read people quickly and turn any dire situation in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;Feinting and applying cheap tricks are also your specialty; sometimes charms and looks wont save your hide from a sticky situation but a well placed dagger might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 21 page playbook containing over 29 moves, with numerous weapons, armor, gear, poisons, and magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    Two compendium classes: The Gambit and the Crime Lord.&lt;br/&gt;    The Half-Elf, a new race with custom moves for you to use.&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
