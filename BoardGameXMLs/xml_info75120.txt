							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragons of Legend (Fudge Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are five stories form that time when dragon tales were told as a warning as much as entertainment. The Lambton Worm was in England, the Fire Dragon was Irish, the Piasa was carved on cliffs over looking the Mississippi, and Japan was home to the Hi-no-kami and the Ryu-hime. As with all myths, there are several `correct' versions of the story, so the reader might be more familiar with slight variants of the tales presented here. Each of these dragons may be used as a representative example of a species or as an individual. Following each myth are game statistics for the dragons and monsters in story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Note on Fudge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the Freeform nature of Fudge it is impossible to write for all Fudge campaigns. Dragons of Legend uses the following attributes to describe the creatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Preferred Environment: This is not so much an attribute as a description of where the creature is likely to be encountered.&lt;br/&gt;       Physical Scale: This represents how large the creature is. It is added to Strength and Defensive Damage Value. It is subtracted from Defensive Combat values because larger creatures are easier to hit. Positive numbers are for creatures larger than humans. &lt;br/&gt;       Intelligence: Intelligence is rated with two words; the first gives the general class. Dragons of Legend uses two classes Animal and Human. The second gives the creature's comparative intelligence within that class.&lt;br/&gt;      Armor: This represents the toughness of the dragon's hide, and other factors which make them more resistant to damage. This does not include any modifications for Physical Scale.&lt;br/&gt;       Attack Combat Value: Per standard Fudge rules.&lt;br/&gt;       Defensive Combat Value: Per Standard Fudge rules.&lt;br/&gt;       Known Powers/Faults: This details specific abilities the dragon or other creature is known to have used. It also lists specific faults the dragon suffers from. At the GM's discretion, the creature might be endowed with abilities it did not demonstrate in the stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
