			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Half-Life 2: Survivor&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half-Life 2: Survivor is an arcade game based on the science fiction first-person shooter video game, Half-Life 2. It was released on June 28, 2006 on Taito's Type X+ arcade system, with a 32&amp;quot; widescreen high definition LCD running at 1360x768 resolution. The game's player character is controlled with joysticks and floor pedals, and offers three game modes: Story, Battle, and Mission, each with different objectives. The game was met with a generally positive reception. Reviewers found it interesting to play the game in an arcade environment, and considered the shift to an arcade setting an excellent introduction of the Half-Life series of video games to Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
