			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Witch Hexes introduces thirteen new witch hexes that delve into those aspects of the witch that have not received their due.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bridgemaker - By stretching her body out in a rather grotesque fashion, the witch makes a bridge.&lt;br/&gt;     Broom-a-mancy - The witch animates a broom for cleaning, defense, and locomotion.&lt;br/&gt;     Commune with Spirits - Having learned how to speak with dead, the witch is bombarded with their problems for the rest of her life. She gains a suite of social bonuses, but penalies to hearing given the background noise.&lt;br/&gt;     Compact Form - A witch can slowly tune her body in such a way that she becomes resistant to being crushed by rocks.&lt;br/&gt;     Dreadful Visions - Visions of his own demise torments the witch's victim.&lt;br/&gt;     Heckling Fatigue - A witch's ire forces the victim to double his sleep or be tired.&lt;br/&gt;     Herbalism - A witch learns how to invest magic into medicinal herbs she picks, enhancing her first aid Heal skill checks.&lt;br/&gt;     Pentagram - A witch focuses magic in a small area, giving her a caster level bonus.&lt;br/&gt;     Pyretechnics - A witch can survive indefinitely when being burned at the stake, but also puts on a good show for the peasants so they eventually cut her down and leave her alone.&lt;br/&gt;     Suffer the Slings and Arrows - Those who irritate a witch can find themselves the brunt of many a small misfortune.&lt;br/&gt;     Tell Fortune - Querying the universe regarding the fate of an individual, a witch can confer either a bonus or a penalty to rolls for 24 hours.&lt;br/&gt;     Witch Buoyancy - An experienced witch can have a suite of defenses against being drowned as a test to see if she is what she is.&lt;br/&gt;     Zombify - Some witches can create humanoid undead without spending money on black onyx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
