			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The noble and the skirmisher were some our first stand alone base classes. We have learned quite a bit in three years and we wanted to revisit these classes in order to give them a facelift!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF has 9 pages of content, includes both the noble and skirmisher base classes, 3 gorgeous art pieces by the talented Alissa Mathiasmeier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like to roleplay? This is the book for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First is the Noble base class. Why draw your weapon when you can talk your opponent into submission? With excellent diplomacy checks and a slew of social skills, this is the class for you if you live for roleplaying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second is the Skirmisher base class. Styled after the fighters who brave the chaos of the flanks to protect the shield lines, the skirmisher lives or dies by his creativity. Using a unique new dice mechanic, the skirmisher plays like a light fighter with a lot more fluff. Due to the mechanics of this class, out of game creativity is a must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The feats and prestige class normally found in the Tome of Ingenuity are not included in this book. This is simply for the two base classes found in that book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
