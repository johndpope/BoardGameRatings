			<description>A battery operated British game of chance, no skill required at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has a wheel with nine different coloured horses with jockeys on board. Players are invited to place their bets. You could play for real money or buttons. When all the bets are placed, you flick a switch and the wheel will spin. As each horse goes past a connection, their colour light flashes on, so with a fast spinning wheel, the lights all flash, adding to the excitement. When the wheel stops, there will be one light on and that is the race winner. Winning punters collect their bets and another race can start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one player who has the most money when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
