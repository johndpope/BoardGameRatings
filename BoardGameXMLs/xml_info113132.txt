							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Manx TT Race Game</name>
									
			<description>The Isle of Man TT races are held every year. The TT stands for Tourist Trophy. Bikers get to ride very fast around the lanes and roads on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game relates to their popularity. It is a relatively simple dice and move game, with certain spaces around the track giving instructions if you land on them. In addition, if two pieces end up on the same space, they are said to have crashed and must miss a turn. Also, if you roll too high a number when going round certain bends, you crash and must miss a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to the finish line, wins. If you want a longer game you can play on for whatever number of laps you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
