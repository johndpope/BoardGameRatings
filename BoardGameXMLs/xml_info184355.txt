			<description>The long awaited expansion to the hit Zombie deck builder Eaten by Zombies! The Zombies aren't the only thing returning from the grave!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new expansion builds upon the Fuel mechanic that was introduced in the Weapons of Mass Destruction mini set. With a new Starting card (Fuel Can), now you always have fuel for your Chainsaw. With the Oil Lamp, Fire Starter you can burn your way through the Zombie Horde. Take a quick swig of the Old Jack Rye #1 for a pick-me up or just smash one of the those undead zombies in the face! You can't pass up a good hiding place even if it is under a car, or just push a zombie down there they don't climb very well. Or get the rest of the survivors to help you out and give them the order to &amp;quot;Fire!&amp;quot; everything they've got at the horde!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the changing of the guard there are 2 new zombie sets. -The first zombies hate the world of man and they not only try to eat your face, but they will destroy any equipment they come across dwindling the already scarce Swag Piles. And the new fearsome zombies will scare the Stuff right out of your backpack! Forcing every player to discard cards from their hands and redraw, bringing even more zombies into your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;now on Kickstarter: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gingeralegames/eaten-by-zombies-burn-it-down?ref=bggforums&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gingeralegames/eaten-by...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
