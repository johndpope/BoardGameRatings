							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roadside Diner</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alongside a long straight stretch of a highway through endless grass land lies this small diner amidst a little parking lot for its customers. Although the structure is nothing special it stands out in the barren countryside. Especially through its brightly glowing neon signs, advertising its presence to all who are hungry or just wary and in need of a rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interior of the circular diner is quite simple. It's single room is divided by a large counter where the staff does all the cooking, the cleaning of the dishes as well as cashing in all the bills. Behind the counter several large refrigerators cool ingredients and drinks for the customers, while the other side of the counter is dominated by several small tables and stools for the guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
