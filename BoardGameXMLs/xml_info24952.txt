							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Testament Game</name>
									
			<description>Part of a series of games published at the end of the Victorian era, the New Testament Game (No. 1124) follows the same formulaic gameplay of the other Cincinnati Game Co. games (including the Game of Flowers, No. 1126, also published in 1899, and the the Game of Shakespeare, published in 1900).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the New Testament Game, cards depict scenes from the life of Christ from birth through resurrection, ascensions and omnipotence,  As in other Cincinnati Games Co. games, the cards are given a letter and number (A-M and 1-4, arranged as A1, A2, etc.). Players attempt to complete a &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; of cards (all four numbered cards of a given letter) by collecting the necessary cards from opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple games are played like Go Fish where a player asks for a card by letter and number from any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can play more challenging games using biblical quotes at the bottom of each card. Before a card is surrendered, the quote is read and the active player must state the book of the bible from which the quotation comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also topics at the bottom of the cards allowing for play similar to the Game of Authors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature black and white illustrations by world renowned artists (and even some world renowned paintings) such as DaVinci's Last Supper and Hoffmann's ubiquitous version of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes works by Dor&amp;eacute;, Bougereau, Plockhorst, Portaels, Le Rolle, Muller, Godall, Benz, Mengelberg, Zimmermann, Cornicelius, Richter, Kirkbuck, Murillo, Rubens, Grieger, Munkacsy, Herriach, Raphael, Reni, Schonherr, and Coletti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
