							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flushed Away</name>
									
			<description>Flushed Away is an action-adventure video game based on the animated film of the same name and released in 2006 by Monkey Bar Games. It was released in Japan for the Nintendo DS as Volume 17 of the Simple series. It couldn't be released on the Xbox because the sales were dropping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flushed Away is based around platform gameplay, with the player controlling the two main characters from the film and guiding them through hazard-filled environments. Environments and enemies are based on those in the film, although several areas and creatures not seen in the film are also included. Interspersed throughout the game are mini-game sequences involving shooting enemies with a golf-ball firing turret, and taking control of a boat in a chase sequence. Some multiplayer minigames are also included, based around puzzle and shoot-'em-up mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Flushed Away (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
