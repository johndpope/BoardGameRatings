			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with both White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying and Swords and Wizardry WhiteBox! Also, quite easy to use with ANY old school game based on a game whose name rhymes with &amp;quot;Truncheons and Flagons!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for White Star with a sort of Star Trek theme. If you're a fan of Star Trek, Andromeda, or Farscape, and even if you're not, there's a lot for you to like here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you get?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    FIVE (5) new classes: Engineer, Expendable, Guerilla, Sawbones, and Scientist, as well as additional notes on the core classes from White Star!&lt;br/&gt;    FOUR (4) new racial classes: Disgraced, Living Starship, Quixoitic Alien, and Simulacrum!&lt;br/&gt;    NEW EQUIPMENT that you can requisition, including weapons with a &amp;quot;stun&amp;quot; setting and badge communicators!&lt;br/&gt;    FOUR (4) new starships and THREE (3) new starship modifications, including the Quantum Teleporter!&lt;br/&gt;    NINETEEN (19) new NPC alien races, including a table to randomly determine the appearance of your own aliens!&lt;br/&gt;    SIX (6) random tables for space exploration! HEXCRAWLS... IN... SPAAAAACE!&lt;br/&gt;    A complete setting in TWO (2) different eras, THE CONTESTED ZONE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you waiting for? You can afford it. Treat yourself before the utopian post-scarcity economy kicks in!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
