			<description>As doctors in a world famous clinic, players have fun trying to help patients recover from a variety of health problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a token and places it on the start square.  Players move around the board by rolling dice. Landing on certain squared allows players to pick a new patient card, roll for a patient, or answer a true/false question.  Patient cards describe a patient and the patient's health problem.  Rolling the dice determine if the patient improves and the player gains points, or gets worse and the player looses points.  Players also gain points by answering the true/false questions correctly. The player with the most points at the end of 30 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occabaton Clinic is a teaching game designed for grades 5-12  to prevent young people from starting tobacco. (Occabaton is &amp;quot;no tobacco&amp;quot; spelled backwards.) The students are not told the focus on of the game is anti-tobacco; the game is designed for them to discover on their own that tobacco use is dangerous. After the game is over, students are led in discussion and exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
