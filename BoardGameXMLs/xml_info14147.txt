			<description>The board consists of 4 playing areas with snooker tables and score boards. Ball headed pegs represent the snooker balls, and two special dice are used to play a competitive game of snooker between players for prize money. Players scoring the least contribute most to the prize money, and the player clearing the table of his balls first, stands to collect the prize money. However, due to there being more than one table in play, though he finishes first, he may not have the highest score. If so it's a black roll game between the first to finish and the highest scorer. The winner of the game, and the amount of prize money they collect not being known until the very last throw of the dice.  To see the details of the board etc. please view my web site as follows:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freewebs.com/snookerollasnookerooka/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.freewebs.com/snookerollasnookerooka/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
