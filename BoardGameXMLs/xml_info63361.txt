			<description>Long long ago, in a galaxy probably fairly distant. There is a war between two to four sides. Each with the banner of a different colour. Only when they are the last colour standing will they be victorious. Only the best Hue may be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Singularity is a free and Print &amp;amp; Play, tactical wargame with fleets of varying sizes fighting in the depths of space. There are 4 phases to the game which are repeated until one player remains standing. The four phases are Ability, Move, Fire and Repair. Each of the phases are completed in order of initiative. Each of the five type of basic ship have a special ability as well as a full arsenal of deadly weapons to destroy the foes. Will you nuke them from afar or wait until they draw close and destroy them with quantum mines and flak barrages? May the best hue win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Singularity is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.5 Canada License. &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game easily allows for new people to design and create their own ships and mechanics within the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure you have the latest version: Please check &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.graphinista.com/singularity/latest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.graphinista.com/singularity/latest&lt;/a&gt; I always update BGG with the latest, but it can take a few days.
