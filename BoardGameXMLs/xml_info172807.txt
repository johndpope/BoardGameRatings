							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruined Empire</name>
									
			<description>From the Kickstarter Page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruined Empire is a system-neutral campaign setting and source book set in a land of five nations in conflict, ripe with adventure and danger. It has a Final Fantasy-esque feel, a mind to social issues, and serves as a great idea-rich jumping off point to running your own games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the land held many nations, but recent decades have seen two great empires arise, each locked in a struggle to the death for supremacy. In the east lies the Imperial Dynasty of Azumi, the Iron Empire. Expanding ever westward, it absorbs all nations that lie in its path as it hungrily devours the resources of the land to fuel its engines of industry.  In the west lies the Jahga Republic of the Enlightened Peoples.  Expanding eastward, it seeks to bring civilization and self-determination to the nations that have not yet embraced the principles of enlightened rule that govern their empire. As it stands, only a handful of resisting nations remain even nominally independent, forming a scant buffer between these two implacably expanding forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruined Empire is a system-neutral campaign setting and source book set in a land of five nations in conflict, ripe with adventure and danger and contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An original campaign setting, inspired by Final Fantasy and common anime tropes, written with an eye toward social issues&lt;br/&gt;     Campaign creation hooks&lt;br/&gt;     Conversion guides and system hacks for use in starting campaigns with non-Tenra systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
