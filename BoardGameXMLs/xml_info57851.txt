			<description>Sometimes home is not such a sweet place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes one might want just a little bit of love and a little bit of control over his destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes one wishes for more than they can possibly handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all starts with a typical and sad case of domestic disturbance. Of course, as with anything else on this side of the Alternate Reality Universe, things are always a little bit more complicated that they seem at first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arnold was a quiet child. He took the beatings his father dealt out to him and his mother without a sound. One day, a stranger asked him if he wanted some power. Arnold said yes. And then Arnold looked for revenge. Against his father. Against any child molestor or wife beater. Who will stop him? The police? The vampires who want to keep secret their presence in NightCity? The Hunters? All depends on you. No matter who you are, your life will be changed by this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOME FRONT is an Alternate Reality adventure for Cyberpunk 2020. It deals with domestic violence - but with a twist. It contains full background material on each group interacting in the story, and lots of characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RECOMMENDED FOR MATURE READERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
