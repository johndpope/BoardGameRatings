							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Solvalla</name>
									
			<description>Solvalla in Stockholm is the most famous horse racing venue in Sweden, and gives it's name to this harness racing game - &amp;quot;a family game where you transfer the excitement of the harness racing track to your own living room.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to six players can participate in the actual race, while the number of those participating in the betting is unlimited. One player is chosen as the totalisator manager and collects the starting fees from each horse driver as well as the V5-coupons for betting on individual horses and their final places in the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race itself is a simple roll-and-move affair, with horses allowed to move diagonally, block other horses by running in front of them, and naturally always trying to choose the inner lane to get and stay in the lead. Unsportsmanlike play - ie. not letting your horse win even though you can, maybe because of bets placed - carries a fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a race is over, the manager turns over an odds card and deals out any winnings based on that combined with the V5-coupons, while the total of collected starting fees is dealt 2/3 to the winner and 1/3 to the second. The rules also stipulate that as many races are driven as there are horses in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
