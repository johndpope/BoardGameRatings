							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dictionary Dabble</name>
									
			<description>Given that Balderdash came out right around the same time, this may be a case of simultaneous invention (or in this case, simultaneously deciding to commercialize a folk game).  Dictionary Dabble is played exactly like Balderdash (players make up definitions to words and try to guess the real one).  The scoring is a little different.  In addition to scoring a point for guessing the correct definition and a point for each person who votes for your contrived definition, you also can score a bonus point if your pawn is on a space that matches the symbol on the word card that is drawn (provided you guess the correct definition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing it has going for it over Balderdash: the movers are little miniature &amp;quot;Thinker&amp;quot; sculptures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
