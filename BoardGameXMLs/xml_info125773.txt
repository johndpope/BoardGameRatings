			<description>Long Live Grandad is a card game appropriately suitable for the different generations within a family to play together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 66 cards are shuffled and each player is dealt 6 cards. In a turn a player hopes to lay face-up one card that will add more length to his current family. Each family must begin with an Opa Solo Card. Once started a family can be extended by adding a numbered card. After the Opa card has started the family, any card may increase its length. Subsequent cards must be the same number as the previous card or higher than it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A family can be made safe by playing a Family Card. The value of your family is thus safe-guarded. Next turn, you can start a new family. When the Draw Pile is exhausted, the round ends and scores are recorded for the value of cards in your protected families and in your current family at the round end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oma (Grandma) cards can make another player start a family all over again. Joker cards can represent any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to 60 points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;11 Opa-Solo-Cards&lt;br/&gt;Opa-Punktekarten (mit den Wertigkeiten 1 - 3)&lt;br/&gt;11 Oma-Stichkarten&lt;br/&gt;11 Familien-Karten&lt;br/&gt;2 Jokers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
