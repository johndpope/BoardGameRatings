			<description>Splay is a two player abstract strategy game. The object of the game is to acquire more territory than your opponent. The two players, called &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, alternately take turns placing their pieces on the playing field, or stacking them on their previously played pieces. Once a piece is played, it is never removed from the board. Splay is a game where the players are constantly battling for territory acquisition. A space which has a player&amp;rsquo;s piece(s) on it represents a unit of territory which is owned by that player. A &amp;quot;tower&amp;quot; consists of one or more like-colored checkers stacked on top of one another. A tower represents potential for acquiring additional territory. Players who utilize their towers effectively will gain a territorial advantage. Towers can also pose a liability so they must be developed with care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splay was inspired by the process by which borders are formed between competing entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please refer to the included &amp;quot;Splay_Rules.pdf&amp;quot; for a complete description of the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splay placed first in the 2011 rec.games.abstract stacking games contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
