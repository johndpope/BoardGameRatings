							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baptism of Fire III</name>
									
			<description>A development of the philosophy that started with BoF I, it features an all new game engine based on real world theories and training doctrines proven in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elegant in design, the rules allow you to focus on commanding the men, leading the action, and coming to grips with the chaos and uncertainty of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baptism of Fire III has been designed with ease of play in mind allowing players to concentrate on decisions and action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baptism of Fire III represents an evolution of modern skirmish game thought.  Imperfect information, uncertainties of command and a fluid, action driven activation sequence make for a hot and exciting table top game unlike any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baptism of Fire III is our most unique and intense game to model skirmishes in WW2 and beyond.  The focus is on Leadership, training and morale using a game engine like no other game.  With pace and simultaneous interaction within a turn, players will find themselves engrossed in the unfolding action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique game engine is the key to all this.  Evolved from earlier TFP Games rules, the system uses a non-traditional card draw, the player with the initiative deciding from 2 to 5 cards, creating a pace of play and simultaneous resolution of both sides activations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also use a sliding dice scale to reflect relative difficulty to resolve tasks or functions.  No adding modifiers to create impossibilities of failure or success.  BoF3 instead changes the size of the die rolling against fixed numbers, a simpler and faster system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders form the centre of attention.  They allow troops a greater degree of flexibility, and better Leaders will be able to motivate and lead their men more effectively.  They do this through Command Points.  Points may be spent to coax and motivate, direct actions more effectively, increase die sizes and more.  Leaders with reserved Command Points may also be reactivated within the same turn, pushing the men hard as they read or anticipate the tactical situation better than inferior leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supplements allow you to play post-WW2 conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
