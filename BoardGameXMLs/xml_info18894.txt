			<description>Eier Klauen / Don't Wake the Chicken is an electronic dexterity game. The game consists of 3 x 12 eggs (small, medium, large) and an electronic chicken. The goal is to take out as many eggs as possible from underneath the chicken's wings. Once the chicken makes a sound, the last egg the player wanted to take, is taken out of the game and the next player takes his/her turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end (when all eggs are either caught or taken out of the game) the number of eggs and the size of them make out the score. Large eggs are 3 points, medium ones 2 and small eggs only 1 point. The player with the most points wins. Ages 6 years and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penny the Chicken has laid a lot of eggs. She doesn't want anybody to take them. If you try to take them she will squawk loudly! Can you trick Penny and steal her eggs? If you are gentle and clever you can slowly take them - one by one. But if she clucks then you have lost your turn. The winner is the player with the most eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
