			<description>Quiz Game after a very popular Dutch TV Show broadcast by the VARA station and lead by Jack Spijkerman, a cabaret artist well known in the Netherlands and Belgium. The game is a faithful reproduction of the TV Show, except that the show mainly revolved around funny video fragments which are replaced by cards in the boxed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quizmaster reads the two players - or two teams of players - a question from the cards. Depending on their answers, the players get to drive a nail (=&amp;quot;kopspijker&amp;quot;) in a piece of wood. Winner is the player with their nail sticking out the least after a set number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's wooden box includes everything needed: question cards, hammer, nails and plank (no band-aids though). Sore thumbs guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
