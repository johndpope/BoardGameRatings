			<description>A card game for 2-4 players in which players take on the roles of the Cossacks and their enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising 20 suits.  Each suit has 3 cards. The cards have 7 basic characteristics: Enemy, Disaster, Men, Control, Action, Fight and Victory. Each suit performs one or two of these basic characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a common set of Victory Tokens (VT) and Cossack Tokens (CT) and one Hetman Token (HT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the role of one Cossack enemy: Russians, Poles, Ottomans, or Tatars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 7 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.   Fate Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    You draw 3 cards. You may discard a control card to draw 2 additional cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.   Sich Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    You may trade cards, CT, and VT with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   Control Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    You may discard a control card to gain possession of the Hetman Token. &lt;br/&gt;-    You may discard a disaster card to cause a target player to &lt;br/&gt;discard 3 random cards from his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.   Cossack Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    You may discard men cards: If you discard 2 men cards gain 3 cossack tokens (CT); 3 men cards gain 5 CT; 4 men cards gain 7 CT and so on. Add 1 CT if one or more cards are from the same suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.   Raid Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    To go on a raid, you must be the current Hetman and you must discard 1 enemy card and 1 action card, otherwise skip this phase. &lt;br/&gt;-    You cannot play an enemy card corresponding to the role that is yours. &lt;br/&gt;-    Roll 3 dice and add them up to get a raid total. Subtract this total from the number of CT you have. If the result is positive gain that many VT. If the result is negative, lose that many VT. &lt;br/&gt;-    You may discard a fight card to cause a 1 of the 3 dice to be rerolled or to cause a roll to be reduced by 1. &lt;br/&gt;-    Discard all your CT. &lt;br/&gt;-    If you won, the player with the role of that enemy loses VT equal to the amount you gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.   Glory Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    If you are the current Hetman gain 1 VT. &lt;br/&gt;-    If you went on a successful raid last phase you may discard 1 victory card to gain 1 VT, 2 victory cards to gain 3 VT, 3 victory cards to gain 5 VT and so on. &lt;br/&gt;-    You may also play an enemy card of the same suit of the enemy card you &lt;br/&gt;played in Raid Phase: Gain 3 VT for each such card played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.   End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Discard an enemy card or reveal your hand to all players. &lt;br/&gt;-    Max 10 CT. Discard excess CT. &lt;br/&gt;-    Max Hand size is 4 cards. Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to accumulate 35 Victory Tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
