							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NBA Hangtime</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;NBA Hangtime is a basketball video game developed by Midway and released in arcades in 1996. Home versions followed for Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, and Windows. A version for Game.com was cancelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangtime was the third basketball game by the original development team behind the NBA Jam series. The title was changed due to the NBA Jam name being acquired by Acclaim Entertainment&amp;mdash;the publisher of the games for the home market. New features of the series included character creation, alley oops and double dunks. A software update known as NBA Maximum Hangtime was released for the arcades later in the life cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next NBA title to be released for video game systems from Midway was NBA Showtime.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NBA Hangtime&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
