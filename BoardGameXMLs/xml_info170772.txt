			<description>Six letter cards (with the letters S-E-R-V-A-S) are placed face-down in front of a larger word saying &amp;quot;SERVAS&amp;quot;. The active player draws one of the cards and flips it open, then can decide to draw the card at the letter just drawn, or quit. If s/he quits, s/he scores a point for the card and keeps it. If s/he continues and draws a letter where the adjacent card has already been drawn, s/he loses the cards for the current turn. &lt;br/&gt;When all cards have been drawn, the procedure is repeated with the other player starting. After two rounds, the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
