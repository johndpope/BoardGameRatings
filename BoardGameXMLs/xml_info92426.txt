			<description>In the game, each player takes a role as a web developer who works on a team to set a new blog by implementing the WordPress engine. Each player need to set the optimal combination of plugins. It sounds easy, right? But there are some elements on the game that will make that simple task much more challenging. There are 3 dices that represent the request from the boss that the player must obey &amp;ndash; some time those will destroy all the work. When to cooperate and when to compete is another challenge that each player need to solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
