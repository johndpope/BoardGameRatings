			<description>Quaint late '60s offering from Ideal.  Plastic shelters are assembled on the roll-out plastic gameboard before players spin &amp;amp; move.  In addition to regulation numerals on the spinner, there are 'umbrella' and 'rain' areas.  Players spinning the umbrella get to slot the small plastic umbrella provided with the game in the allocated position in their mover's hand where it remains until the umbrella is spun by an opponent.  If 'rain' is spun, all players without the umbrella must return to the closest previous shelter passed on the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the finish space is the winner and gets to squirt the losers with the hose (optional house rule).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
