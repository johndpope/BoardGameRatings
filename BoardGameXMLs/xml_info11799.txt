			<description>Let&amp;acute;s Play! Are you fast enough to keep up with the crazy pace? Each player gets the same number of cards that will be played on the two receiver piles set up at the beginning of the game. Take your cards and make four piles and place them face up in front of you. Now it&amp;acute;s going to get fun! Everyone races to play their cards on the receiver piles at the same time. But it&amp;acute;s not just speed you need - you have to match colors and perform actions before you can play your cards. So, snap, clap, &amp;amp; slap your way to being the first one to get rid of all of your cards and you win the game. But don&amp;acute;t get caught making a &amp;quot;goof&amp;quot;, or you&amp;acute;ll have to add to your cards, which will put you behind. Wild cards and stop cards add to the excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 7 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
