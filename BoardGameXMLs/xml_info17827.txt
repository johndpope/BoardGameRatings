							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Regatta: The Game of Champions</name>
									
			<description>Regatta: The Game of Champions was the official boardgame of the America's Cup 2000 yachting event in New Zealand. Countries included are Japan, United States of America, Italy, France, Australia and New Zealand. The game is rather light and reasonably quick, with cards representing events that can change the race, including wind shifts, tactics and incidents. Movement is set depending on what wind speed your yacht is currently experiencing (the dice are used to determine whether wind speed increases or decreases for each yacht each turn). Regatta can be played as a traditional one-on-one race, four player race or a 3-6 player fleet race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
