							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Santa&#039;s Rooftop Scramble</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas Eve and Santa needs to make sure all the presents are delivered on time, and to the right addresses. Sounds easy enough, but in this game - you are Santa. You start in the workshop, preparing all the presents, and as soon as you have everything ready, you can start making your way across the rooftops, dropping the correct presents through the letterboxes. There are a few stumbling blocks to look out for, and although there is some strategy involved, the game is mostly relying on luck. With easy to grasp rules, even the youngest players can skilfully play with the older ones. The first player to deliver all their presents is the winner. A wonderful and fun way for the whole family to get into the Festive Spirit, and is sure to be a family favourite year after year&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
