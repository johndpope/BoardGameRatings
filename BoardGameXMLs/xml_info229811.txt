			<description>A One-Round Adventure for 10th Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crimson Codex Faction Adventure 10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big trouble is brewing for the city of Stormreach, and one of the many forces involved in that trouble is a small group of dragons belonging to the Chamber. This group of dragons (and their followers) has definitely chosen sides in the coming conflict. One of the dragons in this group is Voldrangor the Seeker. He has come to Stormreach with the purpose of establishing himself and his followers as spies and information gatherers. Upon his arrival, he found that a network of rogues was already in place, led by another member of the Chamber known as Stormrider. Before he could establish his dominance in Stormreach, Voldrangor the Seeker knew he would have to eliminate Stormrider and his network&amp;mdash;which was fine with Voldrangor, since his plans directly contradicted the plans of Stormrider. However, no member of the Chamber is allowed to directly slay another member, so the elimination of Stormrider had to be done another way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voldrangor the Seeker and his followers went about that task quickly and efficiently. Stormrider was lured away from Stormreach on Chamber business, allowing Voldrangor&amp;rsquo;s group to wipe out most of Stormrider&amp;rsquo;s network in just a few hours. Only a few of Stormrider&amp;rsquo;s group were able to escape the purge and go into hiding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime, Stormrider was told by someone in league with Voldrangor that the rogue black dragon Tyrosian-Baed, not affiliated with the Chamber but certainly a powerful force on the continent of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik, possessed information about plans that could change the very landscape of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik. Stormrider traveled south into Xen&amp;rsquo;drik&amp;rsquo;s Marsh of Desolation to speak with Tyrosian-Baed, but the black dragon had entered an agreement with Voldrangor the Seeker to capture Stormrider when he came. Tyrosian-Baed and his lizardfolk followers captured Stormrider, as ordered by Voldrangor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now Stormrider&amp;rsquo;s network has been decimated, Stormrider himself is a captive, and a conspiracy against the city of Stormreach is beginning to unfold. Although the Crimson Codex knows nothing about this conspiracy yet, they will soon find themselves in the middle of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
