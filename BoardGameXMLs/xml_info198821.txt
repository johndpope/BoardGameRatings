							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bronx Street Cop</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five levels of tense action as you take on the role of Bronx Street Cop. The city is alive with criminals - armed robbers, crazed muggers, evil drug pushers. Only one thing stands in their way - New York's Police Department and its number one cop - YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;British peripheral manufacturer Cheetah released the Defender light gun in 1989. It came packaged with six games written by Codemasters, which were specially written or modified to work with the light-gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of these games, including Bronx Street Cop were subsequently released as standalone titles by Virgin Mastertronic. Instead of the Defender, the games were now compatible with the Sinclair / Amstrad Light Phaser. On the other side of the tape is a version which can be played with keyboard or joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bronx Street Cop is a standard shooting gallery. Starting out in Training School, the player shoots at targets. Graduating to the streets, the player must shoot criminals while avoiding civilians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
