							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sails of Glory Ship Pack: HMS Hamadryad 1797 / HMS Mahonesa 1796</name>
									
			<description>The HMS Hamadryad, before her capture, was named &amp;ldquo;Ninfa&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; a 36&amp;ndash;gun Spanish frigate built at Mahon, on the island of Minorca. After her capture, Ninfa was taken to Gibraltar where she was commissioned under Thomas Elphinstone as HMS Hamadryad. After capturing two privateers, her career as an English ship was a short one, as she sank whilst trying to shelter from a storm in Algiers Bay, on 25 December 1797.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ship pack can also be used to represent the British Mahonesa class frigate &amp;ldquo;HMS Mahonesa 1796&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
