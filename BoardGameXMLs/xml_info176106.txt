			<description>An Ameritrash, push-your-luck pirate game where players use a hand of Action cards (swords/sails/cannons) to gain as much Treasure and Infamy as possible! Sailing around a series of islands on a cloth map, players encounter ports, other players, and X's where Treasure may be buried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a variety of Treasures to possess and Infamy tokens to be gained by fighting pirates and ports or completing various Quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in rounds, with each player receiving up to 8 random Action cards. They may Sail, Pillage, Board other ships, Shoot other ships, and/or Dig or Bury Treasure. Using their Action cards they may do as many of these actions as desired during their turn if they have the necessary cards. But players don't draw new cards until the end of the round. Bidding at the end of each round allows players to compete for who goes first, and which direction play moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When 2 pirates are dead (the first player to die remains in the game as the ghost pirate), all the Treasure cards have been pillaged, OR any Quests are complete, the game ends. The player with the most Infamy points (Tokens and Treasure) wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
