							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Trip: The RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road Trip: The RPG is based on the idea that while everyone loves a good road trip we never quite get to get out on enough of them. Lots of fun and interesting things happen during a road trip. There are sights to see, interesting people to meet, and shared moments to experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I set out with the concept that there are certain elements that make up a road trip. First off there are the interesting characters who each have their own personalities and their own characteristics. These people also take on roles associated with the road trip, and based on these roles that they assume different actions can happen. So to me the idea that the game should be character driven was cemented in the ground. The characters inflict the game with their own brand of chaos and plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second element that makes up a proper road trip are the locations that the Trippers end up at. This bit should shadow the types of places that we always hear about and have found their way into the fabric of America on the go. The Roadside Attractions that draw millions of people a year, the rest stops that comfort and give respite to the millions of drivers traveling our roadways every day. The mom and pop restaurants that feed travelers and thrill seekers, those places that people tell you, if you are ever in Bassackwards, Arkansas then stop at Tiffanies, they have the greatest hamburgers ever. And of course the motels that dot our countryside providing us with places to sleep and to rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third element is the stories that we tell about our Road Trip. People are enthralled by the tale of a good road trip where you drove up a 12% grade, and when you peaked, your radiator blew out. Only to know that down at the bottom of the grade awaited a gas station with repair shop, so you shifted it into neutral, and just flew down the grade. No one is interested in what happened when you got to your destination, they want to know about the trials that you went through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I extracted the tedious bit of the system out and boiled it down to a quick and simple round based system, and left no rules in the game that in anyway restricted the role-playing. When it comes to visiting an attraction or setting up for the night, the game essentially becomes a free-form role-playing situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Conclusion, the system is not fully fleshed out and has ideas in it that I would love to play around with a little more, and put out a Deluxe version, but for now, it's playable. And remember those words: &amp;quot;The Greatest College Tradition of all Time: The Road Trip..&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
