			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scraps is a vehicle combat game where you can build your vehicle from the chassis up from functional parts, with design as your ally and physics as your accomplice. Compete against human or AI opponents in a combat arena, and scavenge from their wreckage to repair and upgrade your own creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scraps lets you create a vehicle that&amp;rsquo;s great or a vehicle that sucks. Maybe your vehicle falls over when it corners or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough power to fire its weapons &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s okay. Maybe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need an engine because it moves by firing its cannons backwards. You decide what you drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your design choices aren&amp;rsquo;t just cosmetic &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re truly functional and at the very least affect the weight and balance of your vehicle. Battle in single-player against the AI, on LAN, or over the Internet. Easily host your own LAN or Internet games. Using the Scraps demo, your friends can join a LAN game even if they don&amp;rsquo;t own the full game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
