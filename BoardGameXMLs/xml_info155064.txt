			<description>Players place the diamond shaped tiles in such a way as to form zodiacs which are hexagons of the six same astrological symbols.  Moon tiles act as wilds.  There is also a second game in which players are given an even set of tiles and simultaneously play to build structures as fast as they can to earn more tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
