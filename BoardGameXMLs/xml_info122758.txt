			<description>Venus &amp;amp; Braves: Majo to Megami to Horobi no Yogen (English: Venus and Braves: The Witch and the Goddess and the Prophecy of Destruction) is a pseudo-sequel to the 2-dimensional RPG Seven: Cavalry Troop of Molmorth, taking place in the same fantasy world. Venus &amp;amp; Braves includes both a single player mode and multiplayer PlayStation Network battles. The game's plot revolves around an immortal warrior named Blood Boall who is sent by a goddess to save the world from destruction in a hundred years' time. The story itself takes place during the ensuing century and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venus &amp;amp; Braves uses a &amp;quot;Rotation Battle System&amp;quot; in which seven characters are placed on a 4 block by 3 block isometric grid, and fight enemies in a similar pattern on the opposite grid. The abilities of characters are geared towards different rows; some may attack from the back row, while others may heal ally characters in the same row. Battle takes place automatically, with the player deciding whether to send the front row to the back at the end of the turn, thus &amp;quot;rotating&amp;quot; the field. As the field is rotated, the second row is sent to the front lines, and so on. If a character dies, they are permanently removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effectiveness of a character is determined by a number of stats, including an &amp;quot;assistance&amp;quot; attribute for attack and defense, and recovery attributes that affect the speed of a unit's healing and allow them to heal allies. There are over 50 individual unit types and 17 unit categories, and certain combinations of characters possess special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons can become stronger if they are continuously used by a certain character. These weapons retain their power if they are bequeathed to a younger party member and not merely removed from their previous user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Venus &amp;amp; Braves&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
