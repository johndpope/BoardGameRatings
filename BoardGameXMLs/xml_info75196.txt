			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight Night Round 3 is a boxing video game developed by EA Sports. It is the sequel to EA Sports' previous boxing title, Fight Night Round 2, which was released in 2005. Fight Night Round 3 was released on February 22, 2006 for the Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 3 version of the game was released on December 6, 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;Fight Night Round 3 is the third boxing title from EA Sports, upon succeeding from the Knockout Kings games on the PlayStation. It features the usual improvements such as better graphics and gameplay. &amp;quot;Impact Punches&amp;quot; are one of the most drastic changes, along with ESPN Classic fights and a new career mode, in which the player fights to gain popularity in order to reach sponsored fights, or to be featured on ESPN. Unlike in older versions, Round 3 defaults without a heads-up display (HUD), allowing a player to judge the status of their stamina and energy based on their stance, movements, and facial features, instead of the usual stamina meter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versions&lt;br/&gt;The game has been released for several video game consoles and some differences exist between the versions. The cover art features the late Arturo Gatti and Micky Ward on the PS2 and Xbox versions. The PS3, Xbox 360, and the PSP versions have Oscar De La Hoya on the cover. Only the PS3 version can be played in a first-person view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
