							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wicked Pizza</name>
									
			<description>In the modern world of edible witchcraft, pizzas have replaced the standard brews as the food of choice. In this tile laying style card game, players race to collect the 20 pizza scoring tokens by completing as many pizzas as possible. But beware the ingredients&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;wicked&amp;rdquo; special abilities and spell cards that will create havoc if they become activated. When the final scoring token is taken, the game ends and the scores are tallied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you will play either a pizza or spell card from your hand and then draw back up to 3 cards at the end of your turn. The 55 pizza cards have a variety of different layouts with quarter and half slices on them. In order to play a pizza card, it must be laid adjacent to another card already in play and must connect crusts with another card in play if possible. When 4 sections of pizza come together to complete a pizza, 1 or 2 points are scored depending on the number of ingredients that make up that pizza; pizza scoring tokens tokens are immediately claimed. If the pizza is made up of 3 or 4 of the same ingredient, that ingredient's special ability is activated. There are three copies of 4 different spell cards that allow for additional cards to be drawn, pizza cards to be played from the discard pile, add scoring to a non-ability activating pizza, and play a half pizza section of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also 4 bonus scoring cards, each showing 1 ingredient, that have two abilities: 1) worth 3 points if in possession of a player at the end of the game 2) have a half pizza slice on one side that can be played onto the board instead of playing a card from a player's hand. In order to claim these cards, a player must create a pizza that is made up entirely of 1 ingredient. When that happens, that player takes the card and places it in front of them. The card stays there until either the player uses the half pizza or the game ends. However, if another player creates the same type of pizza, they steal it from whoever has it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
