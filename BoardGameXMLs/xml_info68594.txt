							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dante&#039;s Inferno</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Descent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outside the city walls of Acre, Dante finds himself in a dark forest.  For him, the clear path has been lost, and only the visions of slaughter and war can be seen clearly.  The Bishop's promises were nothing but empty lies, words spoken without the authority of God.  Lost in the madness, Dante's passions consume him as he gives into the darkness.  Now, at the crossroads of this world and the next, only Dante's love for his Beatrice keeps him moving forward.  The darkness however, is not done with Dante and has taken his love where no living man may go.  Dante is now faced with the impossible task of reclaiming his love from the furthest reaches of Hell itself.  With the help of a poet and the fire in his heart, Dante begins his descent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
