			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players must score the most possible points by filling spaces of an 8x8 board; whole rows and columns add extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player throws the die in their turn and ticks with their own symbol (dot, circle, square or cross) as many consecutive spaces on one row or column of the board as pips they've thrown; any free space on the whole board can be chosen to start this segment, but no space on the selected segment can be already marked by the player (different symbols can coincide on the same square, though). Dice throws that can't be used are forfeited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When every space on the board has at least one symbol the game ends; every symbol scores 1 point and every whole row or column scores extra 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
