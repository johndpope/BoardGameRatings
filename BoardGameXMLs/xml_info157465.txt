			<description>Cartoon is a 3 players simulation boardgame of a cartoonish situation. The players are a dog, a cat and a mouse - each one a pwn moving on the squared-grid map of a house with garden. During the 61-75 turns of the game, the dog will try to put the cat KO and keep order, the mouse witt try to put the cat KO and stay in the kitchen as long as possible, and the cat will try to put both opponents KOas much as possible. Objects can be taken, thrown and broken in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, each player secretly choose an action: attack, move, take an object, drop or throw an object and so on. Actions are executed in a strict order according to the turn structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Published on Kaos magazine 1.5 (Nexus Editrice, 1994).
