			<description>Spr&amp;aring;kspelet (&amp;quot;The Language Game&amp;quot;) is a set of cards with phrases in Swedish and Northern Sami, intended as a tool to teach and promote knowledge and use of the Northern Sami language. In addition to use of the cards as a teaching or conversational aid, they are sold as a game with several largely similar modes of playing. Gameplay can be summed up as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. At the start of the game, each player gets a portion of the deck as a draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Every round, each player picks up a card from their draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The current player reads a question from their card (in Sami).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Each other player in turn selects and reads a statement from their card (also in Sami).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. The current player decides which other player had the most fun or appropriate response, awarding them a point which is tracked by setting aside a card. The next player clockwise will then read a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Play continues until a certain number of points has been reached or a certain number of questions has been read, at which point the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is sold as a box with a book and three decks using different forms of declension, or as a single deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
