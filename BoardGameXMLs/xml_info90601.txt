							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nancy Drew: #8 The Haunted Carousel</name>
									
			<description>Game #8 in the Nancy Drew Adventure series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, as Nancy Drew&amp;reg;, are invited to the Jersey shore to investigate a series of mishaps at the Captain&amp;rsquo;s Cove Amusement Park. First, the lead horse was stolen from the carousel. Then the roller coaster suddenly lost power, resulting in a serious accident. Now the merry-go-round is mysteriously starting up in the middle of the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The amusement park is closed while the insurance company looks into the roller coaster accident. Nancy begins her own investigation by interviewing park employees, including office manager Joy Trent; chief engineer Ingrid Corey; security officer Harlan Bishop, and Elliot Chen, the park&amp;rsquo;s art director.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As her search unfolds, Nancy learns about the lonely craftsman who carved the carousel horses, and about the sad history of the park&amp;rsquo;s former owner, Daryl Trent. Before he died he hid puzzles and riddles throughout the park to reunite his daughter Joy with her past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only after solving a series of challenging puzzles and avoiding several deadly traps, does Nancy discover the truth behind the haunted carousel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a spin with danger to unravel the mystery of a ghostly merry-go-round! Are the painted ponies searching for their missing lead horse, or is there another explanation for the midnight rides?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
