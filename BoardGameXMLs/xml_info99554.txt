							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">J: The Misere Connection Game</name>
									
			<description>J: The Misere Connection Game is in the family of connection games that include Hex and Gonnect. It is unique in that players can win if they force their opponent to form a connection between two areas on the board, and takes place on an 8x4 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origins of this game date back to a failed attempt to come up with a connection game for Stonehenge, which had an outer track that is very long but very tight.  The shift to a set 8x4 board caused the game to be viewed differently than on the circular board of Stonehenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another unique aspect to J is that players can LOSE the game if they form a certain type of connection, which would be a misere condition in a connection game.  This is also a a unique feature.  I had been pondering how to do one and J provides the opportunity to do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features several other uncommon features, besides the small board and misere game ending condition, like piece recycling, and also entire lines of pieces being pushed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
