			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the shadow of Valind's Glacier and desolate Winterwood, the Fronelan lands shiver as they adjust to life after over a century of God Learner domination. Loskalm seeks to re-establish the ways of St Hrestol; the Janube City States are gripped by a confusion of beliefs and creeds; and, in the east, the Fronelan Orlanthi are still in the grip of Wyrmfriendism despite the efforts of the Carmanians to break the Dragon's stranglehold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fronela is a land of distinct cultural contrasts: from the strangeness of Sog City and its Zzabur-established university, through the courtly cities and culture of Loskalm, to the draconic influence and resistant True Church Malkionism of the Janube cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are secrets and dangers aplenty. For al its stability the Loskalmi still remember old scores that arose under God Learner rule, and the Janubians, conquered by both Loskalm and the God Learners, are determined to forge their own identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book describes Fronela, its cultures, its people and the competing forces. Here you will find opportunities for noble, chivalric service; scholarly endeavour and pursuit; draconic mysticism; and the scheming remnants of the God Learner empire. And hovering over all this are the mysterious hsunchen of the north, wary of humans and determined to resist their ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as details on each of the core Fronelan lands you will also find the city state of Galastar, founded by the eponymous Hrestoli hero, and adventures set within it, and competing Eastpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Fronela. . . adventure awaits you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
