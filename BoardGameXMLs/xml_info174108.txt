							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Children of Bones</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The near forgotten tribe of bones was crushed beneath the heel of the forming empire. The ponies that made it up were killed or scattered, but they were never entirely destroyed. Remnants of this once powerful tribe still lurk through the pony lands, and even beyond it, praying to the Soft Whisper and doing their small parts to tend to the deceased of ponykind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn more about these shamans, with expanded historic information, stats to play your own, new spells and feats, as well as a tribe specific class archetype in this player-friendly expansion for Ponyfinder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
