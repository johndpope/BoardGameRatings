			<description>In &amp;ldquo;Over The Edge!&amp;rdquo;, each player tries to be the first to circumnavigate the Flat Earth and avoid falling over the edge into the abyss. During their voyage, they hope to avoid disease, inclement weather, mutiny, and the dreaded &amp;ldquo;dead calm.&amp;rdquo; Players can also cause havoc to the fortunes to other players if so inclined. The board is a representation of a world map of the 15th century depicting a flat earth with a single &amp;ldquo;old world&amp;rdquo; continent surrounded by the seas. As captain of their ship, each player decides when to sail on to the next port. Is the crew loyal? Have repairs been made? Are the winds favorable (and will they last)? Play your cards carefully, and you may be the first to return to your home port successfully without falling &amp;ldquo;Over the Edge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
