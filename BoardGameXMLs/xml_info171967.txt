			<description>Spin the spinner and move your playing piece clockwise around the board. Object of the game is to collect he most Gargoyle character playing cards as possible and to get rid of as many Xanatos and/or Demona cards collected during the game as you can before the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all 32 cards in the deck have been played, players may disregard all spaces landed on except the Elisa Maza space. As soon as a player lands on any Castle Space the game ends. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game. Points are scored by number of Gargoyle character cards you have. Each card is worth one point. If any players have Xanatos and/or Demona cards, subtract one point each from your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
