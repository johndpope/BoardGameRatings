							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drumlin</name>
									
			<description>Drumlin is an abstract strategy game that is set in the Ice Age.  The background of the story is that a magical stone, the Drumlin, has thawed out from the glaciers.  Upon touching the stone, elephants turn into dragons and this fills the animals with fear.  Two rival elephantine tribes, each controlled by a player, decide to dump the stone onto their rival's territory and make it their concern instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are free to move their pieces around on the board, even into squares with their own pieces or opponent's.  They take control of the Drumlin when their piece moves onto it.  In a square with several pieces, the player with a majority of pieces takes control.  The player in control can then pass the Drumlin to another square, depending on the formation of his or her pieces.  The passing elephant then turns into a dragon, which cannot pass or catch the Drumlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to pass the Drumlin onto his or her opponent's edge of the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
