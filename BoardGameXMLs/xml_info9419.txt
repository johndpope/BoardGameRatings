			<description>From the Homepage of Kidult Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Knox is a game of logic that will put to the test the abilities of an &amp;quot;unknown band&amp;quot; of robbers.&lt;br/&gt;At turn one of the players will guard the safe and will protect its contents thanks to a numerical combination that he has chosen. The remaining players (from 2 to 4) will have to discover the combination paying maximum attention to the &amp;quot;Clicks&amp;quot; of the opening mechanism as it rotates. All of the players compete to decipher the opening code, but... the money will go to the player who will be able to open the safe for first thanks to the clues he found and from the other players as well: eyes wide open and ears unplugged and please! it is absolutely prohibited to write down notes, in the vault there isn't light to write things down and you certainly can't turn the light on, risking to be discovered. A suggestion, it's lots of fun to play Fort Knox in more rounds, as many as the number of players so that each one at turn can be the guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the game pdf file at the Kidult Homepage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
