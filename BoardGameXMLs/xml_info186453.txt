			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create a Legend (character) by distributing points from three separate pools.  Archetype points determine the Legend's Archetype (class); Main points determine advantages, disadvantages, Skills, and Statistics (abilities); and Personality points determine mental qualities.  Legends select one, two, or three Archetypes from Warrior, Rogue, or Caster.  Disadvantages are selected to &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; points in the Main pool while Advantages, Skills, and Statistic Values are purchased with points.  Generally speaking, high Statistics Values are somewhat inexpensive.  Numerous derived values then are calculated, including combat, Health Points (hit points), and so forth.  Finally, Personality and Mental Traits are purchased from the Personality pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Statistic (ability) has a length table detailing associated ability from the Value.  Tables are provided for Strength, Agility, Combat, Health, Aptitude, and Appearance.  Each Skill has a Point value and is based on a particular Statistic.  The Skill list is lengthy.  Combat is fairly complex and requires the attacker and the defender both to generate rolls which are compared to determine results.  Combat supposes that actions are pre-determined and cannot be changed during a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic system is unique and uses a &amp;quot;Noun&amp;quot; plus &amp;quot;Verb&amp;quot; construction to generate an on-the-spot customization of effect.  Each Noun and each Verb specifies a &amp;quot;Word Point&amp;quot; cost and a Casting Time which are added together for the final result.  Magic is further circumscribed by Word Definitions (to avoid arguments) and Spell Limitations (presumably to assist in game balance).  A sample spell from the rules is given thusly:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Magic will create5.2 fire(6)3.2 on1.1 creature(wolf)1.3 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
