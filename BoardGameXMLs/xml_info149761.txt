			<description>Guncon 2 (G-Con 2 in Europe) features a smaller body, as well as a more rounded shape when compared with the original Guncon. The side buttons, A and B, have been moved rearward to a position directly above the trigger. Two new smaller buttons, SELECT and START, have been added to the left side of the shaft. Prominent additions to this second Guncon model is a D-pad at the back of the gun barrel and a C button added at the bottom of the gun handle. These new buttons served to open new gameplay opportunities, such as character movement in Dino Stalker or the ability to use two guns at once in Time Crisis II. Unlike the previous controller, the gun uses a USB connection as opposed to a PlayStation controller port. The controller is released in black in Japan, blue in Europe, and orange in North America. It is not compatible with original PlayStation titles or PlayStation 3 titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Guncon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gun Controller designed by Namco for Playstation 2, update of the Playstation G-Con 45.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
