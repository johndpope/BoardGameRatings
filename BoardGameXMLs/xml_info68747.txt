			<description>The board shows a city with lots of high buildings between which the players roll and move. When a player pawn reaches a black field, the player can look at the top face-down tile next to it and keep it if so desired. If not, he/she puts it back on top of any stack. When a player rolls a 6, he/she can demand a tile from another player who has four tiles or more. The goal is to collect a thief tile and exactly 140 Marks (money tiles come in 50s, 20s and 10s). The first player to achieve this is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(user summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
