							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skunk</name>
									
			<description>Another push-your-luck dice game, like the original Skunk, although in this one the object is to roll skunks, not to avoid rolling them.  Each player's turn consists of one roll of from one to five dice, as they choose; every skunk rolled counts as one letter in spelling &amp;quot;skunk&amp;quot;.  The dice are then passed to the next player.  The first player to accumulate exactly five skunks (one for each letter in &amp;quot;skunk&amp;quot;) wins, but if any player rolls more skunks than they need, they have to start over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
