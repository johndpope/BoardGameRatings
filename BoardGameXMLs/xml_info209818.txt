			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of David Foxfire's 5E Campaign world begins here:  At first, it looks like your basic OSR world with some unique quirks, until the adventurers realize that there is a modern world underneath them, waiting to be rediscovered. &amp;AElig;thercoil puts an interesting--and even noble bright--twist on a post-apocalyptic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;AElig;thercoil Magazine will not only chronicle the development of this campaign setting, it will also compile many character options, monster settings (with adjustable Stat Blocks) and tips on Dungeon Mastering, many of them too small to put into a single document themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents of &amp;AElig;thercoil Magazine #1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthro Races:  Catfolk, Wolffolk, Raccoonfolk&lt;br/&gt;    The Eladrin Race&lt;br/&gt;    Arcane Archer Prestige Class&lt;br/&gt;    Warlock Patron: Arch Witch&lt;br/&gt;    An explanation of a Dual Feywild and a Shadowfell&lt;br/&gt;    A 5E translation of The Dark Power Mechanic&lt;br/&gt;    The Witch Customized Wizard Class&lt;br/&gt;    The Red Haired Elf, Chapter 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Foxfire has been playing&amp;mdash;and Dungeon Mastering&amp;mdash;in D&amp;amp;D 5th Edition since it's playtesting, and is using the system to create his own homemade campaigns and even his own Campaign Setting known as &amp;AElig;thercoil.  Before that time, he has been doing webcomics and illustration, of which his art style will become part of these submissions to this site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
