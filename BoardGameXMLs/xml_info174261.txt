							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sons of Cronus</name>
									
			<description>It is a story as old as time: brothers fighting amongst themselves to prove who is strongest. These brothers, however, are the mighty Greek gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, the sons of the great Titan Cronus. And through you, they fight for control over the land, seas, and skies of Ancient Greece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;Sons of Cronus is a three player trick taking game. The cards feature three suits, one representing each of the gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Several powerful Myth cards represent other figures from Greek mythology with special abilities that add a wrinkle to the gameplay. The players score points by correctly predicting how many tricks they think they will take each round. The player who best manages his cards and scores the most points after the sixth round wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
