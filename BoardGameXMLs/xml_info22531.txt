			<description>A baseball game that is spinner-activated. The spinner and all four-color charts come on one heavy-duty cardboard base. Underlying the spinner is a printed disk divided into pie sections containing realistic percentages of singles, doubles, triples, home runs, walks, strikeouts, fly outs, out-at-first (and a thin sliver for a possible triple play). Also on same gameboard, four charts: Nobody on Base, 1 on Base, 2 on Base, 3 on Base. Each chart gives results for 0, 1, or 2 outs and contains various results including: hit-by-pitch, 2-base error, out stretching a single into a double, out at 2nd, out at 3rd, five levels of double-plays, caught stealing, stolen base, one-base error, four levels of singles results, pick-off, fielder's choice, balk, passed ball, or wild pitch. Game comes with 9 plastic pegs to keep track of action. Peg charts include Runs Scored, Innings Played, Outs, and Batters (one peg on either side of home plate). Comes with two-sided &amp;quot;Spinner Results&amp;quot; sheet which lists explanations for all abbreviations describing play outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
