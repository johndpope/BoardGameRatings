							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robotech RPG Adventures Ghost Ship</name>
									
			<description>From page 4, Preface: &amp;quot;Welcome to the latest in the series of ROBOTECH supplements from Palladium Books.  Ghost Ship is designed to be used as an adventure module, or a long scenario, for the series.  You must have the ROBOTECH Role-Playing Game to play this adventure.  the basic rules for rolling up a character and initiating combat are to be found in that sourcebook, along with much more valuable information.  Of course, the other Macross books in the ROBOTECH series of supplements will be helpful, but are not mandatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular adventure takes place before the time period developed in the Southern Cross.  However, experimental versions of Southern Cross Mecha can be made available.  For details and modifiers, see the Game Master Section in the back of the book.  To simplify the general description, no characters or Mecha that were not outlined in the initial ROBOTECH Role-Playing Game book are used in this book.  If someone would like to change this campaign to include other armor or O.C.C. classes, it should be noted that much of the mecha in later supplements are MUCH more powerful than that of Macross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the adventure is moderately difficult, designed for a party of between three and six players.  More players can participate, although the group may get a bit unwieldy or the game master may have to beef up the antagonists.  If someone would like to enter the campaign after it has been started, the role of a human hostage, waiting to be rescued, can we worked into the game at practically any point.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
