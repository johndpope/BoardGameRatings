							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghostbusters: The Board Game II â€“ Get Real Pack</name>
									
			<description>Containing 23 minis inspired by the classic The Real Ghostbusters cartoon! And that&amp;rsquo;s not all: The pack comes with Ally Cards that introduce exciting new gameplay elements. The add-on is a CZE-exclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the Ghostbusters team&amp;mdash;Peter, Ray, Egon, Winston, and even Janine&amp;mdash;with the minis designed to resemble the characters from The Real Ghostbusters (RGB). They can be used as cosmetic swap-outs for the regular Ghostbusters in the game OR they can be used as Allies (a new rule).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survey the city for paranormal hotspots with this 50mm vehicle. An autogyro that up to two Ghostbusters can ride, the Ecto-2 moves up to eight spaces uninhibited by map obstacles or other Entities. It has a fuel limit, though, and will become unusable if flown too many times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The add-on pack includes Real Ghostbusters plastic minis that upgrade the cardboard tokens in the game: eight Goo Piles, five Gates, and four Traps. These minis can also double as figure stands for those of you who want to display your paranormal paint jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
