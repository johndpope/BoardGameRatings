							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polar Pool</name>
									
			<description>Alex and his Polar pals bring an Arctic touch to an already cool sport. Play classic games like 8 and 9-ball, or use power-ups, bonus pockets, and special characters to master the game of Power Pool. Three game modes let you play by yourself, with family, or compete in online matches at any time. As you sharpen your skills, even more comical characters and whimsical levels unlock for your enjoyment. Chalk up your cue and play some pool - just watch out for airborne penguins! Play Polar Pool today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike normal pool games, there is more to this than just the Arctic Theme.  You can control your movement and jump even while being struck by the cue.  The lighthearted atmosphere is very unlike a real pool hall, and the arctic theme is fleshed out by different creatures arriving to walk around on the table (functioning like slow moving balls), and slippery table-tops from icy conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
