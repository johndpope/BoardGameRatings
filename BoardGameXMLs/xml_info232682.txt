			<description>Sequel&lt;br/&gt;Prompted by the popularity of the Microsoft releases, Sommerville created a sequel, Chip's Challenge 2 in 1999. Sommerville was unable to release it independently, as the trademark was owned by Bridgestone Multimedia Group. Bridgestone, a Christian publishing company, had purchased Epyx's assets when that company folded in order to acquire Bible software produced by the company. Bridgestone had little experience with the video game industry, and required that Sommerville pay a six-figure fee for the right to publish the game, which was not consistent with industry norms. Sommerville resumed negotiations in 2010 and, after five years, Bridgestone and Sommerville's company Niffler released Chip's Challenge 2 via Steam on May 28, 2015, alongside a Steam release of the original game and a level editor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the negotiation period, Sommerville's company Niffler also developed other similar puzzle games. Chuck's Challenge was released in 2012 for iOS systems from the iTunes Store. The game was later licensed by Cartoon Network as the basis for a series official Ben 10 games called Ben 10 Game Generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge%23Sequel Chip's Challenge]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
