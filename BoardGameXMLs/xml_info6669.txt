			<description>Commissioned by the Paris board of transportation, players move around the Paris subway and bus networks. Each has a specific character chosen from the twenty-four available, e.g. Architect, Student, Nightclubber, Movie Buff... Children down to age 8 can play the Urchin and the Parisian Kid. The players must answer questions pertaining to their chosen character. The first who completes a predetermined circuit wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are general knowledge, historic, cultural, weird... :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- For the Writer: What kind of animal did G&amp;eacute;rard de Nerval take out for a walk at the Palais-Royal ?&lt;br/&gt;- For the Musician: In which famous club did Boris Vian play jazz ?&lt;br/&gt;- For the Cemetery Keeper: What did Cyrano of Bergerac and Moli&amp;egrave;re have in common ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters were drawn by the French artist Tignous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I find it interesting to combine variable powers with a trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
