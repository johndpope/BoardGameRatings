							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wise Men</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is a fanciful vision of the adventures the wise men could have experienced as they traveled from the Far East to Bethlehem.  A few liberties have been taken with the text to make the adventure playable and exciting.  Each member of a small group of players can represent a wise man since no definitive number is given in scripture, though there were probably at least three (one for each gift).  The Once Born Non-Player Character rules are used for the wise man characters since the wise men are essentially Old Testament personalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
