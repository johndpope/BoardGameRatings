							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Viking Horde: Papercraft</name>
									
			<description>Viking Horde: Papercraft is a paper-craft fantasy Viking warship game for two or more players pitting opposing fleets against each other for naval supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to manoeuvre your fleet to strategically engage and sink enemy player ships in order to claim mastery over the Nordic seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played either on the floor or sheltered areas outside, Viking Horde: Papercraft features a one-ship-at-a-time mechanic making for a fast and engaging player turn rotation, even with huge ship fleets. The game employs on-hand measuring devices, namely player's feet, to gauge movement and attack distances, and makes use of a custom paper-craft dice set to resolve ship vs ship combat and other aspects of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core game mechanics include:&lt;br/&gt; - One ship activation per player turn, allows for an engaging game for all players right to the very end.&lt;br/&gt; - Directional wind mechanic to tactically enhance ship movement.&lt;br/&gt; - Ship crew members, with class based abilities and roles.&lt;br/&gt; - Ranged and Melee based combat system though use of D6 outcomes.&lt;br/&gt; - Removable shields attached to the sides of each ship to track damage.&lt;br/&gt; - Modularised ruleset (expansion packs and optional rules can be swapped in/out at the groups discretion).&lt;br/&gt; - Floating loot provides random power-ups, events and penalties.&lt;br/&gt; - Ship movement through on-hand measuring devices for simplicity.&lt;br/&gt; - The paper-craft kits for the game come pre-cut and assembly is glue free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
