							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GO Smiley!</name>
									
			<description>THEME:&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on a comical aspect pulled from Jaime Buckley's &amp;quot;Chronicles of a Hero&amp;quot; series--the animated smiley face on the main character's shirt. Always revealing the true feelings of Wendell through silent expressions, this concept was applied to the comical facial expressions of the game cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Based on the traditional GO FISH! rules (both US and AUSTRALIAN versions), players must ask for cards by mimicking the facial expressions contained on their card. If the player being asked does not have the expression asked for, they respond by saying &amp;quot;GO Smiley!&amp;quot; and a card is drawn. Traditional rules apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL:&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the stock runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GO Smiley! is also used as a memory game for children&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
