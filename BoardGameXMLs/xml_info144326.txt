							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myths and Consequences</name>
									
			<description>The purpose of this game is to dispel commonly held myths related to teen pregnancy and sexuality and to show the consequences for one's quality of life. In the process of playing, teenagers will be challenged to face the real consequences of sex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While moving around the board, players will draw cards dealing with the subjects of Sex Facts, Health and Disease, Contraceptives, Sex and Values, and Sex and Success. Correctly answering the questions on these cards gives the player points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain spaces on the board will force the player to spin the Sex Wheel of Fortune.  Of the several results on the spinner, one is pregnancy. Some spaces also will cause a pregnancy. Failure to maintain your score above a certain point will also result in pregnancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pregnancy forces players into a Dilemma. Female players will have to decide on which path to take: Adoption, Motherhood, or Abortion. Male players will have to decide on which path to take: Support or Marriage. Each choice may have different consequences affecting a player's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a predetermined period of gameplay, players will tally their scores.  The player(s) with the higher scores have increased their chances of success and happiness while those with lower scores have diminished their chances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
