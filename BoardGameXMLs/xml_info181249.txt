			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have NO fear, this is not a trivia based game. Because it is not trivia based this allows everyone to pick-up and play the game easily. REBUKE: Compact Trials is a cooperative family game that is similar to the original REBUKE game, but has been condensed so that younger audiences can play. Definitions have also been added to the game to help players understand the meaning of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win:&lt;br/&gt;This game is about teamwork. To win, at the end of the game everyone must be free from all their Sin cards. There are 2 scenarios for winning the game. #1. Everyone has no Sin cards in front of them and there are no cards left in the Deck or #2. Everyone has no Sin cards in front of them and the only card left in the Deck is the Repent to Jesus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great to play with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ministries&lt;br/&gt;     Bible Studies&lt;br/&gt;     Families&lt;br/&gt;     Friends&lt;br/&gt;     Churches&lt;br/&gt;     Academy Classrooms&lt;br/&gt;     Anti-Bullying School Programs&lt;br/&gt;     Road Tripping&lt;br/&gt;     Game Nights&lt;br/&gt;     Camping&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
