							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bye-Bye Balloons</name>
									
			<description>Bye-Bye Balloons is a simple children's game for 2-4 players.  The object of the game is to get rid of all of the cards in your hand.  Each card depicts a brightly colored balloon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the Spinnerific to determine the balloon color that players can discard.  On your turn, you spin the Spinnerific and discard a balloon of the color shown on the Spinnerific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is good for reinforcing colors with small children and also good for teaching basic lessons to children about taking turns and fairness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 3+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
