							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creatures 2 â€“ Torture Trouble</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures 2 was a sequel to Creatures, and programmed by the same team, Apex Computer Productions. However, unlike the first game, the Torture Screens were the main game in Creatures 2, and the bonus stages in between the torture screens were small mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures 2 was released during the end of the C64 era, and featured for the platform a stunning display of impossible feats, such as enemies having colours that did not exist, more moving objects than the hardware could manage, and so on; something that was usually only used on the demo scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;John Rowlands: Program&lt;br/&gt;Steve Rowlands: Graphics, music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
