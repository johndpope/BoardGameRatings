							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fringe Races: Rogues</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're above you... they're below you... they might even be next to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first book in the fringe series introduces four new races from the edge of society. The crag goblin is a flying humanoid race dwelling in the highest, most hard to reach places of the world. Darkness Dwellers are subterranean humans that exist in absolute darkness, no longer needing vision. Impets are mischievous diminutive flying fey, whose appearance hints at their devilish nature. Moon Sirens are a race of females who have been given an extended lifespan and powers over others by their goddess. Each race's favored class is rogue, and provides complete racial information for players, as well as stat blocks for DM's. The book also includes two new deities, one new domain, 11 new spells, 3 new weapons, a new poison, and 6 new magic items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
