			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something's gone wrong, you're not etirely sure what it was, but it has affected the whole team. Will you work out the answers before everything falls apart?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entire RPG (pretty crude, but enough to get you playing) in 200 words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that is required for play is a few dice, some pencils and some blank sheets of paper to write characters on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the entire rule set is 200 words, it will require players who are both familar with the conventions of roleplaying games, and able to ad lib stories by feeding off one another's prompts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
