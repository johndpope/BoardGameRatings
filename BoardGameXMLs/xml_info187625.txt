			<description>Marseille Sophistiqu&amp;eacute; is your guide to one of the most complex families of card games in the world! A 78-card deck, elegantly illustrated and faithful to the sensibility of its 15th century origins, updated with modern gameplay in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tarocchi family of games is a historical set of point-trick taking games, played in a series of zero-sum hands. Most in the family include a signature fluctuating team system where one bids for the high-risk, high-reward position of the single opponent to the other players, who form a temporary team for the duration of the hand. Players may additionally bet on a series of secondary goals, to achieve bonus points along with those for the hand itself. A game is played to a variable number of rounds in which each player deals a hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marseille Sophistiqu&amp;eacute; includes an introductory rulebook, containing historical game rules for&lt;br/&gt;-Baronetti, a simple 2-player introductory rules set that focuses on the basic point-trick principles, also good for fast games and appropriate for children&lt;br/&gt;-Scarto, a 3-player free-for-all&lt;br/&gt;-French Tarot, the classic 4-player, team-based trick taking game, with variants for 3-6 players&lt;br/&gt;-adaptations for 5-suited Poker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free digital content extends these rules to include&lt;br/&gt;-Droggn, a 3-4 player game with a smaller deck, more forgiving to the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;-Hungarian Tarokk, a 4-5 player game with an advanced bonus system&lt;br/&gt;-Illustrated Hungarian Tarokk, a variant for those who have mastered Hungarian Tarokk&lt;br/&gt;-Rules variants reflecting some of the regional iterations of games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
