			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2+ players. Italy 1200-1550. Each player is an Italian City State. Victory: Play ends after everyone has had 10 turns. The Player with the most Provinces wins. If Provinces are tied, the tied player with the most Ducats wins. Defeat: If you are ever reduced to zero Provinces, you automatically lose. Whoever conquers your last Province gets all of your cards and Ducats.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays one of eight Italian city states and starts with five provinces, represented by five tokens. The provinces (tokens) must be captured through card play battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
