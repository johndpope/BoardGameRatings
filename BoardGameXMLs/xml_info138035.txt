							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2000AD: Rogue Trooper Miniatures Game</name>
									
			<description>By the same designer and publisher of the Judge Dredd Miniatures Game, 2000AD: Rogue Trooper Miniatures Game is a science-fiction skirmish 28mm miniatures wargame based (as the title suggests!) on the Rogue Trooper stories of the classic British comic, 2000AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Kickstarter project started in February 2013, successfully funded within one day of launch, the intention is to publish a hardback rulebook and a range of miniatures for both sides, of the perpetual civil war on Nu-Earth.  The Nort and Souther armies are asymmetrical (army lists are featured in the rulebook; units each have a base points cost and upgrades available for additional points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of the game is intended to be from a handful of miniatures (one GI vs. a Nort squad for example) up to company level actions, including light vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The range planned for release currently includes:&lt;br/&gt;GI Rogue Trooper&lt;br/&gt;Souther soldier squad set (8 figs)&lt;br/&gt;Nort soldier squad set (8 figs)&lt;br/&gt;Nort elite assault squad set (8 figs)&lt;br/&gt;Nort &amp;amp; Souther officer squad set (6 figs)&lt;br/&gt;Souther lazooker team squad set (6 figs)&lt;br/&gt;Nort snipers and Black Dome sniper squad set (7 figs)&lt;br/&gt;Skorpion Battlewagon (light tank, 3 variants planned)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troops have their own basic statistics (points cost, movement, defence and armour values, morale (called Will-to-Fight; WtF in this game!), individual abilities (traits) etc. which are then augmented by the range and damage ratings of the weapon with which they are equipped (range, damage, traits).  The more powerful a weapon is, the more combat dice rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules cover ranged and close combat, remote weapons, indirect fire, elevation, suppression, air units, fighting from and in structures, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions can be generated within the 'Engagement' chapter by combining various mission profiles (attack, defend, probe, hold, etc) to give an alternative to simple meeting engagements of equal cost forces.  Success or failure is adjudicated by victory points specific to the various missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NB: This information is based upon the first release of the draft rulebook, and thus may be subject to change before release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
