			<description>In this two player game one player is 'pro' nuclear energy, the other player is an environmentalist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player places 'neutral' nuclear power plants on a central zone of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two pawns he puts on the edges of the board.&lt;br/&gt;They each try to reach the 'neutral' power plants (by roll and move mechanism). The environmental player replaces the neutral power plants with trees, the 'pro-nuclear' player replaces it with a nuclear plant in his color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players have the ability to put obstacles on the board in order to slow down the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all neutral plants have been replaced.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who made the most replacements (and thus has the most neutral tokens in his possession).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
