			<description>Naughty &amp;amp; Nice is a quick playing card game I made for a friend's 30th birthday.  During the game you play cards on yourself and on other players to increase or decrease your Naughty and Nice ratings.  The object of the game is to end with the highest Naughty and Nice ratings with the smallest difference between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also Shiny! cards.  You can play Shiny! cards to take cards from other players.  At the end of the game, each Shiny! card has a 50/50 chance of being worth points.  If a Shiny! card is worth points, you can add it to your Naughty score or your Nice score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naughty &amp;amp; Nice is a game for two to four players. It uses a custom card deck and a single die. A four-player game takes about 30 minutes to play. While the gameplay is rather simple, the ever-so-slightly mature theme of the game makes Naughty &amp;amp; Nice appropriate for Ages 16 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
