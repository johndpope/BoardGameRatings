			<description>Tourist Trap is a card game where you see how many vacations you can complete before you run out of money. But beware, the tourist traps want their share of your vacation money too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This family card game is played by placing mileage cards on different destinations. Once a destination is completed and the player returns home they get the points on that card. While traveling, others may play Tourist Trap cards which will actually cost the player even more of their vacation cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [The Game Crafter, LLC].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
