			<description>Put your sense of smell to the test with Top Scent, a fun party game by the French toy maker Sentosph&amp;egrave;re. This simple game features 96 bright adorable fruit cards and 12 aroma diffusers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out the cards equally among all players. The players sit in a circle and must smell the same aroma diffuser without revealing their answer to the other players. Roll the dice to determine how many times you will have to find the fruit on the cards. All players must put their cards successively in the middle to form a pile in the center of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the recognized fruit appears the number of times as indicated on the dice, the first player to slap the pile collects those cards. The winner is the one who won the most cards at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
