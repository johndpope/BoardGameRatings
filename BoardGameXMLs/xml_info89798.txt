			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robinson's Requiem is a 1994 survival simulation game developed by Silmarils and published by ReadySoft. Players assume the role of Officer Trepliev, a member of the fictional Alien World Exploration (AWE) department, whose spacecraft is sabotaged to crash land on a prison planet called Zarathustra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following this, the player must explore and survive in the hostile alien environment, while using the game's systems to monitor the player character's health status, perform surgery and create makeshift tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rich Pelley of Amiga Power found the game to be extremely boring; he likened playing it to &amp;quot;being told to paint a fence and [...] discover[ing that] it's fifteen miles long&amp;quot;. He also criticized its graphics and performance, and noted that the game's survival systems amounted to &amp;quot;lots of bars and charts and electrocardiograms, and not much action&amp;quot;. The game also received poor reviews from both PC Gamer UK and PC Gamer US, who found the game frustrating and uninviting, and criticized its graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Robinson's Requiem&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
