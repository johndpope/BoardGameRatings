			<description>Subtitle: A Rules-Light Roleplaying Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folklore is a complete rules-light generic roleplaying game designed to be playable after about ten minutes of reading, with enough structure to keep your adventures running smoothly. If you and your friends want to slay dragons and save princesses with little to no prep-time, Folklore just may be the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been trimmed down to the point that the entire rules set fits into a nice 4 page pamphlet. The pamphlet is merely a double sided 8.5 x 11 piece of paper folded in half.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folklore&amp;rsquo;s system uses standard six-sided dice in play, requiring players a certain amount of successes on their dice to overcome conflict. A die is considered to have rolled a success if it produces the numbers 4, 5, or 6. The system has been built around this dice mechanic and since the math never strays away from addition or subtraction, even kids should be able to play with relative ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
