			<description>City Inc, is a city building card game for two to six players! With an easy to learn, hard to master style of play.  Each player is tasked to help build a great city, while trying to tailor it towards your Agenda and Occupation. Featuring a blocky 16-bit art style coming with over 100 cards and a quick to learn rule set making it easy for the whole family and friends to learn and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excerpt from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, rich sucker wise investor! As a new majority shareholder in the company, this orientation tour will teach you the basics of running a multinational conglomerate successfully. By the time we&amp;rsquo;re done with you, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the ability to shape the company&amp;rsquo;s direction as we expand into the city of Metropolitia and absolutely will not be a figurehead whose pocket we&amp;rsquo;re picking. Definitely not. Perish the thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving right along, I suppose you&amp;rsquo;d like a tour of the place? Given that you control it, that seems pretty reasonable. Well, here we go then&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;90 City Building Cards &lt;br/&gt;6 occupation cards &lt;br/&gt;6 agenda cards &lt;br/&gt;6 Headlines &lt;br/&gt;1 Rules Sheet &lt;br/&gt;1 Tuckbox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a fair haul, huh? Just goes to show that a few billion dollars still does get you a lot in the modern world, I suppose. Anyway, on with the orientation. Has anyone mentioned to you that there are three other companies of roughly the same size and resources, all making a play for the same city at the same time? Unlikely, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? You&amp;rsquo;d think we&amp;rsquo;d plan these sorts of things a little better. Maybe that can be one of the &amp;lsquo;big changes&amp;rsquo; you make around here once we&amp;rsquo;ve put you through orientation, huh?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--Goal of the game--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our company can chase the others out of the city in one of two ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)    Control 20% of the city&amp;rsquo;s total income before anyone else&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;    (2)    Control the greatest percentage of the city&amp;rsquo;s income when the place gets as big as it can be (10x5 tiles)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, I know we&amp;rsquo;re essentially at war with those other corporations and there probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be rules about this sort of thing, but there are. If you don&amp;rsquo;t follow them, the other corporations will all call us names and tell on us to judges. Seriously, boss, stick to the rules, it&amp;rsquo;s just easier on everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
