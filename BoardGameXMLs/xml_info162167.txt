			<description>Stax is basically a Pachisi variant played by 2 players (each playing with 4 counters each of two colours which start in their respective &amp;quot;jails&amp;quot;) or 4 players in partnership each playing one colour. The first player/team to get all 8 counters home wins.&lt;br/&gt; Players alway throw two dice and must always move by exact count. It requires a six to move a counter out of jail.If a player's counter finishes on an opponent's counter then the opponents counter is returned to its jail. Once a player has got all of one colour home, he then requires a six and thereafter may move his other colour or partners colour on his colour's turn turn.&lt;br/&gt; If two or more counters of the same colour land on the same square they form a stack. No opponent's counter may pass a stack. To break a stack a player must first land on the square immediately before that stack. He must then throw successive sixes equal to the number of stack counters plus one. If successful the stack counters are returned to their jail, otherwise the turn ends.&lt;br/&gt; If a multicoloured stack is formed, this does not block movement, it may not attempt to break a stack and if landed on  its counters are returned to their jails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
