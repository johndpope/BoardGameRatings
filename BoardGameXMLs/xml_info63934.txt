							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Hour of a Storied Age</name>
									
			<description>From the website: The end of an age draws nigh, an age of magic and wonder, a storied age when legends walked the land and great deeds were done. That was all long ago, when lives were larger, before things were settled. Now, if there is any greatness left, it is great evil, evil that will change the world for the worse. In the last hour of that age, a new story begins. Will it be the story of a hero, rising up to save what is good and true about the old age to shepherd it into the new, or will it be a sad lament for things long gone to usher in a new age of darkness? It is now the final hour of a storied age, and telling the story falls to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storied Age is a no-prep GM-less storytelling game that, over a few sessions of play, creates an epic fantasy story in the vein of The Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time, or The Sword of Truth. The game weaves together the creative contributions of each individual player in a structured plot arc and then helps you play through a chapter-by-chapter account of how your characters face adversity, similar to the way an author starts with an outline and fleshes it out into a full novel. By breaking up the creative responsibility and providing creative constraints to guide players&amp;rsquo; contributions, Final Hour of a Storied Age lets everyone experience an epic fantasy story without asking anyone to shoulder an epic creative burden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
