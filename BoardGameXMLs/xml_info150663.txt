							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Genestealer Cults</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genestealer  Cults  are  the  insidious  result  of  a  Genestealer or its spawn entering a large mortal population and  starting  to  procreate,  either  through  infection  or plain  sexual  intercourse.  Through  this  reproduction more  Genestealer  Hybrids  come  into  existence,  and this creates a Hive Mind, a mental link which connects members of the brood and allows them to communicate and coordinate their actions. The more members a certain brood has the more effective it becomes and eventually creatures such as Patriarchs and Cult Magi come into existence, and a true Cult is born; from there they  can  start  infiltrating  and  converting  the  human population.&lt;br/&gt;If heretical cults weren&amp;rsquo;t bad enough for the Imperium to cope with, once matured these cults can truly destroy a community over time, or worse attract a Tyranid hive fleet. &lt;br/&gt;The first generation is of such a cult always make sure that they remain hidden from sight, using a Hive&amp;rsquo;s old subterranean infrastructure to hide; they only come out for two things, either to expend their brood or for food, and in both cases people start to disappear. &lt;br/&gt;Eventually the brood will grow and in the end you will have a large family, fiercely loyal to each other, they will also try to corrupt the mortal population and convert them to worshipping the Patriarch as a god. The cult will infiltrate all layers of society and eventually topple the ruling status quo and planetary defences and sound in the planets doom as the hive fleet enters orbit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is completely unofficial and in no way endorsed by Games Workshop limited or Fantasy Flight Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
