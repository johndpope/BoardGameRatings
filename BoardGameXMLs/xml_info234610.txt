			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need a quick NPC?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip through a few of these NPC cards and you're sure to find an NPC that fits the situation. All the common races are represented (humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, half-elves, and half-orcs). Many of the NPCs are low level, but they range from level 1 to 20. Of course you're also free to change a character's background to fit the adventure. Or use them as &amp;quot;face&amp;quot; cards and develop with your own background, personality &amp;amp; other details from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimal Game Stats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards focus on each character's background and personality. The few stats used (class/profession, race) give you an idea of the NPC's abilities. You're free to develop the NPC's stats in the system you're using as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Hooks Abound!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has interesting details that can lead to adventures or side-quests:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Why did Quinn's love leave him?&lt;br/&gt;    What plot did his brother Alvariaus nearly uncover?&lt;br/&gt;    What trouble is the widow Fanny stirring?&lt;br/&gt;    When will Styxie reveal her true mission?&lt;br/&gt;    Is the mission Chono Vurrbilt assigns a death trap?&lt;br/&gt;    Who can replace Sir Rafael as protector of his estate?&lt;br/&gt;    Are the rumors of Sintram's deal with a fiend true?&lt;br/&gt;    When will Li's plans to bring back her god occur?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
