			<description>Buzzball is a two-person game, each person choosing a squad of four players from an actual baseball game. The last player on the squad is chosen for you by your opponent. This player is called the &amp;quot;Bum&amp;quot;. Your opponent will try to pick the worst player for you. The players earn points during the baseball game based on their performances in seven scoring categories. Points are deducted for errors. The winner is the owner whose squad scores the most points. (description from the package)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
