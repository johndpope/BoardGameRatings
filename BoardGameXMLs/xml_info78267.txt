							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Simpsons: Bartman meets Radioactive Man</name>
									
			<description>At the beginning of Bartman Meets Radioactive Man, Bart Simpson is at home reading a Radioactive Man comic book only to be shocked as Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, jumps out of it. Fallout Boy tells Bart that he must venture into the comic book universe in order to save Radioactive Man, who is being held captive at the black hole-orbiting prison Limbo Zone. Once inside the comic book world, Bart transforms into his superhero alter ego Bartman and has to defeat three super villains that have stolen Radioactive Man's powers: Swamp Hag, Dr. Crab, and Lava Man. After collecting these powers, Bart must find Radioactive Man and team up with him to defeat Brain-O the Magnificent, the mastermind behind the evil plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bartman Meets Radioactive Man is a side-scrolling platform game. Throughout the four levels, Bart is faced with enemies he has to defeat. He only has five life points, but if he loses one or more of them they can be restored. This is done by collecting radioactive signs. The player is able to collect lightning icons that give Bart the ability to shoot lightning bolts at enemies. His other weapons are kicking and punching. In addition, Bart must avoid the deadly traps that are scattered at various places in the levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Bartman Meets Radioactive Man , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
