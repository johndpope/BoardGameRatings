			<description>According to the box, this game was designed to help players become safer drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with $3,260 and make a $250 down payment on their &amp;quot;Klunka&amp;quot; (car) to start the game.  On each turn, the player rolls the dice to travel along the highway and draws a card, following its instructions.  Cards may instruct the player to go to various points on the board, recite a tongue twister, pay a fine, go to jail, earn money or answer a driver test question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to get 10 points on driver test questions, make four payments on their Klunka, and have $5,000 wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
