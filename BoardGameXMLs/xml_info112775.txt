			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Now I have to confess that this issue doesn't quite contain as much stuff as the usual issue of Critical Miss. I'm afraid that I've got a fair few things going on at the moment, and I haven't been able to devote as much time to CM as I would like to. But I had some stuff done, and I didn't want to leave it just pending for ever. So I decided I'd just go with what I had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, if you're a new reader you've got eight other issues to be ploughing through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're still gaming away, usually badly, still having trouble remembering our PC's proper names. And I'm still daydreaming pointless things, the latest being daft soaplines, like this one for Eastenders and this one for Neighbours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last issue's piece about how James Wallis ruined my character's life and James's hilarious reply kicked off a furious and rather funny bout of swearing on RPGNet, with James Wallis himself weighing in with the obscenities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Thinking of RPGNet, I can't help but think of one of the funniest threads I've read on there, which began when someone started a thread entitled simply: &amp;quot;Kevin Smith dies&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, here's Issue 9. Hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
