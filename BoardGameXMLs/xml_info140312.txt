							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elite: Station Run</name>
									
			<description>From the Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Station Run is a board game version of the computer game Elite, released by Ian Bell and David Braben in the mid 80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and some other players need to get from one end of the game board to the other without your ship being destroyed. Other players might do it, or some of the random people who ply the spacelanes might get to you first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Station Run is a free-to-download game. No need to whip out the credit card for this one, and no need to try and remember your paypal password.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the free PDF rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Station Run is a game for one to four players. Each player is the pilot of a ship which has just hyperspaced into the system. They must get to the nearby planet&amp;rsquo;s space station in order to sell cargo, refuel or whatever else they might want to do. The player can take on a number of roles. Traders are ferrying cargo between systems to make profit, which they can use to improve their ship or buy another one. Bounty Hunters are seeking out wrongdoers and bringing them to justice. Pirates are only interested in plundering the traders and stealing their cargo. Miners are looking for asteroids to mine for valuable minerals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to get from one end of the game board to the other in one piece. Random encounters may occur, as other spacefarers and asteroids make their way around the planet&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;orbitspace. The game is designed to be open-ended and as freeform as possible (just like the computer game).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
