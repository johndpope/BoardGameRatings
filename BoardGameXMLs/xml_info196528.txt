							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Runaway Express Mystery</name>
									
			<description>A young mother's attending a train exhibition with her children, when something strange happens; the legendary Runaway Express starts moving while her children are still on board. Frightened, she jumps on the train and finds it full of unusual passengers -- the ghosts of people who died on the Runaway Express over the 50 years it ran between Paris and Istanbul. Each ghost is a victim, his or her mysterious demise never fully investigated. These lost souls are cursed to ride the train until someone has the courage to go back in time and reveal the truth about their deaths. Do you dare to break the curse? Will you uncover the mysteries and free the souls? Do you have what it takes to face and defeat the terrible masked Engineer and if you do, what price will you have to pay? Jump on the Runaway Express and find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
