			<description>From the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of your reputation as a clever and daring member of the MEGA-FORCE, you have been sent to Sardoun, a strategically important Democratic nation currently under attack. Your mission is to destroy the Enemy Headquarters. Armed with the world's most advanced fighting machine, the Moto-Fighter, you are dropped off just outside Sardoun. You must pass the city and make your way across the barren desert to the Enemy Headquarters on a limited supply of fuel. You'll be challenged the entire way by heavy air and ground attack. Should you travel too far into the barren desert, flashing arrows will direct you back toward the enemy - that's the only help you can expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
