							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Serafina&#039;s Crown</name>
									
			<description>The sequel takes place seven years after the end of the Serafina&amp;rsquo;s Saga visual novel. Grand Prince Robil Feldren dies of illness, and a few weeks later, Queen Belatrix Grandil dies in in the midst of a &amp;ldquo;hunting accident.&amp;rdquo;  Serafina Elborn and her husband Reuben Jeridar are posed to take the throne, except for one big problem: many nobles suspect Reuben Jeridar arranged the assassination of Belatrix Grandil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as a new character, Odell Perin, who is unwittingly thrust into a position of power amidst the chaos of court. Due to her neutral stance, Odell Perin is elected to serve as Regent long enough to settle the ongoing disputes, and therefore determine who will become the next King or Queen of Darzia. The gameplay will feature a dynamic debate system that allows Odell to argue certain points in court based on her accumulated stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt; - Branching Narrative: Every decision made as Odell will change the story &amp;mdash; whether it&amp;rsquo;s getting closer to finding the murderer, stabilizing the kingdom, or helping the next monarch rise to power.&lt;br/&gt; - Stats Management: Odell&amp;rsquo;s decisions will affect her stats, which will help her debate her beliefs in court.&lt;br/&gt; - Debate Mini-Game: The game features an entertaining mini-game where Odell (with the help from the stats she&amp;rsquo;s earned on her journey) will debate a variety of topics to uncover new, important information.&lt;br/&gt; - Girl x Boy / Girl x Girl Romances: Just because Odell is ruling a kingdom doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean she won&amp;rsquo;t save some time for romance&lt;br/&gt; - Voice Acting: Serafina&amp;rsquo;s Crown features a cast of talented voice actors that bring the story to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see many familiar faces in Serafina&amp;rsquo;s Crown, including Reuben, Kallias, Arken, Nikolaos, and&amp;ndash;of course&amp;ndash;Serafina. You&amp;rsquo;ll also meet many new characters, as well as Picard, a major character from the Ashes of Dearen novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
