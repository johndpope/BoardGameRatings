							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Death that Comes in the Night</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something stalks the Aruun that is neither a servant of Izrador nor independent from him. It is a being of darkness and hate, and it is the ultimate hunter of those that live, that breathe, and that bleed. Be wary, for what you don't see can hurt you . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Death That Comes in the Night includes attributes, a description, and a history of a vile creature from outside the world of Aryth. This being is appropriate as a mysterious foe that can be inserted to your normal campaign, or its destruction could be the goal of an entire story arc. While set in the Aruun jungle of the Midnight setting, the encounters described in this web enhancement can be adapted for use in other areas of Eredane or for other campaigns entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: Ties into Minions of the Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
