			<description>A 4-6 player variable player power/hand management board game in a fantasy setting that takes approximately 20 minutes per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player controls a unique faction with a choice of 4 different characters to play. Once you choose your faction and character, you take turns attacking each other's cities until you have achieved enough victory points to win. Attacks are carried out by moving up to 5 of your 20 troops from your Cities onto your Combat Zone on the Battleground, placing the City, with its defending troops, onto it's Combat Zone, and then playing Combat cards. The side with the highest total of troops plus Combat cards wins. &lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, there are a variety of Action cards that people may play during different phases that affect allying, troop count, let you look at opponent's cards, cast miscellaneous spells, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play one of 6 factions, each with its own unique play-style:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Keepers of the Lost Word - Wizards, Witches, Unicorns, Shapechangers, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The Lords of the Silent Deep - Mermen, Hydras, Sea Serpents, Pirates, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The Warlords of the Blasted Wastes - Orcs, Barbarians, Minotaurs, Ogres, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The Merchant Kings of the Golden Palm - Djinns, Efreets, Bandits, Merchants, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The Guardians of the Black Gate - Skeletons, Zombies, Ghosts, Death Knights, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The Masters of the Wild Hunt - Forest based creatures such as Elves and Fairies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
