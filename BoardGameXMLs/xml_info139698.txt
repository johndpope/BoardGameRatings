			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establish the perfect city! Terraform the land, plan your city &amp;amp; develop it. Moddable, community driven, DRM free, single/multi- player!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civitas will be a revolutionary, open-ended, community-driven, highly-moddable city building game, where you are not only responsible for terraforming the land, zoning, and building the structures, but you will also be able to manage many other aspects of your civilization. Civitas can either be played as a single-player game, or you can play online with other city builders to make entire regions, share resources, and compete for citizens to build the largest city. We will not limit you to one or the other, both will be full-featured and complete. Feel free to play it whenever, wherever, and however you want. Civitas will be available for Mac, PC, and Linux through various digital download services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word &amp;quot;Civitas&amp;quot; is the Latin term for &amp;quot;citizenship&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;city-state&amp;quot;, which is a great description for what you will be able to build from the ground up in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very basic flow of the game will follow this design:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terraform the land&lt;br/&gt;Zone the land for your city&lt;br/&gt;Build the structures that make up your city&lt;br/&gt;Manage all aspects of the city for everything from transportation, utilities, emergency management, natural resources, and commerce.&lt;br/&gt;Continue to grow your city. &lt;br/&gt;Meet the demands of the civilization you have created and respond to natural and unnatural disasters to make your city as great as you want it to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civitas will include a fully featured day-night system for added realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have already started working hard on the tools and features to allow players to experience a level of freedom that has never been offered in a city simulation game before. But we are not setting anything in stone. We want to build a community as well as an amazing game. We will be asking for feedback from beta users throughout the entire development cycle to make sure players have everything they need, and as much freedom as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
