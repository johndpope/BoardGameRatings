			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The culmination of the traveling bard Digby O&amp;rsquo;Flannagan&amp;rsquo;s year of logs has arrived.  In Digby's continuing logs he describes the various holidays, celebrations and fairs that he has seen in his travels.  A Year in the Human Lands collects all of the last year&amp;rsquo;s logs created as Digby journeyed through the various Human kingdoms of the world.  They are bound together for easy reference, re-annotated by Digby and feature the collected notes of &amp;quot;The Healer&amp;quot; about the holidays presented in the logs, the month&amp;rsquo;s themes and a little on calendars and holiday design in general.  If you enjoy Digby's writing style or just like to celebrate, this is the book for you. So, as Digby would say, &amp;ldquo;Keep a merry soul&amp;rdquo; and let&amp;rsquo;s see what the human lands have to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains a month summary, alternate historical and fantasy names for the month and several fully fleshed-out holidays for every month of the year, as well as a game master section with an in-depth month theme discussion and advice on using each of the holidays presented in your game, including unique plot hooks for each month.  Coming in at a whopping 148 pages, you&amp;rsquo;re sure to find something to give your campaign something to celebrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
