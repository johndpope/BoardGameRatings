			<description>A board game for 2 to 8 players. The aim of the game is to form a lifeline using matching symbols. The first player to form a lifeline when he places his last stone is the winner. Chinese sticks (dinner-things) are used to allow fate to determine a lifeline. Anticipation and planning largely determine the chance of success. The element of chance means that everyone ultimately has a chance. The game is derived from Chinese philosophy, which says that all things in life must be in balance. Every object has its opposite, or if you like its complementary element. Black and white, man and woman, water and fire. In short, Yin and Yang. It sounds floating but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. Before the game starts the stones are shuffled and placed on the white triangles on the perimeter with the symbols face down. The numbers in the black triangles remain visible. The color of the pawns is also the color of your starting field. Each player drops the three sticks on each turn. Move the total of the throw (6, 7, 8, or 9) on the main field. The used the philosophy that extremes are changeable. You can make a 6 a 7 and a 9 a 8. There are two rounds. In the first round you collect the stones and in the second round you have to make a line (lifeline) between 2 triangles. Therefore, players may lay a stone on the main field on each turn. Each stone laid down must be able to form a pair. This is an import point. It must be able, nothing more than that. Different pairs may be placed against each other. In this way a lifeline can be formed or stones can be played out. The first player to add his last stone to the lifeline is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;It is a new kind of game. You have to get used to it. But after a few times of playing you will find the pleasure of this strategic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
