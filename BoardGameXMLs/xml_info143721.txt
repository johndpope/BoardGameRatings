			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fehr's Ehtnology: Dragonblood profiles the dragonblood race for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragonbloods are humanoids of mostly elven or human stock that have manifested a dominant taint of their ancestor dragon&amp;rsquo;s blood. Less than a half-dragon, and far more able to blend in with typical society, the dragonblood are a race unto themselves, surfacing an unknown number of generations after the original mating of dragon and two-legger. The resurgence of draconic power in these beings gives them power and abilities beyond those of their stock race, or at least different, and takes them in directions definitely divergent from the society around them. It is possible that some of the magnetic figures in history were secretly dragonbloods, and that some of the great personages that were so bold to claim the blood of great wyrms actually did possess powers granted by a draconic ancestor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This release includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     ecology of dragonbloods&lt;br/&gt;     racial characteristics for dragonblood characters (including alternate racial characteristics)&lt;br/&gt;     a selection of racial feats&lt;br/&gt;     traits for the dragonblood race (if you use traits)&lt;br/&gt;     sample dragonblood 1st level character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
