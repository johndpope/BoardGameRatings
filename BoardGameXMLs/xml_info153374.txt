							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It Rolls Downhill</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Rolls Downhill is an introductory adventure for the Contagion Role Playing Game. The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface it is no different than the world you and I live in. Most people go on about their lives never realizing the terrors that walk among them. Despite humanity's vast ignorance, the horrors are there. Demons walk the night. They plot the demise of Heaven's army, but even they are not a wholly united front. Sometimes the struggle is within their own ranks...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Rolls Downhill is an excellent introduction to the Contagion setting. In this adventure, faithful crusaders in the army of the divine are called upon to cleanse the sewers beneath the city of Rockford, IL. A Vagrant named Rufus has seen something stalking and killing his fellows in the storm drains. Has he lost his mind, or does one of Hell&amp;rsquo;s soldiers call the filth its home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Rolls Downhill is designed for 4-6 players of 1st to 3rd level. People familiar with other role playing games will find something unusual in the design concept of It Rolls Dowhill. Rather than being a linear module with events that go from point A to point B, this adventure offers a story seed. Basic events are illustrated, along with character snapshots. The ending is left open and ambiguous, for the Gamemaster to decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
