			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to form a party, venture into the ice forest to find the Snow Flower, that will cure the king's disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is split into two parts; in the first the players will recruit their party using a drafting mechanism, and in the second, they will compete to be the first to find the mysterious flower. Each character has special values in physical and magical attack power. During the monster fighting, the player who is last will draw and deal monster cards to all players. Each player then selects if they want to fight the monster they have, or rest. If the group has higher attack than the monster's defence, it's defeated, and the player go deeper into the forest. Players can also use the special abilities of the characters in order to increase their attack power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to defeat the final boss wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
