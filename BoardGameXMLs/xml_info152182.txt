							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">La Resistance</name>
									
			<description>From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paris: City of lights, a center of liberty, now under the jackbooted heel of the hated bouche! After the Trait&amp;eacute; de Versailles, we were thought to have one of the largest, most powerful armies in the world. Yet, with lightning strikes and wolf like cunning the Germans blindsided us, and crushed our defenses. Now Paris is occupied. Some men have even taken to fighting along side these monsters. But not I, I will resist the hun with every fiber of my being. I will do what I can to turn the bouche&amp;rsquo;s time in Paris into a veritable nightmare. We have seen revolution before. We are not afraid of revolting against this vile little man&amp;rsquo;s army, though it may cost us our lives, we will see France, liberated again! Viva La Resistance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Resistance is a quick RPG, where players play members of the French resistance during the occupation of France from May 1940, until December 1944. Players play the average citizenry of Paris who have taken to joining a cell of a resistance movement, intended to drive the Nazis out of France. Character creation is handled through a process intended to encourage role play, and the system uses a deck of cards for both task resolution, as well as to add tension to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
