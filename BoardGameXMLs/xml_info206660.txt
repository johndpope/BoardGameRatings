			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overture of Kings is a fantasy based card game for 2-6 players.  It is set in a fictional world, but it uses many familiar medieval tones. The players assume the roles of the kings, and must build their armies while at the same time preventing the other kings from building theirs.&lt;br/&gt;  The game consists of two decks of cards; one primarily used to build your army and the other used for attacks and other actions.  Overture of Kings requires strategy and planning, but there are elements that involve the luck of the draw and die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;  There are two player decks designed around the same rules and full games which are more complex and take longer to play.  Also, there are Alliance game rules around which tournament play has evolved  Included in the game are two types of optional cards that will either make the game easier for new players, extend the length of the round or both.  It takes between 30 minutes to 2 hours to play a round depending on the optional cards used and the experience levels of the players.&lt;br/&gt;  Overture of Kings is easy to learn, family friendly and fun.  There is a quick start guide to help new players understand the basics quickly as well as a full rule book for more detailed explanations of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
