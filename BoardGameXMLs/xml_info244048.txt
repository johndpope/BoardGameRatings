			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, a powerful Dwarven Wizard became the king of his clan and used his abilities and intellect to expand his people&amp;rsquo;s kingdom. He crafted himself powerful magic items and his influence grew along with his kingdom's borders. But over time, the ravages of war drove him mad and as his power surged, his mind faded. Eventually, he went mad, abandoning his throne and his people and retreating into the mountains. Terrified of his past, he enchanted the path behind him with tricks and traps and riddles and puzzles to prevent his enemies from finding him. His story became a legend and then a myth. What became of the mad Dwarf King and his powerful relics? What stands between today&amp;rsquo;s adventures and those epic and ancient treasures? There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caverns of Chaos is a fun and customizable D&amp;amp;D adventure module full of puzzles, riddles, tricks, and traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can pick and choose puzzles to fit into your existing story. Or you can run this module as a modified dungeon crawl with 12 consecutive rooms of traps, tricks, and riddles all leading to the glorious conclusion and the deserved reward of magic items and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggestions for modifying or customizing the puzzles and traps are included throughout. The module also includes additional riddles to sprinkle through your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
