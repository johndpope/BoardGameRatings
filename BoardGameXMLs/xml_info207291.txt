							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">De wakkere Oceaan-Vliegers</name>
									
			<description>De wakkere Oceaan-Vliegers (&amp;quot;The Brave Ocean Flyers&amp;quot;) is a Dutch-language aviation-themed target game by a German publisher (Klee). It is undated, but c. 1930 judging by title's declaration of ocean-crossing as dangerous and by the artwork featuring a combination of biplanes, single-engine monoplane seaplanes and a trimotor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a map covering Northern, Central and Western Europe and the East Coast of North America. The board is dotted with 58 small circles with the numbers 5, 10, 15 or 20. Six of these circles are bordered in red, meaning negative points for crashing; the remaining 52 are black and give positive points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces are cardboard planes attached to small wooden balls. The shooting mechanism is a 5&amp;quot;-long cardboard springboard painted with a plane taking off. It has a wooden fulcrum near one end. Players put a plane on the long end and push down on the short end to launch it. It gains or loses points based on where it lands on the board. The player gaining the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
