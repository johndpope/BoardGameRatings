			<description>The board depicts a circular spider web. Players move their five dice around the outer rim of the web, but have to cross it once in each of the four sectors. The players also control ten spider chips each with which they attempt to intercept the other player's dice and block the other player's spiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is dice-driven: On a roll of a 6, a player enters the web and starts the journey with one die (subsequent sixes force him/her to add another die). After each move, a player places a new spider into the web (any position, but a different grid that has intersections with the one for the dice). Once all ten spiders have been placed, these can be after a die's movement. Spiders move any distance along the web, unless they are blocked by other spiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a die crosses the web, it is turned up one number (starting with a one). If a die with a five on it reaches the starting position again, it is turned to a six and the owner wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
