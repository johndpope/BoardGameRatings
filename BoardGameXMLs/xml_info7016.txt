			<description>Each player gets four monks in one color. The player looks at the monks and places them on the starting field, so thta the other players can't see the monks. In play the players aren't allowed to look at the monks.&lt;br/&gt;At the player's turn, he/she throws with both dice and chooses one monk. It's not allowed to devide the points of the dice along the monks. The player can choose to add or the deduct the numbers of the roll. Monks can move in any direction except for walls and bushes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to find out, which of the strange monks is the intruder, the players have to question them. The questioning can take place only in the garden and only if a player with one of its figures comes exactly on the field of a fellow player figure. If this succeeds, then the active player picks up carefully the figure and looks at the figure secretly. Afterwards the monk is placed to its starting position.&lt;br/&gt;If two monks are occuing a space, other monks cannot question them, until one of the monks leave. When both the dice display the same amount a questioning can be broken by another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who knows which monk is the intruder, can start the    persecution. The player has to throw the same amount with both dice.From this moment the player can only move with one monk, until he reached the intruder. The monk has to land on the same space has the persected monk and the player shows the monk. If the monk is the intruder, the intruding party is out of the game. Otherwise the persecuting party is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last order of monks standing win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
