			<description>In Red Streets, Blue Mats you start as a MMA fighter far from the Fame and Fortune of pay-per-view. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve had some formal training or maybe you learned to fight in back alleys or streets, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. You all share the same dream, to make it to the Big Time, fighting in opulent octagons in the fanciest hotels and convention centers. But you&amp;rsquo;ve got a long way to go before that happens as you have to pay your dues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for 20 different fighting styles, each with their own unique attributes, allow you to create our own martial artist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the core, the game pits modern day gladiators against one another in combat. Fighter's stats determine how many dice are rolled, and &amp;quot;successes&amp;quot; are then counted from among the dice. Each combatant, however, has a certain number of &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; dice which he may allocate throughout the game to improve his chances. Tactics enter the game in knowing when to use these dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play solo against the game mechanics. Campaign rules allow you to follow your martial artist's career and fight your way from the Fringes of the MMA world to the Prime Locales of the Big Time, earning money and fame along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or go head-to-head and fight your friends to see who is the toughest competitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
