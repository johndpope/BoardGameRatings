			<description>The game board shows 4 trees  which grow from the center to all 4 edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each leaf of the trees is one field where the figures can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some spaces between the leaves, where the figures have to move around. The figures can even move from branch to branch or from tree to tree if the leaves are neighbored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game places his 8 colored stones on different leaves (2 on each turn until all are placed)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a Player can jump over an own stone he lines it with other own stoned (jumped over in previous rounds) to a line (namesd snake).&lt;br/&gt;If all own stones (which are on the board) are lined, the player moves his snake instead of his pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he reaches one of the start fields with his snake he can place the Stones of his snake on the nest fields, in the middle of the board. Fields have to be free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of fields the player is allowed to move his pawn or snake is driffen by an additional figure, the Mungo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mungo is moving on the top line of leaves of the trees (at the edge of the board). The number of leaves the branch where the Mungo is, is the number the Player can move. Additional the length of his snake (number of stones) enhances accordingly the movement number.&lt;br/&gt;The Mungo is moved the doubled number of the calculted movement number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are additonal rules for removing and adding stones from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when all fields in the middle (between the trees)are filled with stones. The player with the majority of stones in the middle wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
