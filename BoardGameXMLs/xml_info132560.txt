			<description>from the designer's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snype is a game for 2 players, played with black and white stones, on an initially empty board hex-hex board. (Snype is an attempt to create a Y-like game, without the overwhelming strategic importance of the center spaces.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;  * To begin, one player places a white stone on any empty space, and the other player decides whether to play as White or Black.&lt;br/&gt;  * From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. A turn consists of two actions, which may be performed in any order:  1) place a stone of your color on any numbered empty space; and 2) optionally, move a stone in a straight line, any number of spaces up to the number on the space from which it starts, so that it lands on an empty numbered space. No jumping allowed.&lt;br/&gt;  * The game ends when one player creates a connected group of stones which is adjacent to at least one blue, one yellow and one red space. He wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
