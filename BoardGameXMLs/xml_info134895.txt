							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diva Starz: Mall Mania</name>
									
			<description>Diva Starz: Mall Mania is an action game, where the player starts by choosing one of five playable dolls from Mattel Inc.'s Diva Starz doll line. After selecting a character, the doll is placed in a scooter level, where they are required to jump and collect items while riding their scooter down a street. Completing the scooter level allows the player to choose from five mall-related levels: the music spot, the pet shop, the fashion spot, the snack spot, and the style spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The music level plays similar to the Dance Dance Revolution series, requiring the player to input button pushes at the proper times with the music as prompted by the game. The pet shop level makes the player go through a simple maze to find their puppy at the end of it. The fashion spot requires the player to place colored items into matching colored purses which move on a conveyor belt. The snack spot is a puzzle which lets the player make food by placing pieces in the correct order, and the style spot is a dress up game which makes the player pick outfits which look the best on the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Diva Starz: Mall Mania&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
