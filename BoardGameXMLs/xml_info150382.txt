							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CH (Custom Humanoid)-1</name>
									
			<description>Free RPG Day 2013 Character for use with Shadows of a Black Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its custom chassis, CH-1 features unique self-improvement programming. The droid is driven to continue its creator&amp;rsquo;s legacy and modify, upgrade, and customize itself to perfection, and will eliminate any who stand in its way (including its former master). Mechanics and equipment aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap, however. Luckily, the droid discovered that collecting bounties both paid well and gave it a chance to hone its skills. Ever since the Bounty Hunter Guild accepted it into its ranks, CH-1 has done jobs wherever it can. Its work recently brought it to Coruscant, where the droid heard the Pyke Syndicate was placing a price on the head of an unauthorized, rogue bounty hunter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
