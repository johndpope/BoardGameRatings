			<description>Description from the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An industry-building card game for 3-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t an Industrial Revolution it&amp;rsquo;s an Industrial RACE! Build up your investments in Ranches, Factories, Farms and more, and keep the other players down with sneaky actions like Burglary or Strongarm. Whoever makes the most money (scores the most points) before the deck runs out wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farm &amp;amp; Factories is a card game where you use a combination of Building cards and Action cards to accumulate victory points or disrupt your opponents quest for victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each person starts with a hand of four cards in the first round. First you will draw a card from the deck then play one card. An Action card will allow you to take an immediate action, such as the Research card, &amp;quot;Draw three cards,&amp;quot; or the Boycott card, &amp;quot;Choose an opponent: that player skips his or her next score phase.&amp;quot; Once an action is complete you add the action card to your point pile. A Building card performs no immediate action, but will allow you to take prescribed actions on every subsequent turn. You may have as many buildings as you would like, but you only have three workers each turn to activate buildings. &lt;br/&gt;Each subsequent round has four phases per each player turn: Worker Phase (choosing which buildings are active that turn), Score Phase (score cards as dictated by your active buildings), Draw Phase (draw your one card and any others dictated by your Building cards), and the Play Phase (play one card from your hand and any other plays as dictated by your active buildings.)&lt;br/&gt; Scoring is done by following the actions on the Action and Building cards to build your score pile. Each card is assigned a victory point amount from 1-3. Once the deck runs out each player counts the points in his/her score pile and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
