			<description>How Good Is Your Karma? ...You'll know after playing this!!&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Unpredictable and designed to be smoker-friendly, it's a great way to spend a stretchable hour or so with like minded friends. Not sneaky, not dishonest but likely to provoke profanity!&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Chill with friends and visit Morrocco, Marrakesh and Amsterdam to try and score. Then, if you manage that, run the gauntlet of customs, police and your own Karma to get rid of it. The winner leaves loaded and holding, the losers just have some fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally created by stoner students in a UK university in the 1970's, the legendary Big Dope Deal board game is now available for anyone to play! Travel to London, Amsterdam, Marrakesh, and Kabul and score weed along the way, with all the board game fun of dice, fake paper money and full-color cards. Big Dope Deal is ideal for 2 to 6 adult players and an average game takes about one high-stakes, hilarious hour. The 15 x 12.8 inch board is flexible and rolls up easily, and it's laminated so don't worry if you spill some beer on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
