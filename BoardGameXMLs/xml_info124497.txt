							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The War in France &amp; Flanders</name>
									
			<description>This is an operational level game covering the France Campaign, May - October 1940.  Units are primarily divisions, with air formations also provided.  There are 1,152 die-cut units representing French, British, Belgian, Dutch, German and Italian forces.  The 32&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; inch map runs from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Seas.  The War in France &amp;amp; Flanders was to be part of larger series of games called Crusade in Europe, which never appeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequence of play is I-Go-You-Go.  There are detailed rules covering air operations; alternatively, players can use a simplified set of abstract air rules.  Victory is determined by points awarded for losses, and for the date of any French surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
