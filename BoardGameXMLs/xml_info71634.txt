							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gearcraft: Amazing Machines and their Construction</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gearcraft is a great guidebook for introducing inventions and steampunk into any True20 setting. You might ask the reason why, since our focus lies on a broad spectrum of brands. This product rose from the development of T20 RunePunk and the inventors found therein and the specific constraints of the world of ScatterPoint. Through discussions with Erica Balsley, it was decided to move ahead with this great engine for crafting devices and putting it out there setting free, for anyone who might have a desire to create a Jules Verniverse. We love the robustness of this product so much, we wanted to share. This design engine powers the creations found in both the upcoming T20 RunePunk and T20 Ravaged Earth. Each of them, obviously, having the setting specific tweaks necessary to operate in their respective milieus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
