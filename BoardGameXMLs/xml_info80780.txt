							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">That Which Rises</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some folks say there's a curse on Elaqua. Livestock dies. Crops rot or are eaten by weevils. There are fires, floods, and hailstorms. Malaria and Yellow Fever. Murders and suicides and drownings. People get thrown by horses, and gored by bulls and shot in hunting accidents. Children wander off into the woods and just plain disappear. A local joke is that General Sherman didn't even bother stopping when he passed through Elaqua. There was no more destruction to be done. Hell, he probably felt sorry for us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'll bet there are more ghosts in Elaqua per square mile than any other town in the whole country. And if it ain't a ghost, it's something else, and I don't even want to think about what that might be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That Which Rises is a campaign frame for Mortal Coil. Set in the small town of Elaqua, Alabama during the Great Depression, That Which Rises is a campaign frame in the style of the Southern Gothic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
