							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Love</name>
									
			<description>In this game, two to eight players compete by trying to out-romance each other. For the winner, the game notes, &amp;quot;Your reward is collecting a KISS, a BEAR HUG, or a HEARTY HANDSHAKE from the lover of your choice. (We suggest the winning lover and the chosen one leave the room for this.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While luck plays a factor in moving from the start space to the LOVE NEST goal, life experiences, memory, quick wit, and other factors can also help you advance. Some spaces call upon you to quote a line from a love poem (or complete a line for a provided rhyme) without repeating another player's answer. Others call on a player to correctly identify the eye color of the other players in the game. Still others feature bits along the line, &amp;quot;If you think your legs are pretty, go forward one. If anyone doubts you, prove it or go back two.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
