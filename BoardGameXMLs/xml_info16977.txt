			<description>From WotC Press Release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CODENAME: KIDS NEXT DOOR TCG players start with a deck of cards featuring the five agents on 5 different color cards. On their turn, players decide if they want to engage in a face-off competition using their top card, or instead place that card into the Kids Next Door's tree house headquarters. Cards placed in the tree house help boost the power of cards that are played in future face-offs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When cards are played in a face-off, the player with the higher number (which may get boosted by a card banked in the tree house) wins the round. The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game, ensuring an entire game can be played in five minutes or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what happens when each player plays a same-colored card? Both players race to be the first to slap a giant panic button placed on the playing mat to determine the round's winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
