			<description>Power Warriors is a turn based combat game for two or more players set in a world where an alien race is trying to enslave the Earth. The planet's only hope for survival is a group of young warriors. The game allows players to create and control a mighty warrior trained to fight using the mystical energy of life known as qi. Power Warriors is unique in that it gives players complete control over the creation of their warrior. Players can create an existing warrior from popular media or one from their own imagination. The possibilities are endless. The object of the game is simply to be the last warrior standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Warriors is a stand alone game that can also be used as an expansion for any other Toy Battle SystemTM game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
