							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Brutal Lament</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The room was being made ready. Servitors bustled around, gears whirring as they adjusted table settings and rearranged floral displays. In the centre of the room, gloved hands steppled together, fingertips tapping upon his lips, stood the grey robed master of the house. A smile crept upon his lips as he surveyed the scene. All met with his approval. Especially the highlight of this evening's soiree. The book lay on a pedestal covered by a simple crimson cloth. The lighting was just right, the ambient chords perfect in pitch, creating an almost palpable presence around his little surprise. This party would be the source of discussion and gossip for some time to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
