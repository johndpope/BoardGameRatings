							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruined Tower Giant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nice mid level adventure for Labyrinth Lord.  The party must go to the tower the giant took with him when he ran away.   Something is bugging the Duke and his Necromancer thinks it has to do with the tower.  The tower must be explored and the purgative put in every room.  Will they have an easy time doing this?  Of course not.  The tower is dangerous but someone else has taken residence up very close to it.  Only by entering the tower will they find out who that is...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What has the Duke done to us!?!?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw Your Swords!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
