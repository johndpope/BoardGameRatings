			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Joker Is Back. And He's The Only One Smiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seedy underworld is crawling with criminals. Even worse The Joker is back on top of 'em all! Law and order means nothing...Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because Batman is here and the action is hotter than ever! Ear-crunching sound effects. Pulse quickening music. Graphics that are as hot as 16-bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And this time, Batman hits fast and hard. Flying, leaping, and sliding to attack! And striking at the heart of The Joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caped Crusader has a totally new arsenal at his command: Batarang, Crossbow, Sonic Neutralizer. He's even got a superfueled jetpack. And even more powerful weapons at the touch of a button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BATMAN has got to use all of his power. Because this world is a very dark place, and you never know where THE JOKER is hiding!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
