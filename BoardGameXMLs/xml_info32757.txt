			<description>This &amp;quot;variant&amp;quot; of Xiangqi is played on a 19 X 19 grid (Go board). Seven armies represent the seven warring states of the late Zhou Dynasty (1045 - 221 BC):&lt;br/&gt;Qin (white), Chu (red), Qi (indigo), Yan (black), Han (orange), Wei (green), Zhao (purple).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each army is played by one player. For less than 7 players, there are several predetermined &amp;quot;allies&amp;quot;, so one or more players direct two armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every army has 17 pieces, which makes a total of 120, regarding the central single piece, representing the kingdom of Zhou. This piece does not move at all and cannot be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the armies consist of the following pieces:&lt;br/&gt;1 General - moving like the Queen in modern Western Chess.&lt;br/&gt;1 Deputy General - moving like the Rook in modern Western Chess.&lt;br/&gt;1 Officer - moving like the Bishop in modern Western Chess.&lt;br/&gt;1 Diplomat - moving like the Queen, too, but cannot capture or be captured.&lt;br/&gt;1 Cannon - like the Cannon in XiangQi (moving like the Rook, but capturing over one intervening piece).&lt;br/&gt;1 (Unit of) Archers - moving like the Queen, but only for 4 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;1 (Unit of) Crossbowmen - moving like the Queen, but only for 5 spaces&lt;br/&gt;2 (Units of) Swordsmen - moving 1 space diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;4 (Units of) Broadswordsmen - moving 1 space vertically or horizontally.&lt;br/&gt;4 (Units of) Cavalry - moving 4 spaces: 1 in a straight line and then 3 diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several rules regulating possible allies and winning conditions over single states. Residual pieces of beaten armies are removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simplified, it can be said, that to gain a victory over another state, a player has to capture the general or more than 10 pieces of this state. The player with the most captured pieces at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are similarities both to Go (the central piece as the centre of the universe/representing the Zhou Dynasty, or the removing of &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; armies) and Xiangqi  (the pieces, the armies ...); this and the 7 players make this game unique in the history of strategic boardgames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
