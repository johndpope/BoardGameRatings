			<description>The game board depicts a rug with three connected, diamond-shaped areas of 3 x 3 fields each. The goal is to get as many of one's own playing pieces to the far end of the board.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has five coins. In each turn, a player can move a coin one field forward. When a coin can reach one of the opponent's coins, it climbs on top of that. This is called a Biri, it can move two fields, but not eliminate further coins. It can be caught by a single coin of the opponent. The resulting &amp;quot;Biribi&amp;quot; can move three fields and can't be eliminated. &lt;br/&gt;When a Biri or Biribi reaches the far end of the board, opponent's coins are discarded, one's own coins are scored. Whoever managed to get most coins across is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
