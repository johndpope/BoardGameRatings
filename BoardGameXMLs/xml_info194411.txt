			<description>In Anaxi, players are presented with category prompts, and they want to think of words or phrases that fit multiple categories at the same time &amp;mdash; but without matching another player's answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each of five rounds, players draw a single blue, red and orange card. These round cards have clear plastic on one-third of them and a word written on the other two-thirds. Players overlap these cards on a scoring chart that shows the value of a word or phrase that encompasses two or three of these categories. Players have a limited amount of time to write down as many words or phrases as they can for each pair of categories and for all three categories. They then compare answers and score points for those answers unique to themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has the most points after five rounds wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
