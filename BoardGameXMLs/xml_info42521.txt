							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Munchkin Christmas Ornament</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck the halls of your dungeon with this wooden ornament of the Super Munchkin from the cover of the original Munchkin game. This ornament measures approximately 2 1/2&amp;quot; wide by 3&amp;quot; tall. The design is laser etched, from both sides, into cedar wood. Grab one for your treasure stash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this ornament is hanging on a tree in the room where you are playing Munchkin (any version) or Munchkin Quest, on the 24th or 25th of ANY month, Santa will bring presents. Every time a player goes up to 5th Level, that player draws a face-up Treasure. Yes, if you go down to 4th and then back up, you get another present. Only one ornament allowed per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the Christmas Ornament comes in two versions: an older one where the Munchkin's eyes are nearly closed, and a newer one where they are wide open and bulging out. Also, the newer one appears to have addressed a problem with one of the feet breaking off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Munchkin series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
