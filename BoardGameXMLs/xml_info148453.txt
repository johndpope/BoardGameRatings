			<description>Players strive to become the surrogate of Luxembourg's national comic superhero: Superjhemp. To do so, they must fulfill missions and take control of Luxembourg's cantons by proving their knowledge about Luxembourg's history and present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this trivia game, every player draws a secret mission card at the start of the game. This tells the player which cantons (pairs of spaces on the map) have to be controlled by the player in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players traverse the map from north to south. Every time they land on one space, a card from that space is drawn and a random trivia question is asked. If the player knows the answer, he can put a marker on the space. If both spaces from one canton are marked, the player controls that canton. It is possible for players to wrest control of a half or full canton away from a player controlling them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
