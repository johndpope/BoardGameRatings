							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fighting Fantasy: The Forest of Doom</name>
									
			<description>Take part in one of the classic gamebook experiences that introduced a whole generation to fantasy role-playing games! Computer gaming was in its infancy and it was the early days of tabletop RPGs when The Forest of Doom exploded into bookshops in the early 80s, proudly displaying Iain McCaig&amp;rsquo;s iconic cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can relive the adventures in Darkwood Forest on your Android phone or tablet, lovingly updated for digital devices. Presented in full colour with realistic physics-based dice rolling for battles, auto-mapping, an auto-updated adventure sheet and stat keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Writer, Ian Livingstone, was one of the co-founders of Games Workshop and has continued to have a distinguished career in both tabletop gaming and video games. He is currently the Life President of Eidos, recently overseeing the release of the latest Tomb Raider game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cover artist, Iain McCaig, has an extensive print and film portfolio, and is probably best known for designing Padm&amp;eacute; Amidala and Darth Maul for The Phantom Menace!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Make the gamebook as easy or hard as you like and even turn on a special cheat mode to read it old-school!&lt;br/&gt;     Atmospheric new visuals which can be turned off to make the gamebook look like it came off the printing press in the 80s!&lt;br/&gt;     NEW Auto-mapping! Never get lost in Darkwood Forest.&lt;br/&gt;     Iain McCaig&amp;rsquo;s famous cover animated and brought to life.&lt;br/&gt;     Malcolm Barter&amp;rsquo;s classic illustrations colorised for the app, making full use of the high-resolution retina displays.&lt;br/&gt;     Fantastic new cover artwork to unlock!&lt;br/&gt;     Achievements to find throughout the gamebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: This game is an adaptation of the original printed gamebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
