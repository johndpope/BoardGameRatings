			<description>(from the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;For 46 years Queen Victoria is wearing the crown of the United Kingdom and has impressed her stamp upon the Empire, but one thing is there she could not change: the London fog which holds so many secrets that one hundred lives would not suffice to discover them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of this fog a girl staggers into the arms of the PCs, and soon they are in the middle of a new adventure. The child has lost his memory, but this isn't enough for some sinister people. And what do the ominous &amp;bdquo;Friends of the British librarianship&amp;ldquo; do, who concealed their secrets nearly as well as the fog?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(additional information)&lt;br/&gt;part 1 of the upcoming &amp;quot;Bibliothekswelten-Kampagne&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
