							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peek-A-Boo Poker</name>
									
			<description>Peek-A-Boo Poker is a video game made by Hacker International and distributed by Panesian in 1991 as one of three pornographic video games the company made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the other two being Bubble Bath Babes and Hot Slots.&lt;br/&gt;One of the earliest pornographic video games, it went out of mainstream distribution as the industry matured and the &amp;quot;user base broadened&amp;quot;. The distribution was also limited as major national chains would not carry the items for sale.&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay consists of a simple strip poker simulator in which the player can see a different reward screen, consisting of a erotic image of a woman, for every $1000 they collect in winnings, to a maximum of $5000. The game uses standard five-card draw poker rules. There are three computer controlled players: Full House Francine, Double Dealing Debby, and Pok-er Penny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Peek-A-Boo Poker&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
