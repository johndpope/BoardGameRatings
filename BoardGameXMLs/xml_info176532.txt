							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legacy Character Creation</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pass On Your Character&amp;rsquo;s Legacy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of those ideas that every long-time roleplayer has had at least once: when their character&amp;rsquo;s time comes, and they retire to a nice quiet farm or open up a tavern, and go from being a PC to an NPC, and they have a child or three, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be fun to roll up your character&amp;rsquo;s child and play them in a later game? Of course, you don&amp;rsquo;t need a special character creation method in order to do so&amp;mdash;the regular rules of the game are more than capable of handling character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what if there was a character creation method specifically designed to take advantage of this sort of situation, which used the traits of the character&amp;rsquo;s parents in order to determine the abilities and capabilities of the character? What if, through generations of careful cultivation, a player could develop strong familial traits that make for highly specialized and capable characters? Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to wonder, for this book contains just such a system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
