			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every RPG needs a small village as a starting point and safe haven for the adventurers. It should include a smaller dungeon and some opportunities for role-playing, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 26 page accessory does exactly that for LABYRINTH LORD. Larm is a small village of just over 100 inhabitants (112 to be precise) located on the borderlands, descriptions of all the major inhabitants, a lot of smaller tasks the characters can do for the village, with 2 mysterious places to be explored and a goblin camp nearby... The Mill (Appendix 1) is designed as a small starter dungeon to introduce the players to the mechanics of the game. The Abandoned Temple (Appendix 2) is a somewhat bigger dungeon where the players are confronted with various types of undead and the necessity of drawing a map. The Goblin Camp (Appendix 3) is set to test the tactical skill of the players, having to fight a group of weak, but organized humanoids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
