			<description>The game playing components are a 7-square X 7-square playing board, a die to roll to see who plays first, and 4 different-colored playing sets, one set each for up to 4 players. Each playing set has 4 pieces: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. The Alpha piece can be moved only one square, but in any direction (diagonally or laterally). The Beta can be moved either 1 or 2 squares, also in any direction. The Gamma can be moved 1 or 2 squares, laterally only. The Delta can be moved 1 or 2 squares, diagonally only. The players take turns, with each player moving 1 of his or her pieces each turn. Any piece can capture any enemy piece within range by moving into the enemy piece's square and removing the enemy piece. When an Alpha is captured, all its companion pieces are also removed. The surviving Alpha wins. As in many other multi-player games, temporary, unspoken alliances are unavoidable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing components are of unique designs. The playing pieces are hardwood and the roll-up playing board is printed on cloth-backed vinyl. The game is packaged in a nylon drawstring carrying case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
