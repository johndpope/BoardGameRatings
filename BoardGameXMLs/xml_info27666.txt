			<description>From the company's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six Nations must solve internal affairs without creating conflicts within their own borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, hot spots could develop &amp;mdash; and by game&amp;rsquo;s end several or all of the Nations could be at war. The game is then lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Nation creates a balanced territory so that a balanced world results in which population does not exceed land and resources and work is available for everyone. On the religious, cultural and political side, all sectors are also in balance with no particular sector dominating another. The key to achieving this balance is Right Education, in which intelligence and compassion are nurtured. How well the players use Right Education and deploy the other factors within their borders while making trades to assist each other across borders will determine the degree of success in establishing firm and lasting peace in our time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best for group play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: 6 nation charts, 2 sets of cards (110 total) consisting of population, land/resources, work/technology, religion/culture, politics/military and right education, die, rules. &amp;copy; 2006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
