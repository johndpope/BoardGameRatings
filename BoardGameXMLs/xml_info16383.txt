			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You try to build bridges on your construction-site. This results in real chaos and soon the first parts will be falling to the ground. Try to keep your eye on your strategy to get the highest score. Limited edition of 150 pieces, numbered and signed by the author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets four little plots on the back of the game-box. Depending on the number of empty plots, a player gets material at the beginning of his turn. Now he can use this material to build connections between his plots. There are different building-styles which are more or less difficult and therefore result in more or less points. A player can also use the already built parts of the other player, which is easier and therefore results in less points. If you manage to build very complicated connections, you'll get more points. After a while, the board will be full of chaotically arranged bridges. If something falls, you'll get penalty, so be careful! Once all plots are connected, the game is over and if you didn't plan carefully you again get a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
