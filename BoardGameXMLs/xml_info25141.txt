			<description>The game consists of a narrow plastic board about 20&amp;quot; long with a plastic 'kicking mule' in a &amp;quot;corral&amp;quot; at either end.  A small plastic ball is connected to a length of string which originates from the center of the board.  A scoring track runs along each edge of the board between the corrals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing the ball on the hind feet of their kicking mule and attempt to kick the ball into the opposite corral by flicking down the front legs of their mule.  A point is scored each time the ball comes to rest in their opponent's corral and the relevant marker is advanced one notch along the scoring track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the end of their scoring track (19 successful kicks) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
