			<description>For untold centuries a war has been waged in the shadows cast by the moon. Two great powers of the underworld clash in repetitive fury, fighting for ultimate supremacy. The hedonistic Vampires believe it to be their birthright to own the night. The untamed Werewolves believe that none other than themselves should  master the Earth. Whose claim is true? When twilight descends, which species will set the ancient records in stone and prove their powers of domination? Time to settle old scores. It&amp;rsquo;s time to Bare Your Fangs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bare Your Fangs is a two-player dice fighting game devoted to resolving once and for all which species will reign supreme: Vampire or Werewolf. Players choose their faction dice and roll to attack! The fully customized die icons determine successful hits, blocks, and of course, one&amp;rsquo;s ability to hunt for humans and thereby heal wounds incurred in these savage battles. But there is always risk. Some humans won&amp;rsquo;t go down without a fight! And one particular human seeks only the total annihilation of all creatures of the night.  The Werewolf&amp;rsquo;s physical power is unmatched but the Vampire&amp;rsquo;s ability to heal is legendary. Only one will rule when dawn breaks, but will the victor crush his opponent into oblivion and take his rightful place as Leader Eternal, or will the fang fray destroy them both!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
