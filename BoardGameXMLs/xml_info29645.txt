			<description>extrapolated From Games Archives rules for the game; HI-RO is a fast and exciting game. Any number of players may play by having a tray of blocks (dice). The object of the game is to turn your blocks until all 5 of them have the same number appearing along the row of sides facing you. The first person to accomplish this calls out &amp;quot;Hi RO&amp;quot; and receives a score determined by the size of the numbers that he/she lines up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5 blocks are set up to that all blanks appear at the top then the tray is passed around the table. The first player moves the center block 3 spaces. That in turn will reveal a number on the top block. That number determines the number of spaces that the next player must turn and so on. Each player must turn the center block with his first play.  After that he may move any of his blocks in an attempt to line up 5 faces numbered alike. The top side of each block last turned controls the move of the next player but you try to score the sides facing you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
