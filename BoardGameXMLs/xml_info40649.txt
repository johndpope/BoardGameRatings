			<description>The game contains a board, troop units (cardboard with plastic stands), and loyalty/deployment cards.A rulebook contains 2 pages of rules and some background to the theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board represents the city of Oja and each player represents a colonel in the Ojawan army. The first player to subdue the Presidential Guard and capture the palace wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 6 units under his command, 4 infantry and 2 tank. One tank will capture one infantry but two infantry capture one tank. Once captured the forces join your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, through loyalty cards, you may find you attack with one of your units who promptly joins the other side as they play its loyalty card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
