			<description>From the introduction: Nemesis 382: The Point of No Return is a story game that seeks to capture the tension and atmosphere of many of those stories and films [about black holes]. In the game, the crew of an exploratory spaceship must decide whether to risk their lives and souls by taking the plunge into a black hole in the name of science and discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of the key personnel on board the ship, all with their own motivations for being there, and ideas on how far they are willing to go. This state of affairs alone creates a dramatic story, in which conflicts must be resolved and consensus reached before any action can be taken. However, as the ship draws closer to the black hole, unexpected events begin to occur &amp;ndash; crises and breakdowns across the ship, as well as oddities and phenomena caused by the black hole itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nemesis 382 is designed as hard science fiction &amp;ndash; there are no&lt;br/&gt;aliens here, no magic science or mysterious forces binding the universe together &amp;ndash; just regular humans, physics and believable technology. However, being this close to a black hole, where space-time is being stretched beyond its limits, means that the strange and surreal can and will happen. How will the crew cope, and will it impact on their ultimate decision?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
