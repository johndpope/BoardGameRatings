							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Good Sirs</name>
									
			<description>The Good Sirs is a 2 player debate game between cats and dogs. All nonsense aside this is a very strategic game. Players have to allocate their actions to gain debating resources. These debating resources help them persuade the audience on certain topics of the city planning debate such as the budget, healthcare, and municipal buildings. The player who sways the most audience members wins the game, but beware to not get carried away, because for every audience member you get, you lose an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
