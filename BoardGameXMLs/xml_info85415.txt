							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.N. Classguides: Monks of the 9 Animal Clans</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine Clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine Masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine Animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine Fighting Styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine New Monk Variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Monastery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flincrest Monastery was founded 500 years ago on a mountaintop somewhat distant from civilization. Its founders were 9 men; the greatest monks of their age, with wildly disparate personalities. Each of these men had established a method of combat, and his own type of serenity, different from his brothers. Their leader, who would now be known as the Owl-Clan Master, made a simple treaty among these great masters; they would not attempt to kill each other, so that each of them could teach students and pass on their unique style of combat. Over the years thousands of students have journeyed to the monastery to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
