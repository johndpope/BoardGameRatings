			<description>Pepsi Invaders (also known as Coke Wins) is an advergame for the Atari 2600 platform, based on the popular Space Invaders. It was commissioned by Coca-Cola for their 1983 sales convention, and developed by Atari as a modification of the original Space Invaders cartridge (essentially, an official ROM hack).&lt;br/&gt;The game is a modification of Space Invaders, with each row consisting of the letters P E P S I followed by an alien, instead of the original six aliens. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, the game was changed from having limited lives but unlimited time as in the original Space Invaders, to having unlimited lives but a three-minute time limit in which to shoot as many of the enemies and complete as many levels as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pepsi Invaders&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
