							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Giant Anaconda</name>
									
			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Giant Anaconda can reach lengths of 50 feet long and weigh as much as 2500 pounds; females tend to be larger then males. They are dark green in color and some are almost black. They make their homes in slow moving rivers, swamps, and bogs. The Giant Anaconda is slow and cumbersome on land but stealthy and sleek in the water. While in the water it can be hard to discern its true size. This is due to its color markings , and its eyes and nasal openings are on top of its head; making it able to stay almost completely submerged. This trait makes the Giant Anaconda an excellent ambush hunter. When it attacks it will first bite down on its intended target with its teeth that make it almost impossible to pull out of its bite due to the way the teeth point back. It then coils around its victim suffocating and/or crushing it to death. Then like most snakes it then swallows its meal whole. The Giant anaconda is normally a solitary animal however, during mating it is not uncommon to see several snakes together in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
