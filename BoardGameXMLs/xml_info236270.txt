			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first in the &amp;ldquo;Refit&amp;rdquo; series of Armada Codex, Talarion is a redesign of the Mercury prototype first presented in issue #8 of Future Armada. As with all issues of the Codex, this product is designed to give you a ready-made ship to drop into your setting and rules of choice - lending depth and detail to your campaign. When it&amp;rsquo;s time to play, zero hour is ready!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years ago, Project Quicksilver developed the Mercury prototype as part of a Human/Cyntek joint venture to blend the best technologies of both nations. The result was an elegant ship with impressive abilities, but one within which most human crew were not comfortable. Recently the engineers of the New Albion Shipyards were given the task of &amp;ldquo;humanizing&amp;rdquo; the design. Capitalizing on the lessons learned with the prototype, they rebuilt the craft using purely Terran technologies and redesigned the interior along the lines of more standard ConFederation ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The endeavor to rework the Mercury prototype was dubbed &amp;ldquo;Project Hermes&amp;rdquo; and the result is the Talarion-class of starships (named for the winged sandals worn by the god). With a focus on technology and ample science facilities, this class of ship is well suited for research and exploration duties. She is decently armed and very well shielded, but combat is not the goal. With her advanced computer system, the Talarion-class is typically operated by a crew of four, though there are bunks for up to eight spread over half a dozen cabins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Talarion package contains four highly detailed, layered PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Main Book&lt;br/&gt;        10 page PDF file detailing the ship and interior areas.&lt;br/&gt;        Contains 3D rendered scenes as well as orthographic views of the ships.&lt;br/&gt;        Includes system independent statistics designed for easy adaption to your game of choice.&lt;br/&gt;        Background, art, and text are on different layers for custom display and printing.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Map Pages&lt;br/&gt;        15 page PDF file containing complete interior maps and instructions for assembly.&lt;br/&gt;        Miniature-scale maps for tactical combat with an optional 1 inch = 5 ft grid.&lt;br/&gt;        Divided into pages for easy printing in full color or printer-friendly black and white.&lt;br/&gt;        Selectable layers include: grid, black &amp;amp; white version, and optional objects.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Uncut Map Images&lt;br/&gt;        A single page PDF files containing a 23x31 inch image of the complete deckplans.&lt;br/&gt;        elect either a light or dark background (for printing or projection/display).&lt;br/&gt;        Includes layers for grid, black &amp;amp; white version, optional cargo, and background choice.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
