			<description>Players take turns appeasing the local dragon by offering sacrifices for it to eat in RingWyrm, a trick-taking card game with room for negotiation. Players attempt to predict how may &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; they are going to win by placing bids. However, players can mess with other player's bids, changing them by playing certain cards. This ability to &amp;quot;prick&amp;quot; a players bid adds a social element to the game. Players might beg or attempt to broker deals with other players to prevent their bids from getting tampered. When it comes to RingWyrm, it isn't enough to be good at trick-taking. You also have to be a charismatic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
