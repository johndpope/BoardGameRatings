			<description>Activator is an abstract strategy game designed for a piecepack and piecepack pyramids.  It is played on a 4&amp;times;4 board, and has a few other aspects in common with Plateau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players' pieces and stacks move according to the number of pieces in the stack:  A single piece moves one space orthogonally; a double, up to two orthogonally; a triple, up to three orthogonally or diagonally.  Moves may only be through empty spaces.  Pieces and stacks may merge or split as part of their move.  Each player also has one activator, that rides parasitically on the opponent's pieces.  It moves up to four spaces orthogonally, from one opposing piece to another, and it is not considered a piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player's activator empowers her pieces/stacks in the same rank or file to capture opposing an opposing piece/stack when they move.  Additionally, any pieces/stacks in the two spaces where the activation lines of the players' activators cross are immobilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can win the game one of two ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Occupy your opponent's home space with one of your pieces/stacks for an entire round.&lt;br/&gt;     Reduce your opponent's forces to one piece/stack to win immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
