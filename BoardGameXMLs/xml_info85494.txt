			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second novel in the METAMORPHOSIS trilogy! The DELUXE EDITION - large size, full stats and game info for characters, critters, places and items, and beautiful artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark forces gather&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now a powerful demon in his own right, the former archmage Hazergal Redfist has become immersed in the brutal politics of the Abyss. With each fiendish transformation wrought upon his body, he gains more power, yet loses another vital piece of his humanity. Allied with the rogue devil Gemnez and an infamous abyssal ruler, Hazergal continues to unlock the mystery of his destiny and harness the awesome power slumbering within him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now an ancient evil has been released from an eons-long imprisonment, and the lower planes are threatened with a power of godlike proportions. The battle lines are drawn, and Hazergal, along with a number of unlikely allies, must thwart the machination of an enemy as old as the multiverse itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the threat of a plane-spanning war looms, a specter from Hazergal&amp;rsquo;s past appears, and he must choose between his thirst for vengeance and the familiar trappings of the life he left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
