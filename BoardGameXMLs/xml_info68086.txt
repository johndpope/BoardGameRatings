			<description>Life has always been hard for the gibs.  This sub terrain race always had a soft spot for shiny objects.  Now that some gems have shown themselves the gibs have all flocked after them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This light fast paced strategy game can be played in just a half hour and supports 2-4 players.  Be the player that has collected the most gems of a single color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a full page of Variants in the new edition to change up game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First edition scoring can still be used but 2nd edition has a new Scoring system to stop people from being able to swing the game to dramatically in a single turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
