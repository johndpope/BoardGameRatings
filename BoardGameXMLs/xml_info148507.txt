			<description>The dynasties of Ancient Egypt rise and fall. Will your rule be strong enough to survive? Feed your citizens, protect them from invaders, and secure their places in the afterlife!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IUNU is a card game for 2 to 4 players lasting about 30 minutes, with the game lasting eight rounds (with 2 or 4 players) and nine rounds (with 3 players). To set up, divide the cards into two decks &amp;mdash; citizens cards and afterlife cards &amp;mdash; shuffling each and placing them face down as draw decks. One player, selected to be the starting player, takes the starting player card with the (1) icon oriented up, rolls the three four-sided dice, and sets them in front of all the players along with the Bread and Deben counters. The starting player then deals an initial hand of cards &amp;mdash; 2 players: 6 cards, 3 or 4 players: 5 cards &amp;mdash; to each player, as well as 9 Debens worth of tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round of game play has two phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Dynasty Phase: In turn, beginning with the starting player, each player plays one, or a set of, citizen cards of the same type in front of them to their &amp;quot;Dynasty&amp;quot;. For each additional card played beyond the first, the player must pay 1 Deben per card [Exception: The Scribe]. The player may then use the special ability of that card type as applicable. Note: You only use the Special Ability once when laying down sets of cards within a turn, i.e., even if you play a set of three Priest cards together in one turn, you only look at the afterlife deck once. Citizen cards have three numbered icons on their lefthand side:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Victory points (VP) that this card will score at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. If a player has a clear majority of a type of citizen card (ties do not count) at game end, they gain this additional number of VP. This number may be further multiplied by an afterlife card. This number is also the total number of cards of that type in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;3. Bread: A player gains additional VP if the Baker feeds that citizen with bread (see: The Baker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Discard Phase: After each player has played one or a set of cards, all players must discard down to one card in their hand. The citizen discard and draw decks are then shuffled together and players draw back to their initial hand size. The starting player passes the starting player card to the next player to the left and it is rotated clockwise to the next round number. Lastly, the new starting player again rolls the three four-sided dice and the next round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the required number of rounds &amp;mdash; or if a player cannot draw the required number of cards back from the draw deck at the end of any round &amp;mdash; the game ends. Count victory points to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Total the number of victory points listed on each citizen card&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Add victory points for a majority of each citizen card type (no points awarded for ties). This value may be multiplied by an Afterlife Card. Multiple Afterlife Cards may be used but only one afterlife card per one majority may be used&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Add victory points for all Bread-fed citizens&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Every 3 Deben coins are worth one additional VP each&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the case of a tie the player with the most Deben coins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
