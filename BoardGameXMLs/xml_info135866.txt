			<description>Easy Under Over is a casino table game involving both dice and cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Easy Over Under is a table game that accommodates six players on a standard blackjack table. The game uses at least one standard deck of 52 playing cards, two six sided dice and a pai gow dice cup. The cards are assigned numerical values with Ace = 1, each of the pip cards according to their face values, Jacks = 11, Queens = 12, and Kings = 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players do not compete against the dealer or other players.
