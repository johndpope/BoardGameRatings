			<description>Football Manager Live was a massively multiplayer online game developed by Sports Interactive released in November 2008 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst the game was subscription based, both major and minor updates were provided within the subscription paid by users. Subscriptions could be purchased online using debit/credit cards, or PayPal to play on a regular basis, or through boxed copies, which were released in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2009. The servers for the game shut down in May 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Football Manager Live differed significantly from previous Football Manager titles, whilst keeping the same match engine and many of their fundamental concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Users were assigned to a &amp;quot;Game World&amp;quot; of up to 1000 players and created their club and filled their squad with real players, similar to fantasy football. Players were signed via a proxy bidding system similar to that of eBay with the player signing with the highest-bidding club. Whilst Football Manager Live utilised a very similar database to that of Football Manager 2009, like its offline counterpart, aging players retired and younger players were randomly generated in their place within each game world, creating an increasingly fictional environment as seasons progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clubs could choose a football association based on the number of matches the user wants to play (&amp;quot;Casual&amp;quot; FAs for casual players and &amp;quot;Xtreme&amp;quot; ones for more dedicated managers) and which play times were most convenient. Each FA had its own ladder system with a premier league and several lower leagues which were linked via promotion and relegation. Matchmaking for league fixtures was done through a &amp;quot;resolve by&amp;quot; system in which users have to finish a game by a certain deadline instead of having to meet online at a specific time. If a player could not meet the deadline, an AI &amp;quot;assistant manager&amp;quot; took over their team for that match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also added a role playing game-like skill training system for users. Managers could improve their skills over time in coaching, physiotherapy, finance, scouting and infrastructure to become more specialised or to suit their style of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players could also construct a stadium to accommodate several different fan bases to the club. These included die hards, devoted, families, glory hunters and corporates, each offering their own characteristics such as wealth and atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Football Manager Live&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
