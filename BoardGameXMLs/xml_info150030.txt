			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a description of a certain way of roleplaying. We call it &amp;quot;Playing With Intent&amp;quot;. If you like to improvise, to explore characters and story, the thrill of never knowing what happens next, this is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ideas are simple. They do, however, require experience with roleplaying, preferably with different schools/styles of roleplaying. It is possible for an inexperienced player to participate in Playing With Intent, but at least two participants should have roleplaying experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will do everything we can to make you awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central idea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will use different roleplaying techniques as you see fit, selecting and incorporating them along the way, following the flow of the game and your own personal desires. In this way, you will explore something that nobody has experienced before you, and nobody will again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does this mean?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It means there is no fixed set of rules. You'll be trying out different rules, techniques, ways of play as you go along. Maybe, at some point in play, a player says: &amp;quot;I'd like to turn out the lights and play out this scene in total darkness.&amp;quot; Maybe, in a different game, a player says: &amp;quot;Let's put some miniatures on the table to see where all the characters are.&amp;quot; Or someone says: &amp;quot;Lie down on the floor! We'll be the voices in your head, whispering your madness.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No rules at all? No structure? Yes, there is some structure. There are some principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
