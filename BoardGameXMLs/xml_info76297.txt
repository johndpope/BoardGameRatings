			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wheels Within Wheels is the last of five free adventures in the Novus Ordum Mundi Adventures series for 7th Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the file's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serk Markstrom, a prominent member of the Swordsman's Guild, and a member of the Council of Thirteen, has put a plan into motion to thwart Alvara Arciniega. Although Serk is not ready to openly defy Arciniega, he is more than willing to interfere with his plans and delay his research. Utilizing his many connections, Markstrom discovered the whereabouts of Stefan, one of the many smugglers Arciniega uses to acquire artifacts, scientific inventions, and alchemical components. He knows that Stefan is driving a caravan of three wagons through the Lockhorn forest of Montaigne, towards the city of Muguet, where the contents of the wagons can be shipped to Arciniega. Markstrom hires the Heroes, through the guise of the Swordsman's Guild, to stop the wagon in the forest, arrest Stefan, and bring the contents of the wagon to the authorities at Muguet. Of course, Arciniega is no fool, and he assigns his personal police force, de Espectro Acero, to keep Markstrom under surveillance. Upon discovering Markstrom's plan, the Espectro Acero are dispatched to deal with the Heroes and protect the caravan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
