			<description>Cinemaware's Thematic Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In a time of lusty wenches and black-hearted villains, King Richard has been murdered and England thrown into civil war! Amidst the ringing clash of steel and the thunder of charging steeds the bold Saxon knights have chosen you to lead them into battle against the hated Normans. Players will compete in grand tournaments of joust, siege castles and raid enemy strongholds in their attempt to find the lost crown of England. Enlisting the support of Robin Hood, players will have to outwit their enemies to control England and restore order to a war-torn land.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defender of the Crown is set in the Middle Ages, where following the death of King Richard, players assume the role of a Saxon lord, try to fight off Norman hordes and ultimately wrestle for complete control of England.  The players will collect valuable resources to build strongholds, amass armies and fight for control of opponents' castles and territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may engage enemy lords with their armies on the battlefield or contest lands and fame in medieval tournaments.  They may also loot the treasuries of opposing lords or lay siege to their castles.  Players must also contend with random events such as plague, drought, locusts while fighting for their right to be crowned King of England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has taken control of all enemy counties they will be crowned king and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
