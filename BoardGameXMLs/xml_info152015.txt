							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Finals Fever</name>
									
			<description>Finals Fever is a simulation of Australian football played on a board measuring 68cm by 48cm, representative of a football oval with spectators, and including a set of &amp;quot;decision cards&amp;quot; to govern umpiring decisions, plus two dice and a counter representing the ball. The playing area is separated into squares, some with position names inscribed on them, some bearing the letter &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; (for decision card), and others blank. There is a space for the decision cards which are shuffled and placed face down in a pile. The ball is moved in accordance with dice rolls, with the aim being to maintain possession by ensuring that the ball lands on one of the dice roller's own position squares. If the ball lands on a &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; square play continues as per the instructions on the decision card at the top of the pile. If the ball lands on a blank square, possession goes to the other player. When playing from a position square both dice are rolled; when intercepting the ball from a blank square only a single die is used. The ultimate aim is to score goals (worth 6 points) and behinds (worth 1 point) by moving the ball through the appropriate posts at either end of the playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
