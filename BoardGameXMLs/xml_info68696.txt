							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.N. Guild Vol. 3: Monster Hunters&#039; Guild</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters are everywhere, a plague to both peasant and king alike. They battle foes in the forlorn depths of dungeons, the untamed wilderness beyond our fragile bubble of civilization, and, most insidiously, within the very cities that offer us sanctuary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surcease from this dire threat often comes in the form of doughty adventurers, brave souls who, for want of renown or simply treasure, confront monstrous beasts for the benefit of civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, adventurers are often difficult to find, ill prepared, untimely, or just as likely to end up on a monster's menu as an unskilled commoner. In addition, adventurers come in all flavors of moral direction, and those beseeching aid from a passing band of heroes may end up with a threat more dangerous than the monster itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are those beleaguered by beasts to do? Where can one find a professional? Where are those well versed in the ecology of monsters? Those who are well studied in the obscure lore of bestial weaknesses, with the resources and skills to find and slay even the most dangerous of creatures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer is, of course, at the local Monster Hunters' guild house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From E.N. Publishing comes the third book in the E.N. Guild series, plunging you into a guild of studying and hunting monsters. E.N. Guild books bring you a resource of knowledge and crunchy rules. This third fully-bookmarked pdf venture into the secrets of fantasy guilds brings you 31 pages of material ready to use instantly.
