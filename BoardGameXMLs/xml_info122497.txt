			<description>The card game Buck Jitters comes a deer hunting theme, yet is quite abstract in nature. Each card has two numeric values and they are compared with the opponent's card played, with the higher number winning and the lower number adding to the victor's point total. The game includes wild cards and trump cards to adjust the card values. There are many scenarios included with partnership play available as well. It is played in rounds and there is bidding involved, providing a Bridge like format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
