			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It looked so good when we took our first job - top salary, unique experiences, explore exotic colony worlds beyond the vast. They didn't say our first ship was aboard a pre-Drift tech starship and that we'd have to spend the next 18 months in cold sleep, this was not the unique experience we were hoping for. I hope we don't have a rude awakening before its done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rude Awakening is a FREE one-shot module designed for use with the Starfinder Roleplaying Game for a party of four 1st level characters. This adventure works best as the 1st module in a campaign arc. This is the first installment to a series of Starfinder Roleplaying Game Compatible products Gamer Printshop will be releasing over the next year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes; 18 page one-shot adventure module and appendices for new rules as a PDF. A separate layered PDF containing print ready adventure map and starship deck plan as full size maps and sliced to letter size for home printing. A Zip file containing JPGs of the map and deck plan without a grid for use with virtual tabletop applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
