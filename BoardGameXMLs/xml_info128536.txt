							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadowrun Supplemental (Issue 6 - Feb 1998)</name>
									
			<description>From the Editors Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to issues #6 of The Shadowrun Supplemental! This is the on-again off-again Rigger/Vehicle issue, which as you can see, is onagain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I sincerely apologize for the lateness of this issue. The reasons were multiple, a lot of it doing with the winter break for most college and university students. Then, my internet provider canceling my dial-up account without fore-warning me delayed it a few more days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will note that this is only one piece of the issue, as there are separate files for the Rigger Black Book 1 style vehicles and the Rigger 2 vehicles. Although as I write this neither are completely finished, they should be out soon after you read this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reasoning behind splitting the issue up was twofold, number one to keep the file size down, and two, because some people prefer RBB1 or Rigger 2 for various reasons, and only want the vehicles that will work with their statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping with the Rigger focus on this issue, we snagged an interview with Rigger 2 author Jon Szeto, as well as a piece of his unpublished work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only do we bring you a ton of great stuff to enhance and expand on Rigger2, but for those of you that enjoy miniatures, or want to start, we&amp;rsquo;ve cut a deal with Ral Partha, check out the bargain prices on vehicle related mini&amp;rsquo;s!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of this issue is meant to be a challenge to FASA or to Jon Szeto. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to push the rigger spectrum of Shadowrun even further than FASA hoped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
