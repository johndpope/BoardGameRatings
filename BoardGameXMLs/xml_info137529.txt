			<description>A light, engaging game where a lot of different things can happen.  Players take turns placing cards on a cloth grid.  The first player (or team) to form one of the top poker hands (straight or better) wins, provided all of the cards are in a straight line and in your possession as indicated by colored markers.  Crossing lines adds challenge as your opponent is always trying to block your efforts even as he/she develops his/her own winning line.  In addition, deuces allow a player to either take over a card or remove it from the board.  A real &amp;quot;thinking&amp;quot; game and multifaceted, as every game unfolds differently.  Team play is a lot of fun.  The deuces play a big role in strategy, hence the name of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
