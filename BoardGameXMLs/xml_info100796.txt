							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elephant Quest</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Elephant Quest you control an elephant who jumps and fires his laser. Jumping from platform to platform, from your previous door (level entry) to your next (level exit) you encounter both monsters and other elephants. The other elephants will either give you tips and hints, or ask something from you (quest).&lt;br/&gt; The game is not linear: you can return to previous levels (which are then repopulated with monsters) and the levels themselves are not linear, but more maze like connected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While solving quests and shooting monsters, you earn experience points. Once you level up, you can, like in a RPG, up your stats: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Agility (subdivided in Acrobatics, Hide Armor and Constitution)&lt;br/&gt;     Intelligence (Weapon Targeting, Credit Junkie, Spike Readiness)&lt;br/&gt;     Dexterity (Weapons, Swiftness, Adreline)&lt;br/&gt;     Charisma (Miniphant Swarm, Quest Uptake, Cantering)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 11 quests and almost 50 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
