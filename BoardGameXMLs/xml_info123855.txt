			<description>An unusual subject for a statistical sports game. Designed to be very fast so that an entire Olympic gymnastic competition could be played in one evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 250 gymnasts are rated for their abilities. These are based on performances at the real Olympic Games. Essentially, roll dice for each perticipant and that roll is checked against their rating to give them their score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics are provided in paper lists rather than individual cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
