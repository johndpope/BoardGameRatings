							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ice King of Kislev</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Vladimir Tyudor, a Kislevite merchant, charlatan, and the self-proclaimed Ice King of Kislev has recently come up with a plan to harvest ice from the frozen lakes up in Northern Kislev for the purposes of exporting it to Altdorf where he will sell it as a luxury good to the capital&amp;rsquo;s cr&amp;egrave;me de la cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a shrewd marketer, the King has convinced Altdorf's nobility that nothing says wealth and influence quite like offering ice-cold refereshments during the hot summer months. Bewitched by the King's boisterous charm the nobles are fiercely competing over his services and business is good. However, he knows from experience that his current fame and fortune can wane in an instant and, at worst, turninto a pitchfork-wielding mob, so he is bent on squeezing every crown out of their purses before the window of opportunity closes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article presents the Ice King&amp;rsquo;s venture and details how you can use him in your games. Firstly, the Ice King himself and his trade are introduced. Then, some of his accomplices and associates are examined, and, finally, different ways how to use him in your games ranging from short encounters to a whole campaign are presented. The article places Tyudor&amp;rsquo;s ice business in Altdorf, but it could just as well be located in Nuln or Marienburg if that is more convenient for the Gamemaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
