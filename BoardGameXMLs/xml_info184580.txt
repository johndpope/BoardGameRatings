			<description>Four scientists from across the world have been invited by the Earth Vision Industrial Labs (E.V.I.L), to create a chemical potion that would eradicate malnutrition from our planet. However, after reaching the laboratory, the scientists realise that the E.V.I.L Chairman has other plans in mind and is looking to rule the world with a potent mind control potion. On refusing to cooperate, they were locked-up within the laboratory. Can you help them escape E.V.I.L?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game basically involves moving on the board from one spot to another (based on die roll), each spot either gives you the option to buy some chemical, or steal money from prison guards. Essentially, you need to obtain all the resources needed for your eventual goal (decided at the start of the game), then move towards a location on the board, which is the warden's office and then die-roll your way out of a secret track to the end of the game. If you are the first one to do that, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
