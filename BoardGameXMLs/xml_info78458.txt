			<description>Subtitle: The Game of Faerie Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does your garden suddenly look dry and wilted? Are you finding it hard to get new plants to take root and grow? You may think these are signs that insects or bad soil quality are at work but I must warn you it could be a sign something far more sinister is at work. Something you may have heard of. Faeries! There are those who want you to believe faeries are these cute, harmless little winged people who are only curious about humans. That belief could not be farther from the truth. Fairies are nothing more than selfish little addicts, whose sole desire in life is to suck the life right out of your garden. What you don't know is that a beautiful well tended garden is a place of magic and magic is what the evil little creatures are addicted to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Bad Faeries, the game of faerie combat. In Bad Faeries each player controls a mob of faeries fighting over a magical garden and the right to drain that garden of its life giving magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build a mob of 200 points worth of fays, such as Brownie, Pixie, Leprechaun, Goblin, Nymph, etc.  Each fay type is rated for six attributes: Flit, Nimbleness, Wards, Wariness, Smacks, Being, and has a given cost.  A mob can be of mixed types, and you may have Brownies facing Brownies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once your mob is assembled, give them weapons and magic abilities.  The mobs then meet in combat to determine who rules the Garden.  Rules are provided for movement, ranged, melee and magical combat, wounds, terrain, morale and victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
