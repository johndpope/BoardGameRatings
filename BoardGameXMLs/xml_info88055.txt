							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minor Dragon Overlords of the Fifth Age</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Web Enhancement for the Dragonlance Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of Krynn are breathing a bit easier these days, since several of the most deadly dragon Overlords are now dead. But the danger has not ended-many minor Overlords remain alive and are very likely plotting to extend their realms during the turmoil and confusion following the return of the gods. Two intrepid adventurers have risked their lives to provide us with new information on these dragons, so that those who encounter them will have some idea what they are up against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are not the only powerful dragons now present in Krynn, of course-many dragons went into hiding during the reign of the Overlords. Since then, some of them have been sleeping safely in concealed caverns, while others have fled to different parts of the world. But now that the news of the Overlords&amp;rsquo; destruction has begun to spread, many of these dragons have awakened and begun to plot their return. No information on them is available at the moment, but we will disseminate it as it comes to us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
