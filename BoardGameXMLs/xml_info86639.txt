			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not everyone can be the good guy. There are times when a more underhanded approach is needed and there needs to be more bodies. Ethics simply get in the way. In a world where humanoids are outnumbered by monsters, demons scheme behind the curtain, and the strongest heroes stand alone against powerful forces, others are called upon to do what must be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the world of Dark Emerald accessories for the 4th  Edition of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;trade;. Investigating the darker side of the fantasy campaign, these products began with the Quick Kill, a guidebook for characters to kill opponent in one strike with skill challenges, and continues with Dark Classes: Assassin. Murderers for hire, they are the elite of their kind. Professional to the extreme, they operate in secret with legends of their target spreading the word and bumping up the pay. Whether they work to a code or take on with the highest bidder, assassins can add unique developments to any game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this PDF, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the complete assassin class (including over 70 unique powers), three paragon paths (the poisoneer, suicide striker, and hood), new feats, and a list of unique weapons common to the assassin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
