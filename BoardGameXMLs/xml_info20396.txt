							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armored Trooper Votoms: Conflict on Kummen</name>
									
			<description>Based on the &amp;quot;Armored Trooper Votoms&amp;quot; mecha anime sci-fi series, &amp;quot;Conflict on Kummen&amp;quot; is a boardgame about piloted robot fighting machines. &amp;quot;Conflict on Kummen&amp;quot; is a one page, free, promotional game printed on glossy perforated card stock. Apparently the game is a tie-in to a roleplaying game, and a related series of boardgames (though it's not clear if the board games were published).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include a map and small cut-out counters and range/distance gauge all on glossy cardstock. The rules, mecha stats are on the back along with a postcard. (If you mail the postcard, you will lose half the board.) The board has no grid or hexes, so the game has a miniatures flavor. Rules are very short and simple with turn order being determined each phase by rolling and adding a mental stat. Mechs move and fight with ranged weapons, until losing all their hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
