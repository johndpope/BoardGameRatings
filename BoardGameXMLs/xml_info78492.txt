			<description>Paladin's Quest, known as Lennus (レナス　古代機械の記憶, Lennus Kodai Kikai no Kioku) in Japan, is a console role-playing game developed by Copya System and published in Japan by Asmik Corporation on November 13, 1992, for the Super Famicom. It was published in North America by Enix in October 1993. It was different from other role-playing games at the time, because when the player casts magic, it takes away HP (hit points) instead of MP (magic points/power).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its sequel, Lennus II, was only released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centers around a boy named Chezni who, on a dare, activates an ancient machine called Dal Gren and in doing so releases a being of immense power and evil. As a result the magic school is destroyed and the headmaster of the school orders Chezni to destroy Dal Gren at whatever cost before it destroys the world. During his travels he meets a girl named Midia, very much like himself, who wishes to help him on his quest, and numerous other mercenaries that come to aid Chezni. The main antagonist is a young dictator named Zaygos, who wants to use the Dal Gren for his own nefarious purposes.&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Paladin's Quest, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
