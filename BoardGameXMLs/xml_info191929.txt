							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Another Fatal Love Story</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Rana and Drake met, it was love at first sight. And for about two years  that love was intense. Sweat-stinging your eyes kind of intense. But those are just chemicals in the body tricking them into believing they are in love. And when those chemicals wear off and they look over to the person lying in bed with them&amp;hellip; Well?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they realize they don&amp;rsquo;t love that person anymore, it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on. Except Rana doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to move on. She wants Drake dead. Rana would have a hard time explaining exactly why. Maybe she doesn&amp;rsquo;t love him, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want anyone else having him either. Or maybe he&amp;rsquo;s been disrespectful one too many times. None of that really matters. She just needs her friends to help with the planning, execution, and disposal. What could go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol One-Sheet Series do not include rules, only charts. Each game requires players to own at least one game in the Protocol series, or Protocol Prime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
