							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scarlet Empire</name>
									
			<description>Starting in 1997, Glenn Rahman designed an extension to his fabulous game Divine Right.  Scarlet Empire took place in a different period in that game's world, and further to the south of the original map.  It was designed as a stand alone game that could also be played in combination with the other one.  The campaign game pits most of the players against the one playing the Scarlet Witch King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you liked Divine Right, you'd like Scarlet Empire -- everything that made the first game great is also present in the other.  Mercenaries, special locations, diplomacy, magic, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scarlet Empire was supposed to be published by Excalibre Games and made it as far as the advanced play-test stages, but the publisher hemmed and hawed and tried to cut costs, so much so Glen eventually gave up in disgust.  A very few play-test copies are in existence as a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Divine Right&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
