			<description>from inside box lid:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;George Blanda's Monday Nite Touchdown is a fun game for ages seven through adult. It is also educational as it will help those who are learning to add, subtract, multiply and those who are trying to learn the fundamentals of football. It is played like real football with actual rules and techniques applied.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are twelve dice total, six each of two colors. Each player has five dice of one color and one of the opposite color, which is his &amp;quot;captain&amp;quot;. The board is a cardboard stylized football field with plastic sliders moving back and forth in slots to track the ball position on the field, the first down position, and the current down. Real time is used as the game clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, the game follows the play of a regular NFL match, with kickoffs (including touchbacks), rushing, passing, touchdowns, PATs, field goals, and punts. Players switch ends of the &amp;ldquo;field&amp;rdquo; at the half. Fumbles, interceptions, and even safeties are also provided for. Play consists of both players rolling their dice and comparing the results, with the higher total prevailing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player mis-adds his dice, a 15-yard penalty is assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
