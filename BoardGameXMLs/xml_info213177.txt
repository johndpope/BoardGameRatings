							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Penguinfolk</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Spelljammer setting of the 2nd Edition, there was a race of creatures known as the dohwar.  As anthropomorphic penguin-like traders, they often served more as an annoyance than as any real threat or race that a player might choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, crash landing in the hostile True World setting of Maztica and finding an ancient, sentient artifact from the batrachian creator race has a tendency to change who you are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the penguinfolk have their very own warriors, monks and even warlocks.  Their enemies are legion, including the dreaded hakuna (dragonne-like beasts) from the mountains and raiding sahuagin from the sea.  The only thing these enemies all have in common, is that they universally underestimate the dohwar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains the history of the penguinfolk, their cliffside city, the artifact that influences them, new classes, weapons, and a monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
