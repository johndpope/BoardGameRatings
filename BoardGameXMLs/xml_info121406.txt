			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical adventure game set during the carnival of Venice. Your wife has been brutally killed, her murderer disguised by a mask. The police, fearing the numerous Venitian secret societies, won't help you. Your only choice is to look for the killer yourself, but how do you lead an investigation in a city where everyone is masked, when you are in danger of being killed by the same people who ordered the murder of the love of your life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is entirely icon-based. The first release of the game, Masque, was followed a few months later by a second edition called Masque+, as the designer thought the first version was too difficult to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
