			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN THAT EVER LIVED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stardust the Super Wizard is a name spoken in hushed whispers throughout the universe, He uses his vast knowledge of interplanetary science and sorcery to monitor all inhabited worlds, and when he finds beings he considers exceptionally evil or vile, he dispenses the justice he feels they deserve. Once you've incurred the wrath of the Super Wizard, you are done for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stardust the Super Wizard from NUELOW Games collects six tales from the Golden Age of Comics by one or its most eccentric and erratic creators, Fletcher Hanks. Although he only worked in comics for a brief time during 1939 to 1941, the over-the-top nature of his work left a permanent mark on the emerging artform--and it makes the stories worth reading even today. The &amp;quot;Stardust the Super Wizard&amp;quot; series is where his bizarre story-telling style was most prominantly on display. followed closely by run on the &amp;quot;Fantomah&amp;quot; series (highlights from which are featured in NUELOW's The Three Lives of Fantomah: Mystery Woman of the Jungle.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the classic comics, Stardust the Super Wizard contains an extensive OGL d20 System adaptation of the techno-magical devices featured in the comics, as well as an all-new map and description of the base from which Stardust operates. This never-before-published material is by veteran game designer Steve Miller, whose work on Star Wars roleplaying games for two different publishers (West End Games and Wizards of the Coast) and some of the more macabre releases for the Ravenloft game setting, makes him uniquely suited to capture the nature of Hanks' Stardust in game form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
