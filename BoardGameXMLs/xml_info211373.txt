							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beast of Karridan&#039;s Hollow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beast of Karridan's Hollow is a Traveller adventure for four to six characters. It's set in the small village of Karridan's Hollow in southeastern Dravelnar, a medieval kingdom on the world of Netherell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Netherell, a planet shrouded in mystery is the home to powerful magicians (psionicists) and even more powerful natural forces.  One of these is eating at the heart of the Kingdom of Dravelnar.  Into this volatile mix the players are called on by a village elder to deliver them from a terrible beast, an ogre taking what it wants including many villagers as slaves.  Its motives are unclear but it's obvious that if Karridan's Hollow is to survive the beast must be dealt with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are your players up to the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
