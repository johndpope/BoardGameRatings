			<description>Code of Princess Card Game is based on the 3DS console game software of the same name. In this game, each player assumes role of one of characters with various skills and try to get more VPs than other players by winning round battles for 5 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a round each player bids his 5 action cubes divided on 4 stats (Mind/Order of skill, chrisma/order of supporter, order of battle, and attack points) behind cover. Then each player builds up his/her power by choosing a pair of skill cards and a supporter card by the order of bids for each stat. And then the round battle comes and each player plays skill cards and earns VPs by its outcome. After a total of five rounds, the player with the most VPs wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
