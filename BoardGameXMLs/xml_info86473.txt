							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Jack Dice</name>
									
			<description>This is a dice game in Onsworld's Jackpot Dice series.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with five special dice that show an Ace, deuce, four, eight ten and Jack. There are also cards showing each of these denominations and four cards showing pay-offs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player takes on the role of banker and hands a die to another player to cast. After rolling the first die, that player decides how much to bet and subsequently decides whether to roll more dice, one by one, attempting to come as close to a total of twenty-one but not exceeding it. If he exceeds twenty-one the banker takes the player's stake, but if he stops below twenty-one, the banker then rolls two dice and attempts to beat or equal the player's roll. If the banker fails to equal the roll or goes bust, the player wins the appropriate amount as indicated on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optionally, the players may play with side bets. For this purpose, the other cards showing card faces are laid out and players may bet on these faces appearing on the dice for each roll of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions mention that other games in the Jackpot Dice series include Clipper, Crown and Anchor, Liar and Crossword Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
