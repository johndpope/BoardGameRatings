			<description>Magma is a game for two to six players. Your goal is to claim as much territory as possible while using as few pieces as possible. If you&amp;rsquo;re playing with more than three players, you&amp;rsquo;re playing on a two-player team. (How do you get two-player teams with five players? One player controls two home bases.)  Play is a lot like a fusion of Chinese Checkers and Go, except you can only jump pieces of your own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magma uses a custom board and a bunch of tokens in three different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules and board are available at: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/527/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/527/&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to assemble your own set, or if you want a nicer-looking board, you can order a copy from The Game Crafter for a very reasonable price: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/magma&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/magma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magma has fairly simple rules. Thanks to CPSIA, the game is appropriate for ages 12 and up (although parental supervision could probably reduce this restriction significantly). A 6-player game takes about 45 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
