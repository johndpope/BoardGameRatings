			<description>A boardgame for two tired parents trying to keep their household running. Fighting against the clock and the little overlord of chaos, will they manage to have any happiness points by nightfall?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two parents play one day or 17 hours against one little toddler who moves randomly in the house creating mess each turn.Each hour is one turn in which the parents have to spend action points to move around the house to clean, to do the household chores and toe spend time on 'events', some more chores or unexpected chaos or activities with the toddler, leading to more mess but also to happyness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mess arrives in a spot due to an event, a chore not managed or the little toddler moving around. If this is not removed before more mess arrives at the location, it becomes harder to clean and in a next level breaks that location so no chores or events can take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A clean house, rest and fun activities give happyness points, a too messy house and not managing the chores leads to less happyness. So both parents have to work together to plan the best schedule, when to be where in the house, who does which activity and who runs after the toddler to balance the keeping the house in order and to score happyness points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
