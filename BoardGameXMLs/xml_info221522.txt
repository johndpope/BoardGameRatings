							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gylden Kongerike: Golden Kingdom of the Dwarves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dwarf kingdom of Gylden Kongerike is the southernmost region of the fortress mountains and is considered the gateway to the many lands beyond. Unlike the dwarves you know the ones here at the Golden Kingdom have built an above ground village and trading center inhabited by many arcane, dwarf, and humans side by side in a setting reminiscent of a medieval town studded with seeming anachronistic technology. Game Masters this is an excellent quest all on its own with its dangerous labyrinths, adventures into fairy infested forests, dangerous mountain passes, and a lively town setting. Or it can be used as a resting place or starting spot for a much broader campaign as the village of Gylden Kongerike has every resource player characters might need to begin a new adventure. This little dwarf village is a great place for new characters to &amp;quot;cut their teeth&amp;quot; and gain a little treasure in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
