			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le Pacte is a French graphic adventure game developed by Eric Chahi. The player character is part of a paranormal investigation team sent to explore a haunted house. The story is heavily inspired by the Amityville books and movies. The goal of the game was to find the source of the evil presence in the house and destroy it before the character went mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is inspired by text adventure games, though instead of entering text on the keyboard, the player uses the joystick to pick from a list of actions, then picks from a list of objects. Help is included in the game in the form of dreams or Ouija seances. Other noteworthy features are a day-night cycle, a PSY indicator measuring the character's sanity, and a camera used to reveal the presence of invisible supernatural entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
