			<description>This six player game is an upgraded version of Formula 1 Fever, which allows gamers to experience the thrills of F1 racing in the comfort of their own home. Gamers have the choice of competing in a single race or the entire F1 championships playing on the different race tracks similar to the actual F1 Championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (driver) has an identical deck of movement cards, which also represents their fuel, so if at any time during the game they run out of cards, they are out of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the race, players are given 12 construction points to customize their cars according to how they think it will race best on the track selected (the basic game comes with 2 tracks - Malaysia &amp;amp; Japan). Players can choose from better:&lt;br/&gt;- Acceleration (1 point).&lt;br/&gt;- Braking (1 point).&lt;br/&gt;- Cornering (2 points).&lt;br/&gt;- Special features (3 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race is over 3 laps, and players begin with 5 cards from their deck, and 3 &amp;quot;Event&amp;quot; cards (which introduce elements such as rain, safety car, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players starting with the race leader:&lt;br/&gt;1) Decide if he/she wishes to play an &amp;quot;Event&amp;quot; card. The effects take place immediately.&lt;br/&gt;2) Must play 1 &amp;quot;Movement&amp;quot; card and MAY play 1 other card (Acceleration, Braking, Cornering or Special).&lt;br/&gt;3) Players then move their cars according to the modified score of their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in real life, players have to really plan how to negotiate the corners, where penalty points in the form of tire wear is imposed if players pass the corners. Essentially, players who land on the corners receive no penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also have to plan tactically when to make their pit stops, and whether they take a short one (just top up petrol), or a longer one (where they also change tires).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, players who manage their resources well, take risks at the right time and plan their pit stops well will emerge the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
