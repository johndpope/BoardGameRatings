			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take Your Game To The Next Level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing &amp;ldquo;Alternate Paths: Martial Characters&amp;rdquo;. This book is designed with the very experienced player in mind as it presents alternate rules and classes that are more suited to their needs.&lt;br/&gt;Overview: 7 new base classes, non-vancian magic systems, 8 new armor properties,  20 new weapon properties, 3 unique magic items, 34 new feats (16 of those are metamagic/non-class specific magic manipulating feats), 10 revised feats and talents, 17 new spells (very much focused on the meta-game of magic), 10 new magical diseases and afflictions.!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Base Classes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ancient: A ritualistic spellcaster who welcomes the host of all their past lives into their soul. They have a small, unique, spell list that provides 24 hour buffs (rituals) that require the receiving party to partake in the casting. They tap deep into the memory of eons long past to control this primal form of magic. The class also plays with age categories and time in a very weird fashion. (Non-vancian)&lt;br/&gt;    Arcanaphage: They turn a particularly nasty magical disease into raw magical power. They are part magical hacker (modifying their spells on the fly with impromptu adjustments), part antimage, and part blaster.&lt;br/&gt;    Gnostic: A mathematical mage with multitude of multiplying effects on their magic. They practice a form of divine numerology to power their spells and modify their all-AoE spell list based on how many creatures they target. They have a small list of about a dozen spells that all have variable spell levels and are based on a fluctuating resource rather than a vancian system.&lt;br/&gt;    Godaiken: If you have played our &amp;quot;tao&amp;quot; this is it's elemental brother. Using a visual chart- you can master the elements and perform crazy displays of martial power.&lt;br/&gt;    Haunted One: A haunted one turns a ghost that just won't leave you alone into a power. Their ghastly companion is deadly but not always under your control. They also have suite of ghost themed abilities that is more &amp;quot;6th Sense&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;necromancer&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;    Lover: By denying themselves love, a lover gains supernatural magical power. They are trained diplomats and peacekeepers, using their abilities to snuff the flames of war. They are masters of debilitating magic- able to drain or subdue creatures with either their diplomacy or their magic.&lt;br/&gt;    Worldshaper: A worldshaper is a magical artisan who is part of a masonic guild (though not as covert). They have the ability to manipulate materials like clay, animate objects (our playtest had a house try to coup de grace a t-rex), while still remaining a viable character. Our playtesters described it as a utility heavy toolbox that is only as strong as your creativity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
