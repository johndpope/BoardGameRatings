			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Laundry &amp;ndash; protecting the United Kingdom from the scum of the multiverse. Most of the time, saving the world is a 9 to 5 job. Clock in every morning. Feel your life tick away with each meeting and each pointless bit of paperwork. Stare at a screen and feel your brain leaking out through your ears. Try to keep the boredom from killing you. Clock out in the evening and slouch home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's never good when they call you into the office at four in the morning. Any mission that doesn't fit on the standard day planner is inevitably ghastly. They involve things with too many tentacles, people who want to kill you, and secrets that mean you'll never sleep well again. Keep your mouth shut and your head down, and you might just make it through the night. Screw up, and it's entirely possible you just doomed humanity to a fate worse than death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Bag Jobs contains six self-contained missions for your Laundry campaign. From the war-torn hillsides of Afghanistan to the corridors of power in Whitehall, from yoga lessons in Devon to the end of the world, it's time to break in and steal the secrets of reality, like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The truth about social networking&lt;br/&gt;    How to weaponize a shoggoth&lt;br/&gt;    Management secrets of the undying priests&lt;br/&gt;    What the Auditors fear&lt;br/&gt;    How to prepare for the apocalypse&lt;br/&gt;    ... and what happens after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
