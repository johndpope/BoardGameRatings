			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you expect the captain of the football team to piss himself when you pointed your rifle at him?  Maybe.  You sure didn&amp;rsquo;t expect him to try to eat your flesh.  Something terrifying has happened, and now your carefully laid plans for a school massacre have been turned on their head.  But heck, you&amp;rsquo;ve got the ammo, you&amp;rsquo;ve got the adrenaline, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got some time before the authorities mobilize.  Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re going to enjoy yourself one way or another.  Bullies and undead beware!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Create characters on-the-fly at the beginning of the game with an in-character police interrogation scene&lt;br/&gt;     Match wits with the game master in a game of chess, where your moves affect your control over the narrative&lt;br/&gt;     Two distinct sections of gameplay, The Shooting and The Hordes, that provide two very different types of horror&lt;br/&gt;     Shoot bullies and shit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
