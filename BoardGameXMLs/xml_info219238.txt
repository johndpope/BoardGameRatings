			<description>From cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere in the middle of the huge forrest is an ancient castle. Local people tell of strange creatures that guard vast treasures hidden within the castle, though since noone who has dares do venture inside has ever returned it's difficult to know how much is fact and how much is speculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not too far away from the castle is a small cottage which you may as well use as your base. Though now uninhabited remains in good repair, cared for by the villagers who regard it as a sort of shrine. With luck you may find there some items that will help you in your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
