			<description>Only a dirty pig is a happy pig!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Drecksau, each player has 3-5 clean pigs in front of him and three cards in hand. Each turn one card is played. By playing a mud card, one pig can be sent into the mud. The pig card is flipped over to show a dirty pig on the back. Rain cards clean all pigs, even your own! Barn cards protect pigs from the rain, while lightning cards destroy barns &amp;ndash; but lightning rod cards protect barns from lightning cards. Farmer cards can be sent to dirty pigs: the farmer likes clean pigs... Pigs in a barn that are protected with a lock card are safe from the farmer. The first player who has dirtied all of his pigs wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drecksau To Go includes both the Drecksau base game and the Sausch&amp;ouml;n expansion that lets players decide how they want to participate in the pig parade, whether with full makeup and styling fit for a beauty pageant or a more traditional wallow in the mud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
