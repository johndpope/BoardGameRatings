							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gothnog&#039;s Legendary Weapons and Magic (Fifth Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gothnog&amp;rsquo;s Curiosity Shop has seen many wonders, oddities and trinkets pass through its doors over the centuries. The objects contained herein are from the shop&amp;rsquo;s ledger, and represent some of the most unique and bizarre items of magic ever compiled in one book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the biggest issues with magic items in most fantasy settings is that they are boring and generic. When a character picks up a +1 sword that glows around orcs, they are likey to toss it aside as soon as something better comes along. But if that sword was carried by one of the two of the greatest heroes of Middle Earth, and wielded it during the Battle of the Five Armies and the War of the Ring, it takes on a great deal of significance. I mean, who would throw away Sting?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  With that in mind, this book contains over 3 dozen unique magical items. Each has a rich history and lore, with powers ranging from the mundane to the epic, and each will add depth and richness to any campaign setting. When you reward your PCs with one of these items, they will have no doubt that they have acquired something of great value. The very platinum in their pockets will seem dull by comparison.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a series of books dealing with magic items, so your feedback and suggestions are very much appreciated. Check back often for more curious books from the infamous Captain Gothnog and his new and enigmatic partner, known only as &amp;quot;The Swamper.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
