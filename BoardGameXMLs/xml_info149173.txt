			<description>&amp;ldquo;There are only five of us now, three of us didn&amp;rsquo;t make it when we ran into them on the other side of the stream. None of us wants to think that they are following us, mindless, only wanting to feast on our flesh, but we cannot stop thinking of the horror behind us.&lt;br/&gt;We are all shocked and exhausted but we must keep going. The trees are thinning out and I can see lights ahead&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ve almost made it&amp;hellip; A farm surrounded by bushes but with lights on, there must be other survivors there. No, not bushes &amp;ndash; the house is surrounded by dozens of zombies, trying to break in. I can hear their moans even this far away, they sound so close.&lt;br/&gt;They are among the trees. Shambling over dead wood, we are surrounded&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7ombieTV is a standalone Zombie horror spinoff from acclaimed spy-fi miniatures game 7TV. It is the 1980s, and the dead have risen with terrifying amounts of gore and a fearsome appetite for your flesh! Only with a bold heart and a large amount of unlikely weaponry can you survive the night&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players make their force spending points and following rules on the number of heroes and sheep they can have as there are three levels of characters. The game is won when one side completes the objective, points can be scored for other task completed during the game such as killing of zombies! Elements can be used in the 7TV games if desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
