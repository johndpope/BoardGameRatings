			<description>Rivers and Rods is an LDS-themed variant of Chutes and Ladders. Players navigate through a map of Book of Mormon lands. When they land on the beginning of an iron rod, they can skip several places to go to the end of it and when they land on the beginning of a river they are likewise sent backward. As with many other religiously themed games, the rules specifically state that the first person to reach the end is not the winner; rather, everyone who reaches the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
