			<description>This expansion for The Order of Vampire Hunters includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 Miniatures &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Brith&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Burst Brith&lt;br/&gt;2 Elder ID Cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Rules Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Daniel Stoica&amp;rsquo;s Hunt Journal, added to the Book of Brith in June 2016:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I managed to clear the Den just as night was falling. I had taken a few scratches, but was still ready to fight. All I had to do was empty the cellar and it was over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I lifted the trapdoor and jumped down, I knew something was off. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a root cellar. There were many rough hewn exits and the room was huge, maybe 10 feet high. I felt the earth shake before I heard or saw it. Turning, the great beast was already upon me. My instincts took over and I had my sword deep in its belly before I realized I was fighting the legendary Elder, Brith. I killed him with the first blow, or so I thought. Then it screamed, more like joy than pain and its skin tore open with a sickening wet ripping sound. Three massive tentacles snaked out, fatter than my thighs, and clawed at my wrist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All I remember is that I ran. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I got out. Or what became of Brith. The Den was empty when I went back the next day. Cold and quiet like a grave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
