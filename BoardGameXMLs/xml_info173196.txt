							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Misanthrope Islands (with Adventures)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These islands have always been trouble for merchants and pirates ships. The angry sea plays no favorite here. Deadly creatures inhabit both land and sea. But there are the other rumors, rumors that the sea floor between the Misanthrope Islands is littered with bones and gold. Foolish men believe it is theirs for the taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was an unusual one. I had only intended to make a normal micro-adventure out of it, but as I worked on it became my first micro-sandbox setting. Within this are other micro-adventures that I'll be producing later in the month. I have to thank Tim Knight for the idea seed for this one. He wanted some islands, he got them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Sandbox published on the Tim Shorts's Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this printed edition includes&lt;br/&gt;Micro Sandbox #01: Misanthrope Islands&lt;br/&gt;Micro Adventure #07: Gargoyle Lair &lt;br/&gt;Micro Adventure #08: Temple of Selig&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
