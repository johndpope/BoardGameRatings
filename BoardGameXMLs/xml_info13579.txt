			<description>In this game, players strive for the best quality of life. There are different parameters - &amp;quot;health&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;income&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;possibilities for personal development&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;The game board contains a circuit that players roll and move around. Different fields trigger different events or actions, such as choosing a job, buying a house or a car, environmental problems appearing, etc. Each player has markers on the scales for the three parameters, but the society at large (all players) also live in certain conditions, represented by low resources, a bad environment, etc. Depending on these, the actions of the players are evaluated differently. For instance, a player who buys a car pays money out of his/her income, gains personal possibilities but lowers his/her health. Depending on the environmental situation of all players, more or less points are deducted at the end of a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who has completed a circuit places evaluation markers on his/her current situation. When all players have completed the circuit, the points are compared, and the player(s) with the best score in each of the three aspects gains points. After a premediated number of turns, the player with the highest overall number of points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
