			<description>Similar to the same game as played with serial numbers on paper money in bars.  Each of the 55 cards has 8 single digit numbers. Each player has one card and players make bids based on how many of a given digit they believe exist in total on all the cards in play.  &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; is the lowest digit, &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; is considered a ten, and &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; is an Ace which is higher than a ten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player makes a bid such as &amp;quot;Three fours&amp;quot; and each successive player must make a bid with the same quantity of a higher digit, or a larger quantity of a lower digit, or challenge.  Once all but one player has challenged, all cards are revealed and the digits bid by the last bidding player are counted.  If the bid is made all players pay that player, if lost then that player pays all the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
