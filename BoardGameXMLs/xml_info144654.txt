			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entire subsector at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subsector Sourcebook 1: Cascadia compiles our first 12 Quick Worlds sourcebooks AND adds 8 more unpublished worlds to challenge and entertain your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Made with the busy Referee in mind, this book can provide the spark for multiple adventures.  Use Cascadia as a whole subsector to expand your existing campaign!  Or simply use this book as a handy central source for 20 Quick Worlds to use individually as you see fit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is intended to provide a Traveller Referee with a subsector full of adventure for his or her players. It can be used as an adjunct to an existing Traveller game or be used as the basis of a new campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, as it is presented, is largely setting neutral. That is to say, it is not connected to any existing setting that has been so far produced for Traveller. A Referee can, of course, in the privacy of his/her own home, add this subsector to any number of existing settings or sectors. Alternatively, it can be used simply as it is presented and provide a useful background. Indeed, it is our hope that we can save Referees a certain amount of preparation time by providing a subsector upon which he/she can base his/her storytelling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
