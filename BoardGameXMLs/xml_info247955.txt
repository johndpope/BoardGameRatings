			<description>Neighborhood Nitro Racing is a racing experience for 2-5 players where players build their kart and then race. The game features dice rolling heavily as a mechanic, but also incorporates elements of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase, players select pieces to their kart, as well as lay down pieces of the track everyone will be racing on. In the second phase, the players race, trying to roll successfully while avoiding obstacles and the other racers. Players can also try to get ahead with a risky mechanic known as Turbo, rolling less and less dice to extend the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game prominently features an imaginative, cartoon art style and theme, as players build their karts out of tin foil armor, cardboard space ship wings, denim sails, barbell anchors, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
