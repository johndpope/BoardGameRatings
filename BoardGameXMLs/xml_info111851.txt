			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOTOCROSS MANIACS&amp;trade;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you crazy enough to qualify as a Motocross Maniac?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is pure insanity. And to take the checkered flag, you'll need sheer intensity to throttle past hundreds of obstacles, including the Head Spinning Loop and the Sky Riding Ramp. You'll also need precision skills to refuel with Nitro Turbo Boosts that'll power you to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 championship tracks and 3 Ultra-challenging levels (Rookie, World Class and Daredevil) to choose from. You can even race against the clock or computer. Or attach your Video Link&amp;trade;, and spit some mud in the face of a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get down and dirty in an off-road rad race where speed and courage are the difference between popping wheelies and biting the dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play against the computer. Or attach the Video Link and play against a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;The game's concept is quite simple; the player controls a motorcycle moving one way horizontally, much like in a platform game. When a level has been completed within its time limit, the player starts on the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's control over the motorcycle allows moving the front wheel upwards or downwards, allowing for jumps over obstacles and rotating stunts when in the air. If the player lands incorrectly, the rider will fall off his bike and climb back on it. This results in the main cause of time loss within the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motorbike also has the ability to use a limited amount of &amp;quot;Nitros&amp;quot; which provide a short speed boost. This allows for large jumps and can be necessary for making loops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional sets of nitros can be picked up within a level (marked as a large &amp;quot;N&amp;quot;). Other power-ups in the game include more time (marked as &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;), more speed (marked as &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, continues until the player crashes) and special tires (marked as &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;, also continues until the player crashes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Motocross Maniacs&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
