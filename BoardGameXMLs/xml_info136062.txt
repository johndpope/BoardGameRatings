							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Order of Kaga</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Kaga was formed during the dark days of the First Ones&amp;rsquo; rule. The Kaga (or simply Kaga) was created when mankind&amp;rsquo;s brightest minds united into a unique feat of arcane magic.  They created a massive ritual that included more than a thousand arcane spell casters. The secret of combining their energy together is something the brightest minds have since tried to understand and recreate without success. Many believe that some great divine magic was used. Others believe that Kaga achieved godhood through the ritual. Others believe Kaga is just a front for some shadow organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This magical union gave mankind and its fellow slaves under First One domination an unexpected edge. Like a God-Emperor, Kaga led the rebellion in a series of apocalyptic battles that ended with the crushing of the First Ones&amp;rsquo; bases on Exodus. The Kaga is a large repository of knowledge and at times in the past has provided mankind with information and wisdom to make the world a better and more stable place. The Kaga appears as a man made of arcane energy, looking like a red and silver human. &amp;ldquo;Priests&amp;rdquo; of Kaga do not draw their power from divine source, but from an arcane source that mimics divine powers. This sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Order Of Kaga and History of the Kaga&lt;br/&gt;     The Church of the Kaga and Communing&lt;br/&gt;     New Character Options: Eight new feats including Arcane Utility, Avatar Familiar and Diviner&amp;rsquo;s Mastery&lt;br/&gt;     Two New Prestige Classes: Auger and Harbinger&lt;br/&gt;     Two New Spells: Mind Graft and Rip Mind&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items, New Tomes and New Wondrous Items&lt;br/&gt;     Initiative and Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Combat &amp;amp; Initiative Tracker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
