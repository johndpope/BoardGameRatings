			<description>This game claims to be a 19th century Bohemian game replicating the problem people have with storks constructing their huge nests on top of chimneys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a 3-piece wooden house (house, roof, and chimney), and 60 sticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sticks are divided evenly between the players, who take turns placing them in a stack on the chimney.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player knocks any sticks off of the nest, they must take all of the fallen sticks and add them to their supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to run out of sticks is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with instructions in English, French, and German.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
