							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Town, Dark Woods</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere in the cold American north, far away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities and nestled amongst the woods, sits a small idyllic town. People who pass through the town are often enchanted by its charm, despite it&amp;rsquo;s being isolated from &amp;lsquo;civilization&amp;rsquo; by at least half a day&amp;rsquo;s drive. And the people are charming too. Everyone knows everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s a friendly little town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But under the surface there are secrets. Those they keep from visitors, sure, but frequently those they keep from each other. And it is said that many secrets lurk in the woods beyond the edge of town, where the shadows of trees obscure greater mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town has kept itself for a long time, has ensured that those things they keep to themselves remain hidden. But when something terrible occurs in this sleepy little town and people begin digging around to learn the truth, to what lengths will people go to cover their own tracks, to ensure their own horrible truths remain undiscovered?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
