			<description>Kitties and Trick-Taking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save the kitties! Rescue as many cats as you can by winning tricks, but be careful. If you collect the most cats you may become known as &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; person with one too many cats. Collect as many kitties as possible without having the most. Easy to learn and fun for the whole family (or that crazy cat person in your life).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
