			<description>Nicktoons: Freeze Frame Frenzy (known as SpongeBob SquarePants and Friends: Freeze Frame Frenzy in Europe) is a video game for the Game Boy Advance based on various Nicktoons. The game was released on September 24, 2004 and is considered a clone of Gekibo: Gekisha Boy.&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot revolves around the fact that characters from the many Nickelodeon worlds have been misplaced into each other's worlds, and Jimmy Neutron has taken into his hands the job that these characters are brought back to their own worlds. He sends out Danny Fenton, Arnold, SpongeBob, Tommy, Otto, and Timmy to take photos of the misplaced characters with his new invention, the &amp;quot;Neutrino-Cam 4000&amp;quot;, a camera that also functions as a teleporter, which will send them back to their own worlds.&lt;br/&gt;As the player progresses, it becomes clear that Zim is the mastermind behind the whole mess, and Jimmy soon realizes that after the player has cleared all the levels. Jimmy then flies off in his rocket to Zim's ship and stops the Irken's scheme. After taking a group photo, Zim works on his NEW plan to take over the world, making the ending sequence say, TO BE CONTINUED..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nicktoons: Freeze Frame Frenzy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
