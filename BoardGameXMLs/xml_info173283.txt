			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dark night of a distant future, the shattered remains of Earth drift through the cold void of space. The shadows of the past have been driven away, and the dark clouds at the horizon appear to be man-made. After the Great Netherwar, which resulted in the destruction of Earth, mankind is restless, scattered across the void, bereft of its cradle. The Sol system became the last safe hideout for outcasts both mystic and mundane. Known as Vagrants, they are rebels to the oppressive might of the Consortium&amp;mdash;the government ruling over what&amp;rsquo;s left of Earth and its colonies. True freedom can only be found among the stars, the voices of the galactic underground say. To them, the war isn&amp;rsquo;t over. It has only just begun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to equinox, a future fantasy game of stunning action, frightening intrigue, and mystical powers! In this game, you ride hybrid ships through the astral space connecting planets and galaxies and wield awesome mystic powers and nethertech artifacts! Take on the role of a restless wanderer&amp;mdash;someone living on the fringes of galactic society, scraping by in a war-torn universe, maybe even stealing other people&amp;lsquo;s stuff. Whether a misfit, scoundrel, mercenary, pirate, idealist, explorer, or just someone who walked away from his home in search of adventure: you are part of the galactic underground. Fight the nightmares that invaded the universe, start a revolution against the fascistic and corrupt Consortium government, and explore space beyond the Veil..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Equinox Match System Guide is a roleplaying game of stunning action, frightening intrigue, and mystical powers! Designed for larger-than-life characters with special and extremely powerful abilities, this book provides all the tools needed for adventures in a war-ravaged dark future. The Equinox Setting Guide is required to use this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
