			<description>Glover is a German-style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play a role of a local merchant of Nagasaki in the era of 1868 Meiji Restoration (and overthrow of feudal Tokugawa Shogunate's military government), and start to deal with Thomas Glover.  Various products are necessary to deal with Glover.  You can produce them by yourself (maybe by using different facilities borrowed from Thomas Glover himself), or you can get them by negotiation with other player.  Keep in mind, however, that other players are not always cordial.&lt;br/&gt;You will receive rifles, cannons, or steamships (they are winning points in this game) from him in return for your products -- only if you can show him that you are reliable enough.  He thinks you are trustworthy if you deal with other players cordially.  Or else...!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Thomas Blake Glover came to Japan in 1859 to manage the newly established Nagasaki office of a British trading house. (...)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Glover was born the son of a coast guard officer in 1838 and grew up in the port city of Aberdeen, Scotland. He joined Jardine, Matheson &amp;amp; Co. on finishing school and worked briefly in the company's Shanghai office before taking up his assignment in Japan.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nagasaki, Japan's only international port from 1639 to 1859 under the isolationist policies of the Tokugawa Shogunate, was a thriving entrepot. Glover soon built a bustling business there, largely in exporting tea. A larger business opportunity emerged with rising tensions between the Shogunate and rebellious clans in southern Japan. Glover made a fortune selling ships and arms to the rival factions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-- mitsubishi.com, Stories of Some Prominent Figures &amp;quot;Thomas Glover&amp;quot;.  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.mitsubishi.com/e/history/series/thomas/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.mitsubishi.com/e/history/series/thomas/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extract from the introduction of the English rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
