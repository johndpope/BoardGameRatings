							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blankety Blank: Travel</name>
									
			<description>Blankety Blank is based on the UK BBC TV quiz show of the same name first introduced by Terry Wogan in 1977, itself based on the 1970's version of the US Game Show MATCH GAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves guessing the missing &amp;quot;blank&amp;quot; in a sentence. The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank. Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a &amp;quot;contestant&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;panelist.&amp;quot; The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the &amp;quot;Super Match Game.&amp;quot; In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blankety Blank: Travel allows 3-9 players where the base game allows 3-6, and may be played alone or with the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
