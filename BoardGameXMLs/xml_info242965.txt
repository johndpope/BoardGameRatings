			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some hateful shard of alien origin has streaked through the night sky, crashing into the old Miller&amp;rsquo;s farm on the outskirts of the Hamlet!  Those unfortunate enough to witness the Comet&amp;rsquo;s arrival have been blinded by what they can only describe as a shifting, ephemeral hue of damnably abrasive intensity.  There has been no word from the farm in a fortnight, save for the unearthly groaning that echoes from the ruin of the mill&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A New Quest Type: Get lost in time and space as you confront unending waves of enemies, new and old, pushing ever closer to the crash site of the Comet.  Survive as long as you can stomach, and compare your highest kill count with friends and rivals alike!&lt;br/&gt;     A New Enemy Faction: The husks of the Miller and his farmhands roam the area around the windmill, spreading the all-consuming influence of the Comet&amp;rsquo;s light.&lt;br/&gt;     Powerful New Trinkets: Visit the Nomad Wagon and spend Comet Shards to purchase trinkets with new and powerful functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team at Red Hook is thrilled to continue to support Darkest Dungeon with this latest DLC.  We&amp;rsquo;re committed to providing our new and veteran players alike with the very best in all-consuming misery and morbidity.  The Color of Madness DLC is planned for a spring release, and pricing information will follow in the new year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
