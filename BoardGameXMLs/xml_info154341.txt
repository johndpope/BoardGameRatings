			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Corps is part of the One Night Stand range of games &amp;ndash; fast-playing and entertaining role playing games that you can pick up and play with a minimum of preparation. This &amp;ldquo;play right out of the box&amp;rdquo; approach makes One Night Stand games perfect for those times when you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough players to continue your regular game, or when you just feel like a change of pace. While the rules are simple enough to facilitate one-off games, you will also find enough detail and options to allow you to use this product for longer adventures or even campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play are a few friends, a handful of d6 and a character sheet for each player. It is assumed that at least one player has some experience with role playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
