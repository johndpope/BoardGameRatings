			<description>Arcasam: Beat The Dragon is a strategy role-playing game for 2 - 5 players. In this game, where you can fight monsters as well as your opponents, and get a reward if you win the fight. At the end, when you are strong and equipped enough, you can dare to fight and beat the evil Dragon - which is menacing the world of Arcasam - before your opponents do. You will get better, stronger and more powerful each round, however your victory depends on the strategy you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;There are 7 big hexes in the game - 1 center hex, which is the Dragon's den and 6 other hexes creating the terrain. The shape of the game board varies according to the number of players - it is versatile. This will guarantee that the game board will be always adequate - not too big, not too small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex contains 5 slots - you can place a castle, tavern, iron mine, tailor, tanner, orchard or monsters there. You can place them evenly or randomly. This factor contributes to the variability of the game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the game board, each player has his own player board in front of him. He can mark his place a weapon there, place his companion card as well as mark his current attack, defence and health points. The last component is a main board, where players count the rounds and phases of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play Overview&lt;br/&gt;Each round,player has a fixed number of steps he can make (at the beginning it is 13) and during his turn, he can step on/pass through the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Empty spot: No action&lt;br/&gt;    Iron mine / Tailor / Tanner / Orchard: You will get the supply of iron / cloth / leather / food. Materials (iron, cloth and leather) are needed when you want to buy a weapon and upgrade your skill tree. Without weapon, you cannot fight the monsters and your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;    Monster: Once you step on this slot, you have to fight the particular monster. If  you win, you get a precious piece of gold along with the loot.&lt;br/&gt;    Castle: In the castle, you can buy weapons needed for the fights, or you can improve your skill tree.&lt;br/&gt;    Tavern: Each time you pass through the tavern, you have to draw 1 companion card, where you will find some kind of advantage. In the tavern, you can be also healed after the fight. (1 step = 1 life).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you encounter one of your opponents during your round and you both already have a weapon, you or him can choose to fight one another. The winner gets 8 materials from the backpack of the loser and the loser will have to get healed in the tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you can fight either the monster or one of your opponents. The system of the monster fight is different than the system of the fight with your opponent. Weapons have different costs, however you always need to pay one piece of gold which you can get only if you beat the monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Fight with your opponents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one hero encounters another one, and both of them have a weapon, each of them can choose to start a fight. For 1 food they can always draw 2 action cards (they can be either attack or defense) but the maximum they can have in hand is 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero who chose to fight his opponent starts and plays an attack. The attacked has to have a defense card in order not to loose any lives. Then the other player (attacked) plays an attack and and the attacker has to play a defense. If one of the players does not have a defence card, he has to subtract certain number of lives, depending on the attack of the attacker and defense of the attacked. If one of the players has 0 lives, he lost the fight and has to give 8 materials from his backpack to his opponent. Then he has to get healed to the tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Fight with the monsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight with the monster is much easier then the fight with other hero. Each monster has certain number of lives and strength of his attack, depending on the phase of the game. This is the only part of the game where player uses the dice. Depending on the number the player rolled on the dice and on the current phase of the game (1,2,3), monster attacks with a certain strength. The player has to play defence cards in order not to loose the fight. Then he has to play the attack cards to beat the monster, depending on number of lives the particular monster has, and on the weapon the hero has.  If the hero wins, he will take 1 gold and choose 1 loot, where he can find some kind of advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fight with the Dragon is the same as a fight with other monsters, but he is very strong, so the player has to be very well equiped and experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
