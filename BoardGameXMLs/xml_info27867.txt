							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle for Destainia</name>
									
			<description>You start off by picking one of the Character cards to determine what type of person you will be. Each Character starts off with items that have different strengths and weaknesses. You must use your items to your advantage in knowing who to attack and who not to attack when and where. This is a game of strategy and the player who is experienced will have a definite advantage over a beginner. It was made so that luck is not as important as skill and strategy. You can bribe the different people in the game to attack your opponents and take their items from them. You may battle opponents when you land on the same square as them deciding which items to use in each different situation. You may warp to different areas of the board using the tunnel either to attack an opponent or strategically move into a position which is more beneficial. Receive money when passing the Castle to be able to buy items when you land on the store squares. Pick up Destainia cards and follow the instructions of the card which may be to your advantage or to your peril. The object of the game is to move along the board purchasing different items from stores along the way. Each item you buy has points, and once you have achieved enough points you will be able to challenge and defeat the Sorcerer. Instead of like other games where you have to be the last player alive, this is a race to the finish where everyone is trying to defeat the Sorcerer and claim the Medallion. The action is fast paced and there is never a dull moment. Destainia the game includes 100% cotton canvas material for the board, 6 different color pawns, 2 dice, 60 plastic coins, a drawstring pouch, instructions, 143 playing cards, and a convenient clear plastic tube to put everything in, which is easy to store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.destainia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.destainia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
