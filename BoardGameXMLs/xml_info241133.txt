			<description>CardTharsis is a fast-paced game where you use &amp;quot;little hands&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;drain the swamp&amp;quot; and laugh out loud while, as a group, you and your friends Make yourselves feel Great Again. CardTharsis uses humor to cultivate the inner strength we will need to survive. Laugh. Stay strong. Resist. Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be presented with possible real life scenarios based on three very human categories: Social, Political and Sexual. You must respond by playing cards from your &amp;quot;swamp&amp;quot; in your little hand. The best response collects the cards. The player with the most cards wins. In your &amp;quot;little hand&amp;quot; also known as the &amp;quot;swamp&amp;quot; will be some truly despicable waste: Actual Quotes from the President.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
