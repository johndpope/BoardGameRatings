			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A battle card game themed as a fight between 10-year-olds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a team of 3 kids with traits in attack, defence, imagination and ability to carry. These are deployed onto 3 areas (with a max of 2 rom each side in one area). Each turn, cards are drawn from the item deck and the active player can do one action with each of his characters: pick and equip an item, attack the opponent in the same area, move to another area, use an equipment or imagine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded to defeat the opponent by inflicting 4 damage, or by reaching the imagination limit of that character. First to 6 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items include all sorts of weird things like love letters, rain boots and bus stops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
