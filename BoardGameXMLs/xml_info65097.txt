							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">6 x 6 Klein Monte Carlo</name>
									
			<description>Each Player gets a board with numbers 1 to 6 in 6 different colours. (All six cards that come with the game are different, that is, all 36 combinations of number and colour appear exactly once.) Additionally there's the bank in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, all players put the same amount of money into the bank. The players then alternately roll one number and one colour die to determine one field (combination of number and colour). The player who has that field on his card takes the rolled number of chips from the bank. (If the card is not used, the person who rolled the die has to pay that amount instead.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's mostly a casino game, and a great source for game material for other games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
