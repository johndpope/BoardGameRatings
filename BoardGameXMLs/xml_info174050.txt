			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snatches of conversation, laughter, and the thud of mugs rumbled around the smoky room. Durnick leaned back in his chair and waited for the waitress to finish placing their mugs on the table and heading off to the next customer before leaning forward and continuing the conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You heard about Oliver?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; Kor said as he picked up a mug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;He headed off into the Diremirk. Heard he got himself lost, or killed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halflings, cyborgs, telepathic felines, and alien bartenders, friends for characters come in all shapes and sizes and can play many roles in the campaign, from informant and supporter to captive or comrade. Friends can supply the characters with a needed piece of equipment, a hideout or the objective of an adventure when they become captured or trapped in a dangerous area. Player character friends can become a vital part of a campaign. And that is what the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Friends is all about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Friends is the first in a new series of role playing game supplements. Suitable for any role playing game, the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Friends provides the GM with advice, ideas and examples for including friends for the player characters in a campaign. The Game Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide includes sections on meeting potential friends, encountering friends during the campaign, the roles friends play, the lives of friends and examples for each section. Friends connect a character to the setting and events in a very important way, making hooks, encounters and adventures much more personal for the character. Whatever rpg you play, the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Friends is sure to provide you with some useful ideas and examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
