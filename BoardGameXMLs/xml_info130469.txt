			<description>Scrapbots is a mashup of Mechs, with a dash of Battlebots, and a twist of Junkyard Wars. The idea is that you build your bots from the scrap heap and then send them into the arena, where you earn points for smashing each other and knocking parts off the other robots. If you die, you just grab some more parts and send in another bot &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s all about pleasing the crowds.  The goal is to have the most points at the end of the game which has a set number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is set in a televised sporting events arena, complete with Sponsors who provide reliable equipment upgrades to the contestants and commercial breaks where players get to retool their bots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the bots are made from scrap, lots of things will go wrong.  Players can affect this tactically.  There is also an Economy of Failure that allows players to turn their failures into tactical advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
