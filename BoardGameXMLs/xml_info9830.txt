			<description>Childs dexterity game with a electronic, spinning card dealer and 4 swatters with suction cups on the ends. The stack of 40 cards are loaded into the card dealer, which is placed in the center of the playing area (it is powered by 2 &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; batteries). The cards have different point values, some are negative. After the cards are loaded, the dealer is turned on and it starts spinning in a circle. Cards are shot out of the side if the dealer at random times. Each player is trying to get the cards by shlepping them with the suction cup at the end of their swatter. Any card that sticks to your paddle, you collect (even the negatives!). After the last card is swatted, the dealer is turned off and players add up their positive cards and subtract any negative cards. The highest point total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt; It is a quick game to play and children do seem to love to swat at cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
