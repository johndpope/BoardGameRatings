			<description>From the manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chess Player 2150 is far and away the strongest and most versatile chess program yet, with the most advanced 3D graphics and the widest range of features available. Chess Player 2150 began its career with an impressive 1st place in the 1989 British Open Chess Championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a massive 96,000 byte library of opening moves and an incredible ability to learn through its play by the addition of strong moves to its openings library. It thus becomes a tougher and meaner opponent the more times your challenge it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is incredibly fast, and you can determine the level of play by setting its response time in many different modes to give literally thousands of possible levels. A special range of 'easy' levels is provided for beginners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chess Player 2150 will even predict your next move and then use your move time to consider its response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the first and only computer chess program to have achieved candidate master status with an estimated rating well over 2000 ELO points. It offers the unique facility of assessing both your, and its own, chess rating on the international ELO scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It understands all the laws of chess including under-promotion, draw by repetition and draw by the fifty move rule. It can also achieve all the standard mates, in particular those occuring with minor pieces in the endgame, and is well able to handle difficult pawn promotions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
