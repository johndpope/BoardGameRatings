							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel Masters</name>
									
			<description>Duel Masters is an abstract two-player game in which each player (starting at opposite ends of the map) must reach the opponent's starting position by building a chain of game pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a square grid rotated 45&amp;deg;. The pieces are played on intersections, like Go. Each player puts 3 of her pieces in her starting position, then players take turn playing three pieces at a time. Pieces can be played anywhere as long as they are connected to another of the player's pieces. The opponent's pieces can be taken by playing another piece on top of them, which can sever the opponent's chain. Once a piece is taken, the space it's in can't be taken again, it remains in control of the player who took the piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once an uninterrupted chain is built between the two starting positions, the player who built the chain is declared winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
