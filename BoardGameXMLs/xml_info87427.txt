			<description>Special Game Adventure for the 1986 National Garden Festival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5-8 Characters, Levels 4-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The day has been long and hard and, as night falls, you gratefully surrender to the soft, silent blackness of well-earned sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the dream comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are seated on a throne in a cavern where the sun has never shone: where no voice has ever spoken. Yet you are not alone. Through the darkness, silent figures are moving. Blacker than black... formless yet menacing... advancing towards you from every side...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You feel their touch; icy claws plucking at your skin and hair, lifting the throne and carrying you helpless on a journey from darkness into further darkness, from silence into deeper silence. You scream, and a million anguished, reedy voices answer your call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly you awake...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and the dream is real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is for use with the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Expert and Basic Rules Sets. Both of these are needed to use the information in Up the Garden Path. Experienced Dungeon Masters of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS game should have no difficulty in adapting this adventure to the AD&amp;amp;D game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(c)1986 TSR UK Limited.
