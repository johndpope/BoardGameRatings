							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Allo... la France: Le Grand Jeu du Tėlėphone</name>
									
			<description>The aim of the game is to guess first, the phone number of an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a hometown, a name and a profession, all these data provide a phone number specific to each. A phone card with a maximum of 10 units is given to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents the &amp;quot;l'Hexagone&amp;quot; (France) with mayor cities of France and connections between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player draws a event-card indicating the displacement value, whether or not the wiring between vile and authorization or not to call an opponent (... and a possible additional event). After moving in the direction of his choice, the player may (if authorized) to connect to a city hotline of competitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To join an opponent, you have to pay as many units as channels of communication between the two cities. When communication is established, the player asks his opponent more information (a name, profession etc. and the answer can be yes or no.&lt;br/&gt;These will reveal clues leading to the knowledge of the phone number.&lt;br/&gt;When a player thinks he knows the number, he joined the owner and ask him if he has such a number, if so, the player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
