			<description>Pin*Bot is a pinball video game developed by Rare, Inc. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America in April 1990. It is a conversion of the pinball machine by the same name (developed and manufactured by Williams in 1986). The NES version of the game accurately reproduces most of the gameplay and aesthetics of the pinball machine, while introducing new features and added challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NES conversion of Pin*Bot reproduces the design and artwork of the pinball machine's playfield and backglass display, as well as its music and many of its sound effects. Additionally, the game plays the synthesized speech of Pin*Bot, though gameplay is interrupted while its phrases are being played back. The speech, music and sound effects can each be toggled on and off through a pause menu, accessible via the second controller. (The first controller cannot pause the game since the Start and Select buttons are used to &amp;quot;nudge&amp;quot; the machine.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pin*Bot (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
