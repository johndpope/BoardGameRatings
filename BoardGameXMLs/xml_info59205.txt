			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Wars past. Wars present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 3050's, the discoveries of long-buried Star League records led to a plethora of new cutting-edge BattleMech and vehicle designs by the end of that decade, resurrected from the blue prints of design firms centuries old and thought lost to antiquity. Now, ten years later, these designs have moved from novelty to workhorse, as the Inner Sphere once more finds itself at war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully updated to circa 3070, Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade - launches these designs into the current time frame, including notable MechWarriors/crews, as well as new variants. Additionally, a battle armor section has been included, providing full Classic BattleTech stats, and updating the histories for these twenty venerable designs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This upgrade volume is one of a series of Upgrade titles produced to provide new material for gamers and collectors, rather than replacing the original Technical Readout upon which they're based. The Technical Readout 3058 Upgrade is a companion volume to the Technical Readout: 3058, rather than a replacement. Although the two may seem similar the 3058 Upgrade expands the detail up to 3070, adds personality entries, many new Mechs, new sections on Battle Armour and generally provides new material. Both volumes share a cover, although this volume has the word &amp;quot;Upgrade&amp;quot; marked in the lower-right hand corner of the front cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
