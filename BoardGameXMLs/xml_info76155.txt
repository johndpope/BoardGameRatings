							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inn of the Welcome Wench</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inn of the Welcome Wench serves as a base for your heroes, a gathering place to seek out new blood for the party, a destination to meet with informants and quest givers and the site of many an ale-driven drunken brawl. The map shows the first floor of the inn with a large common room, a bustling kitchen and two private rooms for clandestine gatherings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These high-quality vinyl surfaces are ideal for staging encounters during your adventures! Each mat lies flat for ease of play and is sold in sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. Both Game Mats measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and are marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
