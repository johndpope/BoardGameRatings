			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some view you as a monster, fearing that which they do not understand. Others see you as a tool, something to be used by man. You were, after all, made, not born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are still alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone in Dungeon World seeks something, like gold, glory, or both. You&amp;rsquo;re no different, but you seek something different: acceptance, friendship, and love. All things worth fighting for, and make no mistake you will have to fight for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, you&amp;rsquo;ll endure blade and claw in order to keep your friends safe, but you&amp;rsquo;re made of pretty stern stuff (and lack things like blood and internal organs). No, the real fight will be proving to everyone that you aren&amp;rsquo;t just some mindless monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, your emotions have a tendency to get out of control, so play nice and try to keep a cool head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a golem you're strong, tough, and work better with those you have a bond with. When you level up you can become stronger (and more destructive), tougher, gain additional benefits when you do as you're told, become more observant about the world around you, better protect your friends, and even kind of &amp;quot;possess&amp;quot; inanimate objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two separate pdf files. The first is a digest-sized, 22 page pdf that includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The golem playbook, with 20 advanced moves.&lt;br/&gt;    Three additional advanced moves if you want to evoke the abilities of the golem of Prague.&lt;br/&gt;    New armor and dungeon gear, and a new transport option.&lt;br/&gt;    Three magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut that provides an explanation for some of the moves, and even some questions to ask yourself when rolling up a golem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
