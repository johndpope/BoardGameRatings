			<description>This is a chess-related abstract strategy game with an insect theme, played on a hex board of 61 cells. Pieces are the Queen, Highborn, Drone, Nurse, Worker, and Soldier. Each type of piece has a unique ability and movement. Soldiers are the only pieces that can capture, but they may only move over friendly pieces to do so. Nurses can &amp;quot;birth&amp;quot; new pieces, if there are enough workers available to support those pieces. The queen is the royal piece, and there can only be one per hive, but a highborn can promote to a queen, with the help of a drone, preventing defeat. Drones are also the only pieces with totally free movement, being able to fly to any open cell, but are limited to 2 per game. The game is won when your opponent does not have a queen on the board at the end of the opponent's movement/promotion phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
