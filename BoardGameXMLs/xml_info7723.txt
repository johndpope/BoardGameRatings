							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yeoman</name>
									
			<description>One of five games in a series by SPI called PRESTAGS (the others were Chariot, Spartan, Legion, and Viking), YEOMAN is a representation of the major battles roughly around the period of the Hundred Years' War and the Renaissance (1250-1550.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key element of the armies and tactics is, of course, the English yeoman, which came into prominence around this period. The concepts are fairly standard for wargames as far as unit strength, movement, range, and so forth. The battles can be played in an historical series or separately. Different options exist for various units (for example, cavalry can be dismounted to create men-at-arms.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the PRESTAGS series shares a set of the same common rules. Each game also has a set of exclusive rules that highlight features of warfare during the period that game covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
