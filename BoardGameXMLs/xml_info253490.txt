							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Root Guy Farm</name>
									
			<description>Shim and D'rothy's first board game for kids and people of all ages, Root Guy Farm is an old-fashioned roll-the-dice board game that encourages interaction and storytelling. Some of the spaces are just silly, while others prompt your kids to talk about their favorite food, items they would bring on a trip, or to tell a joke. The winner is prompted to make up a story about the mysterious &amp;quot;Root Guy Farm.&amp;quot; This game will bring the family together with laughs, creativity, and imagination.&lt;br/&gt; The game board is printed in full-color at actual size of the original colored pencil artwork, 24&amp;quot; by 18&amp;quot;. The paper game board is fully laminated, so it can't be easily ruined by spills. The game is shipped with a 6-sided die and 5 colorful game pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
