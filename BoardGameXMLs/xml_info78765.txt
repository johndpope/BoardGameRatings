			<description>Kick Master is an action/platform video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System that was released in 1991 by Taito. The game has some role-playing game elements, such as leveling up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kingdom of Lowrel is attacked and burned by monsters sent by the evil sorceress Belzed. In the attack, the King and the Queen are slain and their only child, Princess Silphee, is kidnapped. The king's guards were all killed, except for the powerful knight, Macren. He and his younger brother, Thonolan, an aspiring martial artist, take off on a long journey to free the princess. As the fight against Belzed's minions commences, Macren is mortally wounded. With his dying breath, he pleads his brother to use his great kicking powers to avenge him and Thonolan swears to make Belzed pay for her crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Kick Master , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
