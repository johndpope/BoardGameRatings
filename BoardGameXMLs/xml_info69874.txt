			<description>&amp;quot;Clock Tower 3 (クロックタワー３, Kurokku Tawā 3) is a survival horror game developed by Sunsoft and published by Capcom. The game was released in Japan on December 12, 2002, in North America on March 18, 2003 and in Europe on October 10, 2003. It's the fourth installment in the Clock Tower series. The previous three games in the series, Clock Tower: The First Fear, Clock Tower and Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within were developed by Human Entertainment and published by ASCII Entertainment and Agetec Incorporated. Clock Tower 3 is the first game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, as opposed to the point-and-click mechanics in the previous games. Clock Tower 3 is also the first game in the series not to feature multiple endings. This was the first and only game to be directed by renowned movie director Kinji Fukasaku.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Clock_Tower_3,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
