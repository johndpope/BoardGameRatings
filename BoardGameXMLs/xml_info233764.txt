							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In the Shadow of Wraiths</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no warning. No scent on the wind. No sound of its presence. No temperature change. No disturbance to radar or satellite. It just returns as naturally as the May early morning dew. An energy force, long dormant, replenishes itself, overflows from its natural, ancient paths and, once again, integrates itself with our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 1st, 8.00am, great geysers of ethereal mist, swirling light and energy are spewed forth hundreds of feet high. In seconds, the mist segments into strands and wisps and, desperate for life energy, hundreds upon thousands of deadly spirits form into a blizzard of ghostly shapes and descend upon humanity and everything that lives. Coiling, wrapping and choking themselves around their victims, these violent smoke-like creatures kill millions within the first few minutes of their arrival...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for use with the ParaSpace Role Playing System, In the Shadow of Wraiths is a post-apocalyptic, fantasy, that introduces the Awakened Earth setting as it follows the journey of the player characters struggling to survive against overwhelming odds and carve out a new life for themselves in a world where humanity is no longer top of the food chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
