			<description>18NAC is an 18xx game that includes railroads across the North American Continent. 18NAC is played on a 55&amp;quot; by 34&amp;quot; map depicting northern Mexico, southern Canada, and the continental United States. The game includes 29 U.S. railroads, 14 in the East and 15 in the West, as well as 5 Mexican companies and the Canadian Pacific. The game includes several mechanics that are unique to the 18xx genre, including a system of subsidiaries (rather than privates) that allow players to customize their railroads, an anonymous auction, and land grant companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
