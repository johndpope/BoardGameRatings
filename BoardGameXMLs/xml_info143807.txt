			<description>Praised for its in-game art and cinema-quality storyline, the DEUS EX series has garnered critical acclaim from the media and consumers alike. DEUS EX: THE FALL is a story driven action-RPG and the first mobile DEUS EX in the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEUS EX: THE FALL is set in 2027&amp;ndash; a golden era for science, technology and human augmentation, but also a time of great social divide and global conspiracy. Powerful corporations have seized control from governments and command the drug supply needed by augmented humans to survive. In this chaos Ben Saxon, a former British SAS Mercenary who underwent physical augmentation, is desperate for the truth behind the drug conspiracy. Betrayed by his private military employers, the Tyrants, not only is his own life at risk, but for all augmented humans, time is running out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
