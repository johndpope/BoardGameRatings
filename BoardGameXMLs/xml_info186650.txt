			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Meat-That-Screams will sate Your Appetite for Lycanthropes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;... and lead us not into temptation...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lycanthrope is a being of raw power -- and for some, &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; is the key word. Warm blood dripping from its jaws, a were seems to grow in size, strength and menace. And always there's the ultimate temptation -- release his grasp on sanity and give in completely to his animal nature to gain even more power and be free from the pitiful restraints of &amp;quot;civilized behavior.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Meat-That-Screams is a 12-page supplement to the Bite Me! line of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game lycanthrope products available from Misfit Studios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bite Me! Meat-That-Screams Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Sustenance Pool rules, giving lycanthropes a new source or strength to draw on&lt;br/&gt;    Meat-That-Screams rules, improving on the Sustenance Pool powers, but at a great price to the lycanthrope&lt;br/&gt;    Over a dozen new feats tailored to the Sustenance and Meat-That-Screams rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
