			<description>(From the box bottom)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4WORD - A Family Rummy Word Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player rids his selected tiles by creating simple to complex words and rummy plays using his 4WORD game tiles or if possible creates new combinations from previously played tiles with one or more of his 4WORD game tiles. The game ends when a player reaches 400 points and the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 2 to 4 players (Ages 7 and up) and includes rules, four plastic two tier tile racks, tile pouch, and 108 engraved playing tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of games that lead you in circles or pit you against some unseen brainy computer, then this new game 4WORD is for you. Once again man can now challenge man (or child) in a game designed to give everyone and anyone a chance to come out a winner. More than any card game or ordinary word game 4WORD combines skill, knowledge, reasoning, logic, and luck to provide a refreshing excitement lacking in today's trivia type games. 4WORD is a fast paced family game, its basic design provides equal footing for any member of the family, young or old to compete with any other member of the family. So parents be alert your son or daughter could easily put you in your place. It's skill, fun, some knowledge and luck all boxed up to provide hours, days, and if you don't set a time limit, years of friendly game playing. So get your family or friends together, pass out the cold drinks, open this box, and let the tiles fall where they may, and enjoy the truly creative new game 4WORD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
