			<description>Promotional game published by Shell, the petrol and oil supplier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, this is a roll and move game but the winner is not the first player to reach home. In fact, the game does not end until all players have reached home. Then the winner is the player with the most petrol (gas) still in their car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are drawn when you arrive on certain squares and these often give you more petrol ar make you use up petrol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
