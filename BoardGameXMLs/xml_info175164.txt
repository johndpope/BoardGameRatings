			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 22nd century eminent scientists and leaders of mankind realized that the earth had past the point of no return and the downward spiral of Earths conditions was going to leave it impossible to sustain the civilization of mankind beyond the century.  A plan was conceived to send fleets of Terra forming ships with vast crews in cryo.  The ships were to spend hundreds, if not thousands of years, searching the stars for a new system that could support mankind once more.  One of those fleets arrived upon &amp;lsquo;Mu Area&amp;rsquo; a system that surpassed expectations, providing a number of larger planets that could support life, colonization began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now many years on the colonies established have splintered, separated and developed their own societies.  They each now take a stride to control the system and guide mankind to the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play of the game takes place on a circular board with 3 rings that rotate around the star in the center at the end of each game round.  You are able to research an extensive list of technologies, some unique to each player, build ships, colonize and conquer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start of the game sees an interesting aspect where the players actually create their own race with various advantages over each other.   This gives you the option to try and forge your own style or hinder others.  &lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved by proving your might to the other emerging empires and obtaining the most victory points at the end of 4 rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is fast, lots of research, building and of course combat.  The game takes approx. 3 hours to play with very little waiting or downtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
