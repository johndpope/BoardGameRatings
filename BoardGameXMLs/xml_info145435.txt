			<description>A la B&amp;auml;ionette provides twenty-one historical scenarios for Napoleonic gamers based covering the entire period of the wars of Napoleon, from 1796 to 1815.  Each scenario comes with historical background, briefings for both sides along with victory conditions, a map of the tabletop and a full order or battle based on extensive historical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis is on providing playable enjoyable games that suit your situation, so the scenarios are broken down in to three types.  The majority are suitable for an evening at the club where you want to complete play in two or three hours.  The second group is scenarios for four or five hours and the last, smaller group, is for scenarios that could be played over an entire day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
