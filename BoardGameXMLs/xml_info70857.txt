			<description>In Ontwikkelaars &amp;amp; Ontwerpers (Developers &amp;amp; Designers) you (and the competing players) are developers of computer games. You only have one goal; design the best game ever!&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this you have to acquire different resources, like art designers, game engines etc. Of course you have to stay ahead of the other developers. You have to use your insight, cunning and financial funds to reach the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O&amp;amp;O is a fast-paced deck-building game for 2-4 players suitable for ages 12 and up that can be played anywhere (where there is a flat surface).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
