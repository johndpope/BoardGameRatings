			<description>Defeat your opponents with martial arts strikes in this party game designed and illustrated by Demis Savini.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kung Fu Party is a game for 2-10 players, simple to learn, fast to play, able to engage anyone, even those who normally do not love the tabletop games. Players will be furry fighters, mimicking all the fighting movies, cartoons and videogames collection. Divided in two schools, the White Tiger and the Black Dragon, face your enemies with amazing martial arts strikes. The purpose of the game? Defeat all opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to fight, the players use their red Attack cards and their blue Defense cards. Each of these cards is characterized by a &amp;ldquo;battle scream&amp;rdquo;: the longer it is, the greater the strength. It will be up to you to guess where the opponent tries to hit you and defend accordingly with correct blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Challenge mode you can play even in solitary, facing one Boss after another until you reach the top of the tower for the final challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
