							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pedal Power</name>
									
			<description>Pedal Power is a unique game based on bicycle touring. The goal of Pedal Power is to be the bicyclist who has the most fun. The player with the most Joy Points at the end of the game had the most fun and is the winner of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players plan their trips and attend bicycle events (Weekend and Week Long Tours as well as Expeditions) for experiences and fun. Experiences earn the players Joy Points. The players will enjoy Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast, Camping, Mountain Biking, Tandem and Winery experiences throughout the game. Experiences can be had many times as joy and fun are not confined to one trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will also experience days where skies are blue, roads are smooth and enjoy tail winds. Other days players will be chased by dogs, have headwinds, rough roads, flat tires and thunderstorms. During the game players will be able to take all these Joy and Misery experiences and 'Tell A Story' and earn Joy points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
