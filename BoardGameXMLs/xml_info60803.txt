							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dish It Out: The Satellite TV Game</name>
									
			<description>A cheaply made roll and move around the track game.  Very unusual topic for a board game considering TV may very well be the number 1 enemy of the board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to race to the finish and the first player to reach the &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; arrow wins the game and can &amp;ldquo;dish it out&amp;rdquo; to his or her old TV antenna or cable service! With more than two players continue playing to establish second place, third place, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
