							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Traffic Jam Game</name>
									
			<description>Traffic Jam - A zany gridlock game of limited strategy and outrageous bumping and blocking fun.&lt;br/&gt;If you can avoid the patrolling policement and dodge your fellow drivers you have a chance of winning the game. It sounds easy... but players become ruthless as the intersection grows more more congested. One minuted you may be on the verge of winning and the next ... your card is bumped back to the start.&lt;br/&gt;(Back of box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
