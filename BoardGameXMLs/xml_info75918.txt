							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Action 2: Exploits</name>
									
			<description>You have your guns and your backup guns. You have your sick ride with a trunk full of explosives, high-tech gizmos, and of course a few more guns. You've assembled a crack team of commandos, street-smart lawmen, suave super-spies, and world-class burglars . . . maybe all of them at once! You're ready to rock and roll. All you need is a target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Action 2: Exploits gives players hundreds of ways to show off their heroes' skills on adventures. Highlights include cat burglary, parkour, and dozens of other physical feats . . . techno-thrills ranging from stay-at-home hacking to hands-on surveillance . . . polite and not-so-polite social engineering . . . and much, much more. You're just reading the teaser, after all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the GM, Exploits supplies the tools to challenge and threaten a whole team of heroes. Advice on forging classic action-movie scenes into adventures that spotlight all the heroes is woven through everything, along with input on having cunning henchmen pull stunts of their own -- up to and including using WMD! There's also GM-only material on handling Assistance Rolls and Duty, and on making everybody useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And of course everybody will appreciate the quick-and-dirty chase system and rules for speeding up combat, complete with new cinematic options!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
