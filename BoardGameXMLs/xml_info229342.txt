			<description>Welcome to Christmas 2012!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mortin Fink came from a family of toy makers who made most of their money around Christmas time. As a child, Mortin was very quick to pick up the mechanical aspect of making quality toys. By the time he turned fifteen, Mortin was building highly complex robots for Fairy Toys. As the company grew, so did Mortin's demands, which didn't settle well with the company. They stole his designs and fired him. For the next twenty years, Mortin worked as a technical advisor for different companies, all while getting his PhD in robotics from MIT. And as the world changed and super humans emerged as the next best thing, Mortin took his talents to a whole new level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
