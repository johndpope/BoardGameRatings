			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate of Fools (Pawns of Destiny) is a combined adventure/supplement for use with Elric!, Chaosium's revamped version of their popular Stormbringer game based on the worlds created by author Michael Moorcock. Stuffed into the 62 pages are two adventures and snippets of information concerning fascinating locations that provide settings for many of Elric's epic adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All humans are enmeshed by powers, circumstances, and wills greater than they. A few bear this burden humbly. Because they do not struggle against fate, they find it to be of no consequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some feel the burden too keenly, and take refuge behind cynicism, envy, and indifference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others try to calculate what profit can be gained at every turn, or choose a narrow, zealous commitment to an idea or religion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So we twist and struggle until we die. When we reflect we revere as almost mystical those who stay true to their feelings and are lucky enough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate of Fools contains two adventures for use with Elric! and Stormbringer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;The Book of Brilliant Things&amp;quot; by Lawrence Whitaker, a bard's stories are coming to life, and the players must seek out the mysterious Book of Brilliant Things at the University of Cadsandria, but there is opposition as well in the form of another contender for the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;The Four Seasons&amp;quot; by Stefan Bjorling, a beautiful woman has been turned into a humanoid lizard, and the players must quest across the northern continent to uncover a series of objects necessary for them to undo this curse, but there is opposition as well in the form of another suitor for the lizard's hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
