							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Infamous Mischievous Renaldo Maliauctor</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sages must be crazy (or at least a little unhinged)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tucked down an alleyway, just out of the sight of the bustling marketplace, you find a shop marked with a cheery sign reading The Prankster&amp;rsquo;s Lair. Inside, the cluttered shop seems jammed full of all variety of strange and unusual devices. As you make your way to the back, pouches of sneezing powder, dribble glasses and a myriad of other, even stranger things, catch your eye. When you finally reach the shop&amp;rsquo;s back counter, you see a rather portly gnome dressed in the robes of a wizard, busily scribbling on a sheet of paper. As you approach the counter, the man looks up and, with a broad smile, greets you, &amp;ldquo;Welcome, my good man. I am sure we have just what you need to put a smile on your face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sages Must Be Crazy: The Infamous Mischievous Renaldo Maliauctor explores the lighter, more mischievous side of magic with a collection of spells and items inspired by classic slapstick or pranks. All of these items and spells are conveniently available at The Prankster&amp;rsquo;s Lair, an easy to drop-in-your-setting novelty store complete with a quirky and unique owner. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a bit of fun for your next game, or just want to flesh out that trickster character, this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
