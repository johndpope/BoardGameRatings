			<description>On this (quite literally) cat and mouse game, two rounds are played, with each player taking the role of the cat or the mouse in each of them. The one controlling the mouse must move it with a magnetic stick around the course, go to one end where there's a cheese and go back to his shelter, while avoiding the tomatos thrown by the player controlling the cat, who tries to knock down the mouse as much times as he can before it escapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After both players have played controlling the cat, the one who knocked off the mouse more times wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
