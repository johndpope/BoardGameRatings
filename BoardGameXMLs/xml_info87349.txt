			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond is the downloadable sequel to Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard. The game places players in control of Matt Hazard again, and this time he needs to prevent the evil conglomerate Marathon Megacorp from destroying him by going back in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood Bath and Beyond steps away from its predecessor, and is modeled as a more retro-style 2D side-scroller instead of a 3D third person shooter. The game draws many components from classic run-and-gun titles, such as the ability to use upgraded weapons after collecting pickups and a difficulty setting where enemies kill Matt with a single hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main villain, General Neutronov, has revived Hazard&amp;rsquo;s greatest enemies, and the hero&amp;rsquo;s subsequent romp through time brings him to a number of wild environments, including a Japanese castle, pirate hideout, and Siberian ice mine. Players can tackle the game solo or team up with a friend in coop mode. The second player controls Matt&amp;rsquo;s partner Dexter Dare. Three difficulty settings allow players to tailor the title to their gaming preferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
