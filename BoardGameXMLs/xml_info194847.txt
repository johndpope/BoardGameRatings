							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sign in Stranger (Game Chef Entry)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This early version of the game (later commercially published) was submitted as several forum posts for the Game Chef competition.  In content, it is quite similar to the later &amp;quot;playtest version&amp;quot; that was released as a PDF with much superior formatting.  The commercial version is a much improved system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the initial posts of the game used the title Song of the Blood Moon but this was changed to Sign in Stranger when the primary rules were posted.  The game itself was published in a series of posts over a few days period during the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
