			<description>Rules introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced DUNGEON SQUAD or ADS is based on and expanded from the 24 hour game DUNGEON SQUAD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DUNGEON SQUAD is a great, simple system created by Jason Morningstar and designed to introduce younger players to Role Playing Games. Alternate DUNGEON SQUAD took that and modified it to suit my tastes as more experienced, older and time poor gamer. ADS amounts to a fine-tuning of that concept through game play and some new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with it&amp;rsquo;s predecessors, ADS assumes a measure of RPG experience on behalf the players and referee, can be used in just about any fantasy setting and suits both story driven play as well as hack and slash gaming. Required items for play include someone to act as a referee, some players, a quiet room, a table, pencils, paper and a dice set from d4 up to d12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
