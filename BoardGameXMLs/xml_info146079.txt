							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great War at Sea: Destroyers</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smallest warships capable of operations on the high seas (and thus considered part of the battle fleet), destroyers proved to be extremely valuable to World War One navies. Destroyers performed every conceivable mission, from convoy escort to shore bombardment to surface battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroyers appear in every Great War at Sea game, but the size of their playing pieces in no way reflect their importance either in game terms or in naval history. That gets fixed with Destroyers: 420 &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; pieces replacing the 1/2-inch square pieces in Jutland, Cruiser Warfare, Mediterranean, Cone of Fire, Black Waters, Sea of Troubles, U.S. Navy Plan Red, U.S. Navy Plan Gold, Pacific Crossroads, Dreadnoughts and Reichsmarine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroyers includes three full sheets of pieces, both front and back. British, Imperial Germans, Weimar German, Brazilian, Chilean, Swedish, Austro-Hungarian, Romanian, Japanese, French, American, Danish and Estonian boats are included, and more besides. This is the ultimate add-on for any Great War at Sea fan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroyers is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut-and-mounted, nor are the scenario book or the ship data printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
