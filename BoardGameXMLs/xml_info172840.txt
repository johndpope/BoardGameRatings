			<description>BCE 58: Julius Caesar is broke. His time as proconsul has cost him most of his personal fortune, and much of his clout within the Republic. Luckily, he is still in command of Rome&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious army. He has heard rumors of the riches coming back with the traders from Gaul. When reports of unrest among the Helvetii and a threat of invasion from the Germanic Suebi, the opportunity could be ripe for him to &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; the Gauls&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on the role of a Gallic chieftain as you rally your tribe in an ultimately futile attempt to turn back the tides of history. You will navigate your chieftain pawn around the map while generating and spending site-located resources (food, wood, wine, and gold) to amass an army and build the roads for them to travel. As you choose where to deploy your your defenses, Caesar and his generals begin a slow buy inexorable march from Rome, taking city by city until nothing is left. Do you race to the front? Or do you hunker down and wait for the final battle? Or do you use one of the small selection of political action cards to collaborate with the invading forces and hope for the best?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure Caesar tells the world about you and your tribe as he executes his campaign of glory, and guarantee your place in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
