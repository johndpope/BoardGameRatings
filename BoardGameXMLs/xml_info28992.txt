							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Under the Big Top</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 1952 and Bo Bennett's Big Top Bonanza has reached Sarasota, Florida for their final show. With a successful nine month tour behind them, the performers and staff of the Bonanza are making plans for a restful and rewarding off-season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the curtain falls on the final Big Top performance, a select few gather in JoJo Bones' Exotic Emporium of Enigmatica (part of the Bonanza). To celebrate the successful tour, JoJo will host a night of revelry, food, drink and, this year, what JoJo has promised to be &amp;quot;startling revelations.&amp;quot; Tragically, however, JoJo was killed last night. His body was found early this morning in the lions' cage, mauled by lions Gladys and Mountjoy. Since JoJo's body reeked of alcohol, preliminary reports are that he wandered into the cage in a drunken stupor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, the show must go on and the post-season party will continue - and so the selected performers and staff of Bo Bennett's Big Top Bonanza assemble to remember JoJo and celebrate the successful season. This may be their last chance to seal their fates for the future...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the Big Top lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal -- a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
