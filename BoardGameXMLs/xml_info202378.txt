							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Connection</name>
									
			<description>Space Connection is a two-player deduction game. Each player has a two-part board, with one part being used to set up their &amp;quot;planets&amp;quot; and the other for the opponent's attempts to find them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has twenty plastic planet pegs which need to be placed in exactly nine groups of contiguous pegs (abstractly representing the Solar System's planets). Each player also has pegs representing lasers and reconnaissance ships of different strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ships can be placed to investigate one space, one space plus the six adjacent spaces, or all spaces in one of the triangles the board is divided into. A ship is only returned if its space actually contains a planet peg, otherwise it remains on the opponent's board and cannot be used again. The lasers are only useful when at least two have been placed in a line, as they reveal planets in all spaces between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to find all twenty opposing pegs is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
