							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Done Deal: One Tough Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This card game was distributed as a promotional item by Dodge at auto shows, including the Texas State Fair. A variation on the classic &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot;, players attempt to match three cards, each with a tool and the same number (1-14), to complete a challenge that highlights the abilities of the Dodge Ram pick-up. Also included are two &amp;quot;DONE DEAL&amp;quot; cards that allow the holder to steal one completed challenge from another player. At the end of the game, the player with the most completed challenges is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
