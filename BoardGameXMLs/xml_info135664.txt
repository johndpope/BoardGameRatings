							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snoggle</name>
									
			<description>From back of package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Snoggle, winding your way through a maze of ghosts who will eat you if they catch you. You have to be quick, you need to be bold, but if you are not cool and intelligent you&amp;rsquo;re dead. When you are cornered you may try to reach one of your four energizers, which give you power over the ghosts for five seconds, during which you must make your escape. But don&amp;rsquo;t squander them, for there is no place to hide from a ghost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination action-strategy game written in machine language, with hi-res graphics. Eight levels of play. Keyboard controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning!! The upper levels of this game (levels 2-8) are extremely difficult to reach without extraordinary reflexes and cunning. If you are frustrated by programs not easily mastered, don&amp;rsquo;t buy this program!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
