			<description>&amp;quot;Praise the Loot???&amp;quot; is a product of the mid-1980s, when at least one prominent televangelist was found using his fun raising abilities for somewhat less than evangelical goals. In this game, 2-6 players race to the Pearly Gates. However, instead of amassing virtues - or even converts - the victor must acquire sufficient money and possessions in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes 6 playing pieces, one die, 6 different denominations of money ($5,000 to $500,000), 3 types of cards (possession, contribution and expense), instructions and fold out board (14&amp;quot; X 19.5&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
