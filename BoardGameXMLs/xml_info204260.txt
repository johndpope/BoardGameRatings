							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silver Rebels: Kennels of the Red Fang</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Dog Eat Dog World!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure paths offer fantastic stories and sweeping campaign arcs that take characters on a ride from very low levels all the way up to the highest reaches of the game, and they can be incredibly fun and rewarding to play. But even though there&amp;rsquo;s a lot packed into an adventure path, sometimes you find yourself wishing for more, whether there&amp;rsquo;s a part of the adventure path that feels like it got a bit rushed or cut due to space issues, or just a fun little side trek to take a breather before jumping back into the action of the main story. Side Paths provides just this sort of content, with short adventures designed to fit into portions of existing official Paizo adventure paths, but which can easily stand on their own, or be inserted into other, similar campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this adventure for a party of 2nd- or 3rd-level characters, designed to occur during or after the first volume (#97) of the rebellious adventure path from Paizo, Inc, the party is approached by a man with a seemingly simple request: his dog has been kidnapped by the owner of the Red Fang, a dog-fighting ring with a nasty reputation. With dog-fighting quite legal in the area, and the authorities unable (or unwilling) to find any evidence of the missing dog, hiring rebellious heroes willing to work outside the law to do good deeds is this man&amp;rsquo;s last hope. But as the PCs delve into the kennels of the Red Fang, it quickly becomes apparent that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more going on here than a missing dog. Can they defeat the strange and twisted monsters caged in those kennels?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
