							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hocus &amp; Pocus</name>
									
			<description>A gingerbread house, a girl dressed in red, seven children lost in the woods ... And if these known tales hid secrets that you had to flush out? Play the role of Hocus or Pocus, choose your magic animal and leave without delay to explore these worlds. The success of your mission will depend on your choices because the hero is you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hocus &amp;amp; Pocusis a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
