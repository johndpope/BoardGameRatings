							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hot Dog Race</name>
									
			<description>This Depression-era game involves manipulating a string to move cardboard dogs. There is a sheet of very thick cardboard that is folded into a three-dimensional row of four kennels with a starting ledge in front of them. A thick cardboard dog is attached to each kennel by a string.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players stand in a line equally distant from the kennels and with strings of equal length. They line up the dogs by leaning them on the edge of the starting ledge, and then wiggle or shake their strings so that their dogs move toward them across the playing table. First dog across the finish line wins. Any player touching a dog is disqualified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
