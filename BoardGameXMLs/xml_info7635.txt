			<description>Torch is an The Europa Series covering the Allied invasion of Northwest Africa in November 1942 and the subsequent land campaign for control of Africa through May 1943. It is a two-player game, with one player controlling the American and British forces and the other the German and Italian forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps display the harsh terrain of French North Africa, from the wooded coastal region to the mountainous inland region into the sand dune and wadi infested wastelands of the Sahara Desert. The maps cover North Africa from the Safi-Casablanca region to Tripoli in Libya; they include the Allied and Axis base areas in Gibraltar, Southern Sardinia, and Western Sicily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The counters represent the diverse forces engaged in North Africa: American, British, Free French, German, Indian, Italian, New Zealander, and Vichy French. Ground forces range in strength from armored divisions down to commando battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 50 aircraft; with both sides committing the best available aircraft, German Fw 190A's and Me 109G's fight for air superiority against British Spitfire IX's and American P-38G's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are the Europa rules for desert warfare; they are the same as the rules to Western Desert, with additions for the special features of Operation Torch. The rules cover the important elements of operations in Africa: armor effects, antitank abilities, supply considerations, air power, and shipping troops and supplies. Special operations in the campaign are covered in detail: parachute drops, amphibious landings, and commando actions. Political rules cover the volatile situation in French North Africa: the Vichy French army's response in North Africa can range from full co-operation with the Allies to determined resistance to the invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torch is playable by itself or in combination with the other Europa game on North Africa: Western Desert. In fact, the rules set, titled War in the Desert, provides the rules, charts, and orders of battle for the entire North African and Near Eastern theater of World War II. The rules link three Europa games - Western Desert, The Near East, and Torch - to show the struggle for this theatre from December 1940 through May 1943. A seperate rules set includes the instructions and orders of battle for playing Torch by itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    480 Die Cut Counters&lt;br/&gt;    Two 20&amp;quot; x 26&amp;quot; Maps&lt;br/&gt;    One War in the Desert Rules and Chart Set&lt;br/&gt;    One Operation Torch Rules and Chart Set &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
