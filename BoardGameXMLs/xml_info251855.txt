			<description>Tinderbox Tales expands on the setting for the successful 2017 Kickstarter The Brigade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three game set is presented like a box set of books and &lt;br/&gt;continues the comedic narrative style that made The Brigade so popular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Barmaid's Tale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the &amp;quot;Rat Catcher's Rest&amp;quot; this is a social game for 4-6 players. Players assign blame to each other for the failure of a recent quest while literally &amp;quot;Passing the Buck&amp;quot;. Fun and fast with plenty of banter, The Barmaid's Tale could be the perfect pub game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trader's Tale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play out the events of one of the most famous days in the history of the Merchant's district. Ruby Tuesday saw every adventurer in Tinderbox racing to equip themselves for the quest to recover the ruby hoard of the Salamander King, making a lot of Traders very rich in the process. &lt;br/&gt;A resource management game for 2-4 adventurers who will need to trade carefully to be the first to build and outfit their team for the Quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Damsel's Tale &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damsel etiquette will tell you that you can never really trust a knight to save you properly, but as long as your dragon needs feeding you should let them have a go.  &lt;br/&gt;In this 2 player asymmetrical strategy game of hide and sneak the dragon is trying to alert his mother to the presence of a sneaky knight sent to steal from the horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tinderbox Tales is the second game by Red Genie Games set in The Vague World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
