			<description>A light perfect-information card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 6 identical double sided cards representing bands,  with various abilities; there is also a stack of Fan tokens with a &amp;quot;merchandise value&amp;quot; available for those bands to attract.  Each turn you must either play a Band card with the &amp;quot;Opening Act&amp;quot; side up, or flip a band from the Opening Act side to the &amp;quot;Headliner&amp;quot; side.  In addition to the points scored from the abilities during the game, each player will score points equal to the merch value of the Fans their Bands have attracted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 players can play with one copy,  and additional copies can be added so that more players can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
