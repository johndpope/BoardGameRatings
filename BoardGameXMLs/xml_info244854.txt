							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disney Pixar Fanimation Game</name>
									
			<description>Disney Pixar Fanimation is a Disney Pixar themed board game.  The board is customizable and consists of four interlocking board game sections that each have two unique sides.  These board can be set up with between 2-4 sections depending on how long you want the game to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play consists of spinning a spinner to determine how many spaces you move.  You will land on a colored space that corresponds with three decks of cards.  The decks are &amp;quot;Pardner Up&amp;quot; (pick a partner, draw a card, then do as the card says), &amp;quot;Head 2 Head&amp;quot; (pick an opponent, draw a card, then do as the card says), or &amp;quot;Go Solo&amp;quot; (hand the card to the player to the left, and you do what the player reads).  If you successfully complete the card or win the challenge, you follow the bonus rule for the board game section that you are on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the first player to the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
