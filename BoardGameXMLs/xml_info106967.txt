							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Zombie Death</name>
									
			<description>In a galaxy far far away...&lt;br/&gt; ... a Spaceman dies... horribly. Take control of said fateful space man as he battles to his end against the dreaded Alien Zombies! Using a standard laser gun and a few pickups along the way, make sure you take at as many of those Alien Zombie suckers before they take you down. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. It&amp;rsquo;s Alien Zombie Death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those moments when you have a spare 10 minutes and are overcome with the urge to be overwhelmed by nasty Alien Zombies, this is the game for you. It's simple. The theatre unfolds on a random lump of space scaffolding eg. A bunch of platforms. The Alien Zombies come in from everywhere thick and fast. Retro platform shoot-em-up madness ensues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, being Alien Zombies, they could look like any old mad thing... and they do! Green slimy fiends. Bullet Burping Blobbos. Flying bats. Demons. Electric do-das. Battle them with your trusted laser pop-gun and some weapons pick ups along the way for extra carnage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features :&lt;br/&gt;Available on PSP minis&lt;br/&gt;Intense survival gameplay&lt;br/&gt;14 planets/levels&lt;br/&gt;Weapon power ups&lt;br/&gt;Bonus UFOs and Coin pickups&lt;br/&gt;Medals awarded for achievements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
