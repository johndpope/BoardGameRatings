			<description>Board game that simulates limited over cricket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played by any even number of players (teams), but is ideally suited to two players. Each player bats and bowls for one innings (50 overs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once play order is established the bowler determines the type of bowler for the next over by a dice roll. They then place their fielders on the board in setting that matches this type of bowler. Then outcome (and runs scored) of each delivery is determined by drawing a card from a deck of cards. Each card has six possible outcomes, however the outcome is determined by the bowler type (fixed for this over) and therefor is typical to a batsmen playing a delivery from that type of bowler. A well placed field by the bowler should ensure lower scores from the batting team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each over consists of four deliveries, so each innings is therefore 200 balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with or without a scoresheet as a simple magnetic scoring grid (with markers) is printed on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who amasses the most runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules booklet &amp;quot;To play a Board game of cricket in the true spirit of the cricketing tradition. To foster a deeper interest and understanding of the tactical skill required in the National summer sport.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured &amp;amp; Published locally in NZ by F.T.
