			<description>Do you like Cards Against Humanity, but keep playing the same cards over and over again? And when you play those cards, do you think to yourself, &amp;quot;self, these cards simply don't have enough culture, except for all that bacteria?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fear not, my equally warped-minded friends, for behold: Bards Against Humanity provides new cards centered around William Shakespeare. Get it? Bards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This deck provides an additional 8 black cards and 32 white cards for use in your Cards Against Humanity games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
