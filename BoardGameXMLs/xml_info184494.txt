							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bite Nite</name>
									
			<description>Bite Nite is a new tabletop game about competition and supremacy among vampires. Each player is a vampire and during his turn he must bite a victim in the city. This is not always an easy job. Fortunately there are some powerful magic items to help during their midnight snack. In his turn the player draws a power card that he can use to bite his victims. Each victim has a different value due to difficulty to be bitten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blood-lust may force the players to deal with Dracula, they could try to steal his victim during the Dracula's Masquerade Ball. To complicate their life another dangers hides in the city: a wandering werewolf is killing the poor victims during the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The night ends when there are no more victims in the city to bite while the game ends after three nights. The winner is the vampire who collected more victim points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
