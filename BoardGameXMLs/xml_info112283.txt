							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Latrotabuli</name>
									
			<description>This game was created by Jennifer Diane Reitz to make part of her fictional universe of Pastel Defender Heliotrope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is based on the ancient game of latrunculi or latrunculorum, where players try to eliminate all the opponent's pieces using a &amp;quot;flanking movement&amp;quot; (i.e. pieces surrounding the captured piece in opposite sides). There's little information about movement of pieces, being suggested different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Latrotabuli is a variant played in 12 x 6 retangular board and players have 12 latros and 1 centurion (acts as king). Latros can move any number of spaces in one of the cardinal directions whilst the Centurion can only move one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One particular feature of the game is the possibility of creating several formations to best deployment of pieces: the Testudo and the Phalanx. The testudo is a 4-piece square formation and phalanx is a 4-piece linear formation, in which pieces move as one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method of capture depends of the capturing formation (or lack of) and of the captured piece/pieces, and can be by approach, by flanking or by moving and replacing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's 3 victory conditions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     capture all opponent latros (pieces)&lt;br/&gt;     capture the opponent centurion or,&lt;br/&gt;     when a player in the beginning of his turn can't move his centurion, he loses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
