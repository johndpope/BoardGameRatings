			<description>Ghosts roam around the attic playing wildly and (unfortunately) tearing their sheets in the process. Their parents patch them up, but now it's easier to tell who's who when you spot them passing by, and your job in Spooky Wooky is to find pairs of ghosts quicker than anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, all the tiles are laid face down. Players take turns revealing one tile, and as soon as someone spots a pair of ghosts with patches of the same shape, that player keeps the matching tile newly revealed. Players contain playing until no more matches can be made, then whoever has the most tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, players of Spooky Wooky can look for ghosts with patches of the same shape and color, or for ghosts with the same number of identically-shaped patches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
