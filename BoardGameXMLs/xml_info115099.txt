			<description>From the instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;911TS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fearsome journey ahead. A grim evening. The world's leading sports car. Hasty collections of equipment. A frantic race against time at every stage. Only the ultimate driving skills and the best use of extra equipment will get you to your destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Equipment Choice Selection&lt;br/&gt;     Super Smooth Scrolling Scenery&lt;br/&gt;     Eight Unique Game Stages&lt;br/&gt;     Stage Timer and Bonus&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed 'On-Screen' Game Monitor&lt;br/&gt;     Equipment Collection Stages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCENARIO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course is there, waiting, all set to devour you at the slightest mistake. Eight fierce sections, each with it's own challenges. Skillful driving and thoughtful use of extra equipment is the key to the game. You will choose Dunlop tyres of course, but which ones? SP82 Rally Tyre for dusty conditions? Perhaps Dunlop formula for all round rally performance? The choice is yours and it could cost you your life. At the least it will cost you money. Life would be simple if finances were bottomless but alas no. You only have two thousand pounds to spend on your vehicle. Not only that but you are responsible for collecting the equipment yourself. So as you may gather, the task ahead is to say the least, a bit tough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Racing game where you can outfit your Porsche 911 between the eight stretches of track you're facing. An AI operated car is chasing you and trying to push you off the road - as if racing against the clock and evading all road obstacles wasn't enough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
