			<description>A little luck and skill are needed for this game but it also trains colour recognition and memory. The two different ways of playing this game offer variety and plenty of fun. The players take turns pushing the bees into the slots in the beehive. As soon as a bee &amp;quot;flies out&amp;quot; the player takes it and puts it down on his/her card. Depending on which variant of the game is being played the winner is either the first player to fill his/her card with bees or the last to do. The players should sit side by side so that they can all see which bee is being pushed into which slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
