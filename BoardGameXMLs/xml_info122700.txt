							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Isle of Eldermoor Chess</name>
									
			<description>Isle of Eldermoor Chess is a large board chess variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played on a larger 10X10 board to allow more pieces, and then borrowed the idea of the Citadel corner from Omega Chess, an idea quickly expanded to an area of seven additional squares on each corner, leaving the board with a more castle-like appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also uses the 'river' idea in the centre from Xiangqi, as well as an inner King's sanctum area,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of Isle of Eldermoor was to toss out the traditional Western Chess game. There are great variants such as Omega Chess, Opulent Chess, and Grand Chess which take the traditional game and add to it with a few new pieces. It's been done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So only the King was transfered to Eldermoor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the army array reflects more of a fantasy Medieval army, so Paladins, Cavaliers, Yeomen, Soldiers, Archers etc are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an ode to long nights of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons over the years a fantasy element with Wizards, Griffins and Dragons are also part of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With an all new piece array, I needed different movement patterns, well different from Western Chess at least. There are so many variant pieces almost every conceivable movement pattern has been done before in one variant or another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting movements draw on Western Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi and related variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three win conditions;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by checkmating the opposition king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player loses both Wizards the morale of their army is broken and they lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win by occupying both opponent's wizard towers, and holding them for one full turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
