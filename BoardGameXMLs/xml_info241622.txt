							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arkham Horror: The Card Game â€“ Ire of the Void</name>
									
			<description>Ire of the Void, a thrilling novella by Richard Lee Byers, transports you to Arkham, Massachusetts at the height of the Roaring Twenties. Here, astronomer and Miskatonic University professor Norman Withers struggles to regain his standing among the city&amp;rsquo;s academic elite. His opportunity arises when guest speaker, a prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; of the renowned Albert Einstein, arrives on campus. This man may hold the key to Norman's redemption. If the visiting physicist can help Norman explain the phenomenon of the vanishing stars, his credit will surely be restored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for Norman, it soon comes to light that the young physicist has his own unsettling theories about the curvature of space-time; theories that have drawn him across the sea to Arkham and that he now needs Norman&amp;rsquo;s help to prove. With his reputation on the line, Norman has little choice but to offer his aid, no matter how insane the idea. But when the two men begin working to unwind these experimental conundrums, they find they are no longer the seekers of knowledge. They are themselves being sought out, as the physicist is swallowed by nothingness and a dark, unknowable entity is left in his place. What creatures lurk in the angles of time and how can a man of science stand up to beings that defy the laws of reality?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the story and its intrigues, you will find Withers&amp;rsquo;s own collection of notes and evidence. These detailed full-color inserts offer you the opportunity to take on the role of an investigator yourself and draw you deeper into the world of Arkham Horror, as represented through games like Arkham Horror: The Card Game. Within these pages of primary documents, you can race alongside Norman Withers to uncover the secret of the void and lift the veil long enough to retrieve your lost physicist friend before it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the book itself, Ire of the Void includes four cards for Arkham Horror: The Card Game that accompany the novella&amp;rsquo;s storyline. The new cards included in this pack allow you to add Norman Withers to your crew of investigators, marking his first introduction to Arkham Horror: The Card Game. This novella enables you to build a deck tailored to Norman Withers before his official release, and introduces two new Replacement signature cards for the astronomer: Split the Angle and Vengeful Hound. When Norman Withers is released in a future expansion for Arkham Horror: The Card Game, he will feature a different set of signature cards&amp;mdash;meaning that Ire of the Void is the only place you will find these cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
