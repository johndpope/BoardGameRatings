			<description>Classic charades game in a tin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Split your group into 2 teams.  Each team selects a guesser (everyone gets a turn guessing) and the rest of the teams acts out the:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Action&lt;br/&gt;- Song&lt;br/&gt;- TV Show&lt;br/&gt;- Film&lt;br/&gt;- Landmark&lt;br/&gt;- Event&lt;br/&gt;- Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the timer provided to get through as many charades within the two minutes as possible.  Teams take it in turns to act, the non acting team must keep score of how many correct answers the guesser obtains.  After every person on both teams has guessed the winner is the team with the most correct guesses/points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not a peep among the team members acting.   You lose a point if you speak or &amp;quot;mouth&amp;quot; any words to each other or the guesser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use of objects (or even people) is definitely permitted.  You may use generic charades actions, but remember you're against the clock so you may prefer to dive straight in...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready, Set, Go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source:  Game instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
