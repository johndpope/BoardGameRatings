							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Krosmaster: Arena – Percedal Promo</name>
									
			<description>Percedal is a promotional figure for Krosmaster: Arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iops are known for being courageous knights. They will fly into the thick of battle to save their allies without hesitation and perform feats that would break even the most experienced fighters. Percedal is a very talented Iop, being a student of Goultard, one of the strongest Iops in their history. He welds the demon-sword, Rubilax, which hosts a demon of the same name, and is in charge of keeping the demon from escaping into the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Krosmaster: Arena, Percedal is a an exclusively melee fighter; his only offensive skill requires him to be right next to his target to attack. To help him get close, he can use his other skill to jump around to different areas, giving him one of the highest mobility in the game. If he is paired up with some of his teammates from the Wakfu anime, who are also promotional figures, he gains the ability to hit harder with his attacks while also allowing him to have an easier time preventing enemies from escaping from his grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
