			<description>From the Publisher...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Christmas Cheer is a simple, small game (box is 3.5&amp;quot; square) for families to play during the holidays or anytime you&amp;rsquo;d like to remember Christmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the one with the most Christmas cheer (chips) at the end.  Cards depict holiday events like last minute shopping and package in the mail.  Each one instruct the players to pass cheer right or left, take some from the center.  Players can choose to keep rolling the die, hoping to get more cheer, but some rolls can make them lose it all.  Everyone has fun because it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know who will be holding the most cheer when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s for 3 to 6 players.  There is text to read on the cards, but as long as one player at the table can read even young children can easily enjoy the game.  It takes only about 10 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with:&lt;br/&gt;- a wooden hand-painted gingerbread man pawn (each is unique) &lt;br/&gt;- a 1&amp;quot; die (green or red) &lt;br/&gt;- 10 color cards &lt;br/&gt;- 60 plastic chips &lt;br/&gt;- 1 rule sheet (not in the picture)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides just enjoying the game with family and friends, rules are included to use it to give out gifts at a party or family get-together during the holidays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
