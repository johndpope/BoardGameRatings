							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Three Kingdoms</name>
									
			<description>The game represents the Three Kingdom Era in Korea, around the 7th Century AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three phases:  power play and point calculation.  Each player places cards on a three by three grid, then uses the results to gain either general, emperor, or cultural pieces to play on the map.  Each of the key locations have a point value, and battles are fought if more than one player is on a location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the point calculation phase, the player uses the points from the map to increase general or culture points, determined by the type of piece that garnered those points.  At the end of the game, the winner is the one with the most general points, but ignoring culture will subtract points from the total score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
