			<description>Designer's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hear this a lot: &amp;quot;Gee Jake, Panty Explosion sounds really neat and I really like the mechanics but I can't get any of my friends to try it and Japanese school girls are weird and really I'd rather play Fill in the blank&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I get that. Not everyone is cool enough to play a teenage boy who has to dress up in his twin sister's school uniform in order to convince the demon possessed swim team that she's come back from the dead and is going to expose their evil plot to take first place at the regional swimming competition by turning the other teams into mindless zombies. Fine. Let's try this instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A retheming of Panty Explosion Perfect to fit the Naruto background setting.
