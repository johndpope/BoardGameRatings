							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fort Griffin Trilogy Volume 1-3</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why settle for a third of a Frontier Town when you can wrangle the whole kit and caboodle with one toss of a lasso? This package has all three volumes of the ENnie-nominated Frontier Towns: Fort Griffin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That means a Judge gets a well-stocked town of 17 fully-described establishments (and floor maps), with more than 90 fully-described NPCs (including historical figures such as Doc Holliday, John Henry Selman and &amp;quot;Big Nose&amp;quot; Kate) and a total of 115 adventure hooks. From players who like the gamin' tables, to heroes lookin' for a mystery to solve, or travelers who need a good shave and a hot bath, the Fort Griffin Trilogy is fine as cream gravy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every establishment comes with a thorough description of its history, current proprietor and other notables, as well as maps and room-by-room details. The personalities that make each place come alive are furnished with statistics for Sidewinder: Recoiled in addition to the descriptions. And a number of important characters have original illustrations to boot. Even if a Judge prefers not to use the stats, there's plenty of content packed in these 170 pages to make Frontier Towns suitable for any Wild West game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fort Griffin Trilogy comes with the following establishments designed for a hootin'-hollerin' time in an Old West burg. Please see each individual volume for more notes about each place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    African Methodist Episcopal Church&lt;br/&gt;    Beehive Saloon&lt;br/&gt;    Chen's Laundry&lt;br/&gt;    Clampitt Wagon Yard&lt;br/&gt;    Doc Culver's&lt;br/&gt;    Doney's Saloon&lt;br/&gt;    Earl's Shave and Bathe&lt;br/&gt;    F.B. York's Bank&lt;br/&gt;    Fort Griffin Jail&lt;br/&gt;    Frontier House&lt;br/&gt;    Louis Woolform's Bakery&lt;br/&gt;    Pete Haverty's Livery&lt;br/&gt;    Planter's Hotel&lt;br/&gt;    Post Office and Drug Store&lt;br/&gt;    Shannsey's Saloon&lt;br/&gt;    Thorp Blacksmith&lt;br/&gt;    York and Meyers Outfitters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
