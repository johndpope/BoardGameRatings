			<description>Game Documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far beyond the outermost Galaxy of our universe, beyond the wildest imaginings of mortal man lies a newly born World. A World manufactured artificially from the raw material of the universe. Painstakingly created by the pure thought processes of beings immeasurably superior in intellect to ourselves. Beings who possess no physical form, but exist only as clouds of pure mental energy, capable of projecting their will over infinite distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Geometrical center of this artificial world there exists an immense cavern, created by these beings as a place of worship. The one solitary object of worship in this shrine, a statue carved in the image of mortal man. At the base of this statue are inscribed three words: ALEXANDER THE GREAT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you sleep this night, your dreams are disturbed by a ghostly voice; at first the voice seems to ask you gently to follow it; at your vague refusal it becomes more insistent, eventually growing into a howling demand for your presence. As your last remnant of resistance is shattered you jerk awake to find yourself on the floor inside what seems to be an old mansion. As you raise yourself on the floor inside what seems to be an old mansion, you have no way of knowing that you are now the subject of a....FEASIBILITY EXPERIMENT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
