			<description>Transaction, the wall street game is the result of over ten years of work.  With the game you can simulate conditions as they happen in the actual stock market.  This is not just a game of printed cards, spinners, dice and paraphernalia usually found in a game.  Actual happenings have been carefully gathered and programmed into a new device which releases authentic stock market data similar to the release of such data by an expensive electronic data processing unit. Originally produced by John R. Tusson in 1962 from GAMES FOR SALE at AngelFire.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
