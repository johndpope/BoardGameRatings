			<description>A 3 dimensional board game where Spiderman swings from a web suspended between 4 towers above a rotatable disc simulating a manhole cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad guy discs are located on points adjacent to points on the manhole discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is controlled by a single deck of cards. players take turns to draw a card and follow instructions. after use the card is discarded, when all the cards have been used the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards instruct to move yourself, a bad guy disc swing spidey or rotate the central disc. the object is to collect as many bad guys as possible before the card deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the winner is the player with the most bad guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spiderman swings around and seemingly at random chooses a bad guy to be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
