			<description>Topologic is a game of logic and deduction, but also uses piece movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game is played over two rounds. In the first round one player plays the role of the referee (who hides a secret), the other the role of the seekers. In the second round the roles reverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 5 seekers are moved across the playing field (an assembled area of connected Nestortiles). Then the referee counts the score of the currently occupied locations (1 point for a color and/or number match) and announces the sum of the scored points. As they get more information, the seekers can deduce where the secret is hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topologic is abstract, but players are encouraged to come up with a thematic background they like. This even includes renaming the game for each session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
