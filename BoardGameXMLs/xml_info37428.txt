			<description>Bonus game included with the VHS and Laser Disc release of Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken (a compilation of the first five episodes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components included: game board, &amp;quot;Building&amp;quot; cards, Demona &amp;quot;Wild&amp;quot; cards, Elisa &amp;quot;Badge&amp;quot; cards, spinner (1, 2, 3), and four player tokens (Goliath, Brooklyn, Lexington, Broadway).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players were instructed to keep the video running after they finished watching the movie.  The video would occasionally flash, and the player whose turn it was would have to follow the orders of the character (Xanatos, Elisa, or Demona) that appeared on screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
