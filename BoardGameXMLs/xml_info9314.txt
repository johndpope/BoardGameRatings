			<description>From the back of the ziplock:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In HIGH SEAS each player commands a pirate fleet, sailing the waters of the 17th century Caribbean searching for gold, glory and plunder.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes (8) historical scenarios as well as a standard hypothetical scenario. Scale is 1 week per turn, 50km per hex. Complexity is medium and solitaire suitability is very high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)  24-page rulebook (17-1/2 pages of which are rules)&lt;br/&gt;(1)  18x28&amp;quot; color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;(560) Full-color counters, in two die-cut sheets&lt;br/&gt;(4)  Player reference cards&lt;br/&gt;(4)  Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From an actual inventory, we can add:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     (1) Color Cover Sheet (single-sided)&lt;br/&gt;     (1) Color Back Sheet (single-sided)&lt;br/&gt;     (8) Small Ziplock Bags (55&amp;times;80 mm inner dimensions)&lt;br/&gt;     (1) Corrigenda sheet (single-sided)&lt;br/&gt;     (8) Merchant ship card sheets (single-sided, 16 cards per sheet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are actually just (2) Player Aid cards (double-sided, double-sized)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook's pages 22 and 24 are blank, page 23 is a reduced set of 4 two-sided counter sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the two counter sheets, one is partially in color (110 color counters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early copies came with lower-quality single-sided counter sheets of mere stiff paper, uncut; they included a coupon good for a free upgrade to real counters &amp;quot;in a few months time&amp;quot;. Copies sold at Origins '93 included these *and* the real counter sheets, die-cut and two-sided. Looks like they managed to get the real counters printed in the nick of time. However, the back side of the duplicate (uncut) color counters were misprinted with some missing colors (some parts are even white on white). Luckily this would not have really affected game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
