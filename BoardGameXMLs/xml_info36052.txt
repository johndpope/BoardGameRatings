							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Global Warming</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Solo card game. Abstract simulation of Global Warming. Winning &amp;amp; Losing: If the Heat Level ever gets to 10, Global Warming is not controlled and Civilization as we know it is doomed. If at the End of the game the Heat Level is 9 or below, humanity has averted complete disaster. The Game ends when there are no cards left in the Heat Deck.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck of cards made up of four suits: Pollution, Consequences, Political Will, and Solutions. Each suit had thirteen cards numbered from one to thirteen. A normal deck of cards can be used if the player does not wish to construct the custom deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
