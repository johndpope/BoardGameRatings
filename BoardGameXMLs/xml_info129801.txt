							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prinzessin Lillifee: Das Bl√ºtenfest</name>
									
			<description>A Princess-Lillifee themed travel game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a metal box, whose lid also functions as the game board. It shows a grid of 4x7 squares and two starting spaces. On the grid are placed 28 magnetic flower pieces. Players take turns rolling a die. If the active player rolls a flower colour, he/she may move his/her player piece (also magnetic) until it reaches a flower of the corresponding colour. Pieces may only be moved either vertically or horizontally, and it may not jump over the other player's piece or the rose piece. If it reaches a flower of the colour on the die roll, the player wins that flower. If he can't reach a flower of the current colour, he/she may move their piece to an empty space. If a player rolls the rose symbol, he gets to move the rose piece. The rose can only be plucked once all the other flowers have been taken. In this phase of the game, there are no more die rolls. Each player gets to move once per round. While the other flowers are worth one point, the rose is worth three points.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all flowers have been plucked. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
