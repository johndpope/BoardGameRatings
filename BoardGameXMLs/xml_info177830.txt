							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adorable Avenger</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet Pacifica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rainbow ringed jewel of Galaxy Command, a world with a heritage of peace and freedom dating back nearly 1800 years. One of the first and greatest of the human colony worlds, the men and women who tamed Pacifica have built a world that is the envy of their galactic neighbors, a world that is a utopia even by the high standards of 35th Century existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The citizens of Pacifica eliminated crime, war and disease centuries ago. The multispectrum radiation from the planet's spectacular ring system energies human cells, reversing age and giving the body the energy it needs to fight off even the worst disease. On their homeworld, Pacificians are virtually immortal- centuries old philosopher/hedonists with the bodies of teenagers. Pacifica's ruling council allows grievously wounded from across the galaxy to rest and recover on the paradise. However, though Galaxy Command and its agents are welcome on the pleasure-world, their weapons (even the non-lethal wonders Command marshals use to fight off WARSTAR hordes) are not. Nothing capable of inflicting harm is allowed on Pacifica, and clouds of intelligent mist, possibly the most amazing micro-bots in the galaxy, roam the world seeking out and nullifying any weapons smuggled on-planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacifica enjoys a reputation as the most lavish resort world in known space, but is also renowned for its serene, meditative temples. Diplomats, brilliant artists and famous courtesans all hail from this lush world, and so do the quirky, courageous and relentlessly cheerful adventurers nicknamed, only half-jokingly, &amp;quot;Adorable Avengers&amp;quot;. Cute, lovable and resolute, these (in)famous women end wars, broker lasting peace-treaties between mortal enemies. Sworn to do no harm to any life form, Adorable Avengers are unconventional heroes, who solve problems with wit, with affection and with charm, not with blasters. Even the latest WARSTAR atrocity can't break their resolve, nor end their quest for justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Advanced Class is intended for the Five-Star Rated Galaxy Command RPG today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
