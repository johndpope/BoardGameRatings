			<description>This solitaire game is inspired by the work of the World Class OPFOR of the U.S. Army.  In the game, you are a Colonel of a Brigade Combat Team trying to drive through OPFOR forces into the enemy rear.  If you are sufficiently successful, you may be promoted to General.  If not, you could lose your command.&lt;br/&gt;   To play, 9 OPFOR defense cards are played facedown in a 3X3 pattern. The player then selects from a variety of FRAGO cards which offensive operation he wants to use to find a path thru the defensive lines. Each FRAGO lists the type of operation, combat strength, and the number of game-hours to complete the operation.  The player has to find, or fight, his way thru the defense in less than 20 game-hours.  &lt;br/&gt;   If the player completes the breakthrough in less than 20 game-hours, he retains his command.  If he can do it in 16 or less game-hours, he is promoted.  If it takes longer than the alloted time, the player loses command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
