							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Gunman</name>
									
			<description>The player controls a Space Gunman exploring a derelict Space Station on a mission to destroy the Alien infestation there. Each turn the player moves through the station building the map with a deck of room tiles. In between movement a die is rolled to see where Robots and Aliens show up and wait to attack the player. The combat is fast and simple requiring only one d6 to determine success or injury. The game is divided into 3 missions, each with their own objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this short 20 minute adventure the player is tasked with shutting down the security robots, locating the deceased operative who failed HIS attempt, destroying the Alien nest of eggs, and finally escaping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More and more enemies appear the further the player progresses, but there is Battle Armor hidden in the Lair to even the odds - but is it worth the detour?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a light print and play game which requires very little paper and not much cutting. Players will need to provide their own token to mark their location and a six-sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
