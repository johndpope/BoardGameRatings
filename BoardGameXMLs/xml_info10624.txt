			<description>EmotrionsOnCards is a strategy card game for all ages that belongs to the Emotrions line of games, which also includes board games (soon) and digital games (in development phase). The main feature of the Emotrions line is that it introduces the issue of Emotional Intelligence into a sector traditionally focused on the development of analytical intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EmotrionsOnCards is a really entertaining and addictive game. It's also easy to learn due to its few and consistent rules. There's a conscious balance between a distillate simplicity, which makes it possible for everybody to play in a more relaxed - &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; - manner, and a depth of game which will satisfy the classic strategy game hard players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In EmotrionsOnCards, the cards, called emotrions, represent the basic human feelings: love, hatred, joy, sadness, fury, indecision... Some emotrions score points, others take them away. And they keep intermingling in your hand, when playing each trick, and even when you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is very powerful as a strategy game. The miracle lays in its innovative logic, with negative and positive playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With only 36 cards and some minimal rules you'll be able to unfold many complex and shady situations. And you can also play different games with the same set of cards, such as The Pareo Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy, psychology and luck &lt;br/&gt;EmotrionsOnCards sets off from a Standard style featuring a careful balance between Strategy, Psychology and Luck. But you may just as well alter this balance with The Winner's Options, to suit the winner of the previous hand. Thus, the most &amp;quot;psychological&amp;quot; players will prefer a more uncertain style, and the lovers of sheer strategy will demand a more analytical style. The possibility of modulating the game allows players with different profiles to enjoy, and feel the game as just right for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Philosophy&lt;br/&gt;All the game is a carefully made metaphor on how we manage our emotions, and other people's, in everyday life. As you try to master the strategy, you'll learn that in order to win in the long run (the game), it is always necessary to consider the effects of a particular battle (stake/trick), even if it means losing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the game is to make us reflect on the fact that in real life there's no such thing as obviously good or bad situations, but more or less complex positions in which the thin line between success and failure relies on our managing little things. It is possible to win, even if we get a bad hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
