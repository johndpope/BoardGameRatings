			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wildlands is a frontier region lying between the civilized realms and the southern untamed lands, which are home to foul beasts and fierce humanoid tribes. Various keeps and castles stand watch along the border, guarding the mountain passes and river valleys that would otherwise provide marauders and monsters with easy access to the civilized realms. One such keep is Drake Hall, the seat of power for Baron Richard Drake. The Baron's family has defended the border for more than a century, but recently things have taken a turn for the worse. Things are about to reach a tipping point, unless an intrepid group of adventurerers can save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos in the Wildlands is an adventure front for the Dungeon World RPG. It presents the skeleton of a complete original adventure, inspired by a classic old-school TSR module from the 1980s. With it and a minimal amount of prep work, a GM has enough material for several sessions of play, as well as the set-up for a longer campaign arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
