			<description>Field of Glory &amp;ndash; Rise of Rome is the first expansion pack for Field of Glory, bringing tons of new content and features in addition to a comprehensive Digital Army Generator (DAG). The DAG allows you to design armies to a specific number of points and then take these armies in to single player against the AI or online in multiplayer. Making its first ever appearance on a Slitherine title, the DAG is a powerful tool for any wargames addict! If the ability to create one&amp;rsquo;s own finely tuned army isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, Rise of Rome also includes 5 new terrain types, 6 new battles, a random battle generator, and over 100 new units including camelry, scythed chariots and artillery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armies in Rise of Rome include: Mid-Republican Roman, Late Republican Roman, Gallic, Pyrrhic, Later Carthaginian, Ancient Spanish, Later Macedonian, Attalid Pergamene, Numidian or Early Moorish, Later Seleucid, Later Ptolemaic, Pontic, Spartacus Slave Revolt, Early Armenian, Parthian, Later Jewish, Bosporan. Plus a selection of allied armies to bolster your main force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
