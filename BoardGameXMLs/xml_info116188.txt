			<description>Spaghetti is a two player game that serves up spaghetti, sauce, and meatballs on a Shibumi plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes the white spaghetti marbles; the other takes the red sauce marbles. The black meatball marbles are neutral and are used by either player as needed. Any small object, such as a napkin or black marble, is used as a tie-breaker token to indicate which player last played a black marble to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, White plays a black meatball marble anywhere on an empty Shibumi board and takes the tie-breaker token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then alternate placing one of their own marbles adjacent to the last placed marble.  Here, adjacent means orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to and on the same level as the last placed marble or onto a 2x2 platform just completed by the last placed marble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player is unable to place a marble in this way, she or he places a black meatball marble on any empty space or platform and takes the tie-breaker token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the only space left is the peak of the Shibumi pyramid.  A black meatball marble is then placed on the top of the pyramid. This is a neutral move and the tie breaker token stays with its current owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who created the longest strand of touching spaghetti or sauce marbles (when the board is viewed from above) wins the game. If there is a tie, the player who last played a meatball marble loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strand is a connected set of like-colored marbles such that each marble in the strand is connected to one or two other marbles in the strand as in a chain of links. There is no looping back where a single marble is passed through more than once and there is no branching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now the meal is served. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buon Appetito!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Shibumi Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downloadable PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
