							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Hunt</name>
									
			<description>A fantasy game with unique monsters as opposed to having each combat simply being a different strength rating die roll. Monsters each have their own set of attacks: A Cockatrice has &amp;quot;Stone x2&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Claw x2&amp;quot; for its attack, and is immune to holy spells and vulnerable to fire; A Ghoul has &amp;quot;Fang x1&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Poison x2&amp;quot; attacks, and is immune to stone, song, poison, and curse based attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is monsters vs. monsters, neither player has characters that act as adventurers/heroes. There is the usual variety of spells and items and events to affect the outcomes of combat between the monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
