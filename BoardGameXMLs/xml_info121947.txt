			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graphical adventure set in La Martinique in 1902. A paranormal investigator is asked to investigate a case of haunting. The game came with a tape from Creole band Malavoi, a short story by writer Patrick Chamoiseau and a traditional Creole recipe. The back of the box says (translated from French):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dear master,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;your reputation as an investigator in supernatural manifestations has reached even me. Ever since my family and I have started to live in our ancestral home, we've been plagued with the strangest and most unnerving events: noises from beyond the grave, cries, sepulchral moans, knocks coming from deep inside the walls... Some kind of assuredly miserable zombie troubles our sleep and persecute us during the quiet afternoon hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would be most grateful if you accepted this invitation to come visit us and try and solve this zombie mystery, so that we may understand his origin, what he wants, and what it is we must do to be rid of his presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your price, of course, will be mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yours truly,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michel HUBERT-DESTOUCHES&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
