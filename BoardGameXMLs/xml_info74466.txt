							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cool World</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Cool World is an action-oriented Super NES video game that is loosely based on the movie Cool World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;Cartoonist Jack Deebs (the player's character) has discovered Cool World; eliminating the fine line between fantasy and reality. Holli Would has a major crush on Jack and is using him romantically to get a human body and move to the &amp;quot;Real World.&amp;quot; Jack's only goal is to escape this alternative reality and return to the real world. By doing so, he returns to his beloved hometown of Las Vegas. If Holly grabs the Golden Spike of Power, then both worlds will be destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Release&lt;br/&gt;The original manufacturer's retail price on the day of release was set at $41.95 in American dollars ($65.04 when that amount is calculated using today's dollars).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Popper Police&lt;br/&gt;The Popper Police decide to arrest the player because he is getting too close to Holli Would; who is the main villain of the game.The Popper Police are a bunch of miniature cops working under Detective Frank Harris. Jack (the player) must avoid them or get arrested. When a group of Popper Police manage to bunch up on the player and halt his movement, a message will pop up with the words &amp;quot;You are under arrest.&amp;quot; This renders any further progress in the game impossible pending a cut scene. Depending on how many times the player has broken the law and whether he has nickels (coins) or not, the player will either get a lecture by Detective Frank Harris and/or be forced to pay bail money. 10 coins is the usual bail required by Detective Harris; bankrupting players who either haven't been to Las Vegas to increase their nickel stash or opened a Cool World bank account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buildings&lt;br/&gt;Near the center of Cool World, there is a bank (with an animated Bald Eagle) that allows the player to store nickels in a bank account. There is also a pawn shop that allows items to be traded or bought with nickels in addition to the Slash Club where the player arranges a date with Holli Would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A malt shop is found in Sweet Place where candy can be found in addition to other sweets.However, entry is restricted to players who have collected several pieces of candy. If this demand is not meant, the face at the candy store will spit him out because &amp;quot;he was not sweet enough.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the far left of Cool World is Holli Would's house where the player must navigate the exterior of the house in order to reach his date with Holli.If the player did not arrange a date with Holli before reaching the top, he is tossed back to the ground level. Holli's doorbell has a tendency to spit out a fireball attack at a random moment causing a life to be instantly lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After withstanding anywhere between five to seven hits from a Doodle using any form of weapon except fire attacks, the player's character curls himself into a ball and turns into a tombstone with an R.I.P. epitaph on it. Fire attacks cause the player to instantly lose a life and cause his character to appear with ash on his face and ragged clothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Censorship&lt;br/&gt;Due to censorship issues, the player simply kisses Holli on the date with her to make her human, as opposed to giving her sexual intercourse. This is the most integral censoring of Cool World as the game was produced prior to the introduction of the ESRB video game rating system. The game was released around Christmas of 1992 and the game was targeted towards preteens who were enticed by the PG-13 rating of the Cool World movie that this video game was based upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the movie, Detective Frank Harris would say &amp;quot;Freeze, asshole&amp;quot; to Jack Deebs where he violates the &amp;quot;noids don't have sex with doodles rule.&amp;quot; However, the words &amp;quot;sex&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;asshole&amp;quot; are never used in the video game.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cool_World_(Super_NES),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
