							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pit of Loch-Durnan</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loch-Durnan, a forested town shrouded in mist. It is a town with closely guarded secrets; a town in trouble. Goblins have occupied the caverns of the pit, a hidden gold mine that makes the small town prosperous. Injured in a raid on the goblins, the town&amp;rsquo;s twin brother mayors seek adventurers to do what they cannot. Stalwart heroes are sought after to go into the mine and drive the goblins back whence they came. Seems easy enough for a band of adventurers, but not all is as it seems in the sleepy, mist-shrouded town. The mine is not their only secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This massive adventure from Mystic Eye Games is great for any d20 fantasy setting. It is ideal for 4-6 characters ranging from 2nd to 4th level. Immerse yourself in a plot of intrigue, betrayal, and murder while trying to help a small town rid its mine of evil goblins and more. Can your band of adventurers help the small town or will they die in the dark caverns of the pit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
