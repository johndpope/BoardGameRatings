			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short adventure for the RPG Operation:Fallen Reich, for 3-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure starts in London, November 22, 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot Excerpt:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A German archeological expedition led by a Fallen, Professor Albert Gr&amp;uuml;ber, is in Sweden looking for an old and powerful artefact, The Sword of the Rightful. According to an old legend or myth, a Swedish knight was banished and had to do 20 years of service to the holy chair with the Knight Templars in the holy land. He was given a sword, a very special sword, The Sword of the Rightful. He brought the sword with him when he returned to Sweden from the holy land 20 years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years after his return, when he was mortally wounded in a battle with the Danes, he was buried together with his sword in a church he had build. The memories of his burial place faded, but the nuns of the abbey of Bridget of Sweden (Sancta Birgitta or Saint Birgitta) made a note of its location under the floor stones in the church of Bridget of Sweden, in the town of Vadstena. --&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
