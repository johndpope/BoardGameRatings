							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Derby: The Demolition Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Prepare yourself to enter the Death Derby Tournament -- the hardly collectible card game of over-the-top vehicular combat where machine guns roar, missiles light up the sky, and a carton of eggs can stop a tank. Choose one of ten stock vehicles or create your own. Then begin your rampage by gathering weapons and upgrading your vehicle while blasting opponents and overcoming battlefield hazards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Derby was designed with simplicity in mind. The rules are easy to learn and game play is fast and fun. Three different sets of playing cards are included. Each needs to be printed, cut, separated, and then compiled into a complete deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was created by Politically Incorrect Games before they changed their imprint name to Precis Intermedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
