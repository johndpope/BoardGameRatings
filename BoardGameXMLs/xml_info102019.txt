			<description>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3 (ガンダム無双3 Gandamu Musō Surī) is a tactical action video game based on the Gundam anime series, and the sequel to 2008's Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3 follows in the style of previous Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors games as an action-oriented hack and slash with some tactical elements. However, both Dynasty Warriors: Gundam games have unique gameplay mechanics and twists that set them apart from the core Dynasty Warriors series. The greatest of these is the core content: rather than using characters and story from the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the games draw their material from across the various Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. Another change is the player's choice of pilots and mecha independent of each other, allowing the ability to use any combination of man and machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also changes in gameplay: players are given more ranged combat options than in other Dynasty Warriors games, although melee combat is still the focus of the game. Units in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam are much more mobile, using their thrusters to dash, jump in mid-air, and (for some) even fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
