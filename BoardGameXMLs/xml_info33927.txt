			<description>A game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The spirits have taken your stones and hidden them on the path&amp;rdquo;, explained the shaman, &amp;ldquo;Go, find your stones and return them to their totems around the fire. The first to complete this task is the strongest among you.&amp;rdquo;. The four braves had seen many strange things under the guidance of the shaman, but a race was something familiar and welcome. All four braves paused only a moment, and then they were gone down the path in both directions. The shaman squatted by the fire to wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 1 piecepack&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 suitable container for randomly drawing coins (optional)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to be the first to gather and place their spirit stones on the moon totem spaces of the spirit wheel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
