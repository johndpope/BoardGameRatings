			<description>Nafetel: Merchants is a unique game where players will compete against each other to fill quotas from shipmasters eager to get back out on the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Nafetel: Merchants each player will play through a set of rounds in which they trade, bid, invest, gain victory points, and more. Each player has four sets of these rounds to fill however many quotas they possibly can then the shipmasters will leave with what they have or empty. This is called the ticking time bomb, where Shipmasters and Merchants alike both want the best deals in the quickest time possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will draw 4 Investment cards to begin the game, after that a specific number of quota cards will be placed in the middle of the players. Each player will play their rounds separate from the other players. They will decide if they wish to invest, bid, and/or trade their investments for new ones or invest them on quotas. The first player to fill a quota through either monopolising it, out bidding it, or quickly snagging it off the market will gain a victory point for that quota the filled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
