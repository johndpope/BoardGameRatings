			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focused, Tactical, Player vs. Player Roleplaying for the pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict-RPG is a table-top roleplaying game focused on tactical combat versus other teams and Players. Driving the combat are clearly defined objectives and your will to win. Everything below is included in the boxed set:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-A 122-page Conflict Roleplaying Rulebook &lt;br/&gt;-The Balaneion Battlemap (24&amp;quot;x26&amp;quot; Side A) &lt;br/&gt;-The Ancient's Atrium Battlemap(24&amp;quot;x26&amp;quot; Side B)&lt;br/&gt;-Transparent Spell Area of Effect Cutouts (10 templates) &lt;br/&gt;-Map Counters (5 pages) &lt;br/&gt;-Passcards Pack (6-10 pages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Balaneion Battlemap:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniatures battle map is symmetric balance to provide incredible strategic combat. Each in-scale structure is well-thought out and strategically situated to add different tactical dimensions to each Conflict Match or gaming session. Though designed exclusively for the Conflict Roleplaying System, this map is versatile enough to be used with any roleplaying system that uses the standard 1 inch miniature grid (i.e., 3.5, 4e D&amp;amp;D, Pathfinder).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancients Atriums Battlemap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancient's Atrium battlemap depicts a beautifully designed garden laced in ivory, a sanctuary of peace and harmony that invites comfort. Yet this Atrium is wickedly designed to become the center of conflict and strife. Perfectly symmetrical for tactical fairness, this map is made for strategists. Providing a visually stunning environment that can be used for fantasy (or sci-fi) role-playing settings. Any GM can make the Ancient's Atrium place of peace and well deserved rest for players, or, if you're like us, a place of unexpected conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict Roleplaying Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passcards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PassCards are the key to privatly communicating between individual players and the GM in a Conflict game.During the setup time for a match, your PassCard provides you the space you need to provide your GM with basic facts about your character, such as your saves, armor class, and so on. This information helps your GM when he needs to make decisions about certain actions, such as if one of your enemies attempts to cast dominate person on you without your knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Elements Counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five pages of heavy cardstock-mounted, full-color counters. Both Large sized and medium sized counters are included. In Conflict RPG, Map Elements are magical objects players can purchase and place strategically on the map. These counters are used to clearly illustrate the locations and type of Map Element in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Area of Effect Template&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Area of Effect Templates are printed on transparency film. These templates are coated with a clear polyester base, making it dry erase or permanent markers friendly. Jot down the spell name and effects directly on the template. A swipe with a dry eraser, its ready to reuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
