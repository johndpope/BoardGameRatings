			<description>Summarized from the Kickstarter announcement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wooden Wars is a visual and visceral action battle game, where tactics, good hand-eye coordination and a bit of luck are key! Players command armies of sturdy wooden soldiers against each other using the floor as the battlefield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved by knocking over all the opposing sides&amp;rsquo; forces by firing upon them, with melee action, or by capturing a key objective like the enemy&amp;rsquo;s flag or a star fort made of blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of engagement are simple. Players can either move units a fixed distance, or fire. Firing consists of tossing small rubber balls at the opponent's forces to knock them over. There is no looking up rules or arguing whether or not someone has been hit or not--the visuals tell it all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With strategy, tactics, and rubber balls bouncing around with the accuracy of black-powder musket fire,  Wooden Wars is bringing war back to the floor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
