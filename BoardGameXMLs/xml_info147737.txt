							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Burger Blitz!</name>
									
			<description>Players assume the roles of aspiring chefs who are competing for the head chef position at the swanky Burger Blitz restaurant. Battle your way to the top by attacking other chef's reputations, enlisting the services of food minions, making magic in the kitchen, and getting your hands dirty by taking the plate to speed up your burger-making skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burger Blitz's main mechanic is press-your-luck dice rolling. What you roll determines 6 different bonuses you can earn that round - Reputation, Burger Ingredients, Pepper, Mayo, Attack, and Tips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to dice, there are 24 minion cards which players can purchase. These minions give players permanent bonuses they can use every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally there are magic cards. Magic cards are earned every time a player completes a full burger. These cards are powerful but can only be used once. Play a mayo token with a magic card to boost the effects even more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burger Blitz is easy enough for young children to learn but has enough depth and strategy to entertain seasoned gamers. Included in the rulebook are several variants recommended for more casual or more cutthroat games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
