			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation and leveling up can be confusing, even for experienced players. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of keep track of, including abilities to choose and statistics to be recalculated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Workbook: Oracle for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a game aid designed to walk you through the process and help you keep track of all those changes. It&amp;rsquo;s not a character sheet &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll still need one of those &amp;ndash; but it will help you make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve filled out your character sheet completely and correctly. You&amp;rsquo;ll never have to worry that your character has been short-changed. If you gamemaster asks how and when your character gained a certain ability, or how you calculated a certain bonus, you can show them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Workbook: Oracle contains a mystery worksheet, a skills worksheet, a feats worksheet, and an experience point log. It is also fully enhanced with live links to the Pathfinder System Reference Document at d20pfsrd.com! Most underlined words, when clicked on, will take you to descriptions and explanations relevant to that section of the workbook, saving you time you&amp;rsquo;d previously have spent flipping through rule books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
