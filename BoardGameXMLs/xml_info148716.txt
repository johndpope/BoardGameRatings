			<description>From the game box: Your McDonaldland&amp;reg; friends are here in 3 fun match-up card games!  There's Ronald McDonald&amp;reg;, Big Mac&amp;reg;, Captain Crook&amp;trade;, Hamburglar&amp;trade;, and Birdie The Early Bird&amp;trade;. You'll match colors, numbers - even shadows - of your favorite McDonaldland characters to win. Box contains game rules for all 3 games and a deck of 35 playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow Match&amp;trade; - Players collect one character card each time they're the first to slap the matching shadow card.  The first person to collect a full set of 5 character cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Match and Stack&amp;trade; - On their turn, players try to match a card from their hand with the top card on the game stack.  The first person who gets rid of all the cards in their hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Won-by-One&amp;trade; - A solitaire game, the goal is to match all of the cards while placing them into 1 or 2 stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
