			<description>Oceans Of Space is a print and play solitaire card game that requires only a pack of regular playing cards, a printed record sheet and a pencil to start your new career as an intergalactic rogue trader and pirate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will visit a multitude of planets, mine for precious ores, and adventure for great rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of Oceans Of Space is to retire in with 10,000 credits. If you have 10,000 credits and are in a port, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you ever reach 0 hull, you are destroyed and the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you will either visit a port, mine for minerals, or engage in piracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visiting a port will allow you to buy and sell goods, discover and buy upgrades to your ship, pick up passengers, or accept missions or contraband goods.  You flip a card to discover which type of good is highly valued at this port, and flip further cards to reveal what ship upgrades are available to buy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mining sees you flipping cards to uncover diamonds, pushing your luck for a big haul or a precious gem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piracy sees you gambling against the game, with the possibility of winning big, or having your game suddenly ended in ignominy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your first few turns will be a struggle to survive, but with the right choices and a bit of luck, you're be navigating the oceans of space to your fortune in no time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
