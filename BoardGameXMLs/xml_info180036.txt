							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Kids vs. The House</name>
									
			<description>You and your friends are tired of having all your great stuff go missing. You know it's that creepy house on the corner, and you have had enough. You are each going to gather a group of friends from the neighborhood and make a mad dash into the house to try to get your items back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start The Kids vs. The House, players determine how many items &amp;mdash; as few as one and up to twenty &amp;mdash; they need to recover from the house. This allows them to customize the length of their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You then flip the fist item card over and see how many kid team points you need to have to try to get the item back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with two cards from the Action/Kid deck. This deck contains kids from the neighborhood worth 1-5 points each that you add to your hand to try to build up a team with enough points to retrieve the item. There are also four other types of cards that cause things, do things, and help protect you from the creepy things that can happen in the house:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Chaos cards always go off when drawn. Chaos she is a harsh mistress.&lt;br/&gt;     Protection cards are used to prevent or deflect many of the negative events and actions in the game.&lt;br/&gt;     Incident cards can be played on other players during your action phase to try to disrupt their chances of acquiring the item.&lt;br/&gt;     Trap cards always go off when drawn, with the house apparently trying to defend its ill-gotten gains. Beware the house!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn, you draw a card from the Action/Kid deck. If it doesn't instruct you to play it immediately (traps and chaos cards), then you can put it in your hand. You then have the option to perform an action. If you have a card that is playable (Incident and some Chaos), you can play this on the other players to help yourself or hurt their chances to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns proceed around the play area until someone has at least as many points in their hand as shown as the target number on the item. Once that minimum is met, they can choose to fold their hand and place it face down. They now cannot be targeted by any incidents, but can be affected by Chaos and Trap cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a person folds, everyone yet to play in that round draws one card, then everyone reveals their cards to see who has the most points and clams the item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this wasn't the final item, shuffle the cards and repeat with the next item. When the final item is claimed, the person with the most points at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;We currently are planning a Kickstarter launch in August 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
