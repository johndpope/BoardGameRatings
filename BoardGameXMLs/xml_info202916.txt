			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Eye investigators receives a call from Professor Van Fleet at the Reynolds Museum, a small museum attached to the University of London which maintains a valuable collection of artefacts from the ancient Mediterranean and Near East. Van Fleet is a tall, very thin man in his fifties, almost bald with a sharp beak-like nose and glasses. His voice is very soft and quiet and he behaves with great politeness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A week ago, Professor Van Fleet was shown a nearly complete Etruscan wine bowl, of excellent quality and condition. The curious thingwas, it was shown to him by a band of teenagers who found it in the alleyway behind the Corinthian Building in the City. The kids brought the bowl to the museum in the hope that it &amp;lsquo;might be worth something&amp;rsquo;. Van Fleet and the museum&amp;rsquo;s patrons at the university would very much like to know how a valuable and potentially important artefact should end up discarded in a pile of rubbish. If there is an underground trade in such artefacts, the University wants it tracked down and stopped before more items of historical value are lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Van Fleet is to be Open Eye&amp;rsquo;s contact at the museum. The University of London will pay Open Eye&amp;rsquo;s retainer and fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
