							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja Golf</name>
									
			<description>Ninja Golf is an Atari 7800 video game which combines scrolling beat 'em up with golf simulation gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player starts each hole by aiming his ball and shooting it toward the green. He then runs toward the ball, in traditional sidescroller fashion, fighting various enemies encountered along the way. These enemies include other ninjas, gophers, birds, giant mutant frogs, sharks and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enemies faced depends on the environment the ninja golfer is currently in. Sharks are encountered in water hazards and snakes in the sand traps. Ninjas are encountered in all the environments, including under water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ninja Golf&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle for every hole!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ten years you've trained to be a Ninja. And now your Master tells you that it's time to take the final, most difficult test and become a Master Ninja. You must complete the game of death. You must play nine holes of... Ninja Golf?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You knew your Master was a bit weird, but nothing prepared you for this! You must attempt to sneak in a birdie between karate kicks while you battle Ninja opponents. Par for this course means leaving the green littered with fallen foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You gain points for both your golf game and defeating attacking Ninja. You can also earn points for finding treasures and other bonus items along the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've completed all nine holes successfully, be ready to challenge the disguised Master Ninja. This final battle will determine whether or not you become a Master Ninja. And if you win, it will improve your golf score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
