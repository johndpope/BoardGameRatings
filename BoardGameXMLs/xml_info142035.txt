							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Medic: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another hard day in Dungeon World. The Wizard blew his toes off, the Thief lost an eye, the Fighter took yet another ax to the shoulder. And then you had to perform that emergency operation on the attack zombie going for The Bard's squishy little arms, slicing off its jaw off before it could get a bite in. You sigh to yourself. You're The Medic, and these fools wouldn't last a day without your supervision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Medic is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game. She is a healer who ensures the party survives the most dangerous of circumstances. She can play as a pacifist, protecting the party as much as she can without killing, or she can be a mad doctor, using her medical knowledge to ensure every blow is deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
