			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a creepy little encounter that you can throw at your party as they travel through the woods. It is a simple encounter, but I think it will mess with some of your players. And there is a potential for a on-going NPC the players will have to contend with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are walking along a hunting trail when they find three men laying in the undergrowth. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious they were attacked, large gaping wounds in the shoulders and chest. One of the bodies has his head partially severed. Two of the men look to have been mercenaries, randomly pieced together armor and a tattoo under their right eye that signifies they were once criminals. The third slain is a woman dressed in peasant clothes. Her hands are tied behind her back and a gag in her mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
