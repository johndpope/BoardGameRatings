							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Days of Arhem</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Last Days of Arhem. This is an introductory scenario for the Swedish role-playing game Svavelvinter. It is meant to accompany the translation of the Quick-start Rules in order to give you a taste of the game. This scenario is character-driven, which is one of three game types (character-driven, hybrid and classic) presented in the rulebook. It provides an introduction to how the game is played with a focus on a character-driven play style. The scenario gives you the opportunity to play out a pivotal moment in Erik Granstr&amp;ouml;m's novel Svavelvinter, on which the game Svavelvinter is based. The scenario is set just before the suggested start date of regular Svavelvinter campaigns and scenarios. This is the eighth year of the common reckoning of the setting, which starts at the inauguration of a mechanical and chronometric masterpiece known as the 'Chronolaab'. The scenario has been simplified and streamlined so that it can be played with the quick-start rules only and without having to read the novels. Some rules have been simplified and left up to the Game Master and Players to adjudicate for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
