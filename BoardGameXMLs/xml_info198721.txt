							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crisis in Eastern Europe: Transnistrian Insurrection</name>
									
			<description>This is the Second game planned to come out for our Modern Crisis Line of games. In Transnistrian Insurrection up to four players can take on the roles of the commanders of either; Transnistria/Russia, Moldova/Romania, Belarus, or the Ukraine. They will be fighting for control of the old Soviet sphere of influence as the Moldova/Romania your main goal will be to take out the break away nation of Transnistria before the Russian Army can break through the Ukraine to help them. The game works in phases where each player will switch off and have good opportunities to counter attack and stand there ground when need be. The game also uses an interest damage chit pulling system to simulate the unexpected nature of modern combat. This is a deep war-game that can make you think about the real possibilities of a war like this in the very near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
