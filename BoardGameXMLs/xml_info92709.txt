			<description>Hitoya is a two player abstract card game where players take turns claiming and capturing tiles on a four by four grid. Each player gets a hand of character cards which represent key players in the &amp;quot;Amelio Tale.&amp;quot; These cards provide tiles and special power tokens for placement on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiles denote a number or symbol on each side. When a tile is first placed on the grid it automatically attacks all of its neighbors (if the number/symbol is greater on the attacking tile, the attack is successful). Some tiles are considered &amp;quot;scoring&amp;quot; and the majority of the game revolves around capturing and recapturing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only 15 spaces on the grid to lay tiles so games are typically fairly short (10-15 minutes). The first edition of the game includes four power types (Life, Death, Chaos, and Rotate) and twenty unique characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
