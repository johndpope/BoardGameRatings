			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old stories tell of the wizard Kelsun, better known as Kelsun the Mad Prophet, who was driven mad by visions of a world-shaking disaster. Fortunately, his madness proved to be benevolent&amp;mdash;he set out, in his odd way, to help ensure that items of power would be available to help rebuild civilization after the disaster. Unfortunately, his benevolent madness was&amp;hellip;madness. He created strange dungeons filled with exotic traps and monsters to guard these items. As most dungeon creators do, he left cryptic and even bizarre clues regarding the locations of his caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such clue was entrusted to an order of druids and, after centuries, they finally managed to locate the dungeon in question. However, as is always the case, they will call on the heroic adventurers to recover the item promised to them, a magical vine. In return, the brave survivors will be able to keep all the other treasures of the broken mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Mine is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure. It is intended for a party of 4th-6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the features of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Random encounters for the area.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed color maps for the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     Full statistics are included for all encounters&amp;mdash;no need to look up monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     Unusual traps.&lt;br/&gt;     Hero Lab support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
