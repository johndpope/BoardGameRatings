			<description>The game is based on the 1934 movie &amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot; with Hans Albers. At the beginning of the game, the players move around in the laboratory to find out, who plays &amp;quot;Ingeneur Holt&amp;quot;. The roles are previously determined by card drawing. If a pawn gets on a space, that is occupied by another pawn, this pawn has to reveal it's identity. When &amp;quot;Holt&amp;quot; is exposed, he sabotages the gold-making machine and the sliding doors begin to close. Now all players have to leave the laboratory before the doors are closed. The pawns that don't make it, die in the explosion and their players are expelled from the game. The rest have to move over the turntable and reach one of three escape tunnels. The first one to accomplish this wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
