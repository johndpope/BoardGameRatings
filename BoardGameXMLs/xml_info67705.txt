			<description>Translated from the Russian language instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Commander, the game which imitates the military activity of the early 19th century.  Each player will be a commander, determining the strategic and tactical goals of his troops and realizing them through combat with his opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game will acquaint you with the glorious countries in the patriotic war of 1812, and with the tactics, organization and uniforms of the European armies in 1812-1814.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before beginning, the players need to decide on their strategic goal.  For example:  defeat your opponent(s) through reducing his forces to irreplacable levels and seizing his fortified areas, depriving him of the chance to rebuild his forces; seizure or defense of the main citadel; occupying your opponent's territory, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
