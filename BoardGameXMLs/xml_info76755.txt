			<description>Munch Man is a video game exclusively made for the TI-99 computer. It is a game that is similar to Pac-Man in that the player must cover an entire maze while be chased by 4 enemies. However, instead of eating dots from the maze, the player must cover it all in a chain which is produced as the player moves around the maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 pellets per stage that the player can eat which will make the enemies vulnerable. Running into an enemy will defeat it, and send it back to its home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each stage, the 4 enemies change shape to become different things. There are 20 enemy variations in all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
