			<description>&amp;quot;So Goes The Hare&amp;quot; - Sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;There Goes The Hare&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to four rabbits (each represented by a different color marble)  are hunting in a field trying to capture Carrots, Lettuce and Dandelions.  Carrots are worth 3 points (Orange Marbles), Lettuce 2 points (Green Marbles) and Dandelions are worth 1 point (Yellow Marbles).  The rabbits come in their own unique colors.  Rabbits jump like a Knight in Chess and must land on an occupied field, and win the item there.  When no more mores can be made, the game ends and the points are totaled.  High score wins.  Although you can also win by being the last rabbit standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
