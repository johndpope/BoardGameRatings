			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant Souls is a secret-teams-based competitive narrative game. Each player takes on the role of a champion for his world, knowing that a parallel and similarly powered champion exists on the enemy side. Use your skills and synchronize with your teammates to gain the upper hand, then crush your opposition underfoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant Souls is not a traditional storytelling game. You will not act out your character's actions; you will not need to adhere to any in-game moral code or class restrictions; and you will not need to keep your out-of-game knowledge separate from your in-game knowledge. There are no stats, no calculations, and no complex sets of dice to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, you play as a group hunting down legendary artifacts of power, searching for the one artifact that will give you the leverage to help your world win. Conflict is quick and brutal, so pre-planning, information, and teamwork are critical to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
