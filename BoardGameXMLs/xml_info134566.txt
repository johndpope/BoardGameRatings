							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Run with the Pack</name>
									
			<description>Run with the Pack is a fast paced card game of survival. The game takes place over the course of a single night in the forest. Players start out as lone wolves and fight to have the largest pack by the time the sun comes up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Run with the Pack is to build your wolf pack and have the highest amount of wolves when the deck is exhausted. This is done by attracting wolves with Prey cards and gaining them into your pack by using Howl or Calls in the Night cards. You can also attack the other players&amp;rsquo; packs by using Intimidate cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
