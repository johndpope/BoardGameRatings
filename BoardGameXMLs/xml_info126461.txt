							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Islands of Yupang Gazetteer</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yupang is an island of pirates and powerful warriors that shares with the Shattered Empire a history of conflicts and mutual invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1000 years ago, a mighty half-dragon was given the secret of bronze weapons by a traveller from distant planes (apparently some shadow creature) and managed to subdue the other tribes on Yupang with his well-equipped army. After his victory over the fishermen and barbarian tribes, he granted his most loyal followers fiefs and set the foundation for the modern clan system. Hitomi, the dragon man, ruled as Emperor for over 250 years before traders from the Golden Empire made contact with his people. Soon it came to disagreements between the mercantile newcomers and the warlike natives who held the greedy little merchants in contempt. Little did the early samurai know of the military power behind those intruders and soon their lands were a client state of the Golden Empire. While this occupational period is the root for the mutual hatred between the two cultures, it was also a period of great cultural advancements, due to the introduction of an alphabet, improved administration, and arcane magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took the Yupangans 80 years to free themselves from the gaijin as they called them. However, no new Emperor was crowned and the clans lived in an uneasy alliance ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the fall of the Golden Empire, the different clans reacted differently. The Scorpion Clan took the opportunity to conquer the coastal area of the Shattered Empire with the help of their foul spirit master, the Wheel of Law. Other clans see this increase in power with suspicion and while they hold no love for the Shattered Empire, they are likely to take action soon to keep the Scorpions from amassing too much ritual magic for them to handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
