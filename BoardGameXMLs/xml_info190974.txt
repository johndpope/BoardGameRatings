							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Free-Form Players Handbook</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Players Handbook presents the full rules of the game, but it is not organized for inexperienced players.  Combat in the system is fairly complex with numerous options and special situations.  A spell system is provided.  Character equipment must be placed in &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot;.  Characters have Rank (essentially Levels) in their Class, as well as Race and Attributes.  The equipment lists provide everything from hand-to-hand weapons to high-tech weapons and armors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
