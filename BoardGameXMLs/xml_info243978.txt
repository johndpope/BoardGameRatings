You are in full control of your own future in your persuit of wealth, glory and power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was initially funded on Kickstarter. It is now possible to pre-order the game from the website, also with beta access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be played on online servers. Currently the estimate is up to 300 players per server. The gameworld will be an island apr. 200 square kilometers (or 77 square miles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
