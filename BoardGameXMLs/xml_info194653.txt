			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Republic P&amp;ndash;47 was by far the largest and heaviest single engine fighter built in the entire World War Two. Nicknamed &amp;ldquo;the Unbreakable&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the Jug,&amp;rdquo; it was a rugged and dependable airplane, capable of flying its pilot back from combat even when full of holes from enemy fire. Heavily armed with eight .50-caliber machine guns, and carrying an impressive bomb load, it was very effective as both a bomber escort and a ground attack aircraft. Refined during his development, the P&amp;ndash;47D was the most produced version, with 12,602 built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Republic P&amp;ndash;47D Thunderbolt (Mohrle)&lt;br/&gt;Flying in European skies, Lt.
