							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Elite Operative</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Espionage is usually the domain of specialists. Cryptographers to decipher coded messages, handlers to recruit and manage spies, and soldiers to carry out wetwork. However, some missions can't be completed by a large team of specialists. A single agent with a wide variety of skills can improvise as the situation demands it, a talent unheard of in the ranks of specialists. Elite operatives know how to adjust their plans quickly, easily shifting from one role to the next. An elite operative is just as comfortable in an intense gun battle with terrorists as mingling with the world's elite at a cocktail party. Their versatility makes invaluable to their parent agency but their tendency to ignore the rules ensures their rarity. This 6 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Haven: Full Metal Zero. Fans of James Bond or Marvel Comics' Nick Fury will love to use this character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
