			<description>This is a simple bowling game from the William Bruce Company. It features wooden dice that either have a blank face or a pin on them. You roll the dice and see what you have for pins remaining and then shoot for your spare. This game has similarities to other bowling type games from different companies and different publishing years.  Games like Spare Time Bowling, Bowling Dice, Bowl and Score, or Bowl - A - Strike are similar types games and their may be others already in the DB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
