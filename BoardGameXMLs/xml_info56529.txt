							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Music from a Darkened Room (Call of Cthulhu)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wherein the Agents learn some threats are more tangible than others&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Places, like people, sometimes go wrong. They turn off the path and head into the shadows; becoming something other than normal. Black places filled with blank rooms, closed doors and empty hallways lined with dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these places your voice catches in your throat, the air seems to hum and things happen. People get hurt, objects vanish. Bad feelings flow like the loose tap in the bathroom and hate hangs in the air like old paint. It smells of time and circumstance and something just a little beyond the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It smells like surrender&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1206 Spooner Avenue is a wrong place. In the last forty-six years of its history eighteen people have died there, and you can feel it. You walk in and it&amp;rsquo;s like dropping two hundred feet under water. It&amp;rsquo;s suddenly dark and cold and pressure filled; at least it is in your mind. Still; pretenses remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doors stay shut, and no one ever hears a child&amp;rsquo;s laughter at night. In the hours that stretch like taffy after two, no one ever hears music from a darkened room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Delta Green investigation for 1 to 4 Agents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
