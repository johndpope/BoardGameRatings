			<description>user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be a Dude! was offered in PDF as a &amp;quot;joke item&amp;quot; additional incentive in the Kickstarter campaign for the card game Romans Go Home!.  The instructions for the game are a bit tongue-in-cheek, but the game has been playtested, and is a functional minimalistic RPG.  It is also (therefore) diceless, unless one wants to enforce the &amp;quot;Advanced Rules&amp;quot; that state that disputed assertions by the guy (the GM) should be resolved by the GM rolling a die, staring intently at it for a moment, then telling the dudes (the players) what to do.  Certain snarky elements of the rules appear to be clear jabs at traditional RPG elements; however, the rules are perfectly usable as intended, for quick, filler (and perhaps drunken) roleplaying with brutal, arbitrary, and potentially hilarious results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer drew loose inspiration from Hit a Dude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
