			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Break out your best barnyard sounds for his raucous matching card game.  When you spot a match, shout out the animal sound, and grab the cards.  Collect them all and you win!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is pretty much the card game War played with animal pictures and noises.  The deck consists of four cards each of twelve different animals.  Each player turns up one card at a time, and if ever two matching animals come up, each player must make the correct animal noise first to claim the other player's stack.  A 'challenge' variation is included, wherein each player chooses an animal at the beginning of the game, so that when a match happens, the players must shout out the other player's animal noise instead of the animals in the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
