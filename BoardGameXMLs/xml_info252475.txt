							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yokai Hunters</name>
									
			<description>In Yokai Hunters, you use the five foundational Chinese elements (wood, water, earth, metal, and fire) to capture Yokai. Players take turns swapping tokens on a 5x5 grid in an attempt to match patterns of three available Yokai. Yokai have various point values based on the number of matching elements required to complete the pattern. Take care not to set up a capture for your opponent. However, you can also use the capture of a smaller Yokai to set up the capture of a more valuable one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Yokai is captured, a magical event occurs, with you perhaps turning the game board or flipping tokens to reveal voids or wilds. This is a puzzle-style game with a different twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three levels of Yokai cards are placed next to the game board, and when one of the decks has been depleted, the game ends. Whoever ends up with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
