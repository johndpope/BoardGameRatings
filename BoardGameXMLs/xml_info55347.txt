			<description>Title translates as: With Fire and Sword&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Danish commercial available RPG. According to the forewords it was inspired by D&amp;amp;D, RuneQuest, Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorceries, Wizard &amp;amp; Melee and Dragonquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation is very random: roll for race and sex, roll for relative height and weight, roll for exact height and weight, which determines your Life Points. Roll for 8 different attributes (Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Willpower, Health, Magical Ability, IQ and Speech), attributes are modified for race. Depending on the total amounts of attribute points the player is given bonus points to distribute as he sees fit. Roll for Looks. Strength, Agility and Dexterity is modified based on weight. Based on Health you get extra Life Points and Stamina Points. Based on Willpower you get extra Stamina Points. Based on Strength you modify your Life Points and Stamina Points. Strength also determines which weapons can be used, and damage from a club. After this you start training your character in the skills (weapons, magic and thievery) that you would like him to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no classes, or other restrictions on the type of skills, weapons and armour your can use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 different magical traditions, a few monsters but nothing else that could be called a background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--user description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
