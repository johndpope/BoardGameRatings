							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wiener Takes All</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the sausage festival! In Wiener Takes All, you are competing with each other to flirt with a handsome buffet line of vendors to get them to serve their wieners. Whoever scores the most inches of victory wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, you'll build a character by choosing 4 Traits. Then you'll take turns flirting with the guys. Your turn is divided into 3 parts: Peek, Pick, and Play. Peek at a face down card - you can peek at a Guy to see is he's easy to flirt with, or you can peek at a Wiener to see if it's worth it. Next, pick the Guy you're going to flirt with. It can be a different Guy than the one you peeked at. Finally, play by rolling the dice. If your roll is high enough, congratulations! You get the Wiener! Guys who like your character's Traits have easier rolls for you, so peek and pick carefully!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when there are no Wieners left to grab. Only your highest Wiener gets scored. All other Wieners are worth +1 inch regardless of their size. Whoever has the most total inches of victory wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
