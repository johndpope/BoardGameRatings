			<description>Product Description from Publisher's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muskets and Mohawks is the unit based game of the French and Indian Wars. Players take on the role of an officer commanding multiple units of men. Included in the rules are lists and options to play the Napoleonic Wars, the American Revolution, the War of 1812 as well as the Texas War of Independence. Here's more details.&lt;br/&gt;It's 1754 and there's news of the impending war between France and Great Britain. But that's in Europe and between Kings and there aren&amp;rsquo;t any Kings in North America. Life for both the French and British colonists is tough enough with trying to stabilize their respective frontiers and dealing with the local Indian tribes is a delicate balancing act. No, let the Kings fight amongst themselves across the pond. It's not my fight.&lt;br/&gt;Or at least it wasn't until today. Word has spread along the frontier of open conflict. The tribes are choosing sides and the militias mobilizing. Settlements are suffering brutal raids causing harsh retaliation in kind. The frontier's aflame with war! The Kings may not be here but their war is and while many sides can lose only one side will win. &lt;br/&gt;WHICH SIDE WILL YOU CHOOSE?&lt;br/&gt;In Muskets and Mohawks you can choose from two sides with a total of four factions. You can be:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    British Regulars &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    French Regulars &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    British Allied Indians &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    French Allied Indians &lt;br/&gt;Whichever you choose you must lead one or more units of men through the war, the French and Indian War, fighting when needed because it's all about victory and glory, and in some cases, just survival!&lt;br/&gt;The war drums are beating, the militias mustering, and now it's become your fight. Welcome to &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;MUSKETS &amp;amp; MOHAWKS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
