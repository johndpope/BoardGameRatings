							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PT Boats: Knights of the Sea</name>
									
			<description>The seas can be dangerous, but when you're in command of a crack strike boat crew, you might just be the most dangerous thing out there...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join up to the Russian, German or Allied navies and prove your worth out these on the open water. Control every aspect of your boat's defensive and offensive, from the anti-aircraft guns hobbling your enemy's air superiority to the torpedo strapped to the sides to sink destroyers of merchant vessels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining advanced strategic and action modes you can plan the intricacies of your attack and then lead your crew from the front and right in the battle. As you advance in rank throughout the long campaign you will gain access to new boats and even warships for you to command. Build up your crew in single player then go online and join your friends manning your own boat and challenge others in a battle to the death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Innovative combination of sim, strategy and tactical action.&lt;br/&gt;     Control the entire crew or take your place at an individual station.&lt;br/&gt;     DirectX 9 as well as DirectX 10 options.&lt;br/&gt;     Proprietary graphics engine, with advanced physics and post-processing effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
