							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Finegrader Game</name>
									
			<description>From the rules &amp;quot;The object of the game is to be the first contractor to complete the job and cross the finish line.  Just as in actual contracting situations, the quicker the job is completed, the better off you are.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed for marketing.  One player chooses the CMI Autograder-55 and the other players choose any of the 3 generic autograders.  Players take turns spinning a wheel to determine how many spaces they move.  Spaces can direct the player to lose a turn, go again, draw a card, etc.  Many cards tell the player to loose a turn but do not affect the player controlling the Autograder-55 and then describes why the superior technology of that machine makes it a better performer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
