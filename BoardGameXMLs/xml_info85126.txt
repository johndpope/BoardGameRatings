			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poltava&amp;rsquo;s Dread Day covers a conflict that lasted nearly a quarter of a century (1700-1722), with two turns plus an administrative phase each year. The Summer turn is when everyone gets to work. The Winter turn is where great commanders take huge risks. All movement is a variable, impacted by leader initiative and a die roll. Sometimes, the troops will move far and fast. Sometimes they won't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game provides a range of different foot and horse unit types which impact how well they fight, but is unusual in one area&amp;mdash;each unit is a single unit (strength of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;), with no numbers to clutter up the counter. With few exceptions, once lost, units are gone forever...making each battle and each risk of attrition something to consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poltava&amp;rsquo;s Dread Day provides a keen look into a decisive historical situation that few people know very much about. This period saw not only the founding of St. Petersburg but the birth of &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; Russia. It saw the rise of Prussia, and led to shifts in the balance of power that would have significant effects on the Seven Years War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the TPS, &amp;quot;Decisive Battles&amp;quot; series&lt;br/&gt;That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value. Poltava&amp;rsquo;s Dread Day features randomized elements for everything from reinforcements to diplomacy. No two games will play the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
