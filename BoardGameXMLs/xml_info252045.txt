							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheeky Monkeys</name>
									
			<description>A fun game of chance for all the family. There's no hanging about in this fast paced game, as players battle to collect and count the most bananas &amp;ndash; but watch out for other players trying to steal them! Players must make strategic decisions by choosing whether to play it safe after their first turn or spin the spinner to either collect or risk losing more bananas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children will enjoy hanging their monkeys onto the 3D tree, which adds another fun dimension to this exciting game. As well as teaching basic counting skills, Cheeky Monkeys encourages children to think strategically, interact with others and make decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
