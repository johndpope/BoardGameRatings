			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Y]ou're one of the ordinary people. The people that the superhumans are helping. The ones who supposedly aren't suffering anymore. Sure, food and goods are being rationed according to need, and travel is restricted. Sure, you do the job the new regime tells you to do. But you don't suffer. Or if you do, you disappear quietly into one of the detention centers. You might wind up there if you even think about suffering. Or if it looks like people aren't happy because there aren't enough necessities available where they are living, some of them are moved to a relocation center, and eventually to the land of their dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hope. But regardless of what you think, the trains of the new regime run all night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't feel like playing by the rules, there's always money to be made on the black market, if you don't get caught. Or maybe you could run to one of the rumored free zones, beyond the reach of the regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or you could join the resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
