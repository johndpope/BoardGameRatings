			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something evil bas been unleashed in the depths beneath Ravenor. Monsters filled the tunnels and chambers beneath the town, shambling out into the streets for a night of terror. By dint of combat, craft and cunning you and your stalwart band traversed the halls beneath the streets and now stand at the top of a damp, gloomy flight of stairs. Will you put an end to the evil that threatens Ravenor or will you perish as you push further into the Death Knell Delve?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Death Knell Delve Part II, the second half of the Death Knell Delve adventure and the fourth release in the Universal Adventures Adventure Module series, which began with Assault on the Underworld. Death Knell Delve Part II picks up where Death Knell Delve Part I left off. Packed with 108 cards, Death Knell Delve Part II is the largest Adventure Module to date and takes the characters further into the dungeons beneath Ravenor with all new areas to explore, new foes to battle and new treasures to find! There is so much adventure packed into this module you&amp;rsquo;ll want to play it multiple times just to uncover some of the possibilities. And if you want more, you can easily add cards from the original Universal Adventures Custom Encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, and playable solo or with a group, with or without a GM, Death Knell Delve Part II, brings you a fun and exciting adventure you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play again and again. To play the complete campaign to date you&amp;rsquo;ll also need Assault on the Underworld, Scourge of the Scurvlings and Death Knell Delve Part I. In addition, depending on how events unfold, or if you get creative, you can connect this adventure to DK1 Death Fog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Knell Delve Part II is a huge adventure and one you won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss. Gather your heroes, for glory and vengeance, and prepare to undertake the Death Knell Delve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
