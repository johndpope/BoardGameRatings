			<description>A connection-game played on the intersections of a checkered square grid.  The problem of deadlocks in connection games on square grid is resolved by letting each player diagonally connect across the squares which are that player's color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another interesting property of the game is that on a player's turn, the player plays two stones at a prescribed distance from each other, which leads to more tactical complications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, and complete rules, along with variations, see the author's webpage at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://home.fuse.net/swmeyers/trellis.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://home.fuse.net/swmeyers/trellis.htm&lt;/a&gt; and the game is available for play on Richard's pbem-server at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
