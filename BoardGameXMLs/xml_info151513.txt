			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A truly amazing version of the game of pool using full sound and colour graphics on your Spectrum to bring the action of the real game into your own home. Use your skill and judgement to play like the professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spectrum version, playable on both the 16K and 48K models, is a highly cut-down version of Pool. There are only six balls, three red and three blue. There is no black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shots are lined up by moving a target clockwise or anti-clockwise around the table. A key toggles between different strengths of shot, and another key executes the shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are substantially different from a normal game of Pool. The player receives three shots at the start of their break. If a ball is not sunk with three shots the player loses. A foul also results in the loss of a shot. In addition, the aim of the game is not just to sink the balls of your own colour, but rather all the balls. The balls score differently - 20 points for blue balls and 10 points for red.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amstrad version by contrast, despite being released with almost exactly the same packaging, is a substantially improved game. This is a full version of Pool, using normal rules with both 8-ball and 15-ball options. In addition to choosing direction and power in a similar way to the Spectrum version, this game also allows the players to apply spin before executing the shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
