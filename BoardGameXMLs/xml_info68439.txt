			<description>[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragster is a very short racing game in which the goal is to get from one side of the screen to the other as quickly as possible.  As in real drag racing, most races are over in just a few seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The joystick button is used as the accelerator, pushing left on the joystick engages the clutch, and letting the joystick return to center shifts to a higher gear.  Achieving fast times requires keeping the engine as highly revved as possible, while getting up to fourth gear quickly.  But let the engine rev to high, and the engine will blow out--which is extremely easy to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed and programmed by David Crane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From box front:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drop your Dragster into gear, stand on the gas (but don't blow your engine!), pop the clutch and GO!  Burn rubber!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From box back:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've ever dreamed about being a drag racer, wait 'til you buckle into your bid powerful Dragster and rev up the engine.  Brrrm, brrrm ... feel the engine rumble as the countdown clock ticks ... 3, 2, 1, GO!  It's you against the clock or another racer.  You push in the clutch, shift, rev up, shift, rev, shift, rev (don't forget the clutch!) and try NOT to blow your big engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragster will hypnotize you.  You'll practice for hours just to shave a hundredth of a second off your best time.  It's all the action, fun, and thrills you can ask for in a video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From the catalog:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drop your dragster into gear, stand on the gas, watch the countdown, pop the clutch and GO!  Your motor revs up (watch that red line or you'll blow your engine!), you shift quickly through the gears and burn rubber across the screen to beat the competition or run the video quarter-mile in record time.  You'll be hypnotized by Dragster by ACTIVISION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
