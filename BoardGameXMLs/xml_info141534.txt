			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A computer opponent that allows you to play Scrabble against your TRS-80. A copy of the Selchow &amp;amp; Righter board game is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual feature of this software was that the disk was designed to prevent any backup copies from being made (unlike its predecessor, Monty Plays Monopoly, which at least allowed a single backup copy to be made).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recent interview with MONTY revealed some important points you will want to know before accepting his challenge to the SCRABBLE Brand Crossword Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: MONTY, what have you been doing since your famous competition with the U.S. MONOPOLY champion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: I felt I needed to improve my vocabulary, so I've taken up SCRABBLE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: Have you made much progress?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: So far I've learned more than 54,000 words, and I was really surprised to discover how many words there are that I had never heard of before. My vocabulary now contains a veritable myriad of abstruse locutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: Amazing! I imagine you are hard to beat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: So I've been told. This is why I let people choose a SKILL LEVEL when they play with me. I play quickly at the lower levels, but it can take me several minutes to think of the best play at the top. It's only at the highest level that I use my full potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: Do you play according to the official rules?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: Indubitably. I'm just like any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: How does CHALLENGING work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: I always ask if there is any challenge at the end of each play. We will be playing according to the most recent rules regarding challenging. This means that if the challenged word is found to be a legal word, then the person challenging it loses his next turn. (By the way, don't be surprised if I challenge your word.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: How does the game end, MONTY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: The game will end automatically as soon as one of the players has used all of his tiles and no more are available. However, if no one, including me, can think of a play using the tiles he has left, just choose menu option 7 to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: Any closing words, MONTY?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M: I hope I have cogently elucidated the salient points of the game. I look forward to many enjoyable hours with fellow SCRABBLE enthusiasts all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
