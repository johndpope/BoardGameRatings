			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Emperor's Wedding, a deal was struck between the Republic of Altheria and the Elorii nation of Seremas. In exchange for a substantial supply of blast powder, the Seremasi agreed to provide reinforcements for the Shining Patrol. With the recent Malfelen incursions into Altherian territory, the Republic's borders are hard-pressed. Every attempt by the Shining Patrol to make peaceful contact with the Malfelen has failed utterly. Seremas and Malfea have long had a cordial (if not warm) relationship, so an Elorii emissary has been sent from Seremas to carry a message to his brothers. You are asked to serve as escorts on this vital mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This adventure occurs at the same (in-game) time as LA-SP5-08: Xenophobia. Therefore, players should not play the same character in both adventures. The order in which the two adventures are played does not matter. This adventure draws on material that was first presented in LA-AP4-01: Queen's Castle. Play of the prior adventure is helpful, but not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STANDARD adventure is designed for 1st to 10th level characters (APLs 2-9).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
