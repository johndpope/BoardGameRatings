							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inspector McClue: The Red Rose Murders</name>
									
			<description>Murder mystery dinner party game.&lt;br/&gt;In the dog-eat-dog world of 1950s Hollywood there's only room for one top-dog - and he's the cigar-chomping agent to the stars, Rich Toad. So when he's found dead in suspicious circumstances, floating face-down in the swimming pool of his mansion, surrounded by a hundred scattered red roses, the whole film world is shocked to its core. There's no business like show business, they say, but when it comes to murder, a suspect is just a suspect. And one, or more, of Rick Toad's illustrious clients is about to get fingered for killing the most powerful man in entertainment. Your task is to discover who that killer is. Fortunately the famous Inspector McClue is on hand to assist your investigations.&lt;br/&gt;The guests are: MARILYN MANSFIELD - The blonde bombshell whose flamboyant life both on-and-off-screen has delighted the gossip columnists for years.&lt;br/&gt;ROCK HOUSTON - rugged, rough and rowdy, Houston was the biggest male star of them all, the ultimate in American masculinity; now he's going into politics and talking about running for the presidency.&lt;br/&gt;MARLON MEAN - The most famous teenager in the world. Mean is actually 27-years-old now, but he's still making a career out of screen rebellion.&lt;br/&gt;PRINCESS KELLY OF RURITANIA - before her marriage to the Crown Prince, the most eligible bachelor in Europe, Princess Kelly was simple Kelly Kennedy, the sophisticated star of romantic comedies.&lt;br/&gt;MADAME VELDA - clairvoyant to the stars, she has been a familiar figure in Hollywood circles for many years, predicting the future with surprising accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;WAYNE FONDA - also known as the Hillbilly Hero, Fonda is a rock and roll singer who might just cut it in the movies.&lt;br/&gt;MAE VEST - author, actress and activist, Miss Vest is seldom seen without a devoted young man on her arm, a glass of champagne in her hand, and a quip on her lips.&lt;br/&gt;SALVADOR DILLY-DALLY - Europe's most famous surrealist artist has come to Hollywood to work in the movies, and to make his fortune.&lt;br/&gt;The game includes invitations: simply choose which of your friends play which devious suspect and invite them to come along as that character. Also included are menu suggestions, recipes and of course, a really tasty murder to solve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
