							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drug Wars: A Game Based on the New York Drug Market</name>
									
			<description>Drugwars is a turn-based strategy computer game in which the player assumes the role of a drug dealer engaged in arbitrage. The object of the game is to deal the most drugs to pay off the &amp;quot;loan shark&amp;quot; (who charges interest) by the end of the game and make a profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drugwars was originally a DOS program created by John E. Dell in 1984.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the game is that the player is a drug dealer living in New York City. The player travels around the various parts such as Manhattan, The Bronx, and Brooklyn. The player also buys and sells various drugs such as Cocaine, Heroin, Acid, Weed, Speed, and Ludes. Traveling from one part of the city to another takes one day. The point of the game is to make the most amount of money in the given time of 30 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player begins with $2,000, 100 spaces in his/her trenchcoat, and no weapons. A player must deal with loan sharks who are useful because they provide the much needed initial capital investment, but charge a high interest rate and must be paid back quickly or the player loses the game. During the course of the game, the player can buy a gun or extra pocket space by randomly being offered those things during travel. In each part of the city, the player checks the prices, buys and sells drugs, and then travels to another part of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other components include the police who are embodied in the character of Officer Hardass. During the game, Hardass will randomly confront the player. The player has four choices: to get arrested, to run, to fight, or to keep dealing. Any choice risks injury to the player and after 10 shots the player dies and thus loses the game. In order to fight the police, the player must have a gun. If the player can kill Hardass and his deputies, a cash award will be earned. Random occurrences also occur during the game such as muggings, drug sales, increased drug prices, and the finding of drugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 30 days, the game ends. The final score is calculated by taking the players current amount of cash and multiplying it by two. The number of millions of dollars a player has is his/her score out of a 100. For example, a player who finishes with $25,000,000 will have a final score of 50/100. If a player reaches $50,000,000, the maximum score of 100/100 will be attained and the player will have beaten the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Drugwars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
