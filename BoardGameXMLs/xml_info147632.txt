			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;This source-book is a collection of material, adapted from the Thundarr the Barbarian cartoon, for use with Mutant Future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the designer's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many readers of my blog have written to me, asking me to create a Thundarr the Barbarian supplement for Mutant Future. I obviously cannot (and will not) create anything &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; due to the copyrights and trademarks involved. However, as my gift to my blog&amp;rsquo;s readers and to the many fans of the show, I created this document&amp;mdash;a simple compilation of all Thundarr Thursday posts that have appeared on The Savage AfterWorld in the past year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gathered within is a cornucopia of Thundarr-related Mutant Future material including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Three new PC character classes!&lt;br/&gt;     Eight nefarious NPCs!&lt;br/&gt;     Eleven new devices!&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty-nine (!) new creatures!&lt;br/&gt;     And four adventures based on classic episodes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hoped that you will enjoy reading this collection of blog posts and&amp;mdash;perhaps&amp;mdash;working some Thundarr-inspired adventure into your Mutant Future campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
