							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon of the Selenian Conclave</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep underground, an orc-infested dungeon is revealed to be an abandoned sorcerous laboratory, the turf of powerful ancient wizards and their secret research...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There, the Selenian Conclave labored on how to extend their reach to a place most remote indeed, for their aim was the Moon itself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon of the Selenian Conclave is an oldschool adventure module for the 1981 edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous fantasy roleplaying game, meant for a party of 4-6 characters of levels 1st-2nd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon of the Selenian Conclave is designed to be compatible with most campaign settings and most rulesets that follow in that edition&amp;rsquo;s footsteps. It is also easily adaptable to most other fantasy roleplaying systems, and is an OSR Compatible product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a classic, location-based adventure module: an underground refuge, used by a band of orcish raiders, but concealing deeper secrets: it was once the secret base of a reclusive conclave of wizards, and most of the complex - as well as the fruit of their researches - is locked behind magical seals and trapped doors. The module includes an art handout for players and a map of both levels of the dungeon, and is provided in a printer-friendly format to allow printing in folio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
