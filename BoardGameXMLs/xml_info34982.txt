			<description>11 sets of 4 cards each have to be played to gain as many points as possible by making up various scoring combinations.&lt;br/&gt;This can be done by:&lt;br/&gt;- making up the total of &amp;quot;12&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- playing cards of the same number&lt;br/&gt;- playing runs and/or sequences&lt;br/&gt;- playing the Baden Powell card&lt;br/&gt;- being the last player in the round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends after several rounds until a player has a total score of 30 points.&lt;br/&gt;One of the most demanding games of the Pepys series regarding the rules, and very special because 11 can play without using a second deck of cards !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational aspect of the Scouting theme is accompanied by extensive description of the subjects of the cards on the last pages of the rules booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual with this publisher printing quality and graphic artwork is outstanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
