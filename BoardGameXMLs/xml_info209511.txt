							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atlanta Is Ours</name>
									
			<description>Atlanta Is Ours is the next game in the award-winning Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series. The two maps included are painted by original map artist Charlie Kibler. The military unit counters have been redesigned by Charlie Kibler to harken back to the counters in the original games in the series but with a more modern graphical treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlanta Is Ours contains an updated version of the GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that all the other games in the series use. The Advanced Game rules are also standardized so players will be able to move quickly from one campaign to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlanta Is Ours includes fourteen Basic Game scenarios and five Advanced Game campaigns, all extensively playtested:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Game Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Opportunity of a Lifetime (Snake Creek Gap/Resaca (5/9/1864, 1 turn, small forces): Beginner&amp;rsquo;s scenario, great for learning how to play.&lt;br/&gt;    The Gap Is Blocked (5/8-5/10/1864, 3 turns): Hypothetical scenario, what could have happened if Sherman had not sent McPherson to Snake Creek Gap and instead attacked or tried to outflank other points in the Confederate defenses.&lt;br/&gt;    Battle of Resaca (5/14/1864; 1 turn): Sherman's entire army reinforces McPherson's corps outside Resaca, and attacks Johnston's army in Resaca, which has just arrived from its positions around Dalton.&lt;br/&gt;    From the Oostanaula to the Etowah (5/17-5/23/1864, 7 turns): Sweeping maneuver from one river to the other, with the aborted battle of Cassville near the end of the scenario.
