							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corsica</name>
									
			<description>Corsica is a fan-designed strategic board game for 4 players based on Lewis E. Pulsipher's Britannia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a typical game of Corsica, during 16 game rounds players will take command of the different nations that invaded and partially or fully controlled the island between 556 b.C., when the Ancient Greeks first settled the spot of Aleria, and 1796 a.D., when the island definitelly fell under French control. Therefore, nations available in Corsica include the autochthonous Corsican Ancient tribes (3 each player), Greeks, Carthagenese, Etrurians, Romans, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Byzantines, Sarracenes, Lombards, Franks, Aragonese, Vatican State, Pisan, Tuscan, Genoese, modern Corse people (2 different factions), Ottoman, English and French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, Corsica comes with and expansion that adds the II World War conflict to the original game, and a 17th game round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasions take place at the beginning of each game round, and the goal for each player will be to first invade the island  and then try to hold control of it fighting  the new invaders as long as possible, while trying to accomplish his own nation's objetives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While trying to stick as much as possible to the original game of Britannia, this new version has undergone some minor and major changes in order to addapt the gameplay and game feeling to this new Mediterranean context:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical game round of Corsica consists of the following phases: The invasion phase (in which the new invaders attack and settle the island), the diplomacy phase (in which nations can seal up to 4 pacts for the current game round), the internal struggle phase (in which all nations settled on Corsica fight each other), and during punctuation game rounds the punctuation phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavalry has been removed from the game, as Corsican geography makes it useless, but fleets and sea combat have been enabled, as historically the control of the waters around Corsica has been of great influence. Other concepts like roads, fortifications or watchtowers have been added, and as the island is much smaller than Britannia, movement (both land and sea) has been eased, maybe resulting in a more dynamic game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corsica is well known  to European tourists for the beauty and quietness of its coasts and inlands. But what visitors may not know, is that on the same beaches where they do bath today, blood-thirsty, fierce warriors of all nations around the Mediterranean Sea have been landing during centuries with an only idea on their minds: taking full control of the island!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be welcome to Corsica: a game that portraits the history of a 1500 years long conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
