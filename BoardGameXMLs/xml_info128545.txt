							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadowrun Supplemental (Issue 9 - 1998)</name>
									
			<description>From the Editors Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to issue #9 of The Shadowrun Supplemental! Yes, it's been a long road from issue #8, and the delays have been annoying, probably more so to me than to you. I truly did not enjoy having what I consider one of my greatest achievements online and being updated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were a couple big reasons for this delay. The major one was the server move - we're now located at a new host and I firmly intend to stay at this host until hell freezes over. The second one was my new job - not a white collar job like some expect, but a good old fashioned dirty job inside and outside of a sugar processing plant. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer employed there (Laid off, not fired..), so things are returning to normal now. Unfortunately, I was working 12 hour days for most of the last couple months, which gave me almost no time to do anything online besides retrieve my email and chat a bit on IRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking of email - do not use my old email address anymore. The email address that you must use if you wish me to read it is the new one. If you sent email to my old address and did not receive a response, please re-send it as it may have got lost in the abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of the Compiled Shadowrun Supplemental has been decided. I'll be releasing it sometime after issue #10 arrives, and it will combine issues #1-#9, update them for SR3 mechanics, add some new items that fit in with the old themes, and remove outdated articles, or articles which got mostly negative responses. It will be a series of files separated into categories, such as Rules, Races, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, web-surfers will note that this is the first issue of The Shadowrun Supplemental released in HTML format as well as Word and Adobe Portable Document Format. While I still recommend the latter two formats for printing, the HTML version allows you to read it online and make a decision if you want to download the whole magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
