			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs have emerged from a forgotten dungeon buried deep in an ancient forest. Low on resources and needing somewhere to rest, they head toward the nearest elven settlement. Once they&amp;rsquo;ve rested and sorted their loot, the inevitably ask &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s for sale in this place, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At that point, likely or not, the game grinds to a halt as the GM frantically generates what items are available for purchase or he simply says &amp;ldquo;anything up to the gp cap.&amp;rdquo; (After all, most GMs have better things to do with their prep time than generate what the PCs might want to buy on the off chance they visit an elven town).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s For Sale, Anyway? IV banishes these problems by providing 107 pre-generated, ready-to-use lists for the busy GM to immediately use in his campaign. Also included are sample elven settlements to serve as a handy backdrop to the sales. Buyers should be beware, however, for among the hundreds of magic items for sale lurk 48 cursed objects...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;about the PDF&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
