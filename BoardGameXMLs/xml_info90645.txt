			<description>Simple roll-and move game with same weird twists. The pawns represent air fighters. At first they have to pick up weapons (there are circles on the board where they have to go around till they step on the appropriate square), then go and eliminate the targets. If you miss the target squares, you have to start again. If you step on some specific squares, your plane is destroyed - yes, it is a roll-and-move game with player elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
