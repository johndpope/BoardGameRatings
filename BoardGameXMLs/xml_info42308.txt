			<description>A cooperative educational game with a very ecological background. The players have do discover 5 cards of toxic waste before they are rusted through. The rusting progress is simulated on a rust-o-meter by 50 grommets and after each round one six sided die is rolled and that number is removed. If all are removed before the last barrel of waste is uncovered the players have lost.&lt;br/&gt;The gaming area is set up by mixing all brown cards face down including the five toxic cards and forming a 5x6 pattern. On these the yellow action cards are placed face down as well and finally all green landscape are placed on top face up. The game uses a currency of power beans of which each player gets one six sided dies worth each round. These are used to remove landscape cards 10 for a small card and 20 for a big card and players are allowed to pool power beans. If an action card is unearthed it is turned and the required action is read. This action then needs to be executed in order to remove the yellow card to gain access to the lowest layer of brown cards. Once the brown cards are accessible they may be turned without additional cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
