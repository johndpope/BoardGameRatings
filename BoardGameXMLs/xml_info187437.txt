			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SeeD 2 is an evolution from SeeD, not a 2nd Edition.  Instead of being completely modular, the Seed 2 implementation seeks standardization of rules which are designed for emulation of video games.  In almost all respects, it is a more traditional generic, universal system than SeeD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SeeD 2, characters have six Attributes (Attack, Magic, Will, Vitality, Stamina, and Luck.  Each Attribute is given a 6 during character creation and the player distributes into them 12 more points by fiat, to a maximum score of 10.  Hit Points and Movement Points are then derived by formula.  Characters begin play with one weapon and one armor.  Characters select a Class (from a list of 12), but Class is much less structured than defined in the SeeD Class module.  Characters may select Skills from a Class list; most Skills have special actions associated with them.  The combat system offers various maneuvers during a round, including Attack.  SeeD 2 utilizes a standard D100 roll against a target &amp;quot;Chance of Success&amp;quot; that is determined based on difficulty and modifiers.  Players attempt to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; the target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
