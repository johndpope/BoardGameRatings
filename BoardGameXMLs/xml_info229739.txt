							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kipoud: La pioche ou la raison</name>
									
			<description>Kipoud is a card drafting game in which you try to build the biggest, most valuable house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kipoud, you will have 2 stack of cards, one with &amp;quot;construction&amp;quot; cards and the other with &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; cards. There are two ways to start the game, in fast version each player will have a &amp;quot;foundation&amp;quot; card, and in normal version players start empty handed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, the active player will first roll a six-sided die. On a 6, he loses his turn. On a 1, a 3, a 4 or a 5, he has the choice between drawing 1 &amp;quot;construction&amp;quot; card or 2 &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; cards. On a 2, he performs the action &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; twice. Then, if he can, if he wants, he can play cards from his hand. The goal is to build the houses of the &amp;quot;Moigeux&amp;quot;, small creatures who think only of their material goods and who never cease to build ever bigger or always more ... To build, we will have to make combinations. For example, to build a roof, you will need the &amp;quot;roof&amp;quot; card and a &amp;quot;green wood&amp;quot; card + &amp;quot;brown wood&amp;quot; card. You discard the raw material and place your roof in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are action cards that let you interact with other players or defend yourself against action cards from other players. &lt;br/&gt;Once your turn is over, you must not have more than 10 cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do I win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the &amp;quot;Construction&amp;quot; stack is empty, the game ends. The points in the top right corner on the &amp;quot;Construction&amp;quot; cards are counted and the one with the most points is declared &amp;quot;Grand Vainqueur&amp;quot; or Winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
