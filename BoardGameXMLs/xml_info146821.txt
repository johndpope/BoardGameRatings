			<description>Ap-Bingo is a bingo game with ape theme. The game plays as most bingo games, but also having some twists. Each player has a bingo card, and the chips is mixed in the box. The chips can have picture of four different kind: ape, banana, gorilla poo, and a shovel. The goal is to get five apes in a row or column. The columns have different colors that must match (red, yellow, blue, green, purple), the rows most have one colour of each kind. The game plays around the table, each player drawing a chip from the box. When a ape is drawn it is placed on the bingo card. If you get a Banana you can take a ape from another players bingo card. Gorilla poo is placed on another players bingo card to block. The only way to get rid of the poo is to draw a shovel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
