							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hashtag the Game</name>
									
			<description>Hashtag is an interactive storytelling game for small to medium groups. It&amp;rsquo;s great for an icebreaker or as a way to get to know your friends and family better. Everyone has their favorite stories to tell, but some stories have been buried over years of neglect. It&amp;rsquo;s time to dust off those old pages and share &amp;lsquo;em. A set of Ninja throwing stars you got for Christmas when you were 12? An excursion into the snowy wastelands in a beat up old car? Tell your stories and other players will interact by hashtagging your story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns telling stories based on prompts as the rest of the players lay down hashtag cards that are relevant to the story. At the end of each story, players receive 2 follower tokens for each hashtag card they played, while the storyteller receives 1 follower token for every hashtag the other players laid during the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
