							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Men Under Fire</name>
									
			<description>Men Under Fire is a one-to-one scale game, using individually-mounted figures, vehicles, and heavy weapons. It is a tactical game, not a skirmish game. Players control as much as a full company of troops on the table, and maneuver squads and platoons as units. The game uses D6-based fast-playing rules, while still capturing the command challenges of keeping a squad or platoon moving forward under enemy fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Complete rules, easy to read, with extensive diagrams, and design notes spread throughout the text which explain the reasoning behind the rules and give historical examples.&lt;br/&gt;    The Just Another Mission system for generating historical forces for balanced one-on-one battle games.&lt;br/&gt;    Unit organizations for the US Army, US Marine Corps, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union throughout World War II.&lt;br/&gt;    Complete equipment lists for all of the above armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
