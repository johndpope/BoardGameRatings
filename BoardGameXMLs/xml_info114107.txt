			<description>The Where the Wild Things Are Game brings Max and the wild things to life in the beautifully detailed characters and wonderfully illustrated dimensional game board. Children get to imagine they are Max, travelling to the forest and becoming king of the wild things as they roll their dice and draw cards that help or hinder their journey. Once they reach the top of the hill and get their scepter they race to be the first Max home to win! Love the book, now live the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
