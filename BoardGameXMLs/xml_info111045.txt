			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 3rd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The late Sir Walter Wainwright the First was owner and founder of Wainwright Pharmaceuticals, a British company providing new and innovative pharmaceutical products. His death led to a lack of direction within the company&amp;rsquo;s ranks, and threatened bankruptcy unless the Board of Directors could locate a legitimate heir to the magnate&amp;rsquo;s fortune. Then an investor discovered an estranged son, Walter Wainwright II, who was institutionalized as a boy after poisoning his high school chemistry class. The heir&amp;rsquo;s therapists believed he suffered from severe delusions and sociopathic behavior, and had all but locked him up and thrown away the key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board of Directors arranged for the heir&amp;rsquo;s release, planning to use him as a pawn, a figurehead who could lead the company into a new golden age of investor-controlled profit. But Walter Wainwright&amp;rsquo;s progeny took charge of his new position, leading the company in an entirely unexpected direction. Fascinated by war, he ordered the secret development of a variety of chemical weapons for eventual sale to the military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
