			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The StapleWars board game is a game which combines action games, which involve moving parts (along the lines of Mousetrap or Weapons of War) and strategy games, which involve building and conquering, (like Risk or Axis and Allies) in one. All units and structures are made out of HEAVY DUTY staples, which can be found at any hardware store. Staplewars plays like a strategy game... until it is time to attack. Ammunition staples are flicked at units and structures, and if the units or structures are knocked down, they are destroyed! The purpose of this page is to encourage people to play this exciting game, to give people instructions for their own StapleWars arenas and sets, and to clarify information about this exciting new game. Give it a try, it is a lot of fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
