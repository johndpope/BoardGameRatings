							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Safety Belt Game</name>
									
			<description>Published by the U.S. Department of Transportation to promote the use of seat belts.  Each player rolls a die and moves along a track.  the first player to get the amusement park wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some spaces are marked with hazards that cause the loss of a turn.  Other spaces cause the player to get out the car.  When movement resumes, a Safety Belt card must be drawn.  If the player forgets to do this, a turn is lost.  There are two exits, which if landed on, can shorten the trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game for children who don't mind being preached to while playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
