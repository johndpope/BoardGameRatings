			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better than the Rest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrigue is a staple of the fantasy genre, and many players and GMs are drawn to the idea of a grand campaign of political intrigue, in which the players face the dangers of scheming politicians, backstabbing assassins, high-society soirees, and similar trials, instead of the usual drudging through moldy old dungeons, killing things and taking their stuff. A proper political drama or heist adventure can be hard to run and even harder to write, but perhaps the hardest is for players to get in the appropriate mindset, and deal with their problems with finesse, rather than a blunt weapon. One thing that can help players get in the mood&amp;mdash;and get themselves an edge&amp;mdash;when it comes to intrigue is having an archetype that kits their preferred class out a bit more for the type of adventure they&amp;rsquo;ll be playing. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of Intrigue presents six new archetypes tied to a particular role common in intrigue adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this book, we focus on archetypes of gentry and nobility. No matter the setting, even in those without an official nobility or aristocracy, the rich and the powerful always set themselves apart, always delight the lesser folk with their extravagant balls and sordid soirees, and usually, they are the ones whose plots and schemes are what sets plots of intrigue in motion. Each of the archetypes in this book focus on the ability to manipulate and influence others, social and physical grace that set aristocrats apart from others, and the power of wealth. This book includes the following archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The royal bloodline, a bloodrager bloodline for scions of royal lineages, granting the bloodrager a natural grace and a commanding presence.&lt;br/&gt;    The order of the coin, a cavalier order exclusive to the cr&amp;egrave;me de la cr&amp;egrave;me, who is at home in verbal duels as those of steel, and draws strength directly from his wealth.&lt;br/&gt;    The doge spirit, a medium spirit that is the epitome of social grace and cunning manipulations, granting the power to influence and outmaneuver foes.&lt;br/&gt;    The communication discipline, for psychics, which allows them to empathically read the hearts of others, and gain greater power over charmed creatures.&lt;br/&gt;    The genteel explorer, a ranger archetype with a passion for safari, whose tales of adventure are the life of any party.&lt;br/&gt;    The grace spirit, a shaman spirit that bestows social grace and charm upon those who commune with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
