			<description>From the Forward:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E. Gary Gygax wrote the beloved G-series of modules back in the mid to late '70s. The first two installments ran only 8 pages each (the last being a whopping 16) and all came with maps on the inside of the folder-cover. It is easy to refer to them as beloved since, from the moment of their original printing till now it is safe to say that no other module or series has so ingrained itself into the fabric of the fantasy role playing community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for use with the First Edition Game rules, and should not consider anything from the UA manual or any errata that has appeared since. The party of adventurers should range from 5 to 9 in size and from levels 8 to 12. Dwarves and paladins should be included within the group, with at least one cleric, magic-user and thief along as well. Whether a paladin is used or not the general bent of the group should be Lawful and Good. The DM should deny any evil race or class from being used. The DM should make a list of pre-rolled characters in case the players do not have any of the appropriate levels; one or more of these may also be used as henchman to strengthen a small group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
