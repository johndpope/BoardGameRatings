			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This game requires a ball. It is essentially a simulation of playing as a dog, in which participants all want to play with the ball. The players sit round in a circle, with the ball initially in the middle and within reach of everyone.&lt;br/&gt;Players can only make one of three canine sounds, indicating pleasure, anger, or loneliness, but must always attempt to play with the ball. When in possession of the ball, players may only use one hand to play with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
