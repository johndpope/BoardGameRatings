			<description>Discover the Bible game is two games in one to teach you about the bible: a chronological overview of the bible with 60 key character cards throughout the bible, which can be a card game by itself. The Board game can be played with two to six players with the aim of visiting twelve significant periods of time (&amp;quot;Eras&amp;quot;), as described in the bible. While travelling from Era to Era players can land on bible characters and collect their card if no one else has already landed on it. The aim of the game is to be first to collect as many Era tokens (worth 20 points) and character cards (worth 10 points) and finish on the &amp;quot;Second Coming&amp;quot; and have the most points overall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character cards are a helpful tool to get to know some details about certain Bible characters. Some of the characters are examples to us in regard to what qualities a godly person ought to show in the Faith, Obedience, Love, Suffering, Wisdom, and Leadership. The aim of the card game is the learn more about how to be godly in your own character: to have more faith in what God has planned for your life; what it means to be obedient; to show love for each other and love for God above all else; to count it a privilege to suffer for doing what is right; to make wise decisions based on the character of Jesus Christ as found in the Bible; and to be a godly leader who is an example and deals justly with others, who upholds the teaching and example of Jesus, the Servant King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discuss and debate the ratings that each character has been given and look up the references to find out more about each character. Each card also gives more information about the name meaning and where you can read more about them in the Bible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
