			<description>Teams of 2 or more compete to reach the end of the track on the game board. Each turn, one team member rolls a die to determine which of the 4 categories they will attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oodle Doodles is simple drawing; &lt;br/&gt;Model Madness involves modelling with clay provided in the box; &lt;br/&gt;Paper Mash-Ups has the player folding and tearing paper; &lt;br/&gt;Scribble Riddles requires drawing a phrase, saying or something from popular culture (a song, film or famous person).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player draws a card from the category that they rolled, and chooses one line from the card. A timer is started, and the other players have to guess what is being drawn or modelled. In some cases, the player is allowed to act and move with the object they are modelling. If the team guess correctly, a miniature representing a marker pen is moved on to the next space of that colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some board spaces have special features. &amp;quot;All Play&amp;quot; means all teams are allowed to guess instead of just the team whose turn it currently is (and move on the board if they guess correctly). &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; means the team moves back by one space if they do not guess correctly. And a &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; means the team has twice the amount of time to guess (the sand timer is turned twice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a team must complete two separate challenges (with two separate rolls of the dice) within the normal time limit, a single turn of the sand timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
