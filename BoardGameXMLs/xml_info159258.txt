							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Player&#039;s Guide: The Colonies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows over Vathak: Colonies - Player's Guide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Shadows over Vathak, a realm where the abominations known as the Old Ones seek to destroy humanity. It is a world of darkness and despair, where even the light of the One True God is often corrupted and twisted to serve sinister ends. As players, you may be heroes representing a bright point of light in the encroaching shadows of evil or you might just be survivors, living day by day however you can, survival your only goal. In Vathak, even joy is mingled with the bitter ashes of despair and hopelessness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you have here are additional player options to augment the material presented in the Shadows over Vathak Campaign Guide. New feats, spells, traits, and more are detailed in the pages of this book, tied to one of the specific regions of Vathak. That is not to say that just because your character hails from elsewhere or you are campaigning in a different part of Vathak, that you cannot use the material in this book. While the material here in is based on a specific region, it is also designed to fit the overall themes of Shadows over Vathak as a whole. As always, check with your GM before using any of the options in this book to make sure they are comfortable with it and it fits the flavor of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
