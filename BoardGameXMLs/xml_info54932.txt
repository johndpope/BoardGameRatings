			<description>Swimming pools can be very dangerous. You have been hired as a lifeguard. Each shift, the kids line up to get in and swim. As more children enter the pool, it is your duty to assign them safe areas to swim. If a child is paired up with a swim buddy, parents tend to reward you for taking care of their kids. When an area of the pool gets too full, kids get bored and leave. If there are a lot of kids playing in your area, you are considered to be a good lifeguard. If you help enough kids you will gain favor with the Boss. It is always good when the boss likes you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the part of lifeguards assigning buddies to the children entering the pool. They will choose the best area of the pool to guard, hoping the children will be happiest there. The Boss will reward the lifeguard who has the best reputation, allowing the lifeguards to rank up. If ranking to a level 5, that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
