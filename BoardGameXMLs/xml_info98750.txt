							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Fives</name>
									
			<description>A variant of games where you need to build a line of pieces to win. In this game you must be first to create a line of five pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 20 discs in his own colour. Players alternate to place pieces on to the board. The game ends when any one player has a winning line. However, if no-one has a winning line after all 40 pieces are on the board, players must move one of their own pieces one square. If no-one wins after five such moves, it is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are circular discs with a vacant centre and a winning player scores as many points as printed on the board, which can easily be seen throught the middle of the piece. Scores are pegged on a sort of cribbage board.&lt;br/&gt;Essentially a 2-player game, the rules suggests variants for more players, one of which is a Five Drive. This goes back to the fashion for Whist Drives, i.e. a number of tables playing side-by-side, maybe in a village hall or similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
