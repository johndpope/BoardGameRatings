			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes is a SNAFU type game in which the player is a 'snake' that travels about the level trying to complete an objective while also trying to stay alive.  The tails of each snake will destroy an incoming snake, and can be made longer or shorter depending on the powerups and score of the player.&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of game modes in Heroes, including a Death Match that forces the players to fight to the death, a Kill'em All match where players try to run over the other player's lemmings while avoiding their own, a Time Ca$h mode for collecting money, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
