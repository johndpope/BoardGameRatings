They are the warm climate cousins of the northern tundra yeti. They have large eyes, a pronounced brow ridge, and a large, low-set forehead; the top of the head is rounded and crested. Sasquatch are commonly reported to have a strong, unpleasant smell by those who have encountered it. The enormous footprints are as large as 24 inches long and 8 inches wide.
