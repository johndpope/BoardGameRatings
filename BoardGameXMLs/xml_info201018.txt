			<description>Buccaneer&amp;rsquo;s Bounty is a piratey wargame for kids. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to introduce the fun of playing games with models, dice and lollipop sticks(!) to children as young as 4 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do I get it?&lt;br/&gt;The full rules and print-to-play PDFs are available for free at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.farfaraway.org/blog/buccaneers-bounty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.farfaraway.org/blog/buccaneers-bounty/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do I need to play?&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve never played wargames before all you need is a copy of the rules, some ordinary size-sided dice and access to a printer to print out the quick start paper &amp;lsquo;models&amp;rsquo;, treasure and lollipop sticks. You can replace these with counters and real lollipop sticks when budget allows! If you have a collection of models and some terrain already you can dive right in with those.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any pirate models&amp;hellip; is that a problem?&lt;br/&gt;Not at all. There are 'print and play' models included. Buccaneer&amp;rsquo;s Bounty has rules for using other common model types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How long does a game take?&lt;br/&gt;About 20 minutes, even with 4 players. I wanted the game to play quickly with each player taking short turns, so no one is left waiting for long to act. The scenarios are quick to set up, so if you want to play another game it&amp;rsquo;ll only take a minute to get going again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
