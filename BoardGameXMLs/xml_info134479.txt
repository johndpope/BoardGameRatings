			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your entrance music hits. &amp;quot;Now making his way to the ring, accompanied by Lazarus...at 350 lbs, the Doctor of Paaaaaaaain!&amp;quot; Boos and catcalls from the crowd. Some of the older fans are cheering. Lazarus, your Manager for the last 5 years, yells something at you that you can't hear as you step over the top rope into the ring. This is it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your entrance music hits. &amp;quot;Now making his way to the ring, at 225 lbs, the Master of Many Faces...Mimic!&amp;quot; Some cheers, a couple of guys have signs. You pump your arms up and down, take a running dive into the ring, come up into your signature pose. This is it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is it. This is the last match for one of these wrestlers. The Doctor of Pain has been around for a long time. The older fans have a soft spot for him, but he&amp;rsquo;s starting to hit that age where he just can&amp;rsquo;t physically perform like he used too. His challenger, Mimic, is a young guy who just started with this big televised promotion &amp;ndash; but since his tag team dissolved, he&amp;rsquo;s not getting over like they thought, and the rumor mill says that he&amp;rsquo;s on the block to not have his contract renewed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a standard live televised show. These two guys don&amp;rsquo;t have any big rivalry, no feud, no driving storyline. This match is in between two huge title belt matches. Obviously, they&amp;rsquo;re going to do their best no matter what, their job is to entertain. But, this is going to be somebody&amp;rsquo;s last match. And everybody knows who's out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
