							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elizabethan Adventures: Gamemaster&#039;s Book</name>
									
			<description>The Gamemaster's Book is coloured throughout with historical details but it is not tied to any specific genre. It can be used to explore serious themes on race, religion and gender, or it can be used for tales of gothic horror, or romantic swashbuckling high fantasy - whatever suits your gaming group. This is a warped historical fantasy where the metaphysical and superstitious beliefs of the Elizabethans have the potential to be true. Evil is real. Witchcraft has its role as does the power of faith. Europe is in the grip of a religious war that sometimes degenerates into fiery hysteria. The Gamemaster's book is structured like a Renaissance cabinet of curiosities, emphasising small curios of history rather than filling it with dull essays. Within it is everything needed to form ideas for adventure stories. Social estates are described, as are the various religions (including witchcraft) and adventure locations worldwide from the kingdoms of Europe to the furthest reaches of the Spanish Empire. It also includes full prices for anything an adventurer may wish to buy, a bestiary and a chapter on ships and sailing (including full naval combat rules and ship stats). It also includes an introductory adventure and a twenty page gazetteer of London with coloured maps and 256 detailed adventure locations. Perhaps witches conspire for the downfall of society and devils wage war in corporeal form? Some say that there is a fountain of youth in the New World, or that a great iron mountain exists at the Pole. Perhaps there may still be an earthly paradise. The scope for fantasy is unlimited. 122 pages. Fully illustrated in colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
