			<description>Jai Alai is based on the fastest sport in the world!&lt;br/&gt;Jai Alai (aka Cesta Punta) is a sport with origins in the Basque Country, where the ball reaches speeds of up to 300kms per hour (180mph) and injure or even kill a player.&lt;br/&gt;Now you can bring the excitement of this amazing sport to your living room, without having to risk your life doing it too! It includes all the small details that make this sport so amazing, such as the ancient traditional team selection, two-wall shots, and even jumping off the wall in order to reach a high ball.&lt;br/&gt;It is played on a accurate small-scale replica of a cancha/fronton (Jai Alai court) with a grid.&lt;br/&gt;During each turn the player rolls a special &amp;quot;DosDados&amp;quot; roll to move, catches the ball, selects the distance and rolls another &amp;quot;DosDados&amp;quot; to determine the total and finally chooses the direction of the ball.&lt;br/&gt;It is a fast-paced game with plenty strategy and excitement. The objective of the game is similar to that of tennis. For example; if your opponent does not reach the ball before the second bounce, it will be a point in your favour.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with two teams of two pelotaris (Jai Alai players) and can be played with 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
