							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Military Cemetery</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the gentle slopes of the local hills endless rows upon rows of simple grave markers separated by gravel paths in the valleys between the hills make up this military cemetery. The grave markers, simple marble obelisks with equally simple marble name plates at their feet are shaded by oak trees standing in neat rows. The cemetery is large enough that, even accounting for visitors, burial services and the caretakers, one can easily find  some peace and quiet without being disturbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To some this cemetery is a symbol of heroism while to others it is a symbol of foolish national pride. To the families of those buried here it more often than not this is a place to say their last good byes to their loved departed ones ,a place to find solace and at least a small measure of solace. In some moonless nights this place serves entirely different purposes though. Purposes the caretakers would probably not approve of. After all a remote place without witnesses, streetlights or bystanders is a precious commodity in the world of spies and intelligence agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
