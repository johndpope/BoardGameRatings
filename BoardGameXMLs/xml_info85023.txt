			<description>Grossbeeren 20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oudinot vs. Bernadotte, 21-23 August, 1813&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleonic 20 #11 (Germany 20 #3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a seven week truce ended in August of 1813, the Sixth Coalition that was trying to stop the French awaited Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s next move, and that move would be a drive on Berlin led by Marshal Oudinot. Right from the outset, however, the campaign was beset by bad weather, slowing the advance against the Allied forces led by the famously cautious and canny Prince John of Sweden (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte and Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s brother-in-law).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many &amp;ldquo;what ifs?&amp;rdquo; are explored in this game, as so much of war&amp;rsquo;s friction occurred during this campaign. Grossbeeren 20 features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &amp;lsquo;story-driven&amp;rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &amp;ldquo;friction of war&amp;rdquo; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 4.5 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One 8-page, color instructions booklet, with Standard and Optional rules included&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One sheet of Exclusive rules.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 32 color, die-cut 5/8&amp;rdquo; mounted game pieces&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 12 random event cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; One 11&amp;rdquo; x 17&amp;rdquo; color game map&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Two color player aid sheets&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Polybag packaging and component storage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
