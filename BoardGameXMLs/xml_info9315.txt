			<description>Sub-title:&amp;quot;The East Prussian Campaign 1914&amp;quot;. The Imperial German Army's successful opening battles of encirclement and destruction of the Imperial Russian 2nd Army at the opening of World War 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include a Ziploc baggie, a 17&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot; paper map sheet, 2-page rules folder, die-cut thin paper counters, and a paper sheet with the Combat Results Table/Terrain Effects Chart/Turn Record Track/Reinforcements Schedule. Players must provide their own die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map sheet is mostly tan with blue national territory lettering, forest and water features and brown for all other terrain including single &amp;amp; double rail lines, towns/cities, borders, fieldworks, detached and ring forts, and place names. Counters are white with green print (Russians) and green with white print (Germans) and represent Brigade/Divisional level Combat units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules folder has a listing of abbreviations. On the back page are the victory conditions, addenda, design notes and scenarios including some optional set-ups. Additional options include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A.Stronger German 8th Army; &lt;br/&gt;B.Stronger Russian 2nd Army; &lt;br/&gt;C.Better Russian Mobilization; &lt;br/&gt;D.Better Russian Cavalry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game runs from August 17th, 1914 through September 15th, 1914 and each turn represents 1 day while each hex is considered to be 3 miles across from side to side. The playing area covers East Prussian Germany down to north Russian Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Russian moves first and the Sequence of Play is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.Supply Judgement phase; &lt;br/&gt;2.Movement phase; &lt;br/&gt;3.Combat phase,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;followed by the German Player's turn. There are Special Rules for Cavalry, Landsturm, Fortifications &amp;amp; Fieldworks, and Hidden (inverted) units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very concise and easy to learn game as is most of the company's products while being one of the first produced by them to have die-cut counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
