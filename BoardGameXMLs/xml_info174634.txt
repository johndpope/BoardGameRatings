							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beauty and the Beast</name>
									
			<description>A mob of angry villagers, led by Gaston, has decided to invade the forbidding castle in order to kill the Beast.  Belle saddles Phillipe and sets out to save the Beast.  However, you must help her to get to him before the last petal of the Enchanted Rose falls, or the Beast will never become a prince again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published as part of Disney's Giant Board Game Book, Beauty and the Beast is a roll-and-move game where players take the part of Belle, rushing to save the Beast.  Each player in turn presses the &amp;quot;electronic die&amp;quot; and moves the indicated number of spaces along the track.  Each player also has a marker on the rose board, indicating petals falling from the enchanted rose.  As they move along the track, they will land on spaces that may move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  Landing on another player's marker moves a player back 2 spaces.  Players landing on spaces marked with a rose must move their marker one space forward on the rose board.  The first player to reach space 42 by exact roll without their rose board marker reaching the end of the rose board rescues the beast and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
