			<description>Defend the walls of your Dojo from invading Pirates that want to steal the ancient artifact of great power you protect.  Play one of six ninjas all with their own special abilities and work together to prevent the fall of the dojo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a worker placement tower defense co-operative game where the Ninjas take turns fighting off wave after wave of Pirates until they have defeated four of six Pirate Captains. Build and upgrade walls to slow down their advance because if they enter the Dojo they will start damaging the Ninjas instead of just the walls and turrets. You can always use bombs and ballistas but you only have have a limited number to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each end phase the Pirate ships will attack with their cannons and send in reinforcements.  The location of that attack and the direction and number of new pirates is randomly selected by three small decks of cards that will be reshuffled every time a captain is found.  The difficulty of the game can be changed by adding or subtracting to the Pirate number deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
