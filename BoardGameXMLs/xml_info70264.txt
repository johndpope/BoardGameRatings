			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The pigs have made a mess of Shaun's photo album. The players help Shaun gather up his pictures as fast as possible, so that the farmer doesn't find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;60 playing cards are spread randomly face down over the table. Every card's front has one of four sheep pictured and a background in one of four colours. Players pick up and look at cards as fast as possible (no turns) and then either return them to the table or place them on their pile. The game ends when there are no cards left to pick up. Players score points for the longest sequence in their pile where no two adjacent cards share either the picture or the background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
