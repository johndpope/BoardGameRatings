			<description>Independent mercenary hacker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear pack of corporate hyenas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had it with you. After seven years of working for your greedy-ass corporation, I&amp;rsquo;m through! You&amp;rsquo;ve raked in millions off my code done for the peanuts you paid me. No extras ever, constant all-nighters, and interminable meetings that went nowhere. Add sexist jokes by both male and female directors for good measure. I&amp;rsquo;ve hit my head on the glass ceiling one too many times! It was me who built up the backbone of the protection system, it was my work that served as the basis for every product for three whole years. It was me who sniffed out and prevented dozens of illegal entries to our network. And what do I have to show for it? Employee of the month prize. A weekend at a spa. Those morons at the Human Resources are out of their frigging minds. As is that dumbass, my boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ll take what you&amp;rsquo;ve denied me all these years. Courses, upgrades, latest tech weren&amp;rsquo;t for me. I figure you&amp;rsquo;ve already found out about the budget database break-in and the large sum that&amp;rsquo;s evaporated from the representation fund. Yes, that was me. I did design the system, after all. I&amp;rsquo;m no thief, I&amp;rsquo;m just claiming what&amp;rsquo;s rightfully mine. Don&amp;rsquo;t go out looking for me. The full cyberbody I ordered is waiting for me. Finally, an end to this organic crap I was trapped in. There&amp;rsquo;s no way you can find me. But if you were to try, let me just say that half a year back I set up microcams in recreational rooms for managers on floor 27. Fun stuff. A tasty scoop for a couple infochannels, for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hereby terminate my contract with immediate effect. Bite me!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sylvia Alvarez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sylvia Alvarez&amp;rsquo;s contract &amp;ldquo;termination&amp;rdquo;, found during investigation into the sex scandal at the Vello Mekanik Corporation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
