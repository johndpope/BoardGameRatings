							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moebius MacGuffins #1: The Gift</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MacGuffins are those items or bits of story that serve to trigger different parts of the plot into action. What would The Maltese Falcon be without that classic figurine of a black bird? Or Raiders of the Lost Ark be without the Ark of the Covenant? What would The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings be without the One Ring?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though they&amp;rsquo;re used all the time in films, television, and books, we sometimes use them in our roleplaying game campaigns as well. This series of products aims to provide some ideas on how to randomly generate plot ideas based around simple objects so our players and PCs can sink their teeth into them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea for Moebius MacGuffins: The Gift sprung from a topic explored in the RPG Blog Carnival hosted by the World Builder Blog in December 2015 (Homebrew Holiday Gifts) and rapidly took on a life of its own. This product collects the articles I wrote on the topic and expands on them, including ideas for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Potential Adventure Seeds&lt;br/&gt;    Generating Simple Gift Ideas to Explore&lt;br/&gt;    Sending &amp;quot;Special&amp;quot; Gifts from Enemies of the PCs&lt;br/&gt;    and &amp;quot;What's in the Box?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get some random tables to help generate ideas as well as some ideas to ponder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most Moebius Adventures products, the MacGuffins series will be system- and genre-neutral, offering ideas for multiple genres including fantasy, the Wild West, science fiction, and even modern worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
