							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snog Marry Shove</name>
									
			<description>An adult board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of impossible choices and hilarious results. 3 famous names; 3 hard choices. Who to Snog. Who to Marry. Who to Shove. Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, Enrique Iglesias, Antonio Banderas, Ricky Martin. Decisions, decisions! It's hard enough trying to decide what you'd do, let alone guess what everyone else is thinking. there are hot seat question cards for you to make up your own choices - family, friends, work mates, ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends, or, if you're really daring, your fellow players! The winner is the first to get to the finish (and is still talking to their partner!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
