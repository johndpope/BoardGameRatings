			<description>You always suspected that they were psycho, now it is time to prove it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In All my Friends are Psycho you become the psychologist and use original designed Rorschach cards to find out just how demented and gross your friends really are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rorschach card deck is set in the middle face down. Flip the same number of cards that you have players, face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without touching the cards, each player chooses an image to analyze keeping their interpretation a secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The psychologist picks up the cards and one by one asks each player what they saw. The psychologist has to match the player's interpretation with the correct card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the psychologist guesses correctly, both the player and psychologist gets 1 sanity point. If not, they score 1 psycho point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns being the psychologist. After this the sanity and psycho points are added up. The player that has the closest number of sanity and psycho points (balances out) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 27 Rorschach cards and requires a genuine, original (neither genuine nor original) pad and pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
