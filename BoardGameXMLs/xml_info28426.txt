			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For the last 72 years, cycle tourists from all over the world have covered the PARIS-BREST-PARIS cross country cycle ride, 1200 Km to be run in less than 90 hours, passing through forests, towns and villages of 9 Districts.  This is what the organizers of this exceptional meeting offer you: the opportunity to participate in the official PARIS-BREST-PARIS-Randonneur board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the player who achieves the best time in completing the PARIS-BREST-PARIS circuit, a journey consisting of some 1200 Km (750 miles). The player is expected to avoid the many pitfalls of the route, to arrive at control points within the required time, to achieve a good average time, to not waste time at controls points and to persevere despite the sometimes adverse weather conditions and other hazards which will get in their way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second objective of the game is to see which players can get all of their team past the finish line in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two sequences: 1) The practice Lap at St. Quentin-en-Yvelines, 2) The Paris-Brest-Paris-Randonneur.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
