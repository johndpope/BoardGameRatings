			<description>Roleplay tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s family today. Think in the future everyone will still be living in traditional husband and wife and two kid families? Think again. A revolution in family models is taking place, so get with the curve. Remember, today&amp;rsquo;s weird is tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player group will play out all the usual family dramas- attending PTA meetings, having arguments over TV watching, computer use, homework and whose turn it is to do the washing up etc.- but with a twist: at that PTA meeting will be not just Bob and his husband Jim, but also Jim&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife Diana, who still lives with Jim and Bob in the brave new family of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
