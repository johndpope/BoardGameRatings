			<description>1920's Gangster 35mm skirmish gang wars with co-op story missions too. Create your mob choosing from 5 different types each with their own stats and skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 25 miniatures allowing you to create gangs based on your play style. Do you want a even mix or are you the assassin type or perhaps the gunner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tommy, the 20's gangster with two Tommy Guns for cleaning a room straight out. .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foxy, the 20's assassin babe with a double barreled shotgun and silenced pistol for up close and personnel damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henry, the WW1 Veteran, an expert marksman and excellent at ranged revolver shooting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xiao Hu, the Triad Chinese assassin. furious in close combat with his double Tomahawks or rain down with his Mauser automatic pistol and grenade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bobby, the seasoned beat cop. Tough and brutal with his baton and revolver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a gang and start on opposite sides of the board.  Each unit has 3 actions which include moving, shooting and close combat taking in which ever way the player chooses so choose to move once and shoot twice if you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've finished moving and fighting, it's the other players turn. Use cover and stealth to your advantage.  The player chooses which direction his units face so to turn and fight someone behind you would cost 1 action to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choosing the direction your units face is crucial as you don't want Xiao Hu or Foxy sneaking up of you. Don't get caught without cover when Tommy or Henry's around and don't get trapped with your back against the wall when Bobby charges you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board map if split into boxes. Movement and shooting are on each characters profile telling you how many box distance they can move and shoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a D12 (12 sided dice). The D12 makes shooting and close combat much more fun with more choice to the roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have unique skills and powers which they can use. Powers are special attacks like expert shooting but a cool down is needed after each use. Example using a power may require a 4 turn cool down before you can use that same power again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several powers are available. Some powers include&lt;br/&gt;Kill box for Henry - Henry automatically fires his marksman rifle during the enemy players turn when a enemy unit has crossed his line of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kung Fury for Xiao Hu - Xiao Hu attacks everyone in close combat within the same box but with less damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cat Attack for Foxy - Foxy's cat attacks causing a distraction allowing Foxy to sneak up and shoot the enemy with extra accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the standard game simply wack the enemy gang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other missions types available. Examples are Cops and Robbers. The cops out number you and are hunting you down. Can you escape alive?  And Turf wars which is hold and secure territories. The team with the most turf wins after a certain amount of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-Op story missions are available too.  Depending on which character you choose the story will be different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra characters are also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Butch - the face smashing bare knuckle boxer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maggie - the female tom boy machinegun gangster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McGowan - the anti gang shotgun wielding cop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;James - the Highland claymore wielding Scotsman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chibs - the sneaky wee back stabbing gangster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
