			<description>From the rulebook Designer's note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The original version of SC3600 was developed and published by Mariner Games back in 1997. The original launch was accompanied by a small range of miniatures developed by Brigade Models. However the original designers, Patrick Doyle, Mike Tastsides and Doug Glover were serving members of the US armed forces and as such had more pressing demands on their time than playing games, so development of the rules understandably stalled.&lt;br/&gt;[...] We've avoided unnecessary changes to the core rules, being content to tinker around the edges with minor changes to the design system and the inclusion of a hex-less movement system. Our main goal has been to streamline the rules a little without drastically altering the flavour. Probably the one major change has been to do away with the 12-point movement system that allowed movement along hex edges - we abandoned this in our own games very early on. We've also removed the distinction between the Basic and Advanced versions of the game in favour of a single unified set of rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses miniatures of starfighters, it is played on a hex map but a set of rules to use hexless maps is also included. The main dice roll used is the 2d6 roll, this is modified by another kinf of dice (ranging from a d4 to a d12) based on the pilot skill. These dice rolls are used to resolve fights and control rolls when your fighter is going spinning around due to damages or wrong manouvers. The damage system is very interesting, being it not the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; set of boxes that have to be crossed out but a system that takes in account a series of debilitating damages that during the game, imposing each a number of malus and penalties, can render your fighter inoperative or totally destroyed. Statistics for the official fighter models are in the end of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are introductory free rules, Brigade Models is going to publish in a near future more complete rules (this time you are going to buy them) that will also include campaign games rules, pilots' skill progression and others more convoluted situations not presented here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
