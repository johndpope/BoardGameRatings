			<description>Houdini! celebrates what many deem  the Golden Age of Magic, the first few decades of the 20th century. The game is named for the most famous - but not necessarily the &amp;ldquo;greatest&amp;rdquo; -  &amp;ldquo;magician&amp;rdquo; of all time, Houdini (n&amp;eacute;e Ehrich Weiss).  In the game, each player is a historically famous magician rated for his skill, strength and luck, all used when trying to make a name and fortune for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win the game by amassing the most Victory Points. Players gain Victory Points for Fame and Wealth, and they gain those by playing Cards that enable them to perform Escapes and Illusions, announce/answer Challenges, gain ownership of theaters, and survive the demands and dangers of doing all of this. Each &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; will require differing levels of skill, and many will sap the stamina and strength of the Magician. Performance of tricks earns Money and Fame. The winner is the player with the most Fame and Money at game&amp;rsquo;s end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
