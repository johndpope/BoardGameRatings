							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King of Legends</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Tales are rising like a wind blown down from the mountains carrying the smell of Dragons awakening from Ages past. Rumors are spinning like dead leaves in a graveyard leaving a trail back to tombs opening after a thousand years. Sailors' yarns are rigging a thousand phantom ships sailing from beyond the world to invade the Kingdom of Roland. The magic of legends is that they define truth, but truth they are not. They are the legacy of those who control their lives rather than letting fear and rumor control them. Are you one of those who would dare to defy Death? Would you dare to seek the very heart of myths? Would you dare to seek the King of Legends?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
