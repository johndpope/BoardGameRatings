			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dragon&amp;rsquo;s peak is a really strange place. A single mountain peak overlooks a very small hamlet. The peak is almost hollow since it hosts a numerous goblin tribe and an ancient black dragon. How could the hamlet of Dragon Foot survive is a mystery. The hamlet&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants fear the dragon but they keep him quiet by dragging cattle at the sacrificial altar just before the peak. In return, the hamlet is a very quiet place: the villagers are not bothered by goblins, nor by the dragon himself and all the raiders and marauders do not dare to approach Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Peak, fearing the dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Usually, a dragon would not be satisfied from cattle, but, due to some strange reason, this one does. Someone whispers that the ancient wyrm is searching for something hidden under the peak. For sure, goblins, subjugated to the dragon, dig and mine the belly of the peak. What they are searching for is left to discover to the next group of brave adventurers who dare to adventure in Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product details the peak, including the mines, the goblins' dwelling, the dragon lair, a map of Dragon's Peak and Dragon's Foot and a cross section of the mountain.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
