			<description>A game of parrrlimentary procedure on the high seas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a mutiny, pirates aboard the good ship Due Process have struck on a more egalitarian way to divvy up treasure. Without a captain, players rely on their wits, political savvy, and a talking parrot to collect the most loot before the end of the voyage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players traverse the board performing sailing actions, which add loot to the game's treasure chest. When they reckon there's sufficient booty, one of the players calls for a parley to divide the loot. Players take turns secretly reaching into the chest to take a hidden share of loot. Once all the treasure is divided, pirates vote on whether to keep their hidden shares, or return the loot to the chest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gain the support of the crew, it's important to be fair. Just...not too fair. Will you take what you deserve? Or maybe a little extra? Can you trust the pirates who reached in before you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DemocraSea is a great way to try your hand at politics, just be sure you know a reliable hook merchant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
