			<description>This is a car racing game with a variable track built out of 24 course tiles. The tiles have different designs and some of them have some special spaces printed on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race starts just with the start tile on the table. Each turn, a player has the option to either add a tile to the course or throw a die to move his car. If a die roll cannot be used totally, the car does not move at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last tile has been put on the table, the cars must continue the race back to the start tile. The first arriving there, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
