							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Before Richmond: Beaver Dam Creek</name>
									
			<description>Beaver Dam Creek is the fourth game in the Blood Before Richmond series, but the first battle chronologically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first major engagement of the Seven Days set the precedent for the fighting that would follow. You have a small contingent of Union soldiers occupying a strong defensive position; Lee's plan calls for multiple divisions to coordinate their assaults so as to outflank and destroy the enemy; one or two divisions do all the fighting, abandoning the plan and settling for costly frontal assaults. At least this time, Stonewall Jackson shows up - sort of, anyway: having just marched from the Valley with orders to attack the Union rear, he hears the fighting and promptly sets up camp instead, because of course he does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth game in our series goes back to the beginning. Though this battle has relatively few special rules, it's very challenging. It's much harder for the johnnies to activate more than a single division at a time, while the yankees find their line stretched precariously thin...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
