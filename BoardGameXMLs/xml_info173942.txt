			<description>In Virtual Empire, players try to create a business empire and amass a fortune by moving along a track, collecting various cards that represent ideas, assets and business developments, collecting income along the way. Spaces or cards may send you to court or help or hinder the development of your business. In order to finish the game, players must collect one each of nine different types of cards and land on the Empire Money Chest at the end of the track. Players get bonus money for finishing before other players.  At the end of the game, the player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
