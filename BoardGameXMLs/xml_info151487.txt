							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darwin&#039;s Children: The Ravinoti</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the fifth issue of Going Postal, a series of supplements for the Mutant Future role-playing game by Goblinoid Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue covers a new race called the Ravinoti.  These bipedal man sized ravens are the ninjas of the post-apocalyptic world.  Living in small family enclaves ruled by an elder, these creatures hire themselves out as spies, assassins, and couriers to anyone that can afford their fees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes both the monster stat block as well as the player character description including new mutations and an example Ravinoti lair, all for only 99 cents.  The PDF has been set up with individual layers for page backgrounds which can be turned off for ease of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
