			<description>Abstract strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glass board, 3 metal circular pawns:&lt;br/&gt;Blue = player A&lt;br/&gt;Yellow = player B&lt;br/&gt;Black = base&lt;br/&gt;The colour on these pieces is only marked on a quarter of the circular top of the playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to touch the common black base piece with their own piece by sliding and turning their piece on a 5x5 grid (excluding the corners) from a set starting position to win the match.&lt;br/&gt;Players either slide orthagonal along the dots or turn their piece 90 degrees in their turn.&lt;br/&gt;Touching has to be done between the coloured parts of your playing piece and the common base (hence the importance of turning).&lt;br/&gt;An extra turn can be earned by ending your move on one of the four open dots on the board.&lt;br/&gt;Jumping over other pieces is not allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
