							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords of Twilight</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;War evokes many powers and awakens many heroes, and fulfills many prophecies. Sometimes, like the wind, war creates itself and then destroys itself. Such is the legend of the Swords of Twilight and their Champion, the Master of the Wind. Centuries ago, these fabled blades were carried by heroes from all lands, who were destined to fight until only one remained. That Sword has now been taken by the Fallen King, whose power grows like a rising storm every day, challenging all others of power to contest him or await their doom. It is this challenge which has awakened the Swords of old, along with their new heroes who shall carry them into battle as Champions of a new Age. Gathered together by the spirits of long dead Sages and honored with bearing the Swords of Twilight, can the party find the Tower of the Wind and fell its Immortal master? Along the way, as the storm gathers strength, their foes of greater and greater power shall only temper the swords that are their souls, sharpening them like blades indeed, until in the end they will make the Master invulnerable, or defeat one said to be invincible. Which shall it be?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
