							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conan: The Roleplaying Game (First Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover of the first-edition hardback:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Know, O prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars Nemedia, Ophir, Brythunia, Hyperborea, Zamora with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted mystery, Zingara with its chivalry, Koth that bordered on the pastoral lands of Shem, Stygia with its shadow-guarded tombs, Hyrkania whose riders wore steel and silk and gold. But the proudest kingdom of the world was Aquilonia, reigning supreme in the dreaming west. Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandaled feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torn from the pages of Howard's original vision, Conan The Roleplaying Game is a faithful realisation of the vivid world of the Cimmerian barbarian, allowing you to follow in his footsteps and create adventures, scoundrels and fell sorcerers of the Hyborian age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring everything you need to explore the lands of Hyboria, including a complete system of character creation and advancement, combat and sorcery, Conan The Roleplaying Game fully details the world of Conan, from the unknown islands west of Zingara to the semi-legendary kingdoms beyond the deserts and steppes of eastern Shem, from the frozen lands of the Aesir and Vanir to the lush jungles of Kush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Conan stands before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare you Enter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the Hyborian Age. The civilised kingdoms at the heart of the world make war on one another with massed ranks of mercenaries while idle nobles chatter and gossip in the courts of Aquilonia and Nemedia. In the north the barbarians of Asgard, Vanaheim and Cimmeria make war on anyone close enough to raid and in the west the Picts savagely reject the encroachment of settlers into their primeval forests. Pirates infest both the open ocean in the south and the inland Vilayet sea, earning the ire of Stygian sorcerer-priests and Turanian horse lords alike. This world of expansive plains, steaming jungles, ancient tombs and otherworldly horrors gives no quarter - you must wrest your destiny from it with the strength of your limbs and the edge of your sword!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conan RPG allows players to take the on the roles of characters from this rich and vivid world, whether Hyborians or any of the other myriad races who people the tales of Conan. As Howard&amp;rsquo;s hero did, they can learn the skills of the thief, the mercenary soldier, the desert nomad and other roles on their way to greatness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
