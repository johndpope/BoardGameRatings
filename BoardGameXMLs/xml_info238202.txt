							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Tanuki</name>
									
			<description>Tanuki are small, racoon-like sprits. They are playful by nature, if a bit mischievous. They tend to know a handful of magical tricks of debatable usefulness, such as the ability to immediately switch location with a nearby teapot (and only a teapot).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tanuki have an intense (some would say unreasonable) love of alcohol, but they are too impatient to brew it themselves. They usually attempt to steal their booze from unaware, but if pressed, they can easily conjure up a magical (though, tragically, non-alcoholic) elixir that is highly sought after by non-Tanuki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was this love of alcohol that led to Tanuki first arriving in Malifaux: a group of them had hidden within a shipment of sake the Ten Thunders were shipping through the Second breach. When the crate was opened, the drunken Tanuki scattered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After initially considering Tanuki to be nothing more than pests, the Brewmaster reluctantly established a relationship with the little creatures. They make for excellent spies... provided that he only gives them their promised moonshine after the assignment is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing three 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high-quality Plastic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Tanuki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Tanuki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
