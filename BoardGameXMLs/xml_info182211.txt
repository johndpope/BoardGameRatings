			<description>This game is about a King that wants to build a new castle and the players are the builders competing for the job.&lt;br/&gt;The two Guilds in the game have a dislike for each other , the one being the Merchants Guild and the other the Thieves Guild.&lt;br/&gt;From the merchants guild you can get the building blocks, to build a castle wall, so the King can inspect your works and see if he likes your work to give you the job of building the his castle. The Thieves guild also wants to take the job with their own builders (so later on can have control over the castle) but the Merchants guild refuses to give any request forms for building blocks. So the players can have special action through the game from the Thieves, and while the Thieves are getting paid, with Blocks from the players, they get to build their part of the Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a Midweight euro game with hand management while the players get to compete my bidding and majority controlling, managing the resources they get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
