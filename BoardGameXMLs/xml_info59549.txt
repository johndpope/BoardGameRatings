			<description>German football game. The game consists of 60 cards with photos of Bundesliga players (season 1978/79). Each player places 13 player cards on the board (2 replacements). Then a scoring sheet is consulted which gives the gradings that the players received after each match day in the season of 78/79. Card by card the players compare the gradings; the better one scores a goal. Whoever scores most goals is the winner of the match; repeat for further matches or even a season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is extremely random; other than choosing the team it is mostly bookkeeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
