			<description>Snyxtrap is a game which uses the Larklamp Magic Lantern Game System. The game and system were designed by P.D. Warne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snyx are mischievous faerie from the ethereal realm of the Shadowfay, and one has gotten loose inside your home! Maneuvering on a board cast entirely of shadow and light, you play your hand of magical lures and traps against the other snyx hunters to be the first to capture the pesky snyx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a hand of 5 cards, from which they'll play 3 each turn. The cards control the movement of the Snyx or the shape of the game board. The board is comprised of light and shadows made from the Larklamp, and by sliding the panels on the lantern, the board can be modified. The Snyx is moved according to the cards played each round. The more cards you match in the 3 cards you play, the more likely that that respective card will resolve. The goal of the game is to maneuver the Snyx to a specific location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
