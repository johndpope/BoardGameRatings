							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Funky Party Games: Blind Paint</name>
									
			<description>A party game that involves blindfolded drawing and guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played in two teams. One player has to wear a blindfold so that he/she can't see what he/she is drawing. The other team members have to guess the words/phrases that are being drawn. There are easy tasks (a simple word, such as &amp;quot;house&amp;quot;) and difficult ones (sometimes whole proverbs like &amp;quot;People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.&amp;quot;). Difficult tasks are worth more points than the easy ones. The team with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 pencil&lt;br/&gt;- 1 sand timer&lt;br/&gt;- 1 notepad&lt;br/&gt;- 1 blindfold&lt;br/&gt;- 50 cards&lt;br/&gt;- instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
