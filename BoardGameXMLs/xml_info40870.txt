							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Have A Word</name>
									
			<description>A simple letter-tile-placement game. Words can be formed diagonally as well as horizontally or vertically. A spinner is used to determine where the next word must go: either at the beginning, middle or end of an existing word, or &amp;quot;any&amp;quot; (anywhere on the board). The penalty for not being able to put down a word is to pick up 1-4 more tiles (as indicated in the outer circle of the spinner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to run out of letters. When someone does so, their score is the total number of tiles remaining in everybody elses racks. The rules suggest playing three games in a row to determine an overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
