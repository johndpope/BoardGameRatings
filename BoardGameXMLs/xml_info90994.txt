			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The Bettor Word Game&amp;quot;, Dratz! combines word building with poker-style betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a deck of 82 lettered cards of different values.  Seven cards are dealt to each player, from which words will be selected in secret.  When all players have chosen their words, they are arranged face down in a stack and the betting begins.  On each betting round, the top card in each stack is revealed.  Players may bet, call, raise or fold.  The remaining player with the highest valued word wins the pot.  In the event of a tie, the longest word wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
