			<description>Introduction taking from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brain Trainer / Reversi is a game of concentration in which the players are able to develop their ability of logical thought and planning independently of each other. The game is a typical family game in which everyone participates with equal enthusiasm. Two persons play at a time. Also, you can play alone, trying to solve the code with as few moves as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underneath the gameboard at the top you will find four sheets of different colours. These sheets are called code boards. The game is supplied with the green side A at the top. Place the pegs corresponding to this patten. Before playing you must turn the green board so that the reverse side B faces up. A pattern now appears with the colours arranged in vertical rows. Try - with the fewest possible moves - to place the pegs so that they coincide with this pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unrelated to Othello.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
