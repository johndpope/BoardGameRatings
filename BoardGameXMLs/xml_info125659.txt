							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pogo Joe</name>
									
			<description>Pogo Joe is a Q*Bert clone with several extra features. The player takes the role of the eponymous Pogo Joe, a boy on a pogo stick. The game takes place over 65 different levels, each consisting of a different arrangement of barrels. To complete a level, Pogo Joe must jump on every barrel.&lt;br/&gt;To make Pogo Joe's job harder, several enemies inhabit the levels. They first start out as spherical &amp;quot;eggs&amp;quot; of different colours. Colliding with these &amp;quot;eggs&amp;quot; kills the enemy within them, but if left alone for a few seconds, the &amp;quot;eggs&amp;quot; hatch into different sorts of enemies, contact with which is fatal to Pogo Joe.&lt;br/&gt;The tops of the barrels have different colours depending on their status or functionality:&lt;br/&gt;White &lt;br/&gt;The default state.&lt;br/&gt;Red &lt;br/&gt;The barrel has been jumped on.&lt;br/&gt;Cyan &lt;br/&gt;The barrel has been jumped on twice (required on some levels).&lt;br/&gt;Purple &lt;br/&gt;The barrel has been jumped on three times (required on some levels).&lt;br/&gt;Green &lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;smart bomb&amp;quot; barrel. Jumping on this kills every enemy on screen, and reverts the barrel to white.&lt;br/&gt;Black &lt;br/&gt;A teleport. Moves Pogo Joes instantly to another black-topped barrel.&lt;br/&gt;On later levels, some enemies change red barrels back to white when jumping on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pogo Joe&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
