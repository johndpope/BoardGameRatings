			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, it is not enough to merely summon up a temporary storm.  For some, sometimes it is necessary to completely defy the laws of nature on a far more permanent level.  Caelumancy, the art of creating permanent weather and environmental effects in an area, is a mysterious form of magic that allows a spellcaster to bring rain to the desert, snow to the tropics, or unleash Armageddon on interlopers.  While Druids are the primary masters of the craft, other magic users have learned the value of Caelumancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caelumancy explores the art of such weather magic in concise, practical terms.  Now allow spellcasters to craft permanent weather effects as if they were crafting any other type of magical item.  This book explains what Caelumancy is, how it works, and offers 37 unique effects that can be created.  Also find a variety of new feats that not only maximize the potency of Caelumancy effects, but can benefit other magical crafters as well.  Plus information on Sentient Caelumancy effects and example locations that game masters can use to introduce Caelumancy into their setting. &lt;br/&gt;Designed for use in d20-style/OGL games, Caelumancy will unlock exciting new powers and magical opportunities for your campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
