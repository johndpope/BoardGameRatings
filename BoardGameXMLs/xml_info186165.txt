							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The OutWorlds Revelations (fan expansion to Ophidian 2350)</name>
									
			<description>The OutWorld Revelations is a 140-card expansion set and has as his main theme some characters from the OutWorlds. The set is based in the Fallen from Grace Fan Fiction, the Grakkan's Union &amp;amp; Grakkan&amp;rsquo;s Union Revised Fan Fiction and various official Storylines that took place in the OutWorlds region. The set also brings more Ophidian League Gladiators that weren&amp;rsquo;t part of any Fiction, but are showcased on the Ophidian League Bios on the Main site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OutWorld Revelations also features 2 New Card Types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Managers&lt;br/&gt; This card type works like the Reinforcements, but they will have 0VP, and may be played at the beginning of the first wave. The Managers have Life, Rage &amp;amp; ADMG values, but they mostly do not interfere in the Wave. Their special abilities may change the n&amp;ordm; of cards in the hand, the n&amp;ordm; of CP, and other skills, like giving some additional abilities for the Team of the manager (for Teams see above).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sponsors Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may play 1 Sponsor at the start of the game, after playing your Gladiators. This card is not part of your deck, and cannot be discarded, nor placed out of play. Some sponsors will override the standard rules of CP, VP, Cheer, Hand Sizes, Bonus Cards, and Victory Conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And a brand new Mechanism:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Team affiliation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some Gladiators cards will include a new keyword that will indicate that they belong to a Gladiator Team. Example:  The Gladiators Freakshow, Striking Dragon, Ryla &amp;amp; PK have the keyword indicating that they belong to the Team Machine, as seem in The Saga showcased in the Main site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
