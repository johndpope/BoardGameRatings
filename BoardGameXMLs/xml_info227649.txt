							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Balanced Life in a Cruel, Cruel World</name>
									
			<description>This is a roll-and-move game reminiscent of Careers, but focused on finding a perfect balance among eight Values: Affection; Respect; Skill; Enlightenment; Influence; Wealth; Well-being; and Responsibility. The rules include a Leader's Guide for using the game in classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of an outer loop of 32 spaces and eight inward loops of 7 spaces each, one loop for each of the Values. When landing or passing by the entry to a loop, a player may choose to enter that loop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inner and outer tracks both have blue &amp;quot;Enhancement&amp;quot; and red &amp;quot;Deprivation&amp;quot; spaces, with the outer ring half and half, and the inner loops all 5:2 positive. The outer loop also has spaces where players take either &amp;quot;Circumstance&amp;quot; cards or &amp;quot;Cruel, Cruel World&amp;quot; cards, as well as Transaction Post spaces where players can trade points with each other. Both sets of cards have good and bad outcomes, and most result in &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot; point gains or losses, where the player may choose which value to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a thick scoreboard with pegs that all start at zero for each Value. The pegs move +/-1 for blue and red spaces on the outer ring, and +/-2 in the loops. The winner is the first player to achieve a balanced life by having the pegs in all eight values on his board line up vertically on the plus side of the scoreboard (all at +1, all at +2 or all at +3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
