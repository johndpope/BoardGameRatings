			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every night, before bed-time, my 8 year-old daughter and I have story time. When she was younger I read stories to her. After she began school she read to me. Lately we have been really enjoying creating stories together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After trying out a few different ways of playing story-creating games together, we came up with the following simple rules, which seem to work fairly well, for us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Info:&lt;br/&gt;Number of Players: 2-4&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Ages: 6 and up&lt;br/&gt;Average Game Length: 8 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This game is available as a free download from 1km1kt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
