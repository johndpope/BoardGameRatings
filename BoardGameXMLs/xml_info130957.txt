			<description>It's a family game containing 90 cards, 1 die and a few tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central board is built with one type of cards (table-cards). Each player receives 7 cards from the pile (game-cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to collect the 7 colors of the Rainbow as soon as possible in order to score more points. The mechanic is quite simple: 1. draw a card and reveal it (use the bonus action if a bonus card was drawn); 2. Exchange a card of your hand with another one on the board (carefull: some cards are blocked and cannot be exchanged unless you use the die). After a player turn the others may struggle to exchange for free (no turn action) the card left by the previous player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1st player collecting the 7 different colors wins the maximum points (depending on the number of players). Then, by finishing order, others gain less 1 point than the previous one. Scoring: each color card and each pot-o-gold worth 1 point. Add the scoring tokens and know your scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
