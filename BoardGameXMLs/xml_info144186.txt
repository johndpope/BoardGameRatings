							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Funky Smugglers</name>
									
			<description>Funky Smugglers combines awesome 70s atmosphere with massive multiplayer events for endless arcade fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the things smugglers try to get through the airport are incredible. There's a spider in grandma's suitcase?! A racketeer is hiding a plunger?! Holy smoke! Luckily, you have an X-Ray scanner to check their clothes and luggage for wacky contraband. Enjoy a funky 70s-style soundtrack while keeping the airport safe from hammers, scissors, and other illegal goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join huge multiplayer battles where you fight for high scores! Dive into challenging randomized missions! Use multi-touch or a one-finger slide to pick up multiple items and chain together combos! Boost your X-ray! Earn in-game cash to spend on customization, new contraband, new smugglers and exciting upgrades!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
