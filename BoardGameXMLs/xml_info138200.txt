							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Court/Ship (KS Playtest Draft)</name>
									
			<description>From the Kickstarter description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The court of Louis the XV of France was a weird place. He had a place called a &amp;quot;Deer Park&amp;quot; where he kept a stable of young mistresses, he kept his court in the cramped and weird living situation of his palace, and from all reports lived a crazy and decadent lifestyle. Women would come to court to become his mistress to gain a title and lands. This was also the time of the &amp;quot;gentlemen scientist&amp;quot; when there was growing interest in science and technology, as well as new systems of government. Into this environment... an alien invasion begins. This Fate Core expansion by J.R. Blackwell will explore themes of identity, hierarchy, and what it means to be human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;This is the backers-only preview draft of Court/Ship&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
