			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Hexcells Plus is a logic puzzle game featuring hexagonal tiles. It is the sequel to Hexcells and features similar gameplay. The goal is to determine which tiles are a part of the pattern by marking them and removing the tiles that do not belong. A few hints are given at that start of the puzzle and more information is revealed as tiles are removed. A number inside the hexagonal shape below a removed tiles tells the number of adjacent tiles that are part of the pattern. Other hints include the number of pattern tiles in a column and whether tiles that are part of the pattern are adjacent or not. In total, Hexcells Plus includes 36 puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
