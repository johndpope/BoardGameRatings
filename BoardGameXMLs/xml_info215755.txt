			<description>1 versus 1 tactical combat game played on an 8x8 to 12x12 square grid game board. Each side has 6 military units, plus a Fortress to defend, and a Cannon Turret to defend the Fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set up your units on your edge of the board, then let the battle begin.  Each player's turn is made up of 2 actions: Move, Attack, Heal an injured unit, or Repair and disabled vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacks are resolved by comparing Attack Strength + dice roll  to Defense Strength + dice roll.
