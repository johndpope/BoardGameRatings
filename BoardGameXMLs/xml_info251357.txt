							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon and his Marshals: The Dice Game</name>
									
			<description>Napoleon and his Marshals - The Dice Game is a fast playing wargame covering several years of Napoleonic warfare. The game includes two scenarios, one for two player and one for multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a map divided into areas and dice for the counters. The strength is represented by the number of pips. These pips determine the number of dice that can be rolled in combat as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each country represented in the game is handicapped so the game can be ended at any point and determine the final score. The game is designed to introduce new players to Napoleonic games or for experienced players to get a quick game in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
