Errors or omissions found between revisions will be notified by issue of an Errata, changes to be included immediately in the working copy (and the revision number updated). This booklet is not meant to be a substitute for any of the White Wolf&amp;trade; source books, and as such we recommend that players at least purchase and read the relevant clan book. Queries about the interpretation of these rules should first be directed to your Referee or Storyteller who may consult the Admin Council.
