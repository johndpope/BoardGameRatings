							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hui Buh: Der verfluchte Geheimgang</name>
									
			<description>Children's game about Hui Buh, a famous ghost from a children's audiobook series. The active player closes his/her eyes and the evil count is hidden behind one of the seven walls. The active players then opens his/her eyes and takes out as many walls as he/she wants, but if the count is unveiled, the turn ends. If the player stops in time, he/she can perform the action on the wall pieces he/she drew. These actions include moving forward 1/2/3 spaces, using a secret corridor that forms a short cut, or finding a key to that corridor (the latter two only work together).&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
