			<description>Year 700 A.U.C. (53 A.C.). The Roman Republic, strong under the lead of Caius Julius, is waging war over Gaul. His personal power is ever increasing, shaking the very foundation of the Republic, while Senators tremble in fear.&lt;br/&gt;This is the time in which great men can show their value and fools their weakness.&lt;br/&gt;But that is the front line, not here. You are somewhere away from glorious battles and sieges, reckless attacks and everything good that life can give to a soldier of Rome. Here, stranded in namely captured and loyal lands. Captured, but flow of supplies is not as safe as expected. Loyal, but tax collection is resisted. Your job is ensuring someone else can show off with well-fed, well-equipped and well-paid soldiers. At least for now.&lt;br/&gt;Your long-time rival has recently arrived here, tasked with your same mission. A weak man may see a threat, but a strong man sees a chance. Prove your tactical prowess and bravery. Make a fool of him, running around chasing his tail. It&amp;rsquo;s time to outwit him and show your worth to the future Imperator. Get the promotion you deserve, strive for glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quaterni Lapilli is a strategy game about tactical control of resources during Gallic Wars. The players are low-ranked army leaders, trying to outshine each other to get a field promotion. Using double sided and ever shifting tactic cards, they must seek control of supplies lines by deploying their soldiers where needed while keeping barbarians in check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
