							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dominator</name>
									
			<description>A chess-like science fiction themed game. The game board represents the planet Elkos and is broken up into a series of hexes with four different types of terrain: Flatlands, Rough, High plateaus, and bunkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different types of pieces corresponding to the four Elkosian &amp;quot;races&amp;quot; of the planet. The Etons move in a straight line and are blocked by anything but flat terrain. The Artilla Squads also move in a straight line, but may traverse flatlands and rocky terrain. The winged Ariel Bombers may traverse any terrain, but fly short distances - they also carry bombs to bombard the opponents. Finally, the Dominator Lord (one per side) moves up to three hexes but may not ascend plateaus. Its special ability however is to convert any opposing piece to its side by moving next to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting twist to the game is that the game board may be altered through the use of bombs. When a bomb is dropped, the owning player may use one of 14 &amp;quot;tri-hexes&amp;quot; to alter the landscape, thereby making previously impassable terrain passable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either the opposing Dominator Lord is killed, one side no longer has pieces other than the Dominator Lord to move, or a stalemate is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components are mostly card stock, three color printing on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
