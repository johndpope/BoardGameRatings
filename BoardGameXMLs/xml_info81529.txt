			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knuckles, first introduced in Sonic and Knuckles, gets his own game with several of his friends, once again looking to free his animal pals from the grasp of Dr. Robotnik.  Now all of his friends have their own special abilities, giving you many more ways to smash through the robot hordes and collect the rings and Emeralds that the evil Dr. is trying once again to get his hands on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can play alone or with a friend, using a special bungie cord connection to each other that allows you to quickly launch each other at extreme speeds into the minions of Robotnik, and depending on the characters you take with you, you may find a variety of different routes to reach your goals.  It is the only game in the Sonic universe to be created on the 32X, and is also the only one to not have Sonic in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
