			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;LowDie Light is a set of rules that can be used to help tell an interactive story known as a roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LowDie Light rules are a condensed version of the full LowDie System, and are intended to appeal to gamers who prefer uncomplicated rules and to act as an introduction to the full system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;LowDie System Light! offers a simplified, more intuitive presentation that the LowDie System. It uses four attributes instead of eight, and uses a streamlined, quickstart approach to character generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose between three or four packages of pregenerated numbers for attributes, skills and traits (advantages).  The simplified character generation method has the advantage of reducing the number of choices during character generation, while still allowing the creation of a personalised, unique character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
