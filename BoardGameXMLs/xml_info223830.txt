							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Good Little Ninjas</name>
									
			<description>The game takes place over one week in a bustling Japanese village. Each day, you will employ Farmers, Carpenters, Peasants and Merchants to harvest rice and construct buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more daring might send Ninjas to raid the Palace Treasury, or recruit Samurai to prevent the predicted raids. You might even persuade one of the more powerful inhabitants to help you: the Shogun, the Daiymo, or even the Emperor himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the player who best uses their cunning to gain the most coins wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Little Ninjas is a card-drafting game for 2-4 players, aged 12+ that takes about 30 minutes to play. It is available as a free print-and-play download from the Good Little Games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
