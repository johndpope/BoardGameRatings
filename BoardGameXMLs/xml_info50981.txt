							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Black Madonna</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Madonna is an adventure module for Twilight: 2000. Silesia, in southern Poland, is the backdrop for a quest for a religious icon of great value. Was the icon taken east by the Soviets? Was it hidden in a cave by Polish patriots? Was it destroyed when Czestochowa was bombed? Did the NATO forces who occupied the city briefly carry it west with them? Or, does it rest beneath the ruins of Czestochowa? There is only one way to know for sure...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over and above the main adventure, this module provides a picture of life in southwest Poland after the destruction of the war. The surviving cities, the resources, the petty lordlings and the major powers are given life and detail. From the court of the Markgraf of Silesia to the camps of the bandit gangs; from the ruined factories of Czestochowa and Gliwice to the slowly recovering facilities of Raciborz and Rybnik; all are described in rich detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module provides a picture of life in southwest Poland after the destruction of the war.  The surviving cities, the resources, the petty lordlings and the major powers are given life and detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are also given the chance to aid in finding the Black Madonna, a religious and cultural artifact that could help Poland rise from the ashes of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
