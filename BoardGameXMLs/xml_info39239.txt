							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Allergy Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Italian Comic Book / TV show &amp;quot;Monster Allergy&amp;quot;. Each player has his/her own deck of cards, choosing 30 out of the available packs. There are cards in five colours, but players are only allowed to choose cards of three colours, so the influence on the cards played in the game by the other player might be limited. Also, several icons and numbers, plus some descriptive texts showing different values, powers and abilities of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rounds are &amp;quot;days&amp;quot;, in which in a strict order powers, friends, monsters and so on are placed onto the board. This has two personal zones - one for each player - and a neutral zone, in which the monsters are placed and attacked/captured in the main phase of each round. Aim of the game is to capture monsters with the total value of &amp;quot;10&amp;quot; through activating the power cards, but the other player can protect monsters with his/her cards, losing these powers for capturing doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the &amp;quot;attack / capture&amp;quot; phase, there is a &amp;quot;night phase&amp;quot;, in which several monsters` activities are executed. Some more twists are interlaced in the system of the cards, influencing each other and offering some tactical decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the starter set there are two decks with 30 cards each - the total of available cards is 111.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packed in a nice &amp;quot;Bombo&amp;quot; monster figure as storage for cards, player mats and rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
