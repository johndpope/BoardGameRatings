			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations Don Jonz! You have just won a Virtual Adventure Vacation on Eternam, the biggest and best planetary Funpark in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hard-working intergalactic Space Marshals like yourself deserve to experience the ultimate getaway. Travel through 3D landscapes to more than a half-dozen past human eras, populated with life-like bio-tech creatures offering tongue-in-cheek remarks. From the age of the pharaohs and the realm of medieval knights to the French Revolution and beyond, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the adventure of a lifetime... or several.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, Mister Jonz, there is a slight problem... Dragoons still inhabit Eternam wanting to reclaim the park and have joined forces with your arch-rival Mikhal Nuke. They plan to ruin your vacation in a big way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least you can count on help from the beautiful Tracy, a technician on the Eternam coordination team. Unfortunately, to escape Nuke&amp;rsquo;s evil clutches, she has dematerialised into the Funpark&amp;rsquo;s computer network, so Tracy will communicate only via a computer screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need intuition, courage, wit, diplomacy, charm and a surreal sense of humour. Only you can save Eternam - - and yourself. But who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t face all challenges to win Tracy&amp;rsquo;s smile? So... Enjoy your vacation, Mister Jonz!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
