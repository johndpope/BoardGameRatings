							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hellgate: London</name>
									
			<description>Hellgate: London is a dark fantasy themed action role-playing game developed by Flagship Studios, released on October 31, 2007. It was developed by a team headed by former Blizzard Entertainment employees, some of whom had overseen the creation of the Diablo series. In 2008 Flagship Studios filed bankruptcy and all intellectual property was seized because it was used as collateral for funding received from Comerica Bank. Subsequently, development of the game halted. Namco Bandai Games provided free ongoing US/EU server support in the fall of Flagship Studios until 31 January 2009, when the US/EU multiplayer game servers and websites were taken offline.HanbitSoft has since acquired properties to the game and it is being developed and played in Korea to date. As of 2010, Hanbitsoft has acquired the US/EU territory rights and will be re-releasing back to the US/EU territories with its sequel Hellgate London: Resurrection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a post-apocalyptic London in the year 2038, Hellgate: London is a fast paced action role playing 'hack and slasher'. The game featured both singleplayer and online multiplayer support when it was released although US/EU online support has since shutdown. Flagship Studios released 1 major MP content update The Stonehenge Chronicles and the 2nd The Abyss Chronicles on the test server before the studios closure. Similar to the Diablo series, randomization is embedded into many of the game mechanics including weapon and armor attributes, item drops, mob spawns and level composition. The singleplayer version features a 5 act story quest line and when completed, the player is eligible to restart the story line again in Nightmare difficulty and create new characters in Elite mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Hellgate: London , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
