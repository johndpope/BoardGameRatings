			<description>The TurboGrafx-16 was the first video game console in North America to have a CD-ROM peripheral[citation needed] (following the PC-Engine CD-ROM add-on in Japan, although the FM Towns Marty was the first Japanese console to have a built-in CD-ROM). The TurboGrafx-CD debuted at a prohibitive $399.99 (and did not include a pack-in game). Monster Lair (Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair) and Fighting Street (Street Fighter) were the initial TurboGrafx-CD titles. Ys Book I &amp;amp; II soon followed. However, the TurboGrafx-CD catalog grew at a very slow rate compared to the library of TurboChip (HuCard) titles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TurboGrafx-CD came packaged in a very large box, 85% of which was filled with protective styrofoam inserts. By some accounts, no other video game console (or peripheral) has been packaged in such an overkill manner. The TurboGrafx-CD did however come with a large plastic &amp;quot;carrying case&amp;quot; that could comfortably hold the TurboGrafx-16 base system, TurboGrafx-CD, all AC adapters, 2 &amp;ndash; 3 controllers, and a few games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the TurboGrafx-CD library was relatively small, American gamers could draw from a wide range of Japanese software since there was no region protection on TG-CD / PC Engine CD-ROM software. Many mail order (and some brick-and-mortar) import stores advertised Japanese PCE CD and HuCard titles in the video game publications of the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TurboGrafx-16&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
