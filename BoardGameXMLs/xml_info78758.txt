							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">System DL Manual and Players Field Guide</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ready for a paradigm shift? Welcome to System DL, a new direction in role-playing! System DL is completely diceless. Put away those polyhedrons, they're no good here. You won't miss them, except maybe as something to rattle around, build teetering towers in the middle of the playing area and accidentally drop into the nachos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System DL still plays like the old diced games everyone's used to. After all, if, as Einstein once said, God doesn't play dice with the Universe, then why should you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System DL includes the innovative Ten-Minute Character Generation System, which creates balanced, well-rounded characters with actual backgrounds, not just numbers on a page. Game play is amazingly fast without sparing detail. If you're not sure the speed and fun of a diceless system is right for you, this manual even includes simple rules for playing with dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This package contains both the 64-page System DL Manual and Player's Field Guide and the 34-page System DL Rules Grab Bag booklet. The Grab Bag contains all kinds of crazy stuff for use with System DL: alternate chargen rules, quick conversions to/from d20, an entire half-baked comedy game venue entitled Zombies vs. Robots vs. Ninja vs. Pirates vs. Cowboys, and even more such oddities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready to see your games truly unleashed with System DL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
