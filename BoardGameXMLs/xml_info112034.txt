			<description>The players want to cook marmalade with the mouse and collect the fruits in the garden to exchange them for marmalade. Each player draws a secret mouse card, his aim is to reach a corner square with the mouse of that colour and as many fruits as possible. The active player rolls the die and moves any mouse accordingly in any direction, jumping over other mice is possible, only one mouse per square is allowed. Who reaches a corner, discards the mouse card and draws a new one, the fruit chips he keeps. Three fruit chips are exchanged for a marmalade jar. When all the mouse cards have been discarded, the player with the most marmalade jars wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
