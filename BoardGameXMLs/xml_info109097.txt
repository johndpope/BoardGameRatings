							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spacefaring: For Fun &amp; Profit</name>
									
			<description>A brand new region of space has been discovered and it is brimming with planets ripe for the plundering. Blast off into uncharted territory and be the first to claim these curiously uninhabited wellsprings of wherewithal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of &amp;quot;Spacefaring: For Fun &amp;amp; Profit&amp;quot; is to colonize the most valuable planets before your rivals. The game ends as soon as every planet has been colonized, and your total score is based on your planet value, the number of factories you built and the economic level of your homeworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
