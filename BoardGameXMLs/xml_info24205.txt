			<description> Be the first pirate to reach the lost treasure!&lt;br/&gt; Players roll the dice and move their three colored playing figures along the board, hoping to reach the ships, which will take them to Treasure Island, where the golden treasure lies.  On every turn, players have several options - they can split the roll of the dice and move two players along, they can use one or both of the rolls to move the ships at sea, or they can try to send an opponent home. In Race for the Gold&amp;trade; the ultimate goal is to reach the golden treasure first! Players use unique finger grooves in the game board to move the ships around the game board. The longer they sail, the more likely they will encounter danger!&lt;br/&gt;A pirate can fall overboard, or a ship can sink, causing all on board to begin the journey again. The player whose pirate reaches the treasure first is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
