			<description>A simple roll-and-move race game from Paris around the world and back to Paris, using a track of 80 squares, which impose various penalties and bonuses to those landing on them. Drawn under the observations of the French Royal Academy of Sciences, the centre of the gameboard is occupied by maps of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The 'Terre Antarctique' is described as an 'Unknown land situated in the southern part of the Globe comprised of New Guinea, New Zealand and New Holland'. A specific penalty is imposed on players so unfortunate to land on the Barbary Coast. They are to remain there for two turns 'because of the trade in Christian slaves which is carried on there', but they can be released by the arrival of another player on the same square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
