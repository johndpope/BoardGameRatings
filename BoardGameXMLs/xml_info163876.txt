			<description>publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUILD HUNTERS is a fantasy game with six main races: Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, Halflings, Felis, and Minotaurs. In GUILD HUNTERS you play a member of a guild in the human city of Council Bluffs. In Council Bluffs reputation is everything - you you need to gain lots. Without reputation no one takes you for a person or a guild and with too much reputation people and guilds come looking for you to build there own reputation on taking you out. Reputation becomes almost a catch-22 where you need it and then you have to defend it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a new 3d12 system for the rules. There are 7 main attributes and each main attribute has 2 sub attributes to it. The sub attributes cover the skills and the main attributes cover magic defense and other random things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic in the game is free flowing. There are no magic points or spells to remember. Magic is a big part of this world and everyone in the world can cast magic, though many do not or if they do only simple spells. If you fail a spell by 1 or more you take half the affect of the spell. People casting the spells need to think about there spells and the outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
