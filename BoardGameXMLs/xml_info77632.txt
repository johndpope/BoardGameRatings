			<description>From the Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is 60 AD. The Roman Empire is at the height of its power, under the rule of the cruel Emperor Nero. The isle of Britannia is wracked by rebellion against its Roman masters, as the Celtic tribes ransack city after city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the depths of the wilderness, the village of Nethergate, forgotten and ignored, is hatching a conspiracy. They will conspire with the faery kingdoms, the dark, secret, wild powers, to destroy their Roman conquerors. Magic is dying, but there is enough of it left to put an end the the Empire. Your job is to help them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or, your job is to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
