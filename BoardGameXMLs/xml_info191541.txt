			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hanafuda playing cards were designed in Japan centuries ago after Western playing cards were outlawed. The cards are based on the four seasons and 12 months of the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Koi-Koi is a set collecting game played using these classic cards. The game includes a tutorial mode as well as a guide to the sets and their point values. Koi-Koi also includes a &amp;quot;push your luck&amp;quot; mechanic, as each time you complete a set, you will be asked if you want to continue playing or call for scoring. Only the person who calls for scoring will get points for the current round. There are 12 rounds in each game, though the game may end early if you reduce your opponent to 0 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
