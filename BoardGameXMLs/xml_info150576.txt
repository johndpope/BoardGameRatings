			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2 player card driven battle game based on the manga with the same name by Kentaro Miura.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw 5 cards from a common deck; cards are numbered 0&amp;ndash;5. Each player puts down a card, and in turn, turn them face up to either move as many spaces as the card shows or attack (if the distance to the enemy is as many spaces as the card shows) and then puts down another card. Hence moves are programmed one turn in advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to inflict 2 damage wins. The game also has special character cards, and some rule-changing cards to draw at random if players want to spice up the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
