			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark came over the Mines, and the Cavers, with their Tubs, followed the Lights to freedom... Check out Cavers of Porphyra!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Freedom was a community laboring for something lovely and rare.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Colson Whitehead, The Underground Railroad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slavery flies in the face of all that is right and good, and few places are free from it, least of the  Patchwork planet of Porphyra! There are those that secretly oppose this practice and seek to free slaves, dedicating their powers to them, and spiriting them out through secret paths and tunnels, and using miner&amp;rsquo;s slang to conceal their actions. These are the intrepid Cavers, who have a wide variety of skills called &amp;lsquo;capers&amp;rsquo; used to smuggle, free slaves, and fight for freedom! Cavers add the special powers of a selected class to their cavers&amp;rsquo; skills to create a force for opposing slavery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carl Cram&amp;eacute;r&amp;rsquo;s Cavers of Porphyra, published by Purple Duck Games, contains all you need to play this new and exciting 20-level class, which uses the new Porphyra Roleplaying Game rules developed for your excitement and ease of play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
