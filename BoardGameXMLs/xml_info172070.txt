			<description>Seems to be a simple race game with dice. The set includes d6 dice, 6 plastic horses with jockey (yellow, white, black, green, red and blue) and a board with 6 lanes which has a number of spaces marked off. Guessing that the main game is a simple race to end of row and back which would be about 30 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxtop has a race trail rail from left right and curving around back to right. Above rail mostly red and below yellow.  &amp;quot;Thorobred&amp;quot; is at the top of the box, in yellow print on the red backtop. There are four horses showing on left side of box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
