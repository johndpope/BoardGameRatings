							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antietam Campaign</name>
									
			<description>This game is a fairly simplistic hex-and-counter wargame. With less than six pages of rules, it is very adept in it role as an introduction to gaming the American Civil War. The developer&amp;rsquo;s notes indicate that it is a modified installment of the Blue &amp;amp; Gray (SPI) system. The games comes with three scenarios, from nine to thirteen turns long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hex scale is 300 yards. Each strength point represents 250 men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ANTIETAM CAMPAIGN is the latest in a series of games based on Civil War campaigns. Scenarios cover the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, and Harper&amp;rsquo;s Ferry. All can be linked to re-create the entire campaign.&lt;br/&gt;Each unit and commander which fought or could have fought in the campaign is rated for its movement, combat and leadership capabilities. The Confederates are vastly outnumbered, but boast fine commanders such as Robert E. Lee, Thomas A. &amp;quot;Stonewall&amp;quot; Jackson and James Longstreet. The Union Army is fighting on its own ground and is much more powerful than the Confederate forces, but has difficulty bringing that might to bear. If they can, the war might end sooner. If the Confederates succeed, they might swing Maryland to the Southern side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
