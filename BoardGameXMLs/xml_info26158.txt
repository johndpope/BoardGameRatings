			<description>For the first time, Little Wolf and his friends are allowed to get the necessary food for their families. They have beautifully made tomahawks and earthenware jugs, leather clothes and feather headdresses on board their canoes to exchange for pumpkins, herbs, maize, and fish. It's an exciting adventure because the river is treacherous and it is not always immediately possible to steer to the right market stand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quality wooden game from Beleduc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
