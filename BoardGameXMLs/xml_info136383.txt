							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Station Zero: The Abusement Park</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When eccentric Trillionaire Clark Duncan finally heard about the scope of the space station tragedy, he saw money. &lt;br/&gt;He told his people, &amp;ldquo;Build me a theme park, a scary one, with all those tubes and radio signal ghosts. I want that in a really scary theme park.&amp;rdquo; They told him he was crazy, that it was insensitive. That no one would come to a theme park based on those ideas. &lt;br/&gt;He told them to build it anyway. &lt;br/&gt;When they told him there were real survivors, real people with real accounts, he said, &amp;ldquo;great, get &amp;lsquo;em on board. Pay them consulting fees. It&amp;rsquo;ll add to the hype. No, of course I don&amp;rsquo;t know what a PTSD is.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;So Clark dumped a portion of his wealth into a &amp;lsquo;terror park.&amp;rsquo; A first (and probably last) of it&amp;rsquo;s kind, a park meant to retell the awful ghost stories that come down from the derelict space stations still floating overhead.&lt;br/&gt;Two years later, under the tightest security and best kept secrets in theme park history, Station Zero, an Adult Horror Adventure Park opened to five hundred special guests with about half that many employees on hand.&lt;br/&gt;You are among their numbers. &lt;br/&gt;When the stories of the what happened that day go public, will you be a survivor, or another hapless victim of...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Station Zero: The Abusement Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Station Zero is a toolkit adventure for Maschine Zeit. You do not need Maschine Zeit to play! (Although, we recommend it. We rather enjoy it.) It consists of eight &amp;quot;rides.&amp;quot; Each ride has a description, reasons for going there, and a few ideas for things with which to abuse the players. As well, we've included printable cards for each (cardstock recommended.) They have the logos for the rides, and the back sides have the descriptions and hooks, so you can put them out on the table for your players. It's a short module, perfect for very quick play, perfect for a Halloween pickup game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are five characters, ready to print and play. These characters are made to be compatible with our new Maschine Zeit 2.0 playtest rules, a draft of which are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
