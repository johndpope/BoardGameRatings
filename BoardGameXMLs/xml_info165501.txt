							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Simiopolis</name>
									
			<description>In Simiopolis players are building a colony on a distant planet. It is the not too distant future. The earth is too crowded and we need more space... fast. The colony of Simiopolis will provide the Simi II and its passengers a place to live. The planet has different types of terrain that include the 3 resources needed to build structures. Unfortunately the engineers have not been given enough time to study the terrain and confirm it's ability to support the massive structures. The crust of the planet is rather thin. Lava like material and massive caverns are occasionally discovered when heavy buildings are built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race is on. Who will build the most and highest quality sections of the colony on Simiopolis?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players work outward from their starting tile by Exploring new terrain tiles, Excavating tiles, Expanding onto the tiles and strategically Exterminating previously expanded tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players gain points for building (Expanding) structures on tiles, building on the most of each of the 5 types of terrain tiles, for each complete set of 5 terrain tiles they build on and for bonus points received from specific terrain tiles. &lt;br/&gt;Last round starts when a player has built all of his sructures or when two stacks of terrain tiles have been explored. The Engineer with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
