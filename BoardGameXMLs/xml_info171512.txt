							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crusader&#039;s Gauntlet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crusaders Gauntlet was written when Castles &amp;amp; Crusades had just hit the shelves. It was written as a demo module back when I had a brain and was considered by the Troll Lords when there was talk of organized demo teams. It was rewritten for their Aihrde setting and repitched and was not what they were looking for. So, their loss is your gain. This is a tough adventure for low level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
