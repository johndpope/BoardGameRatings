							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dreamkeepers SKIRMISH: Shadow Wars of Anduruna</name>
									
			<description>SKIRMISH is a strategic fast-paced two-player card battle game that combines tactical deployment zones with character-based action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines Vivid Publishing's cult hit serues 'Dreamkeepers' with the finely honed gaming sensibilities of the Electric Panda Fish dev team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a background enjoying classics like 'Magic the Gathering,' Electric Panda Fish envisioned an experience that cut the collecting, and jumped straight into balanced action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging the distinct personality and lore or Dreamkeepers, they have crafted exactly that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eight leader characters in SKIRMISH, each with their own 20-card deck. The decks are tuned to represent the distinct personalities and traits of their leader characters - some are fast and hard hitting, some are sly and resourceful, others chaotic and insane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You choose two characters for you SKIRMISH and combine their decks. Then it's time to face off against your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The table itself is divided into three zones - a central lane with two flanking areas - and where you deploy has a huge impact on on the success of your strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flanking attacks, reinforcement blocks, long range equipment, area denial continuous effects - the varying zones give you the option to attack, retreat, consolidate, or redistribute your forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas Magic resource generation is random, and Hearthstone has a rigid scaling in place, SKIRMISH as a more flat resource system that creates brisk, deep gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character generates REsolve that they can use to play followers, items, actions, and events. But be cautions about deploying it all at once - just like the tactical regions on the table, managing your Resolve with cold efficiency can be the key difference between victory and defeat. And if a character dies, their Resolve goes with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
