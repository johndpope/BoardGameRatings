			<description>designer's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Anders Bremmer is a photographic journalist, and he's gone missing. But not before mailing his evidence to someone he could trust - and who would know that Anders would only do this if he thought his life was in danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The search for Anders Bremmer and investigation of what he stumbled upon will take the PCs to a town in the Australian desert where a lake is receding in drought conditions, revealing a drowned town from the 1950's. A fact which has attracted the attention of interested parties who wish to work undisturbed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the preface:&lt;br/&gt;This is an investigative campaign using the NEMESIS system, suitable for 1-4 players. It&amp;rsquo;s intended to be easily adaptable to either a Delta Green or Dark Conspiracy context, or as a standalone storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
