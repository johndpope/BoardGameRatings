							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mathematical Dice</name>
									
			<description>Mathematical Dice is played with two 20-sided dice with the numbers 1 to 10 and -10 to -1 on their sides. On a turn a player rolls the dice and can add the sum, difference, product, or quotient (if it's an integer) of the two numbers to his or her score. The object is to reach a specified target total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another game is suggested in which the letters of the alphabet are assigned numbers to be generated by the dice, with the object being to form words, but complete rules for this are not given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were published in Games &amp;amp; Puzzles #28 (September 1974).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
