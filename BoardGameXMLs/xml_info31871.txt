			<description>The name of the game translates into English as Skillful Flyers and it's about birds. Actually there are three different games in the box that are all playable with the same set of components. The games are of different difficulty levels and it's intended that as the child grows the game(s) can grow together with him. The goal of all the three games is to collect a specified set of 15 different animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
