			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuko Ahso looks like an ordinary grammar school student, but she is actually the Valis Warrior. &amp;quot;I defeated King Rogles of the Dark World with the Valis sword which was given to me by Queen Valia, but my friend Reiko died in the process.&amp;quot; Yuko went home by train after that terrible fight. She didn't have the slightest idea that she would be summoned to fight again. &amp;quot;Yuko...&amp;quot; said a familiar voice. &amp;quot;Reiko,&amp;quot; said Yuko, &amp;quot;is that you? But I thought you...&amp;quot; Reiko quickly admonished, &amp;quot;Go and see Queen Valia, Yuko Emporer Megas has threatened Dream World and our friend Vecanti.&amp;quot; When Yuko was told of Vecanti's great danger, a burning desire moved Yuko to action. She has risen to crush Mega's ambition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
