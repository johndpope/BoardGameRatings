			<description>Players need to make their way out of the snail&amp;rsquo;s shell and be the first to reach the salad. Two dice are rolled and placed on the snail&amp;rsquo;s antennae, the third you roll and then move your snail the sum of the die rolled and one of the antenna dice. The dice used are then placed on the antennae. On the green path you move forward, on the red backwards. You cannot enter closed spots, a doublet earns you another turn, on occupied spots you place your snail on top of others. When moving on you take along snails on top of yours and leave those below. On spots so marked you must change to the other path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
