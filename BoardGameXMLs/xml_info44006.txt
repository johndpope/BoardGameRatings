			<description>This game is one of a series of roll-and-move games published by the Regent Book Store in Singapore in the 1970s or 1980s. The games all have a paper board with graphic illustrations in the style of that period. Text on the board is in both English and Chinese. The boards were printed by Koon Wah Lithographers, Singapore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Conduct Games, players roll a die and move their token around a spiral track, moving forward or backward or missing turns if they land on certain special spaces. These spaces reflect a particular action or behaviour and the player is rewarded or penalised accordingly. Examples are, &amp;quot;(1) Exercise in the morning, move to 8.&amp;quot;, or, &amp;quot;(67) Read horror story book, halt once&amp;quot;. The first player to reach space 100 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
