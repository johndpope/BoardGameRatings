			<description>Moragon is a peninsula located in the northern regions of the Abidon Sea, where, for a long period of time, Elves, Dwarves and Halflings lived their lives peacefully in their communities, with little or no interaction between each other. When Humans arrived in their ships, gradually established their commercial routes from north to south of the peninsula.&lt;br/&gt;The relations between every race of Moragon changed radically, has mutual benefits were achieved. &lt;br/&gt;However this thriving success also brought to Moragon influent men full of greed and thirsty for power, who would stop at nothing to achieve their goals.&lt;br/&gt;As a consequence of this struggle for the dominion over peninsula, Vazuhr, the Lord of Darkness, an ancient evil that was dormant for thousands of years in the depths of Moragon saw an opportunity to rise once again. Vazuhr found his herald in Zogalon, a powerful warlord who already had taken by storm one of the most important ports of Moragon and had aggregated the Orcs to his army.&lt;br/&gt;Having Zogalon as his liege, Vazuhr managed to open the portals of Hell, unleashing his legions of demons to fight alongside the warlord and thus conquer the whole extension of Moragon.&lt;br/&gt;Yet the brave people of Moragon stood united against this threat and managed to defeat Zogalon and his ruthless army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
