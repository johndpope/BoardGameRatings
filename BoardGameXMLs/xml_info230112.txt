			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO THE CITY OF SPIRITS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Meriquai Falls, where Native American culture blends seemlessly with modern contemporary society to form one of the most beautiful cities in the United States. It is also home to one of the largest concentrations of metahuman activity in the Midwest. Between the schemes of Galvakar and his Imperions and the genocidal plots of the Manitou and his Totems of Retribution, the crazed antics of the Pooka King and the dark secrets of the Night Sparrow, there is plenty to do for an intrepid hero in Meriquai Falls. Save the city and perhaps, in so doing, save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEET THE HANDS OF DOMINATION!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Meriquai Falls is full of surprises. So many villains and heroes in a modest Midwest city with little to offer compared to its coastal sisters is surprising enough. But when the world's most beloved teen adventurer hero from nearby Kansas City flips heel and forms a villainous mercenary company with her former archnemesis, everyone is in shock!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meriquai Falls - The Hands of Domination includes six full HERO System 6th Edition character sheets and biographies for Kaity Powers, aka the Scarlet Saber, and her company of mercenaries willing to work with any villain for the right price. You can use these villains in a Meriquai Falls campaign, a Champions Universe campaign, or your own homebrew campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your heroes be able to defeat the Hands of Domination? And, in the end, will they even want to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
