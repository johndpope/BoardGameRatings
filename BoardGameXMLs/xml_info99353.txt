			<description>Das Book is a supplement for the Flames of War WWII miniatures game that compiles many rules and articles from several sources.  It compliments the basic rule book and the similar sized starter book.  Some rules are updated, such as the &amp;quot;No Retreat&amp;quot; mission which was written to be more balanced than &amp;quot;Hold the Line&amp;quot; from the main rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The compilation was credited to Casey Davies, from work by The Battlefront team and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;Compiled from across the Flames of War book range, Das Book includes:&lt;br/&gt;Nine Combat Missions: Free-For-All, Encounter, No Retreat, Fighting Withdrawl, Breakthrough, the Cauldron, Roadblock, Hasty Assault, and Breakout.&lt;br/&gt;All mission special rules.&lt;br/&gt;Latewar Airborne Assault Special Rules and Mission.&lt;br/&gt;Bocage Rules.&lt;br/&gt;River Crossing Rules and Mission.&lt;br/&gt;Fortification rules, with updated bunker rules and two fortification missions: Trench Fight and The Big Push&lt;br/&gt;Street Fighting rules and mission&lt;br/&gt;Complete Mid and Late war Arsenals for all of the major forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
