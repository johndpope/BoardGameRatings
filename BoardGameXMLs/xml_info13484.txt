			<description>This game is designed to teach colors and (presumably) self-esteem to very young children. Players race across the board to join Barney the Dinosaur in his hot-air balloon and go for a ride. The game features the Magic Light, which is a light bulb device that shines light through a color wheel and into a bubble. A player spins the wheel and moves to the next space of the same color on the track. If you pass or land on a...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duck Space: All players quack like a duck to cheer you on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clapping Hands Space: Everyone applauds to let you know what a good job you're doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a Barney space you move to the space in front of the leader. When all players have made it to Barney's Balloon, everyone cheers, &amp;quot;HOORAY!&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
