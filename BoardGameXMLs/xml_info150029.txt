							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1911 Amundsen vs Scott: Expansion 4 â€“ Food Depots</name>
									
			<description>IMPORTANT UPDATE:&lt;br/&gt;The second edition of &amp;quot;1911 Amundsen vs Scott&amp;quot; incorporates this expansion inside with 4 white cubes (not wooden tents).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small expansion for backers of the Verkami crowdfunding campaign consisting of 4 food depots in the form of small wooden tents and a rules card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important: If you want to play with this expansion only need to print the rules and use 4 pieces (cubes, discs, peanuts :D ...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rules:&lt;br/&gt;1- Each player receives 2 pieces (Food Depots).&lt;br/&gt;2- Each player rolls a die and place one of their Depots in the resulting track space (&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; is the space adjacent to the ship).&lt;br/&gt;3- The players choose where they want to place their second Depot, exactly 2 spaces ahead or behind (if possible) the first one.&lt;br/&gt;Ex: Amundsen rolls the dice with a &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; result and places his first depot in the fifth (yellow) space. The other depot may be placed in the third (green) or seventh (red) space.&lt;br/&gt;4- At the begginning of the game each player receives 3 cards instead of 1. They must pick 2 of these cards to place face down next to each of their depots.&lt;br/&gt;Note: If this expansion is combined with the &amp;quot;Expansion 1 - Patrons&amp;quot; (included with the game), the Food Depots must always be executed first.&lt;br/&gt;5- When a player ends his turn in a space with a Depot, he takes the corresponding card.&lt;br/&gt;Note: If the new card forces the player to exceed the hand limit, the player must exchange a card of his hand face down with the card of the Depot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is called &amp;quot;Expansion 4,&amp;quot; as the first three expansions are already in the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
