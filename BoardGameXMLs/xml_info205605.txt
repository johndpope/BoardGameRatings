			<description>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Your city is being threatened by ruthless and corrupt organizations who seek to profit off the backs of your friends and neighbors. It&amp;rsquo;s time for someone to stand up and fight back. The odds are stacked against you and your fellow justice seekers, but maybe, with the right strategy, equipment and training you can chase the Minions out of your city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;Create a hero and go on patrol to take down the corrupt organizations and their minions that threaten your city. Beat the clock, against schemes that empower the Villain, uncovering their identity and stopping them once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Vigilante is a campaign, deck construction game with a sprawling city of Schemes that you and your friends' heroes move through, playing cards and rolling dice to combat. The challenge is knowing which Schemes are most important to stop, because the ones that you fail to prevent add new abilities to the Villain and his lair. Reward cards will give you temporary upgrades and gear can be combined to unlock new equipment and weapons. Upgrade your team's base or your own vehicle? The choice is yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
