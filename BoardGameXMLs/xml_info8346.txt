			<description>Quite nice Memory variant...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place cards on 6 different desert locations. Placement  of the next card is depended on the card placed before. Cards show 1-3 of 4 different desert inhabitants. After each location contains one card or one location contains 3 cards, 3 question cards are drawn. Players have to guess either how many desert inhabitants of a certain kind are in play or how many of each of them are on a certain location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this sounds quite simple it is pretty tough. No luck involved - just good memory helps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
