			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure for the RPG Operation: Fallen Reich, for 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short adventure suitable for a 2-3 hour game, starting in London, November 18, 1937. The adventure works well with new characters who just has been recruited to the O:FR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot Excerpt:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Callahan House is an old building with a very long and eventful story. The building is located in what now is the outskirts of the small town East Dereham, about 15 miles east of Norwich. It is the oldest building in the village, and it was first recorded in books in the early sixteens century. The basement is much older than that, and it do contain a secret that has been well kept since the days of Merlin and Arthur. Hidden in the basement behind a well hidden secret door, is a catacomb where a fallen has been trapped. Powerful magic seals of the area and even blocks any paranormal abilities to detect the presence of a fallen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the centuries, many children have discovered the secret door in search for adventure and unknowingly wandered into the catacomb. Those moments have ended in disasters, and three times have the house been burnt down, leaving only the stone bedrock, In every fire many people have died, but never enough people to give the fallen power enough to break the seal that keeps him locked in here. The house have then been rebuilt after each fire, while the fallen have still been trapped deep below. The fallen is not physically trapped, but can only leave the catacombs for a short period of time, using a controlled body. To leave the place for good, a powerful ritual has to take place, which requires a large amount of dead people to break the bond locking his spiritual form to this very place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to the present time. For the past two months, whole families have been disappearing from the small town of East Dereham. It all began when the young boy Allister Clarke went missing, and a few days later his family. Then a week later another family, then another. Scotland Yard put their best man on the job, Detective Inspector Sir Henry Porter, but after three weeks and several families gone missing, the Yard have turned over the case, first to M.I.5, then it ended up on the desk of the commander of Operation: Fallen Reich. --&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
