			<description>The striking lime green plastic circular gameboard is about 15&amp;quot; in diameter.  It is divided into twelve equal segments, each with a hole near the circumference.  A small ball on a string is attached to the center of the board.  The board has been designed with incomplete joins between each of the twelve sectors so that it is possible to flip the ball upwards by pressing down on the edge of any particular segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players select an equal area of the board to patrol.  If the ball is flipped into an opponent's hole, the player who achieved this is awarded a point.  Each segment has three rows of holes for colored scoring pegs; a peg is placed in the top row of each segment at the start of the game.  When a point is scored, any one peg from the relevant player's segments is moved down one row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move all their score pegs from the top to the bottom row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
