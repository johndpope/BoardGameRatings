							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tarzan: Lord of the Jungle</name>
									
			<description>Players get to control Tarzan (based on the famous character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs for his novel Tarzan of the Apes) in six different missions set in Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These include curing the Great Ape's disease and saving his friends from the evil poachers. These poachers want to capture the wildlife and place them in their zoos. Weapons that can be utilized include: spears, knives, and arrows. Pitfalls and obstacles are to be avoided in order to collect the mandatory quest item. Under a strict time limit, players can swing on vines and swim vast bodies of water to cross various parts of stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tarzan: Lord of the Jungle&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
