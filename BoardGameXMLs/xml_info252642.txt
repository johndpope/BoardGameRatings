							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rolemaster Blog Monthly (Issue 10 - Feb 2018)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brian wrote recently that he had published nearly 200 documents for Shadow World on the Rolemaster Blog and the Rolemaster Forums. What I want to achieve here is bring these together into the first printed edition of Brian&amp;rsquo;s Alternative Spell Law or BASiL as it has become known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is my understanding that BASiL is a working document in that it is still evolving and new spell lists are being introduced all the time. What I will publish here will be the aggregated documents that Brian shared on the blog and the supporting articles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
