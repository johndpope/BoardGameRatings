			<description>The IN Game or Initials Game is a game in which you make your way around a board and as you go, you are challenged to figure out famous athletes, politicians, entertainers, and other influential historical figures. You are given their initials, one clue, and 30 seconds.  For example: GW and &amp;quot;The father of our country.&amp;quot;  The answer is George Washington. WS and 'He bought Alaska.&amp;quot; The answer is William Seward.  Land on a BETS space, and opponents can place bets (double or nothing) on whether or not you can answer a clue in a tough category.  The IN Game includes 1,200 different clues. This game can be played with 2-6 individual players or in teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
