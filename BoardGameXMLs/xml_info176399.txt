			<description>In this fast paced family card game, you must get your rats from the dirty bilges of the lower decks to the life rafts on the upper levels of the ship! Race the rising flood waters and other rats to the top. But beware! Your opponents will try anything to slow your progress and beat you out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rats! is all about friendly competitive play. You and your family will have hours of fun leading your rats to safety. Use well placed cheese and holes to stop and slow your opponents down before they do the same to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rats! players have three moves to move their rats from room to room. Cards players gain can increase the number of moves they have and also can be played on other players to slow them down. Rats can only go up a level when they find a ladder after exploring the doomed ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round of play, each player rolls a die to determine if they can flood the ship. Each flooded space is removed from play, along with any rats trapped inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score points, players must escape the five levels of the ship to safety. The player with the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
