							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Richard Petty Grand National Champion Race Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A hilarious, family fun game for up to six players of all ages. It combines the grand sport of competitive racing with total craziness, for a race you will never forget.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No player has an advantage no matter what their age. Just because you are ahead, it doesn't mean you will win the race. You may be within half a lap of winning and be sent to the pits, by your best friend; or you may be cruising along minding your own business when some blockhead behind you involves you in an accident and WACKO! off to the pits you both go; or you may draw the dreaded 'Blown Engine' card and be put out of the race.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There are 30 'fate' cards you may have to draw from -- some are good, some are bad, and some are downright awful. No one is safe from the 'fickle finger of fate', so don't get mad -- get even!!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: game board, six miniature race cars, thirty fate cards, two standard dice, twenty-four green lap chips, twenty-four yellow lap chips, and an instruction sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
