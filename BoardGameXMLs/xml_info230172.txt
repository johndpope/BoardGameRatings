			<description>&amp;quot;The Executive Trivia Game&amp;quot;. Game consists of six decks of cards, a game board, and four colored markers. The decks are shuffled together, then the players take turns answering questions from the category of their choice (people, places, or things). If the player answers correctly, they move the number of spaces (1-4) indicated at the top of the card. There the player must answer a question in the category dictated by the color of the square they have landed on. The same player continues until they answer incorrectly. Play proceeds clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some squares are marked &amp;quot;Knockoff&amp;quot;. If a player lands on one of these, they pick the category for their question. If they answer correctly, they may either go again, or &amp;quot;knockoff&amp;quot; an opponent by sending them back to start. The player knocked off now has a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win by reaching the end square by exact count of spaces indicated by the card, and correctly answering a question in a category chosen by their opponent. If a player on the end square answers incorrectly, they remain there, and are eligible to be knocked-off by an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
