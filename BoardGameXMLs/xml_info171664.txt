			<description>Use your wits and think ahead and the numbers will work for you. A competitive board game that combines dice throwing and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of four sets of the numbers 1 to 18, one for each player, and a small pit in the middle. Each player also receives 20 rings in their colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes turns throwing the three dice provided taking turns they use the die values in a math equation to mark numbers in their set with a ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;e.g; If you throw a 2,3 and 4 you could mark these three numbers as they are &lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;2+3=5 and 4&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;2 and 3x4=12&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;2+3x4=18&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;what ever equation you can come up with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numbers can be used in any order but can only be utilised once each in any equation each turn. Difficulty scales with the players as they learn to utilise square-roots and more in their equations. Once a players marks all their numbers (1-18) they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also some player interaction as each player has extra loops in their colour. Loops can also be used to block a number on an opponents board. Just achieve the desired number with the dice results and you can place a ring on that number in an opponents set. In order for the opponent to be able to mark the blocked number in their set they must first remove the invading ring. This is done by achieving that number and and using it to discard the opponents ring instead of place more of their own (you have to get the number a second time to put your own ring on it). Discarded rings can not be used again meaning that if any player should lose more than 2 rings they can never complete their set and as such can no longer win. Rings used to block can also be retrieved by their owner if the owner can achieve the same number again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
