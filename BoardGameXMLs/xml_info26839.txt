							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piecepack Letterbox</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the real-life outdoor sport of letterboxing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players hide &amp;quot;letterboxes&amp;quot; somewhere on the board and write clues for the other players. Everyone then attempts to find as many letterboxes as possible. A player gains victory points both when she finds other letterboxes and when other players find hers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has found all other letterboxes. The player with the most victory points is then the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game won the first Mesomorph Games Piecepack Competition in 2006, and is designed for a standard piecepack and the four seasons expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Super Duper Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
