			<description>From the box: Tenacious rail barons contend with civil disorder, internecine wars and each other in their drive to reach the rich mines of the high Andes of South America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tracks to Titicaca is a cousin of Tracks to Telluride, in which players strive to develop the best railroad networks in order to access the most profitable mines in the region.  Each turn, players acquire mines and build tracks to connect those mines. After a set number of turns or when someone reaches remote Sucre, Bolivia with a rail line, the winner is the player with the highest total mine revenue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crayon rail game with lower production values than most 'German games.' Note that for the year (1996) and the publisher (Winsome Games) who is known primarily for desktop published games, comparing this game to later games of a different genre isn't very helpful.  This game is clearly a &amp;quot;gamer's game&amp;quot; with game play emphasized over production values.  It is relatively difficult to find a copy, and the publisher is also known for small-batch releases with minimal reprinting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
