			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Slangology, one player draws a card that shows several slang words and definitions. That player acts as a &amp;quot;judge&amp;quot; for the round and reads one of the words aloud. Each player then writes a definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The judge then reads all of the definitions (including the actual correct one) aloud, without revealing which player wrote what. Then all players vote on which definition they believe is correct, which may be correct and which one they believe is definitely not correct by placing tokens with values of 3 points, 2 points and -1 point. Players earn points when other players believe theirs is correct, so the more believable the &amp;quot;definition&amp;quot; the better!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the next round, another player acts as judge and this time, the definition is read and all players must invent their own slang word to match the definition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
