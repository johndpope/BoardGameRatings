			<description>&amp;quot;Aero Elite: Combat Academy was only released for the PlayStation 2. This fourth and last sequel of the Aerowings/Aero dancing series was also considered the best: quality graphics, very detailed and animated 3D plane models, over 60 planes to fly (including Mig 29, SU27, Mirage2000, Harrier, A10, Tornado, etc), challenging missions and new original features like the &amp;quot;scramble&amp;quot; mode - a random interception mission where a player must take off, intercept an unknown intruder plane, take pictures to identify it, then return to the base and land to finish the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerowings/Aero dancing is considered by fans as the first true attempt of combat flight simulation on a console. On the contrary of the Arcade-oriented &amp;quot;Ace Combat&amp;quot;, the Aerowings series provides fairly accurate flight physics, 3D cockpits views, real weapons loads, possibilities to take off, land on airbase or carrier, refueling and a replay video system which is able to record your entire flight and offers you the possibility to create your own movie with more than 30 different cameras (including the popular &amp;quot;shaky cam&amp;quot;). The last Aero dancing called Aero Elite in the U.S. is also the last of the series because of the splitting of the creators company (CRI). This series is recommended for flying enthusiasts who like a fair amount of accuracy in a console flight game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Aero Elite: Combat Academy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
