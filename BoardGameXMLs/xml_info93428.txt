							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">stern Wissensquiz: die sechziger Jahre</name>
									
			<description>This quiz game is for 2-4 players or teams. The questions are all about the sixties. The nice twist in this game is that all players including the player who asked the question put a token (with the answer they think is the correct one) in the middle. Than they are all revealed and the questioner gets points according to the number of righ answers. 4 correct answers gives him 1 point, 3 give 2 points, 2 give 3 points and 1 correct answer gives him 4 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
