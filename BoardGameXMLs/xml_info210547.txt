			<description>Let's go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the CAVE/Raizing classics of the STG golden age, Blue Revolver is built from the ground up to be fast, lean and furious. Play as Mae - a rabbit-eared technical genius on the run from maniac environmental group &amp;quot;Blue Revolver&amp;quot;, and shoot through 5 stages of struggle. Snowy mountains, busy dockyards, nightmare bases and more await you on your fight-and-flight rampage - each packed to the brim with vicious enemies, violent bosses and thousands of bullets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're far from helpless though. Your ship is just as good at spewing out bullets as anything they can offer, and comes loaded with enough smart bombs to turn even the most nightmarish situation upside down - not only that, but each ship type comes with four special weapons to choose from, fully charged and customized for any number of tasks - slicing through groups of enemies, carving up bosses, blocking bullets or turning a screen full of chaos into a screen full of glistening point items!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
