							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nickel &amp; Dime Pool</name>
									
			<description>Nickel &amp;amp; Dime Pool is a dexterity, flicking game based on pool. Coins are used in place of balls. They are &amp;quot;flicked&amp;quot; with your finger instead of using a pool cue. A larger, nickel-sized coin is used as the cue ball and 10 dime-sized coins represent the rest of the balls. The small coins are split into 2 groups, solids and stripes. One player/team uses solids, numbered 1-5, the other uses stripes, numbered 6-10. The goal is to be the first player/team to sink all of their respective coins into the pockets. The board is square, molded plastic with 6 pockets. 1 at each of the 4 corners and 1 one along either side midway down the board. Just like billiards, the cue coin is used to sink the other coins into the pockets by flicking it into the numbered coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with board, 11 coins, plastic triangular rack and vinyl pouch to hold coins. Vinyl decals are supplied to apply to the coins, representing the different numbered balls, 1-10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
