			<description>The Game&lt;br/&gt;Fleets at War! is a tactical wargame played on the floor or a large table with cardboard counters representing starships, fighters, and other space craft, set in the same universe as the Imperium Chronicles Role Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt; The wargame consists of three major factions: the Imperium, the Magna Supremacy, and the Pirate Clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMP System&lt;br/&gt;Fleets at War! uses the IMP System that reduces the number of die rolls necessary during play.  All other calculations are done by referencing a chart of two opposing attributes (ex. Damage vs. Armor) to find a result.  The goal of this system is to speed up play and allow for large-scale battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale&lt;br/&gt;Each counter in the game represents a single starship or a flight of four to five fighters.  An inch equals approximately 0.2 miles, or a mile equals 5 inches.  Each game turn equals roughly 2 to 3 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;Each class of ship (i.e.: heavy cruiser, destroyer, frigate, etc.) has a one- or two-sided card listing all the stats for that class, including its offensive and defensive capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
