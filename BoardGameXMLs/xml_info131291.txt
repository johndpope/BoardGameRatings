			<description>Game from the inside covers of the 1964 Boy's Own Paper Annual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOLLOW THE TRAIL AND FIND THE PIRATE'S TREASURE!&lt;br/&gt;Here's an exciting game that calls for some skill and judgement. Up to 13 players can take part. All you need is a small, coloured counter for each player and one die. Players throw the die in turn and move their counter according to the table below.&lt;br/&gt;First throw a 6 and then start from any square at the west end of the map. STOP if you come up against a natural obstruction (such as a volcano or swamp), or the edge of the map, or a square occupied by an opponent&amp;rsquo;s counter, and lose the remainder of that move.&lt;br/&gt;If you throw:&lt;br/&gt;1 - Move one square in any direction and have another throw.&lt;br/&gt;2 - Rest on your present square until the next throw.&lt;br/&gt;3 - Bonus. Move three squares in any direction &amp;mdash; including a combination of forward and sideways.&lt;br/&gt;4 - Move four squares South.&lt;br/&gt;5 - Move five squares North.&lt;br/&gt;6 - Move six squares East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will be the first player to reach the treasure island on the right hand side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
