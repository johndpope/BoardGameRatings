			<description>Cops and Robbers is a two-player card game that pits a deck of Cop cards against a deck of Robber cards.  Each player races to occupy the locations provided to either gain loot as the Robber, or protect the city as the Cop.  The Cop player also attempts to arrest Robbers that are on locations. The game ends when the Robber has gained 24 loot, or the Cop has 24 arrests.  The cop can also win by stopping the Robber from getting 24 loot after all the locations have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cop and Robber each have a deck that includes Units, Items, and Actions.  The Units and Items are used to occupy the locations.  Each location requires a different number to occupy, and a specific number of turns.  There are 4 locations out at a time, and 24 locations in the game in total. The Action cards are used to affect things like occupy time, defense and attack buffs, and hand management. If a player wins a location uncontested, as a Robber they win the loot, and the Cop gets 1 more location off the game board. If the other player does contest while occupied, they must play that same number of Units and Items required against the occupied player.  Each Unit has a level and it becomes a war type-highest number wins after all levels  are added up, action cards are played, and a die is rolled.  Along with the win, the player also get an Event card, which can be played for big bonuses and affect the game positively or negatively.&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, each player has a home base.  The Robber has their Hideout, and the Cops stay in the Police Station.  Loot and arrests are also held in these home bases, and through the play of an event card, Each player can attack the others home base for bonuses, and to lower the number of arrests and loot they have collected.  &lt;br/&gt;Its a fun fast paced 2 player game, with a fun light theme, and some great art and cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
