							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jacksonville: the Beaches of DOOM</name>
									
			<description>JagdPanther magazine #15, renamed BATTLEFIELD magazine OCT-1976-Jacksonville: the Beaches of Doom is a hypothetical &amp;quot;what if?&amp;quot; depiction of an invasion of the USA. in 1997, following a major War in Europe by about 15 years, according to the game description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Equipment consists of the following: a game Mapsheet-17-inches by 28-inches; a RULES section; a large double-sheet pull-out; 2-Sets of thin Game Counters; while players will have to provide their OWN 6-sided DIE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mapsheet is overall WHITE with BLUE water features and BLACK print for other terrain. The Game Counters are Light BLUE &amp;amp; Light PINK with Darker Color silhouettes for each of the various Unit types such as: Tanks; S.P. Artillery; Towed Artillery; Helicopters; Cruise Missile Launchers; Naval Units; Air Units; and Infantry Types. Altogether, there are 44 different types of units, including Hovercraft (Soviet), IL-44 Medium Bomber (Soviet), US Army XM-2 Tank (M1-Abrams?), Soviet Aircraft Carriers, and even the U.S.N. Battle cruiser TEXAS! The pull-out Sheet has the Terrain Effects Chart, Base Attack Table &amp;amp; explanation, Anti-Ship Bombardment Table &amp;amp; explanation, Summary of Sequence of Play, Combat Results Table, Anti-Aircraft Table, Air-to-Air Combat Results Table, Bombardment Table, and Strategic Display with nearby bases of Pensacola, Atlanta, Montgomery, Georgetown, U.S. &amp;amp; Soviet Rear Areas, Havana, Bermuda, a Beachhead area and Soviet Fleet Carrier displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RULES are very detailed and concise for being only 4 pages long, Front &amp;amp; Back printed. We ended up making our own &amp;quot;crude&amp;quot; Strategic Rear Area/Fleet Display in order to increase its size for game play. Game length is 18 turns representing 6 days and each Player Turn consists of 15 Phases (including Advanced-Air) so if you exclude the AIR game, the turns will proceed quicker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BATTLEFIELD (formerly Jag Panther) magazine was a Variant filled production of the founders of Task Force games with contributions by Alan Emrich, Robert C. Smith, James Frediani, James Simms, Howard Anderson, Mike Smith, Hershel M. Sarnoff, David Kopel, David Curtis, Andy Webber, David Jameson, John M. Astell, Paul F. Stevenson, John Mischon, Michael Forbes, Eric Kyllo, John Berry, plus many others. Thanks to all of THEM for their many informed and added game play contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
