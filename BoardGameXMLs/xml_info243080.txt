			<description>PlingPong is a dexterity game.  The game comes with four (4) interlocking trays to create a single game board, which holds a black cup in the middle and four (4) sets of six (6) colored cups on each tray. Each player get a color (or two (2) colors if playing with two (2) players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is played on any table you can bounce a ping pong ball on. With the board setup diagonally, players shoot over their color, to hit the other player&amp;rsquo;s cups. In each round players shoot twice, then score the round; empty cups stay on the board, cups with an Odd number of balls come off and cups with an Even number of balls stay on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to bounce your shots into the opponent&amp;rsquo;s cups, while avoiding the black cup in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the black cup has an odd numbers of balls, each player who placed a ball in the cup lose one of their cups, and the other players gain a cup. Even if you have no cups left, you are still in the game, because you will get one back when someone makes a black cup shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player with cups on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
