			<description>Hattrick is a fast-paced soccer card game with 89 cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 60 team player cards (4 x 15 per team: England, Germany, Switzerland, Brazil)&lt;br/&gt;-  6 all-star player cards&lt;br/&gt;-  8 interrupt cards&lt;br/&gt;-  5 punishment cards&lt;br/&gt;-  3 special cards&lt;br/&gt;-  5 goal cards&lt;br/&gt;-  2 rule cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player cards are either goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders or attackers. The 4 teams have different numbers of each of these player card types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with an imaginary ball on a imaginary soccer field with 4 parts: the goal room, the defense, the midfield and the attacking sector, assuming that the players always stay in their sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, a player can play 1 card more than his opponent has played in his previous turn, but these cards must be from the same team (all-stars are used as jokers). Anyway, the first card must always be a card that &amp;quot;stops&amp;quot; the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal is scored, when an attacker can't be stopped with an appropriate card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
