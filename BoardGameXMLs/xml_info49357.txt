			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legend - Loose upon the winds of the tempest, astride his fierce steed, is a rider, a creature of rage, a creature of the storm. It is said you can see him dancing over the gray clouds, urging the winds onward to greater ferocity. When his anger is especially fierce, he descends to the earth to wreck havoc upon the good folk, leaving only his flaming hoofprints behind. Some say he was a man whose passion overcame him, and who now looses his rage upon the winds of the storm. The magus Grimgroth insists he is an elemental, a magical incarnation of the air. Others say he is a foul demon, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, sent to earth to torment the good folk of the valley. However, all of them know him as...The Stormrider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This kit includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Eight pre-generated characters, complete with personal backgrounds and detailed personalities.&lt;br/&gt;    * Briefing sheets which explain the rules simply and succinctly. Your players do not have to read the game to play in this story; these one-page briefings are all they need.&lt;br/&gt;    * An adventure designed to guide you (the storyguide) through your first Ars Magica story.&lt;br/&gt;    * Begin play in half an hour or less. All you need to do is to read this kit beforehand, and review selected chapters from Ars Magica itself.&lt;br/&gt;    * No mere dungeon crawl, this story explores the full mystery and scope of myths and legends. A story in all senses of the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this kit you can begin your first game of Ars Magica in half an hour or less -- using the rules briefing and characters provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(16 pages + 22 loose briefing sheets.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
