							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Keno</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple Bingo/Keno game with 2 variations of play. In the first game, each player receives a card with 16 numbers (valued 1-6) printed randomly on it in a 4x4 grid. On a turn, a player rolls a die and places a chip on his card over the number rolled. If more than 1 number rolled is uncovered on his card, the player chooses which one to place a chip on. The first player to place 4 chips in row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, calls out &amp;quot;KENO&amp;quot; and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second game, players roll 2 dice and cover both the numbers rolled. When a player covers all the spots on his card, the player calls out &amp;quot;KENO&amp;quot; and play stops. The Keno caller scores 60 points (the sum of all the numbers on his card). The other players add up all the numbers they have covered, and if the number ends with 0 or 5 (45, 50, 55 etc.), the points are taken by the player who called KENO. If the number does not end with 0 or 5, the points are credited to the player who holds that particular card. The first player to score 500 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     8 Bingo cards showing 16 die faces in 4x4 grid&lt;br/&gt;     2 dice&lt;br/&gt;     128 circular paper chits for bingo markers&lt;br/&gt;     instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
