			<description>Adventurous and challenging! Dare to go on an adventure without fear on the road of the reprobates. Find your own special powercard by using your cards very smart. Beware! You will see only the cards from your opponenents and they see your cards. In order to know which cards you held you try to ask smart questions as much as possible. When you've found your powercards turn your summary so only you can see them and than you can go directly to the road of the reprobates. If you are the first who enters the road of the reprobates, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
