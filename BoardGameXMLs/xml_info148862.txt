							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Night Shift</name>
									
			<description>Night Shift is a Solitaire board game with Survival Horror themes. It describes the efforts of three different characters (an FBI agent, a security guard, and a mercenary) as they seek to survive a night of Lovecraftian horror as monsters and madness descend upon a storage facility nestled between the sea and a spooky wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played out on an 8x8 hex grid and simulates the escape of a character through a simple set of movement and action rules. Enemies actions are controlled by a simple set of A.I., unique to each enemy, while the scenario to be played can be determined randomly and can be modified slightly according to preference or dice roll. The main driving force of the game is a narrative table, aptly called the Horror Table, which produces results that apply mechanical changes to game play as well as describe the nature of the dark events befalling your character. Couple with a search table, Night Shift creates an environment rife with spooky stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally created for the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
