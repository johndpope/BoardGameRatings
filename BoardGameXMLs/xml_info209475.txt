			<description>The Game Room by Black Toad Games is a live-action puzzle adventure you host in your own home. Your guests compete against each other in a furious race to solve puzzles, open locks, and claim their reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step into the shoes of hot-shot news reporters racing to solve a maze of clues and puzzles in order to earn an exclusive interview with a notorious mad-man! Only the winning team will land the story, so brush up on your favorite board games if you hope to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You become the Game Master by using the online Game Master Portal to customize the game to your space and players. You choose whether to print puzzles or use your own props. Use real locks or the virtual locks provided online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tear-n-Play version available which requires no Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
