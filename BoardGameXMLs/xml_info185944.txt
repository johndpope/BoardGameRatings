			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's finally here, Halloween! Trick or Treating! Candy! You and your friends have been waiting all year for this glorious evening and now it has arrived! And, this year it's going to be special. This year you're heading to Golden Oaks, the ritzy neighborhood where the real treats await! No more rock hard Mary Janes or stale candy corn for you! Those bronze door knockers in Golden Oaks will bring you a real haul. King sized candy bars, giant battery operated lollipops, silver dollars, and more! All that remains now is to don your costume and meet your friends on the road to the sugary paradise of Golden Oaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only, there's a couple small snags. All the big kids are out tonight too, and they'd rather steal candy than get it on their own. Then there's getting to Golden Oaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sure, you could follow Drewry Lane out past the high school and enter Golden Oaks from the east side, but that would take hours of walking and you don't have hours to waste with so many houses to hit, so many treats to claim. That means taking a shortcut. That means going through Old Man Fedwicks Farm. People, kids mostly, say the old man is off his rocker. There's all kinds of stories about what he's done to kids who got caught on his property. That isn't going to stop you though. You've got your friends and there's safety in numbers. Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
