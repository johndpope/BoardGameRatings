			<description>'Take Over' is a board game about gaining control of a company by building up a holding of the shares, and subsequently preventing other players from doing the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For up to 9 people - 8 players and a Chairman. With less than 8 players, the excess companies are removed from play and their squares on the board are covered over leaving only the companies in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns to roll a die and move a single counter around the board, the square the counter lands on affects all players in the game who has the shares in that company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is similar to monopoly with the companies separated by general bonus or penalty squares that affect all players in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the counter passes the start the current round ends and the chairman invites bank investments or overdrafts, collects overdraft payments, and oversees the buying and selling of shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time during the round, a player cannot pay all the penalties then he has to sell shares to the chairman for a fixed price. At the beginning of the next round all players can buy those shares also at a fixed price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when 1 player has all 8 shares in 1 company, they get a &amp;pound;1000 bonus. All players then add up their holdings in shares and money the player with the largest holding wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
