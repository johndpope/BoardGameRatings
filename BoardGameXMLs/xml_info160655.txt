			<description>Investars is a collaborative game, where players work together to collectively achieve Big Goals, accumulate money in their retirement savings account, use their individual salaries to Invest in companies, and try to get all their pieces back Home to retire and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investars is played in rounds, each simulating a decade in your life.  The team starts in their 20s with a salary, multiple Stock Tokens to invest in companies, and empty savings accounts.  Every round starts with paying salaries, doubling the value of each savings account, and rolling the dice to find which companies pay off investments - or potentially go out of business. If companies go out of business, their tiles are removed from the game, potentially blocking players' paths to the Big Goals and Home. Then, it is the team&amp;rsquo;s turn, and each player makes several actions toward winning the game: Move, Invest, Achieve, Save, or Withdraw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With good planning, lots of teamwork, and a bit of luck, players will achieve their Big Goals and retire in style as successful Investars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, while you're having fun playing Investars, you'll also learn a bit about compound interest, savings accounts, and planning for long-term goals. In short, you'll learn how to be better investors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
