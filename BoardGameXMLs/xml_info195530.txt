			<description>The player travels to Sugar Village to pick up his grandfather's things after hearing that he has died. He learns that the village will be turned into an amusement park, and encounters three &amp;quot;Harvest sprites&amp;quot; and the Harvest Goddess, who ask him to stay on the farm and help them. The player then decides to take over his grandfather's farm and work hard to turn the village around. By choosing different paths, you can find up to 16 ways to save the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Harvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
