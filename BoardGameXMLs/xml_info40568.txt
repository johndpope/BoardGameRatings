			<description>Guard the Hive's Golden Treasure! was published on the back of a Honey Nut Cheerios cereal box in 2008. The cereal box comes with a Magic Compass Decoder that is used in playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guard the Hive's Golden Treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buzz and his friends want to move the honey that makes Honey Nut Cheerios cereal so delicious across the amber ocean. But Yellow Jack and his crew won't make it easy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Play:&lt;br/&gt;Help Buzz transport the honey across the ocean or challenge a friend to see who can get there first. To play, flip a coin to determine how many spaces to move. Heads move one space, tails moves two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you land on a compass, place your magic compass decoder on the spot and move it back and forth to reveal the symbol for your next move. Use the key to determine the value for each symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
