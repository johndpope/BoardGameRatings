							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extreme Violence</name>
									
			<description>Extreme Violence is a computer game for the Commodore Amiga, released in 1991 as a shareware game. It was written by Simon Green in AMOS (an Amiga version of BASIC programming language).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was later introduced to a larger market after it was included on a cover disk of the magazine Amiga Power, issue 24 (April 1993). It is a two player, top-down view shoot 'em up, in which players battle it out in a randomly generated maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to shoot the other player's character using a generic basic gun, or one of the power-ups that are dotted around the level. The first player to kill his opponent ten times wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Extreme Violence&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
