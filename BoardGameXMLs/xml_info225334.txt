			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alice has gone away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She can no longer find herself. It all started one sunny afternoon, where Dream saw his chance to grab Alice. Alice lay in the park reading when a young man with white hair, blue vest, and long white rabbit ears came by. Alice wondered if the young man was human under all that hair, and then she discovered that a pair of winter gloves were sticking out of the young man's back pocket. This sparked Alice's curiosity, because the sun was shining hot and it was in the middle of summer. She got up quickly and hurried after the young rabbit man, around a corner, and into a tunnel. And Alice fell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And fell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And fell far&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And deep and slow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
