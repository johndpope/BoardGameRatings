							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Xen&#039;drik Expeditions Fastplay Characters - Level 1</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate rapid play with new players, the organize play campaign promoted a large number of &amp;quot;fastplay&amp;quot; characters built at level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from easy use, every fastplay character was keyed to a specific Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Miniatures figurine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player used a fastplay character and that character's specific miniature, a bonus feature was unlocked.  Note that experience points gained when using a fastplay character could be transferred to the player's default character if the fastplay character and the player's default character were the same character class.  Note that most fastplay characters were aligned with a faction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-page character sheet builds at this level include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Aasimar (Planetouched) Knight&lt;br/&gt;        Changeling Rogue&lt;br/&gt;        Changeling Wizard&lt;br/&gt;        Drow Sorcerer&lt;br/&gt;        Elf (High) Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Elf Druid&lt;br/&gt;        Elf Ranger&lt;br/&gt;        Gnoll Fighter&lt;br/&gt;        Half-elf Bard&lt;br/&gt;        Half-elf Cleric&lt;br/&gt;        Half-orc Barbarian&lt;br/&gt;        Human Fighter (1st variant)&lt;br/&gt;        Human Fighter (2nd variant)&lt;br/&gt;        Human Monk&lt;br/&gt;        Human Paladin&lt;br/&gt;        Human Ranger&lt;br/&gt;        Human Rogue&lt;br/&gt;        Human Wizard (Diviner)&lt;br/&gt;        Shifter Scout&lt;br/&gt;        Tiefling Duskblade&lt;br/&gt;        Warforged Scout Ranger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
