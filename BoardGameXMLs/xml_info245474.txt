							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abak Evolution Backgammon</name>
									
			<description>Abak Evolution is a variant of the traditional Backgammon game that includes different classes of checkers in the game, with special features each. This features are the ability of going backwards, trapping a checker instead of hitting it, limited movement (an analogy of wounded soldiers), and extra strength (or an analogy for it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of backgammon rules are present in Abak Evolution, with 3 general additions.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; A point or column can only stack five checkers (this is known as the Egyptian rule on standard backgammon, but is not often used in the classic version).&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; The checkers in a column must be moved in order from top to bottom.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; There are 6 classes of checkers:&lt;br/&gt;        ◦ General: It can move backwards.&lt;br/&gt;        ◦ Druid: It immobilize an opponent, instead of hit it.&lt;br/&gt;        ◦ Guards (Each team has two) : It can block the column being alone in it.&lt;br/&gt;        ◦ Regular (Pawn, each team has 9) : No difference with backgammon. &lt;br/&gt;        ◦ Wounded&lt;br/&gt;            ▪ Odd : It can only move if the die number is 1,3,5. Odd numbers.&lt;br/&gt;            ▪ Even : It can only move if  the die number is 2,4,6. Even numbers.&lt;br/&gt;               &lt;br/&gt;Each of these classes have their own set of rules, and all rules must be fulfilled in order to make a legal move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of Classes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The General is a checker that has the ability to go backwards. Some limitations are applied:&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; During a turn, when it goes backwards, it can no move again, neither backward, nor forward.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; During a turn, when it goes forward, it can not move backwards the next movement.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; It can only move forward if the are other checkers of his team outside it's home.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; When playing from the bar , the next movement can be backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Druid:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The druid Traps a checker, instead of hit it. The druid is placed over that checker, not allowing it to move until is off. &lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; This feature is present only in middle camp. At any home, it hit the checker, behaving as a regular checker. &lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; It can be hit by any other class. &lt;br/&gt;    &amp;bull; While the druid is trapping an enemy checker, it can stack more checkers over it. If it is alone over the checker, it can be hit by any checker, or trapped by the enemy druid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guard:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guards behave like two checkers together. Being alone in a column, is a blocked position for a regular checker. The special rules on guards are the following:&lt;br/&gt;- A checker can't hit a single guard, unless that checker is another guard.&lt;br/&gt;- The druid can trap a guard when it is alone.&lt;br/&gt;- Two no-guards checkers can hit a guard that is alone if both hit on the guard position in consecutive movements during the turn (a movement known as jane in Middle East).&lt;br/&gt;- Each team has 2 guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wounded:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The checker in the wounded class have limited movements. There is the Even Wounded and The Odd Wounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even Wounded: Moves only if the number of the dice is even (2,4,6).&lt;br/&gt;- When playing from the bar, or bearing off, it can move any number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Odd Wounded: Moves only if the number of the dice is odd (1,3,5).&lt;br/&gt;- When playing from the bar, or bearing off, it can move any number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldiers:&lt;br/&gt;- Regular checkers that behave like backgammon checkers.&lt;br/&gt;- Each team have 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
