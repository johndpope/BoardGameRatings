			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s Something Rotten in the City of Q*Berg is the role playing game for those who have ever asked themselves what life would be like if all problems could be solved by jumping. It&amp;rsquo;s a game that balances role playing and character development for both the Q*Folk and the Coiled as they make their way through the Q*World and good, ol&amp;rsquo; fashioned Q*Bert action. The game also delivers a wholly plausible (i.e., made up) story on why Coily was out to get our orange hero from the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who really want to adventure in the city of Q*Bert, there are complete rules for joining factions, casting spells, and useful skills for pickpockets and lock pickers! Can the heroes solve the mystery behind the horde of pulverizing pineapple? Can the heroes stop the nefarious gremlins&amp;rsquo; schemes and turn the Coiled back into peace green snakes again? If the The Ancient Order of the Q*Bringers of Q*Light doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, why are they included as a faction and how come Q*Bert is a member? Will the O*Folk try to recruit you for their own schemes??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing is needed except a couple of players, some lint, and a D2! It also has LARP rules and instructions on how to make your own Q*Bert! Created after literally minutes of reading on the history of Q*Bert, this game strives to stay true to the original, but adds a rules light way to role play in the Q*World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
