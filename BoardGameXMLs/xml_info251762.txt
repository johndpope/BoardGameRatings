							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deliverance of Reine</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An act of violence on the besieged world of Oris sets a disparate group of wanderers on a path to heroism. When their skill at neutralizing the threat gains them their first shared job &amp;mdash; extracting the terrorist daughter of a police captain ahead of a planned raid &amp;mdash; they face a shocking discovery and the prospect of welcoming a new member to their fledgling band: death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deliverance of Reine is a one-page, no-frills starter adventure for Cepheus Engine, starring characters of varied career backgrounds. The referee should have little trouble adapting the scenario for other RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic, including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game. The adventure is designed to assemble an adventuring team for the first time while avoiding the clich&amp;eacute; of meeting in a bar or tavern. The action literally throws the heroes together into a life-or-death situation, giving them a chance to make far more lasting bonds, while providing a coherent backstory for their party's formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
