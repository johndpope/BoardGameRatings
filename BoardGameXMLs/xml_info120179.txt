			<description>&amp;quot;SafeKracka is a complex psychological puzzle that will test your ability to get into other people's minds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a series of 30 safes to crack. That's a lot of combinations. But you know the owner of each safe, and you understand that people choose a number with personal significance as a basis for the combination, like a birth date, a special event, or even an old army serial number. All you have to do is read their minds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some combinations will come easily, others may take days of careful research. But difficulty is rewarded and you can progress from Punk to Grand Master SafeKracka, by checking your ability against all other players worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;    No time limit - this may take you months.&lt;br/&gt;    Beautifully rendered safe artwork - historic, contemporary and futuristic.&lt;br/&gt;    Play the game in any order - just swipe left or right for another safe.&lt;br/&gt;    Easy-to use-rolling combination interface - just flick with your finger&lt;br/&gt;    Opened safes reveal their secret and are automatically saved.&lt;br/&gt;    'Guest Mode' allows you to reset the game temporarily so a friend can test their skill.&lt;br/&gt;    Compare your ability by direct link to an online score database.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
