			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Animalacious everyone is an animal. The object of the game is to guess which animal you are. If you woke up one day as a different animal and there were no mirrors how would you figure out which animal you are? Well, you would use cunning and craftiness and you would observe those around you, and of course you&amp;rsquo;d use your animal instincts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically: Imagine Celebrity Head where you are an animal rather than a celebrity. Add a deck of cards with pre-specified questions (descriptions), in response to which all players vote for which animal best fits that description. Points are scored for voting for the most popular choice! Players are entitled to guess the identity of their animal after scoring 10 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include cards (identities and questions), headbands, name badges, dry-erase markers and voting wheels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
