			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are those who quite simply do one thing and do it well; this is a game about a team of such people, each of whom has a unique skill that they are well practiced in. The team works together to overcome the challenges they face, overcoming adversity to secure their prize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important thing to note about Unique Services is that it is a game for five people: four of them take on the role of the specialists in the team, the fifth is the GM who throws challenges at them and acts as their adversaries throughout the game. You can play the game with as few as three people, but it will be a very different experience; you can&amp;rsquo;t play with more than five though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
