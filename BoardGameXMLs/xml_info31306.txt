			<description>We are customers visiting the market. Sometimes we buy things. Sometimes we just look. Sometimes we return stuff. It's up to us to decide what to buy or just look at. Each vendor must sell enough to be able to come back another day. If they don't make some money or even lose money, they will leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, the object is to watch out for everyone's welfare. To do this well, we must discuss, plan, &amp;amp; problem-solve together, so everyone will enjoy some success. Lots of decision making for each player. The basic game plays quickly, with an advanced game for older players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
