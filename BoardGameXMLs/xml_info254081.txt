							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frostgrave: The Wizard&#039;s Conclave</name>
									
			<description>In this new supplement for Frostgrave, some of the biggest names in gaming turn their creative powers towards the Frozen City, each contributing a scenario and adding their own flair to the game. Featuring scenarios by Alessio Cavatore, Alex Buchel, Andy Chambers, Gav Thorpe, Chris Pramas, Daniel Mersey, Andrea Sfiligoi, and many more, this tome provides a collection of adventures that will pit players against unimaginable foes and challenges, pushing their wizards and warbands to new limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizards tend to be solitary, keeping to themselves and associating with a select few apprentices, followers, and henchmen. It is rare that they spend time in the company of other spellcasters, and rarer still that they work together. Now, however, something is about to take place that has not occurred since the great days of Felstad -- a gathering of wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
