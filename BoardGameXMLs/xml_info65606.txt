							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gypo Logging Board Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a roll-and-move game in the style of Monopoly. It has an &amp;quot;Inner Board&amp;quot;, similar to Careers, where you roll only one die, rather than two. It has no well-defined end-game conditions: simply play for a set period of time and then total up your assets (cash, businesses and equipment), with the win going to the player with the highest total value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the 1930's and late 80's was the heyday of the Gypo Logger. This was an era when a man, with very little or no formal education could get very rich in a short time, with a lot of backbreaking work, some good luck and with a highball crew working for him. Many more Gypo loggers also went broke in their ventures due to poor planning, unforeseen expenses, plain old 'bad luck' and a multitude of pitfalls which this game only touches the surface of. The term 'Gypo' refers to &amp;quot;haywire&amp;quot; or make do methods that are not necessarily proper--in other words lots of duct tape and haywire is holding everything together and you&amp;rsquo;re probably not using the right machine or tool anyway but somehow you're still getting the wood out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
