							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern: 13 Occult Languages</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the D20 Modern Roleplaying Game, the skills Read/Write Language and Speak Language are treated differently than other skills. For one, they have no key abilities associated with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this approach works perfectly well for most modern campaigns, it may not suit all of them, particularly those where obscure languages and the ability to understand them play an important role, as in many occult or supernatural campaigns. The following is a brief set of alternate rules for Game Masters who wish to introduce more linguistic detail into their D20 Modern Roleplaying Game campaigns. Also included is a list of thirteen&lt;br/&gt;occult languages for use in any campaign in which secret societies clash in the shadows, battling one another for control of ancient knowledge hidden for millennia and intelligible only to those who have mastered the esoteric tongues in which they were written.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
