			<description>&amp;quot;A Gun-Fighter Card Game for 2-8 Players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt five cards. On one turn a player draws the top card from the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile if there is one. A player may display a Bullet card from one&amp;rsquo;s hand or add the next card on one&amp;rsquo;s own sequence of Turn, Reach, Draw, Aim and Fire cards. Otherwise, the player must end the turn by discarding. After completing one&amp;rsquo;s own sequence, the player may use subsequent turns to use the Bullet cards to eliminate the other players one at a time. A player who is the target of another player&amp;rsquo;s Bullet may avoid elimination by discarding a Miss or Ricochet card. Playing a Distract card forces the targeted player to skip a turn. Play continues until the winner remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also contains some optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
