							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jeopardy! Remote</name>
									
			<description>The popular television quiz show is once again duplicated in a format that allows players to signal when one is ready to respond to a challenge. Each player uses a wireless remote to respond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game master holds the main console and reads the answer aloud as is appears on the screen. The console notes who has signaled, keeps score and enforces a time limit to keep the game moving. Rules from the television show apply in most cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Final Jeopardy round is multiple choice and wagers must be made in $100 increments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has mode to make the entire game multiple choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
