			<description>This is an Advanced Tobruk System expansion game that allows players to recreate squad-level action from World War II.  This expansion game, like all complete games and expansion games in the Advanced Tobruk System, uses the same ruleset from the system rulebook.  Gameplay is the same for all games and expansions.  It also comes with a Battlefield Walkaround booklet that points out landscape and terrain features specific to the game&amp;rsquo;s maps, and a few game-specific rules to reflect the unique circumstances the title portrays.  Rules additions and changes are kept to a minimum allowing players to get started right away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ATS, players alternate using impulses to move and fire infantry squads, armored vehicles and Heavy Weapons, to fulfill or deny completion of a scenario&amp;rsquo;s Victory Conditions.  Each scenario sets the victory conditions that one side must complete to be victorious, and the opposing player must prevent.  Draws are sometimes possible.  The counters have the overhead view of AFVs and vehicles debuted in wargaming with Avalon Hill&amp;rsquo;s TOBRUK. Vehicles and guns come on 3/4&amp;quot; counters, infantry on a 5/8&amp;quot; counters, and status markers remain on 1/2&amp;quot; counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each new game or expansion in ATS drops you into a historical theater, and a specific locale within to give you an up close, and sometimes eyeball to eyeball perspective, with scenarios based or inspired by historical actions, all at 50 yards per hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Expansion comes with 2 large historical linking maps covering the firefights near Ponyri Station, during the Battle of Kursk, 1943. Includes 18 scenarios on the 18th Panzer Division's assault against Soviet fortified positions.  Most scenarios play on one map.  One &amp;quot;monster&amp;quot; scenario uses both maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATS Ponyri component list:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 linking mapsheets&lt;br/&gt;18 scenarios on 11 cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Battlefield Walkaround booklet&lt;br/&gt;2 small countersheets (5 rows with zb obr 39 25|A H|AA in upper left corner)&lt;br/&gt;1 countersheet German Personnel&lt;br/&gt;1 countersheet EF1&lt;br/&gt;1 countersheet ATS New Russian Personnel 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOT A COMPLETE GAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ownership of any Eastern Front ATS complete game is required to play this expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
