			<description>This is #7 in the Games on a Half a Checkerboard Series. Frontjammin' is a game like Backgammon, with its own twists.  It also includes a variant using a King piece, which gives the game a bit of a Chess flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players will roll two dice.  If they roll 5-6 on any of the two dice, that counts as a single die roll that a player picks (1-4).  If players roll doubles of 1-4, they advance 4 pieces the same amount, if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the game involves pieces being placed in columns and trapping their opponent's pieces.  The smaller board also lends to an increased chance of a reversal of fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
