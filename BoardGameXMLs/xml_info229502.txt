							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death is the New Pink</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bizarre, crazed, post-apocalyptic setting uses the fun Into the Odd rules by Chris McDowall and is inspired by Tank Girl, Judge Dredd, the Fallout and Borderlands video game series, and Mad Max.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take on the roles of Meat Bags that wander the packed and filthy streets of Scratchtown, or buzz through the wasteland on souped-up hot rods.  Their goal: to find Doodads, obtain materials for trade, or to cause mayhem, death and destruction just for the sake of it.  Meat Bags feel they&amp;rsquo;ve seen and done it all, so the prospect of death is one of the only exciting &amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rdquo; things left in the world.  Death is the New Pink is brutal, bloody, and chaotic.  Things should be kept fast-paced and it&amp;rsquo;s more than fine if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense!  Character death is fairly common and should be embraced; a particularly blood death should be applauded and celebrated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doodads, mutants, bullets, dead bodies, and some booze and pizza are all in a day&amp;rsquo;s adventure in the Wasted World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strap on your ass-kicking boots and grab your big guns, Meat Bag!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to get your killin&amp;rsquo; (or dyin&amp;rsquo;) on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burn rubber and enjoy spreading chaos in the Wasted Worldin this scrappy RPG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
