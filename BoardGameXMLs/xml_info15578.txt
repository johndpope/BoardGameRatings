			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Those nasty misfits are challenging Jem and the Holograms to a Battle of the Bands. The Holograms are trying to collect all their records and bring them to the battle. But the Misfits are blocking them at every turn. The only way to outwit the Misfits is for the Holograms to split up and each try to get as many records as possible. Which hologram will make it to the battle of the Bands first with the records she needs to win?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple track game is based on the 80's TV show. Using a spinner for movement, the players travel along the paths trying to collect records by landing on record spaces. When you reach the Battle of the Bands space, you spin the spinner and add the number you spun to the number of records collected. If the total is 12 or greater you win. The game also comes with an audio cassette of Jem and the Holograms music. This tape can be used in the game by playing random song clips on Side A that sends players to the matching record space if instructed to by a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
