			<description>Gone with the Wind the Game consists of eight separate board, card and trivia games: Gone with the Wind trivia game, Atlanta, Carpetbagger, Frankly My Dear, Pay or Play, Rhett, Scarlett and Tara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular game is a trivia board-game with a small twist. In addition to drawing cards and answering questions in your quest to win, this game includes two complete decks of playing cards. These form the 104 question cards, but can be used as regular playing cards as well. Instead of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds, we have Scarletts, Rhetts, Mammies and Ashleys. There appears to be no correlation between the picture on the card, the subject matter of the questions, or the suit, but I'm sure I'm just not looking hard enough. The pictures are repeated on some cards, and not with regularity, so there must be something going on. Playing card collectors will like these decks.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the game itself, there are also rules for playing other games with only the cards, including variations on rummy and go fish, as well as other games that make use of the trivia questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two large decks of question cards can also be used as regular playing cards. Standard suits have been replaced by Scarletts, Rhetts, Mammies and Ashleys. The art depicted on the cards is independent from questions. The rules for card games include variations on Rummy and Go Fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
