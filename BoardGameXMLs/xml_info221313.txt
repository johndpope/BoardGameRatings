			<description>A TRIP TO YUGOSLAVIA is an experimental interactive game with a theme of the old VCR player (with the ability to REWIND, PAUSE and FASTFORWARD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yugoslavia has fallen apart. No one knows what caused it. Some people ran away instantly and some of them still don't know that the war has just begun&lt;br/&gt;Including you. You're taking a role of Dimitri, an amateur photographer, who has been caught in the nearby Yugoslavian forest on the outskirts of town. Now, without any combat knowledge, you have to survive a few months of war in a desolated country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
