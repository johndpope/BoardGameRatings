			<description>Saikyō Habu Shōgi (最強羽生将棋, lit. Strongest Habu Shogi) is a Japanese virtual board game for the Nintendo 64 developed and published by Seta. It was released exclusively in Japan on June 23, 1996 as one of the Nintendo 64's three Japanese launch games alongside Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64. The game features the shogi player Yoshiharu Habu, who won all seven major shogi championships the year of the game's release. The game was a commercial failure, selling only about one copy with every one hundred consoles sold at the system launch. Despite this, Seta released a sequel titled Morita Shogi 64, which was announced at Nintendo Space World in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Saikyō Habu Shōgi&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
