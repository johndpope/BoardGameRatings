			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture the scene. You running a game for a bunch of PC's. You've spent ages creating a dungeon. You've slaved over it. You've put your heart and soul into it. What's one of the first things the party does?&lt;br/&gt;They kick the doors down, kill the guards and run off with the treasure. They probably giggled as well.&lt;br/&gt;Well not any more. Now you can make the party a bit more nervous about kicking down that door, or simply looting the first chest they see for any treasure contained therein.&lt;br/&gt;How?&lt;br/&gt;Traps, that's how.&lt;br/&gt;Now that door will cut into the person who kicks it in, now that chest will spray a contact glue onto the party's thief for daring to pick that chest open.&lt;br/&gt;Done right, your players will get suspicious and any thing that looks too good to be true.&lt;br/&gt;Only a few of the traps contained within here are actually lethal, you don't want to kill the party. It's much more fun to watch them limp home, bleeding and crying, saying and making rude comments and gestures to the dungeon entrance and yelling &amp;quot;Damn you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;For the more sadistic DM's each of the traps contained herein has an optional effect, to make things more...interesting, more deadly, and make your players characters more afraid of what's to come.&lt;br/&gt;Also included in this book are some skills/feat that make things easier for some , worse for others.&lt;br/&gt;Now go and have some fun and watch your players squirm....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designers note :&lt;br/&gt;The majority of this book has been kept as system neutral(in that it's not tied to any game world) as possible with regards to costs and other subjective cost etc. for items, e.g. 100.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of gaming system, it's been designed to go with D20 systems.&lt;br/&gt;Costs will be in the primary currency units in your game, for example: Gold, leaves, small turtles, whatever you use.&lt;br/&gt;Each trap also comes with a bit of background, quotes or other fluff you can give your players, or, use for adventure seeds etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
