							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Kingdoms</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for settlements and PC constructed kingdoms appear in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: GameMastery Guide and Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Campaign. These provide all the information required for the construction of most normal communities, from discrete little thorps to complex thriving nations. However, there is a distinct lack of the wondrous and fantastical within. The rules fall short when posed with the challenge of fashioning technomagical civilizations stuck out of time, necromancy-saturated cities built on undead labor, or extraplanar nations united by mysterious magical gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, it seems that the founding of such should be beyond the reach of mere mortals, but the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures book allows PCs to achieve greater reaches of power. Likewise, the GM may simply wish to establish a campaign visiting or based within a location touched by mythic influences. Four Horsemen Present Mythic Kingdoms attempts to provide GMs and players with the tools necessary to build castles in the sky or reclaim a lost legendary realm steeped in destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
