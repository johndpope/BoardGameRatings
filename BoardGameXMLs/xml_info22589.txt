			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 49ers - An Exciting Game of Risk and Rescue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting game with very spotty rules. A single player takes the role of Blackjack the stagecoach driver who scores points by visiting settlements. The other players take on roles that attempt to thwart his efforts (bandits) or aid him (the sheriff). Once Blackjack has completed the stagecoach circuit, he tallies up points. The board is then rotated 90 degrees and each player takes on a different role. Play continues in such manner until all players have had a chance to play the role of Blackjack at which time the game truly ends and scores are compared. The highest Blackjack score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their are 4 players. BLACKJACK (Stagecoach Driver),ROARING RED (bandit), BLUEBEARD (bandit) and SHERIFF WHITE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play 4 rounds with each player playing a different character in each round. Roaring Red and Bluebeards' objective is to stop the stage coach by using a trail to get in front of the stage. If that happens the stage must turn around and use another trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sheriffs job is to overtake the bandits, he tries to protect the coach and catch the bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
