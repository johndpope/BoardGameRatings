			<description>Tsair Deng (Slant nail) is similar to One Arm Joe, except that it is played with Chinese dominoes instead of a standard double six set. Also similar to the Korean game of Dancing Dragons, which is essentially the same game played with two open ends instead of one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If four people play, each is dealt 8 tiles. If three people play, each is dealt 10 tiles and the remaining two are not played. If two people play, each is dealt 16 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first tile laid, the leader must declare which half is 'open'. Then all dominoes are connected to the only open half of the boneyard, in a straight line. Once the boneyard counts a multiple of eight dominoes, the dominoes are stacked backward upon the previous row. The boneyard can therefore count up to four rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player is unable to play, he must discard a tile from his hand facedown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the players' hands are empty, the round is scored. Each players counts the pips on his tiles, and must pay to his opponents with lesser scores the difference in points. If a player manages to play all his tiles, this scoring difference is doubled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
