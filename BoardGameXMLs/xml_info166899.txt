			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In From the Depths you can build and take first-person command of battleships, planes, submarines, giant terrible geese, space ships, hot air balloons and more! The game is currently in open-alpha and contains a wide range of single player content including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A creative mode allowing you to push your designs to the limit and ensure the total annihilation of your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A campaign waged over hundreds of islands against eight factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Story Mode where you can (eventually!) play 15 missions as each of the eight factions &amp;ndash; a fantastic mixture of strategy, design and wild battles! Defend your fleet against waves of enemy forces in a series of extremely tough challenges that unlock new components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An expansive multiplayer and co-op element is planned for the coming months!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
