							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War of Ashes: Shieldbash</name>
									
			<description>The War of Ashes is not a war of front lines and set piece battles. Small groups encounter each other in every manner, and there can be neither truce nor quarter. Scouts and foraging parties, messengers, guards, and lost soldiers meet. They fight over a cache of food, a lost animal, a footbridge, a message, or just to get back home. These desperate skirmishes take place amongst camps and baggage, in ravines, at the edge of swamps, or on the decks of small ships. There is no warning and no time to call for help. These small battles that will never be named or recorded are decided by the choices and skill of a handful of fighters, and in turn these skirmishes decide the course of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shieldbash is the skirmish wargame for the War of Ashes setting.  The fights are very flavorful, with ships that move beneath you as you fight on their decks, cavalry, darkness, archers, musicians, berserkers, carnivorous plants, and lumbering trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two new races of Agaptus are introduced in Shieldbash: the lizard-like Ki-Kak seeking vengeance on the Vidaar, and the True Atronians, does from the Elvorix, Vidaar, and Jaarl people who fight to unify their peoples against the Kuld menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A blind activation system leaves the commander unsure of how far he can push his fighters before the momentum of battle changes. Shieldbash concentrates on a commander's ability to use his fighters to best effect. Designed for ease of play, commanders can fight several skirmishes in an evening, following the tale of their warbands as they grow in power and renown. Gather your fighters, plan your attack, and fight for your people. Lead with your sword, keeping an eye open for the errant Shieldbash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
