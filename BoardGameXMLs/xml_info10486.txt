			<description>The board is an 8 by 8 checkerboard, with the central four squares blanked out.  Each corner has a road bend and is the starting point for each of the players.  The objective is to lay tiles, representing sections of road, in such a way as to build a road which starts at one's corner, loops round the center of the board and comes back to the start point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inevitably each players road becomes entangled with other players' roads.  The trick is to try to co-opt other's road sections while hindering other players.  Dead ends and enclosed loops are not allowed so there is always a potential path for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhat similar to Metro and Tsuro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
