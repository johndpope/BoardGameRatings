							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Prehistorica: Lost Creatures</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with (but not exclusively with) Lost Prehistorica AND JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD TAMED THE LOST LANDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You found yourself waking up to screams, only to find a large shadow lumbering off in the darkness of night. Before you, gurgling out a pitiful pool of blood was the remainder of your sorcerer's carcass. Three days later, something in the jungle's mist bit your barbarian, causing him to flush with the pale sweat of poisoned sickness. The warrior guide has been coughing and shivering since he got those strange, infected claw marks on the side of his back. As you stumble and weave through a thick floor of dead vegetation, you feel something long and scaly start to wrap around your left ankle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Lost Creatures, a guidebook to some creatures that populate a land seldom seen. Restlessly caged within the spine of this tome are a variety of savage, prehistoric monsters destined to add new and dangerous flavor to your adventures in the lost lands. Designed to cover a variety of challenge levels, explorers and natives alike will find a toothy, claw ridden monster suitable for the party's encounter needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Pohei CR 1/6&lt;br/&gt;    * Jekovar CR 1/3&lt;br/&gt;    * Lazura CR 1/3&lt;br/&gt;    * Nanjee CR1/2&lt;br/&gt;    * Firebrander CR 2&lt;br/&gt;    * Kohu CR 2&lt;br/&gt;    * El-el CR 3&lt;br/&gt;    * Lake Lurker CR 3&lt;br/&gt;    * Qetz CR 3&lt;br/&gt;    * Bonegore CR 4&lt;br/&gt;    * Chwepti CR 4&lt;br/&gt;    * Storm Petal CR 4&lt;br/&gt;    * Ang-kur CR 5&lt;br/&gt;    * Osor CR 5&lt;br/&gt;    * Whip Bug CR 5&lt;br/&gt;    * Magmasaur CR 7&lt;br/&gt;    * Maqor CR 7&lt;br/&gt;    * Vardu CR 7&lt;br/&gt;    * Deep Ooze CR 8&lt;br/&gt;    * Dragon, Yarmas CR 8&lt;br/&gt;    * Kamala CR 8&lt;br/&gt;    * Niag CR 9&lt;br/&gt;    * Yenda CR 10&lt;br/&gt;    * Soex CR 11&lt;br/&gt;    * Dragon, Ulret CR 12&lt;br/&gt;    * Und CR 15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
