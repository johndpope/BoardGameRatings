							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PlayStation 3 Super Slim</name>
									
			<description>In September 2012, Sony announced that a new slimmer PS3 redesign (CECH-4000) was due to be released in late 2012 and that it would be available with either a 250 GB or 500 GB hard drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In PAL regions, the 250 GB model is not available; a model with 12 GB of flash memory (CECH-4000A) is available in its place. A standalone 250 GB hard drive (CECH-ZHD1) is available to upgrade this model. In the UK, the 500 GB model was released on September 28, 2012, while the 12 GB model was made available on October 12, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CECH-4000B consoles (those with hard drives) weigh approximately 2.1 kg (4.6 lb), while the CECH-4000A weighs approximately 2.0 kg (4.4 lb). Both are &amp;asymp;25% smaller and &amp;asymp;20% lighter than the original PS3 Slim. This version has a sliding disc cover rather than the slot-loading drive found on previous PlayStation 3 consoles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;PlayStation 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
