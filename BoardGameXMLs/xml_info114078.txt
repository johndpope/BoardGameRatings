			<description>4x4 EVO 2 is a video game developed by Terminal Reality for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. It is the sequel to 4x4 Evolution and features more trucks, and more racing tracks than the original game. 4x4 EVO 2 is a racing game in which the general point of the gameplay is to cross the finish line before all of the other vehicles. The courses are primarily in extreme environments such as deserts, canyons, and other off-road locales. Players are allowed to customize their vehicle to their liking with a variety of engine, suspension, wheels, tires, and other aftermarket parts and modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 112 selectable trucks and SUVs ranging from compact to full size from the following manufacturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chevrolet&lt;br/&gt;    GMC&lt;br/&gt;    Dodge&lt;br/&gt;    Jeep&lt;br/&gt;    Infiniti&lt;br/&gt;    Nissan&lt;br/&gt;    Toyota&lt;br/&gt;    Lexus&lt;br/&gt;    Mitsubishi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ford was pulled from the game after licensing issues (present in the original 4x4 Evolution and the beta version of the sequel). Ford is said to have wanted too much for the use of their vehicles. There is a user-made pack available that includes these vehicles converted from 4x4 Evolution. Even though the game was released in 2001 for PC and Mac, There are still new people starting to try out Truck Making and Track Making. Trucks in Multiplayer: If you downloaded a modded truck that another player does not have, they will see the vehicle that is on top of their POD.INI list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the vehicles that come with the game are in the following classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Class 1 is basically stock vehicles. Beginners should always use them.&lt;br/&gt;    Class 2 is slightly modified vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;    Class 3 is highly modified vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;    Career is a special kind of vehicle not used in classes 1, 2 and 3 that you can buy in that mode if you have enough money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;4x4 EVO 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
