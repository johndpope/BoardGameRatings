			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Outlive Outdead Companion is a collection of five episodes (adventures) for the cinematic zombie roleplaying game Outlive Outdead. Each adventure is set in a different time period and comes with pregens and small rule modifications to make each setting unique and colorful. The adventures include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Extinction Event: What really killed off the Neanderthals? A tribe armed with clubs and stone axes struggles to survive when Cro-Magnon zombies invade their village.&lt;br/&gt;     Le Morte: King Arthur and his knights have fallen, and Mordred&amp;rsquo;s undead legions roam the land. You must prove your loyalty and courage, take up Excalibur, and end the usurper&amp;rsquo;s reign. Can you stop zombie knights on horseback, defeat Mordred, and reclaim the Grail?&lt;br/&gt;     The Jacobite Dead: Charles Stuart makes a pact with witches to create a Jacobite army of the dead in Scotland. Can highland warriors fight their way to the source before all of Scotland falls to the undead?&lt;br/&gt;     Teufels of Belleau Wood: World War One rages in France. US Marines stop the German advance at Belleau Wood, but the French demand retreat. Why? What are they hiding in Belleau Wood?&lt;br/&gt;     Sterilization: Humans and aliens live together on a future Earth&amp;ndash;until they turn into zombies. The military will sterilize the entire planet in 24 hours. Can you reach the escape shuttle in time, or will zombie aliens stop you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time period will also feature different starting equipment, unique motivations, and new talents and/or capabilities. All are compatible with the Outlive Outdead rulebook, which is required to play. For example, &amp;ldquo;The Jacobite Dead&amp;rdquo; includes rules for zombies fighting with weapons and &amp;ldquo;Sterilization&amp;rdquo; provides character generation rules for playing aliens and alien zombies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
