							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Butchery of the Geldamore</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There your party is, having a few pints at the local tavern, minding your own business.....suddenly a fight breaks out! As you enjoy watching someone else take a beating for once, the town guards break in and stop the fight. A shriek and an old woman pointing her finger at one of the members of your party saying they have murdered the bar owner and now they are in custody. Can the other members of the party figure out the mystery and spring your cohort?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is a murder mystery for adventurers of any level and can be incorporated into any campaign setting or used with additional adventures in the Filbar realm as a continuing campaign. Also this is set in the Free City of Landos and can be used as a companion adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
