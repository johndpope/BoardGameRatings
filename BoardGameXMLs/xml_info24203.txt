			<description>The publisher of this game is out of business but this is such a great game that it needs to be available. What follows are the complete rules to a miniatures version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mongolian Goat Rodeo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a miniatures horse racing game that recreates the Afghan game Buzkashi - Goat Grabbing. In the real game players are all mounted. The first player to grab the goat scores a point. The player who gets the goat around a goal scores a point and the player who gets it back to the starting point scores a point. In between everyone tries to grab the goat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player runs a team of three riders. You need a start post, a goal post, two six sided dice, and ten tokens per player to make unexpected things happen. Place a goat token on the start post. The youngest player goes first. Go around the table to the right. Place one rider on the table. Once all the riders are placed the youngest player takes the first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of grabbing the goat and moving or moving and grabbing the goat. The player needs to be next to goat to grab it. They make up a story about how they get the goat. They pick another player to decide what they have to roll equal to or higher on 2d6 to succeed. Most players set the roll at 7+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player rolls 2d6 per rider. If they move only in the 180 degree arch to their front they move the total number in inches. If they move at all in the 180 degree arch to their rear, or are carrying the goat, they move the larger of the two rolls. Riders may not move through other riders but may squeeze through gaps. End moves pointed in any direction you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any time a player may spend one of their tokens and make up any other kind of event. Maybe they get an extra turn or maybe they fight someone. They pick another player to set their roll just like with goat grabbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the goat is brought home, players use their remaining tokens to get extra victory points. They lie about what they did and another player sets what they have to roll. They get as many rolls as they have tokens. The player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition of Mongolian Goat Rodeo (2006) was a board game, while the second edition (2013) is a card game in which players need to supply their own dice, ruler and coins in order to play. The version presented here is a miniatures game that can be played using any mounted figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
