			<description>Amazonas is a dice-roll based game for 2-4 players. The players score points by &amp;quot;shooting&amp;quot; animals on the way to the finish line. Everyone starts with 10 bullets and uses the 1-2-3 dice to move forward and the regular dice to shoot at the animals. When you arrive on a tile with an animal on it, you can decide if you want to shoot at that animal. This is done by the regular die. If you roll a number (1-6) that has an animal token on it, you &amp;quot;shot&amp;quot; the animal, you remove the token and keep it. Every shot costs one bullet. If you miss, you can try again by using another bullet. Obviously, if less animals remain, your chances to shoot one is smaller. Once you hit an animal, the next player's turn begins. If you arrive on an &amp;quot;Amazonas&amp;quot; tile, you can choose the animal you want to shoot at. Different animals give you different points (e.g. parrot one, lion six).&lt;br/&gt;There are also obstacles on the way that players must cross. If they fail to cross them, they loose animals worth of 6 points. If you don't have enough animals to return, you can give back your bullets (1 bullet - 1 point).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SWAMP: In order to cross the swamp, you need to roll a number (with the regular dice) that corresponds with the value of a neighboring tile (except the one behind you). In this case, you can move to that tile, making your way across the swamp.&lt;br/&gt;Once you make it through an obstacle (or even if you fail), you arrive in a village, where you can sell your animals for bullets according to the animal's value. (For a 6 point lion you get 6 bullets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHASM: In order to cross the chasm, you need to get 10 points out of 3 rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COCONUT: Monkeys are throwing coconuts at you, and you must avoid them. You place your marker anywhere on the first row (there are four) and throw with the blue and red dice. The values of the colored dice show you where the monkeys are throwing the coconuts (red value counted from the left and blue from the right). If they miss, you go to the next row, if either of the hits you, you fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUSPENSION BRIDGE: from 8 rolls you must get all the 6 values of the dice (1-6, in any order)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CROCODILES: You need to row through the water by using the green and white 1-2 dice (Right paddle green dice, left paddle white). Equal numbers: you go straight ahead 1 or 2 tiles. Green 1, white 2: you move one ahead and one left. If you hit a croc on the way, you fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROPE: You have 8 rolls and you need to get to the other side by always rolling a bigger number than the previous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you get to the finish line, you count the value of your animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
