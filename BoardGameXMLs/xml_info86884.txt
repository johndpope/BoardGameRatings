							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tricky Double</name>
									
			<description>Tricky Double works a bit on the principle of Raj but makes it an 'adult' version.  Players simultaneous choose a card and reveal it and then have to select a second card and reveal this one too.  You win with the combination of these two cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lower cards in the deck hold coins, the person who gets the most of these coins wins the game. The lower the card, the more points it has.  So if you want to score a lot of points you will also have to play out a low card from your hand but still want to get the highest result in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
