							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Cards: World War II</name>
									
			<description>Replay WWII in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East under two and a half hours by taking sides as either the Axis or Allied nations. With a time scale from early 1939 until mid way through 1945 players face both the clock and an opponent in collecting their forces (represented by cubes), setting aside four suits of 'combat' cards which represent their units: air, armoured, infantry, and artillery, moving around the map, and seeking to gain outright victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is a combination of an overpower rule and playing 'combat cards' (plus event and terrain cards) previously set aside prior to battle. Only such cards laid aside can be played in combat - not those in a players hand. Event and terrain cards can add to battle. Players aim to play four suits that independently reach a higher score than the enemy's four suits - totalled from the face value of cards played; dependent on where on a  Tech Level Track players are they can add other cards to a suit to increase the value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forces are colour coded represented by 10x10mm cubes. Combat cards put aside are placed face down to allow fog of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are laid aside each turn to allow movement, recruitment, movement up and down the Research Track and Tech Level Tracks, or moving into combat. Players have four actions per turn. Each turn a player tops up their hand with new cards based on their Tech Level (the higher the level the more cards a player receives), and takes up to four actions. A player takes all actions then play moves on to the opposed player. A turn is two months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
