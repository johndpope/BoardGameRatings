			<description>User summary (details from Wikipedia):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gyruss (ジャイラス) is a &amp;quot;tube shooter&amp;quot; type shoot'em-up video arcade game developed by Konami, and released in 1983. the player controls a spaceship and the goal is to shoot down everything that comes in sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ship the player controls travels left/right on the circumrefence of a thought circle circling the screen, with the ship always facing towards the middle. The background starfield also emerges from the screen's center, the stars travelling to the screen's edge, giving the impression that the ship is travelling into the screen at high speed, as if it were in a tube, hence the name &amp;quot;tube shooter&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gyruss was designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, who had earlier created Time Pilot for Konami. Gyruss was licensed to Centuri in the United States, and was ported to numerous games consoles and home computers. It follows in the tradition of space war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J. S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular arrangement is superficially similar in sound to &amp;quot;Toccata&amp;quot;, a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gyruss,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
