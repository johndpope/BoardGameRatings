							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Village of Camiram</name>
									
			<description>From the Web Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re trying something new with this installment of the Cliffhangers series, to offer you a complete village to use as &amp;quot;home base&amp;quot; for your adventuring party. The village of Camiram (kam-EE-ram) can serve as a safe haven for a group of low-level D&amp;amp;D adventurers as they set out into the world for the first time, seeking fame and fortune. It also can serve as a location for adventurers to encounter in their travels, but it's primarily intended as a base of operations and an example of how to build similar villages. You can place it in the World of Greyhawk, another D&amp;amp;D campaign setting, or a world of your own creation. To fully develop the village, we will offer updates throughout September and October.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
