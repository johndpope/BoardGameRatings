			<description>Think is a Trivia game with 5 knowledge areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player's turn, another player takes a new Card for reading the question(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each Card there are 5 questions, for one each knowledge area. Which question is asked is determined by rolling 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;Rolling doubles or 6s results in a special effect, such as getting a free Point or getting 2 questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different numbers (without 6) gives the active player the possibility to choose the knowledge area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 question/area on each card is bold. This is the master question where you bet 2 or 3 of your previous owned victory points, for doubling or loosing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the small editions the actual Player gets the card for knowing the answer, in the big boxes there are additional &amp;quot;nuggets&amp;quot; (black stones) for counting the victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Ends when 1 player has a predetermined amount of victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
