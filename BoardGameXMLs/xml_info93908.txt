			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an action/ puzzle solving game based on the manga of the same name. You will need to collect various items in order to accomplish your goals. They are scattered throughout the school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High School! Kimengumi (ハイスクール!奇面組, Haisukūru! Kimengumi?) is a manga series written by Motoei Shinzawa which ran in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1982 to 1987. The title literally translates to High School! Funny-face Club or High School! Weird Face Club. An anime TV series (1985&amp;ndash;1987) and movie (1986) based on the series were also released.[1][2] The High School! manga series was preceded by Third Year Funny-face Club (3年奇面組, Sannen Kimengumi?) (1980&amp;ndash;1982), and followed by Flash! Funny-face Club (フラッシュ!奇面組, Furasshu! Kimengumi?) (2001&amp;ndash;2005).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kimengumi is an episodic chronicle of the bizarre adventures of a group of misfit junior high school (and later, high school) boys who form a club known as the &amp;quot;Kimengumi&amp;quot;. All of the character names in the series are puns. For example, &amp;quot;Kawa Yui&amp;quot; is another way of saying &amp;quot;kawaii,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Uru Chie&amp;quot; is a slang form of &amp;quot;urusai,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;obnoxious&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;annoying.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other romanizations of the title include High School! Kimen-gumi and Highschool! Kimengumi. In a 2006 survey of celebrities by TV Asahi, Kimengumi was listed as #87 on a list of the top 100 favorite anime series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Highschool!
