							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Timewatch GM Screen and Resource Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protect the secrets of the future, present and past - until the time comes to reveal them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TimeWatch designer Kevin Kulp has traveled into the future where he&amp;rsquo;s already completed the TimeWatch Game Master&amp;rsquo;s Screen and Resource Book, and brought it back for your use and enjoyment! He probably did not catastrophically disrupt history in the process!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TimeWatch GM&amp;rsquo;s Screen is three-ply and portrait-oriented, with all-new art on one side by TimeWatch artist Rich Longmore and enhanced by 13th Age artist Lee Moyer. On the other side is the essential information and tables a GM needs to run a TimeWatch game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Resource Book includes advice, guidance and rules for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Making combat in TimeWatch even more fun&lt;br/&gt;    Pre-made Rebel organizations to bedevil or ally with your time-traveling Agents&lt;br/&gt;    16 new time seeds for near-instant missions, organized by the Adversaries and Antagonists that each mission seed uses. If you read the Adversaries in the main book and thought, &amp;ldquo;that sounds fun but how would I use it?&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;ll like this section. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
