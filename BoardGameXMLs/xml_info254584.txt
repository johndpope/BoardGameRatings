			<description>Out of the Loop is a fun and easy to learn new party game for 3-9 players. Play at a party, waiting in line or on your next road trip!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answer silly questions about the secret word to figure out who in the group doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clue about what everyone else is talking about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;------ WHAT IS IT?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of the Loop is a mobile party game by the creators of Triple Agent! All you need to play is a single Android device and a few friends. Each round takes around 5-10 minutes to play and at the end of the night whoever has the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;----- FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- No setup! Just pick up and play.&lt;br/&gt;- Easy to learn! Learn the game as you go, the perfect filler game.&lt;br/&gt;- Short rounds! Play a quick game or several rounds.&lt;br/&gt;- Hundreds of secret words and questions.&lt;br/&gt;- Diverse categories for varied play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;----- GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After choosing a category for the round, each player either gets to know a secret word in the category or that they are Out of the Loop. Each player then proceeds to answer a single question about the word before voting for who they think is Out of the Loop. Did someone have a suspicious answer? Did they not laugh at the thought of doughnut filled doughnuts? Vote for them!&lt;br/&gt;On the flip side, the Out person has to figure out the secret word. If they do, all is for nought, so make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not too obvious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
