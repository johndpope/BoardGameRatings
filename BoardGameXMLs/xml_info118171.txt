							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Regional Settings: Kael&#039;Myn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The region of Kael'Myn was once home to a terrestrial enclave of celestials, barred from the heavens. Since that ancient realm's demise the region has become home to a plethora of peoples, monsters, and power hungry organizations. Powerful relics wait to be discovered by adventurers daring enough to brave the dangers of Kael'Myn's shadowy underworld, and a new war is brewing that threatens to sweep every last individual in Kael'Myn into a catastrophe the likes of which hasn't been seen in centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this is included in Regional Settings: Kael'Myn plus:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A new race and new exotic weapon&lt;br/&gt;     2 new spells&lt;br/&gt;     3 new monsters&lt;br/&gt;     9 new feats&lt;br/&gt;     4 detailed organizations&lt;br/&gt;     A detailed history and description of the region, its history and people, complete with full color maps and a timeline for easy reference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
