			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for HOT CHICKS: The RPG. You will need the core rulebook in order to play. We will also be using material from the supplements Bios Ex Nihilum, Villain-Net, and Character Studies #4: Eve Sylver. These books may come in handy, as might Inner Darkness, Inner Darkness 2: The Depravity War, Ten Uses for Incomplete Clones, Mechaphisto: Demon Lord of Technology, and The Cyber-Undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This source book details operations of the organization known as Nth Degree and its enigmatic leader, The Smith. We will introduce some of the weaponry, cyberware, and other technology that Nth Degree is producing for their war against cyber-intolerance, and provide game statistics for some of Nth Degree&amp;rsquo;s personnel. We will also discuss some of the things that can go wrong in their operation, and the kind of opposition that can only happen from within their own ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem with organizations is that they&amp;rsquo;re made up of people. Even Nth Degree is made up of people, no matter what everyone else calls them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains adult content - nudity, strong language and extremely adult themes. Adult Readers Only, please!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
