							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Flips 2: Monsters</name>
									
			<description>Triple Flips 2 includes Curse of the Pyramid, Vampire Attack, and Escape the Evil Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Curse of the Pyramid is a race game for 1 player.  You mark half the dice numbers as belonging to the mummy, then roll the die.  If the mummy's numbers get rolled, he moves toward the goal; if not, then you move the actual number rolled.  Of course, your path is substantially longer than his.  You also are required to change the mummy's numbers each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Vampire Attack lets 2-4 players attempt to bite each other.  On your turn, roll the die, then move orthogonally with up to one 90&amp;deg; turn per move, in an attempt to sidle up to another player.  Once you get orthogonally adjacent to an opponent, roll again.  A 1 (appropriately, the big, red pip) means you've bitten them and they're out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Escape the Evil Castle is a spiteful race game for 2-4 players.  Players traverse a linear path toward the goal, advancing the roll of a die each turn.  However, your roll also moves Dracula, whom you can move in either direction.  If you move Dracula onto an opponent, she must move her pawn back to the 0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% mark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
