							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars: Battlefront (2004)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Star Wars: Battlefront is a first- and third-person video game  based on battles in the Star Wars film series. It was developed by Pandemic Studios and LucasArts  and released on September 20, 2004 for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Macintosh  and Microsoft Windows, the same day as the release of the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set. Aspyr released a Macintosh port in July 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel, Star Wars: Battlefront II, was released on November 1, 2005 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Unlike Star Wars: Battlefront, it was not released for Macintosh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Wars: Battlefront encompasses battles between four main factions from both the original and prequel trilogies: the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) of the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire of the classic trilogy. However, factions can only play their historical adversary; there cannot be any Rebels vs. Separatists or Clones vs. Empire fights. In each faction, five different classes of characters become available. Four of the classes are similar for each faction: a basic infantry soldier (a Super battle droid for the CIS), heavy weapons soldier, pilot and sniper. Both factions have a set amount of reinforcements. When the reinforcements have been depleted, the faction loses. Scattered around the battlefields are command posts. AI units and players use these command posts to spawn from after being killed. If a faction controls all command posts, they win the battle unless capture of one of these points is disrupted. Each faction has special units such as the Droideka for the Separatists, and a Jetpack-wielding darktrooper for the Empire. Several ground and air vehicles are also available to the player on the battlefield. Ranging from the hulking AT-AT, to the fast speeder bike, there are more than 25 vehicles at the player's disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Star Wars: Battlefront, Jedi heroes are featured: Mace Windu battles for the Galactic Republic, Count Dooku for the Separatists, Luke Skywalker battles with the Rebel Alliance and Darth Vader the Galactic Empire. Unlike its successors, jedi characters are not playable.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star_Wars:_Battlefront,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
