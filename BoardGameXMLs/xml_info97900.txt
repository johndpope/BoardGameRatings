							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noval</name>
									
			<description>Noval is the quick playing family-friendly strategy game with suspenseful play and comfortably shaped cards. No batteries, boards, pencils, or score keeping. Play in under 30 minutes! Match or beat each others cards in a race to be the first empty-handed player! Great for family game nights or get-togethers. Noval's portable size makes it great for fun on the go. Grab the box, slide it into a pocket or purse, go have some fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine cards are dealt to each player who then select 3 cards at random without looking at their hands and place them face-down in front of themselves. These cards remain there until later in the game. Players must then match or beat each others cards to get rid of their hands and win! Cards like BURN and WILD add a twist of excitement while High cards (BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, and DIAMOND) are used to force other players to pick up piles of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
