			<description>A simple roll and move game for the very young. Children will need a little luck to be the first to find the letters that matches the character name on their postcard. It is a nicely themed game about this popular children's TV favourite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher;&lt;br/&gt;Today is total mayhem at the sorting office! Letters are everywhere and no-one know what to do, so Pat has no choice but to stop his deliveries and help sort out the mess! Players each have a postcard belonging to a resident of Greendale, then race around the sorting office turning over the jumble of post to find the missing letters. The first to find all their missing letters from their postcard is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
