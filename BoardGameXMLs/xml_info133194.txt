			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Year of Our Lord 510, the great wizard Merlin brought to King Arthur his ageless wisdom. His aid took many forms, from showing Arthur how to find (some say forge) the sword Excalibur to granting insight into the Kings enemies. He showed Camelot&amp;rsquo;s craftsmen how to build suits of Shining Armor with coiled springs that increase a knight&amp;rsquo;s strength threefold. He taught sages secrets of mathematics, science, and engineering that propelled the kingdom into a Golden Age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly 25 years have passed since the coming of Merlin. Arthur&amp;rsquo;s court has grown to nearly 200 Knights, and Camelot has spread peace across Britain. Many from the Round Table have set out on the most Holy of quests, even recovering the Grail of Christ, not a cup but a stone of an unearthly green glow. The Grail whispered further secrets to those Merlin trusted to study it, powers to drive darkness from men&amp;rsquo;s hearts, to cure all Earthly ills, to master the beasts of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But portents grow dark. Merlin has disappeared. The King&amp;rsquo;s sister, Morgana, has stolen the Grail. An army gathers under the banner of the dark knight Mordred. And the King&amp;rsquo;s mind is bent by the possibility that his most trusted Knight is dallying with the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will become of Camelot, of Britain, of the World? If there is no more Merlin, no more Arthur, who will rise to the call of history? Will it be you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
