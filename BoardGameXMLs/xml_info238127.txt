							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saucer Escape: A Spacemen and Scribbles Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Saucer Escape depicts four of humanity's best space soldiers abducted by an alien Mothership after an assassination attempt. Their mission: Destroy the enemy forces, fuel up their escape pod, kill the alien's leader, the Hivemind, and survive! This game is an homage to Grey Gnome Games' Doom Realm games and Mark Jindra's Pencils and Powers game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Saucer Escape, a very brisk yet challenging one player game, featuring variable setup and unique, variable character powers, &lt;br/&gt;the player will spend each turn rolling four dice and allocating them toward four different goals - reconnaissance, enemy strength, items, and locations' artifacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Reconnaissance dice will allow you to move around the interior of the ship, finding special encounters and the entrances to the enemies' locations. &lt;br/&gt;     Enemy Strength dice will increase the strength of one enemy; players must balance the enemy's strength against their own as their increasing strength makes them harder but also affects your final score directly.&lt;br/&gt;     Location dice simply make each enemy's location more valueable. They don't directly affect your score, but rather how many Alien Artifacts you find in a location after slaying the enemy who inhabits it.&lt;br/&gt;     Reward dice extend the value of an enemy's loot when killed; there are many unique items in the game  which can aid you in both scoring and simply surviving.  From shields to medkits to laser pistols...your ability to manage these tracks are key to your success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
