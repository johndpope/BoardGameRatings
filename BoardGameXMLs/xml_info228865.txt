			<description>This is a Sudanese version of Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;With regards from The Modern Bank of Luck&lt;br/&gt;The only agent in Sudan&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is completely in Arabic, but I've had most of it translated.  The mechanics are the same, however with slightly different rule variations.  Properties focus on Arabic cities in Northern Africa and the Middle East including Khartoum, Aleppo, Benghazi and Baghdad.  You can purchase garages, restrooms or markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the rules translated into English:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Bank of Luck game is one of the best games that guarantees players a good time and makes people love honest trade in the sale and purchase of cities, garages, restrooms, etc.  It is one of the most famous games played by 2 to 6 players and preferably more than 2 players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
