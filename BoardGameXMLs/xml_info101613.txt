							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maze of Mayhem</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a brave hero in the world of Liettarra where creatures such as Men, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Goblins and Hobbits live in peace. Unfortunately it is not that simple. Others such as Sraks and Rock beasts terrorise the peaceful folk. This causes battles all over the land, especially Darreepdwell, the Dwarven capital, in the Cold Mountains, which is being attacked on all sides by Carralies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this story is not about wars and Darreepdwell. It is about the Maze of Mayhem in the Elvish forest Cathelliolon. Every year the Elves hold a contest and one champion from each race enters the maze from a different place. Whoever reaches the middle first wins &amp;amp;1000000 (Cromars, the money of Liettarra) and another unknown prize, always different each year. You are one of the champions this year and there is only 2 minutes before the tournament begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
