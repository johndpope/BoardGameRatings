							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">North American Song Birds Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The game comes with two different rule sets that can be played with the cards in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the game Cartoon-Strip Bird At the start of the game the 20 cards are shuffled and 5 are dealed out to each player. The dealer now draws a card from his left hand neighbor and tries to complete  a set of any letter from A to E. &lt;br/&gt;The next player then then draws for the neighbor on his left and so on.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to lay down a complete set of 4 cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second game that can be played is North American Song Birds. The two different sets of cards are shuffled in to separate piles. Then the bird picture cards are spread out on the table.&lt;br/&gt;The dealer is given the verse cards deck and starts the game by reading a verse from the top card of the verse deck. &lt;br/&gt;As soon as one of the player recognizes on of the birds that is described by the bird he quickly places his hand on that bird card.&lt;br/&gt;Play then continues to the nex player who becomes dealer and so on.&lt;br/&gt;When the verse deck is empty the player who made the most correct guesses wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
