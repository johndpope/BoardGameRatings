			<description>Welcome to the realm of GROG, the ULTIMATE Drinking Card Game!!! It is not a game for the conservative or squeamish and is not advised unless you are up for a game which may cause extreme inebriation and one's consequent actions we know so well so BE WARNED!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comprises 52 cards - 13 sets of 4 identical cards with specific drinking related actions attributed to each of the 13 different cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 52 cards are placed face down, chandelier-style around an empty glass. The players then place themselves around the table with their preferred drinks. The game ensues in a clockwise direction with each person in turn flipping a card onto the table for all to see and responding to the action on the underside of the card. But beware, the rest of the players must all be attentive as there are 'reaction' cards like the 'HIJACK' card which requires every player to respond to the card as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no winner to the game, only one poor unfortunate sod, who will have the misfortune of flipping the fourth and final GROG card. As the game progresses, every time one of these cards are flipped, the 'flipper' will pour a tot of his/her beverage into the glass in the middle of the table. So by the time the fourth GROG card is flipped, there should be an alcoholic concoction of at least 3 tots of whatever the respective GROG flippers' beverages were. The fourth GROG flipper (the loser) must then pour a tot of their beverage into the glass and down it (OUCH!!!) That terminates the game and you may then gather all the cards together and play again until you have had enough... (or fallen down)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
