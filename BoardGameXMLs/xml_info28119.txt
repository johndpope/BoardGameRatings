			<description>LITTLE CHIEF  -----   This 1966 game from Whitman was a simple roll and move game where players Ages 5 - 10 tried to win feathers for their headdress. Each player had a headdress to wear at the start of the game and each time a player landed on a particular square on the board they were allowed to add a feather. First player to get 5 feathers won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
