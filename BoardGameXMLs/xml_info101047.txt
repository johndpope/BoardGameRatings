							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bakugan Battle Brawlers</name>
									
			<description>Bakugan Battle Brawlers is a video game based on the original anime series made by NOW Production and Activision&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bakugan battles are very different from the anime series and the general rules. At the beginning take a gate card, which will land on the field. Then you have to target an aim on the battlefield (like a gate card or items), choose one of your three Bakugan and throw them to where you wanted them to throw. It is possible to either let it directly get on one of the gate cards or to move it to items, trampolines, or other locations that will give your Bakugan extra G-power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the video game, different Bakugan have different special attacks, which can be activated once the special meter is full. special attacks do various things, such as knocking Bakugan off of gate cards or shooting into the air to reach platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If two Bakugan stand on one gate card the fight starts. You can now activate ability cards in order to power-up your Bakugan even more or to change the battle rules. The fight itself is nothing more than one of three different mini-games (shooting, shaking, and pressing buttons at the right time). With the help of these mini-games both Bakugan gain more G-Power, which decides after it who will win the fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner gets the gate card and a new battle can begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is able to collect three gate cards will win the entire brawl. The winner earns BP (Bakugan Points) to upgrade their Bakugan, buy new Bakugan, buy new gate cards, or buy new ability cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;List of Bakugan Battle Brawlers video games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
