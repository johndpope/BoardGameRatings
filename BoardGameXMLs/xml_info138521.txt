			<description>The game board represents a honeycomb in the bee hive. The queen rests in the middle of the brood nest (brown cells) surrounded by her royal household. The colored cells above the brood nest show stored pollen (inside the pollen field there are yellow and brown pollen cells).&lt;br/&gt;Yet above the pollen field the honey cells are located (yellow cells). The honeycomb is occupied by the queen and several workers and drones. The smallest bees are workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Das Bienenspiel players try to get 3 cards of honey and 3 cards of pollen. This is achieved by reaching either honey or pollen cells and claiming one. After each claim the player pawn has to return to the central brood nest unless he is able to hit a spot with a drone which allows the player to immediately turn around and go for another card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have to move the full roll amount and must not enter cells which are occupied by bees or other player pawns.&lt;br/&gt;Player with the full set of 6 cards (3+3) need to return to the queen cell to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
