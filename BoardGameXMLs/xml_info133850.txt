			<description>Zhukov's first counterattack on the Eastern Front&lt;br/&gt;As August turns into September of 1941 and the Nazi hordes push ever deeper into the heartland of Mother Russia, General Zhukov&amp;rsquo;s Reserve Army has been given an opportunity to counterattack.&lt;br/&gt; While it may not yet be time to drive the hated facists out of the beloved Rodina, pushing them back, away from Moscow, with their tails between their legs is always worthwhile ! Besides with the Nazi panzers out of the way, what better time to trial the new assault theories while conducting an encirclement of your own ?&lt;br/&gt; Yelnya is designed to be an easy to learn and fast playing game for two players while still being a challenging puzzle for both sides if played solitaire&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each turn the Russians have an opportunity to bombard the germans before both sides move and attack. at the end of the turn both sides may receive reinforcements and a check is made to see if the german high command authorises a withdrawal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the withdrawal order is given (usually about half way through the game), focus of play shifts from positional warfare to the germans escaping with as many units as possible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
