							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">POW Cards Set #2</name>
									
			<description>user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POW Cards were an accessory produced by Doc's Games/Uncle Morty Productions, presumably for use with their line of tiny role-playing games (Dinky Dungeons being the best-known of these).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set #2 contains 17 cards with comic-book style speech and thought balloons containing various sayings, both short (&amp;quot;OOF!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Get him!&amp;quot;) and long (&amp;quot;It's a good thing that building was empty today.&amp;quot;). There are also 5 cards with empty balloons and 5 completely blank cards, presumably for the creation of one's own custom cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their exact intended use is currently unknown. The Doc's Games catalog describes them as &amp;quot;quoteable quotes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
