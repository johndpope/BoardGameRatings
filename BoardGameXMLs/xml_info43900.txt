							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</name>
									
			<description>This Meeting of the Committee is Called to Order . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You braved crocodiles, Nazis, necromancy, and devolved ape men to find the mythical city and the secrets it holds. You tested your skills and resolve to their limits, driven by a secret desire that motivates you to greater deeds just as it blinds you to possible pitfalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you have returned from your expedition and must report to your peers on your daring exploits, proving to the hardened adventurers, geniuses, and polymaths gathered before you that you are worthy of their respect in your every endeavor. You&amp;rsquo;ve gone into danger and survived driven by your desire - now is the time to bring it to fruition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries is a storytelling game of exploration inspired by the pulps and tales of Victorian adventure. Playable in a single evening or over multiple sessions, it allows you and your friends to tell tales of harrowing danger, daring deeds, and furious action with freeform narration and pulse-pounding timed conflict resolution. No pre-game preparation is required, so grab your hat, your whip, and your .45 and get going!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
