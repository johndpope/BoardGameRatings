							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Getting Dressed</name>
									
			<description>Getting Dressed is one of the games published in Math on a Roll, a book of number games using polyhedral dice. In this game, characters roll the two dice (a 20-sided and a 12-sided) and consult a chart in the book to try to completely dress their stick figure (drawn on a piece of paper). Underwear and socks must be put on before other pieces of clothing. Each piece of clothing requires a certain combination such as &amp;quot;Underwear--Blue odd, purple even&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Jacket--Blue die is greater than the purple die.&amp;quot;  Many die rolls will allow more than one piece of clothing to be chosen, but only one piece may be added per turn, so players must choose which piece to add strategically.  The first player to fully dress his or her stick figure wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
