			<description>The Earth needs to be fed: move your counters around the board and fill up your boxes with fruit before the hungry caterpillar can eat it. By achieving this, you'll feed the planet! Feeding the planet is a collaborative game for all the family, to teach everybody how nice it is to play and win together as a team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feeding the planet is a collaborative game developed for Expo 2015 in Milan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;On the board there are some tokens face down: each token can show a fruit, a caterpillar or the Expo2015 mascot.&lt;br/&gt;Each player throws the dice and moves their counter: according to the token, the players pick fruit, move their counter wherever they want or draw a piece of the caterpillar jigsaw.&lt;br/&gt;When all players have completed their individual boards and the harvest is safe, the players have won!&lt;br/&gt;However, if the jigsaw with the caterpillar is completed, they have lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
