			<description>From the box :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's a great time for you to come play with me!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's go through the house and see what fun stuff we can find! Toys are everywhere! Balls in the living room, trains in the kitchen, bears in the bedroom. Look, I found the blocks! Can you be the first to collect all of the toys you need for your toy box? So many toys to find. Good thing it was so easy to find this great game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual - great quality components from Ravensburger. The box itself becomes the gameboard, as the floor and wall components insert nicely into the base. Wonderful colors will keep kids interested in this fun little memory/set collecting game. Roll the die...move from room to room...turn over a tile...only keep that toy if you do not already have that toy. The first player to have a complete set of all 6 distinct toys wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet and simple. Just as we've come to expect from Ravensburgers' wonderful line of kid's games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for ages 3-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
