			<description>Heroes of Mana, known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Heroes of Mana (聖剣伝説 HEROES of MANA Seiken Densetsu: Hīrōzu obu Mana?, lit. &amp;quot;Holy Sword Legend: Heroes of Mana&amp;quot;), is a real-time strategy role-playing game developed by Brownie Brown and published by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS video game console. The game was released on March 8, 2007 in Japan and was released in the U.S. on August 14, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a real-time strategy game (RTS) and is almost entirely a touch-based system. Players will summon monsters to fight alongside heroes in order to accomplish objectives such as destroying an enemy carrier or defeating all enemies in the area. Throughout the game players will unlock new units, spirits, and tips that will be useful in achieving victory. New equipment is obtained through completing story and bonus missions and finding it as hidden treasure. There are a total of 26 bonus missions, one for each mission of the story mode, as well as additional missions only available through the Heroes Ranking system. There is multiplayer wireless support, however the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service is restricted to downloading new maps and missions. Special items can be obtained by logging on the Wi-Fi Heroes Ranking system as well as by earning points through mission achievements such as fast times and most thrifty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Heroes of mana&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
