			<description>Puppy Phonics is an educational game about consonant blends and short vowel sounds. It is designed to be enjoyed by 2, 3, or 4 players age four and older. Each player twirls a spinner and names the sound indicated... for example, A E I O U. The player then advances his or her puppy token to the next space on the illustrated pathway which features an image matching that sound. The first player to reach the finish line is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
