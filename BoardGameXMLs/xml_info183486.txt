							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Everest Adventure</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will A Terrorist Plot Keep You From Reaching The Highest Place On Earth?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you're an experienced climber, you never thought you'd be chosen to attempt Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. But someone is trying to stop your expedition. During a stopover in Beijing, you're exploring the crowded city when you are suddenly grabbed from behind! The cold steel of a knife presses against your throat. &amp;quot;Stay still and you will not be hurt,&amp;quot; a voice hisses in your ear. Should you try to get away? With all these people around, he wouldn't dare use the knife, right? On the other hand, it may not be wise to test him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
