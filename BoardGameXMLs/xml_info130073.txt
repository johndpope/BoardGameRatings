			<description>In the game are 72 cards in 4 colors and with the values ​​0 to 5 Players are dealt four cards in your hand and are trying to get rid of the cards as fast as possible, or at least to cash in as few points as possible. To store one can only form a stack per color, a stack starts with 0 or 1, a discarded card must have the same value or one higher or one lower than the previous card, and the same color. You can also fit and a card from the deck or pull a card as waste face down in front of him, a player with no cards or the last card from the deck finish the round. Everyone writes down the value of the cards in hand. After some rounds the player with the fewest points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
