			<description>Translated from the box:&lt;br/&gt;Who collects two complete series of cards first? Use your Joker and Choice cards well and avoid being hit by your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Start with 3 cards. Take a card, play a card. Collect series of 6 cards. Your Start card determines in which order to build the series: up, down or random. Close a series with a Home card.&lt;br/&gt;You can hit on the last cards in an opponents series using Tease cards as long as that series isn't completed with a Home card.&lt;br/&gt;Jokers can substitute any number card and can be exchanged for the right number in your turn and must be played again in the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;Choice cards make you turn extra cards from the deck (as many as there are players). You get to choose first. Don't forget to end your turn with just 3 cards in hand. The other players have to fullfil that condition at their respective turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
