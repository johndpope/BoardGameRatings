			<description>In Cake Mania 2, Jill Evans returns in a fantastic all-new cake-baking adventure where she can strive for fame, fortune, or maybe even love! Players use the stylus to lead Jill through more than 200 different levels of baking and frosting mania that include 50 unique kitchen upgrades: from new ovens, frosters and display stands to microwaves, shoes and TVs. Cake-bakers must work quickly and accurately to please 18 all-new demanding customers that include aliens, federal agents, rock stars and grannies. Plus, Jill's new non-linear baking experience with six possible endings will take her to exotic locations like an underwater theme park and outer space. Throw in new cake shapes, decorations and frosting flavors and players will have their stylus busy at all times throughout the main game and in the new Endless Baking mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
