							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vers: The Rap Game</name>
									
			<description>Vers is a freestyle rap based card game where the players compete against each other to see which can create the best freestyle rap, but it uses a template system that makes it accessible to anyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's mission is to make freestyle rap accessible to anyone. From 7 year old girls to 71 year old grandparents, anyone can freestyle in this party game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;A player might get a category like &amp;quot;Taco&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;And then a base card like &amp;quot;Hate, Great, Appreciate&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;And then one might rhyme:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There's a taco in my mouth and it's filled with hate,&lt;br/&gt;lettuce and cheese and it's looking great&lt;br/&gt;but the beef is sour I cannot appreciate.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player would rap using a different category card and the player with the best rap would win, as chosen in an Apples to Apples style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
