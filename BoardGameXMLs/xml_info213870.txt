							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hangry Hippos</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangy Hippos is a delightful combo-building card game for 2-5 players. It's easy to learn, simple to set up, and only takes a few minutes to play (a few minutes of pure FUN).  The game consists of 120 high-quality 2.5&amp;quot;x3.5&amp;quot; cards in a tuck box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as a chef, trying to cook up food for hungry costumers. You meet the 'orders' listed on customer cards in order to get points. But you have to watch out, because there is a famished hippo, who keeps getting more and more hangry until he eats someone's food!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players not only try and get food card combos, but also try to sabotage their opponents. You can play actions cards ruin their meals and steal their food, or you can send the hangry hippo to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
