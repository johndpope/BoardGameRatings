			<description>A Game of Building Influence, Wrestling Economics and Swashbuckling Control in the Golden Age of Piracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providence is a worker placement action drafting game. Players compete to balance strife with prosperity by directing colonists within a growing pirate empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonists are in every sense the players in the game. Their actions will decide the fate of your black marketeering operation based in Nassau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player commands an operation comprised of an inland estate and a waterfront enterprise. A player&amp;rsquo;s operation is part of an independent colony operating away from the power of Britain&amp;rsquo;s interference. Players compete to become the most notorious black marketeer in the Bahamas and chief supplier for the many pirate crews of New Providence Island by overseeing dealings with the colonists in Nassau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
