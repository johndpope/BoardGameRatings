			<description>The ChangPing Campaign is the first free wargame to be published by War Drum Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Changping (長平之戰) was a military campaign that took place during the Warring States period in China. It concluded in 260 BC with a decisive victory by the State of Qin over the State of Zhao, and ultimately allowed Qin to conquer and unify China decades later. The campaign is considered one of the most lethal military operations in history, although most of the Zhao casualties were captured soldiers executed after the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
