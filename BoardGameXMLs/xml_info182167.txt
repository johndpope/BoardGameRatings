			<description>The players start with 175,- gamemoney and have to get from their starting point to the roundabout and a crossing on the other side of the board and back to their starting point, while minding the traffic rules. The first to achive this, gets a bonus of 50,-. Movement is determined by a die and the traffic lights at the center of the board. While playing, the players have to pay fees or receive bonuses. The game ends when the first player returns to his starting point and the player with the most money wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
