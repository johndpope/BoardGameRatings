			<description>Civilizations are not set in stone. You can&amp;rsquo;t just do all the hard work in the beginning then expect your culture to stand the test of time, unchallenged. It&amp;rsquo;s not like that in the real world &amp;ndash; or in Civilization games. The expansion Civilization VI: Rise and Fall, adds new dynamic layers onto the game you&amp;rsquo;ve already been enjoying. You will lead nations to golden ages. You will watch others buckle under their own weight. You will earn &amp;ndash; or lose &amp;ndash; the loyalty of your people. The question is, &amp;ldquo;How will you be remembered?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest, over-arching goal: dynamic empires. Civilizations will rise and fall through the course of the game (as you probably figured out from the title). Borders will ebb and flow. Cities will change their loyalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a secondary goal, Civilization VI: Rise and Fall includes more storytelling elements &amp;ndash; Historic Moments &amp;ndash; that highlight the interesting turning points in your civilizations. These events happen every time you play, making playthroughs unique, while also giving them meaning in the mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
