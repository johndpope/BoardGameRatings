			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The population of the City measures into the millions with sprawling streets and neighborhoods that span 4,500 square miles.  To keep this many people in check, the ruling class has been divided into houses which manage different districts with their own sets of local laws and guards to enforce these laws.  Each of the ruling families answer directly to the Prince who keeps them in check by rewarding and punishing families through the distribution of land and power.  The only other entities that hold any sway in the city are the church and the guilds.  They are allowed to deal with the public and the ruling families any way they wish, though they have to answer to the Prince as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During Stage 1 this game was entitled Verona 1568.  During Stage 2 this title was removed (but not replaced).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
