			<description>This track game plays similar to &amp;quot;Snakes and Ladders&amp;quot;. A double pointed spinner is used for movement and the player may choose either of the two numbers indicated. For example, if the arrow points to 5 at one end and 2 at the other, the player may advance to the nearest 2 on the track or the nearest 5. Landing on a &amp;quot;Helping Hand&amp;quot; space moves the player up to the space indicated by an arrow to the track above. Landing on a &amp;quot;Landslide&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;Whirlwind&amp;quot; sends the player down to the space below. The first player to reach the top of the mountain wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
