			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1529; Stage One: Jay Treat; Stage Two: Eric Nieudan; Stage Three: Willow Palacek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;You sense things no one else can. And you use your gift to help the authorities catch dangerous criminals. Today you&amp;rsquo;re teaming up with other consultants with mysterious talents, despite your many differences. What twisted plot demands the collaboration of such odd detectives?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychic Detective Agency is an American Freeform game for 2 or more players, based on improv fundamentals. Take on the role of psychic detectives, and shape the story together. Your characters might see the end coming, but you never will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is American Freeform?  It's sort of like Live Action Roleplay (Larp), crossed with improv, and generally focused on intense, single session games.  You'll know it when you see it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: As a group, you create the story together by answering Questions and then playing out scenes. Anyone may prompt a Question at any time. Players are not restricted to narrating or roleplaying only when prompted, but have greater narrative authority when answering a Question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
