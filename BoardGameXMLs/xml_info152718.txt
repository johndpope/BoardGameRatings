							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: ComStar</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ComStar, the Clan Invasion sparked a Schism that was, perhaps, a long time coming. When the Jihad erupted, the self-appointed guardians of interstellar communications and the lost technologies of the Star League found itself at war with its brethren on a scale that even the mighty Com Guards could not overcome. As the Word of Blake&amp;rsquo;s war against humanity collapsed on itself, so too did the white-clad warriors of ComStar&amp;rsquo;s military might, their strength and prestige evaporated by the loss of Blessed Terra and the long-bitter bitter Jihad. Answering now to a new order on Terra, ComStar&amp;rsquo;s wartime experiments have come to light&amp;mdash;including new tools of battle intended for use against the zealots of Blake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Technical Readout: ComStar samples the custom and prototype designs that were developed in the testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of ComStar&amp;rsquo;s scattered military. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake waged on. These technologies&amp;mdash;first described in Tactical Operations&amp;mdash;have only begun to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
