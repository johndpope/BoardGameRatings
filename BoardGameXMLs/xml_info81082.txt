							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bingo: The Friendly Farm</name>
									
			<description>Back of box:  This amusing two-in-one bingo game stimulates children's sense of observation.  Reversable game boards and cards allow children to explore the wonderful world of the Friendly Farm and learn the letters of the alphabet.  Same general idea of the Classic Bingo, but with pictures on one side of the board and letters on the other. As in traditional Bingo, a player calls a particular picture or letter that is selected at random, and each player covers that figure on their personal board.  A player who gets a row covered wins.  &lt;br/&gt; A colorful way to get children to play with and recognize letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
