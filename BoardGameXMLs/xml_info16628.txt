			<description>&amp;quot;My Arse&amp;quot; is a Cheatwell Games trivia game based on Granada Television Ltd's &amp;quot;Royle Family&amp;quot; situation comedy show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its a variation of the card based trivia theme in which players pit their wits against Jim, the Royle Family's fountain of all knowledge and have to decide if &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; on the trivia cards are &amp;quot;Sound&amp;quot; (true) or &amp;quot;My Arse&amp;quot; (false.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's how the marketing material describes it:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A classic game of truth or bluff, you have to choose the facts from the guff...decide whether Jim really knows his onions or is simply full of hot air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you agree with Jim and head for a pint at the Feathers or grumble your way to the kitchen to brew another cuppa?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of one thing you can be certain...you're in for a right Royle battle in this off-beat trivia board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
