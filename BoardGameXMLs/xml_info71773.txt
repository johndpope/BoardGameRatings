							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Row</name>
									
			<description>The Chess, Checkers, and Poker Board Game according to the box.  King's Row is a Checkers mutation.  Each checker has a playing card value on it.  This value has two effects.  First, a jump can't be made against a checker with a higher value.  Second, when a checker has made it across the board, it is not &amp;quot;kinged&amp;quot; to return to play, but instead remains in the &amp;quot;King's Row.&amp;quot;***  At the end of the game, the player who can put together the best poker hand from the checkers that have traversed the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is something of a mystery.  It comes in a Monopoly-sized box, with a heavy board and very heavy-duty checkers, but no publisher or designer is listed on the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            Correction: a checker in the King's Row may be moved out of King's Row to remove opponent's pieces, but may not be compelled to do so. Only the checkers that are in King's Row at the end of the game are counted.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
