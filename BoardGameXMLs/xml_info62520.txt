			<description>Scarabs, Pyramids &amp;amp; Dung Beetles is an Ancient Egyptian themed trick taking card game with a BID of a twist. The object of the game is to be the first to complete three pyramids. To do this you play cards to the table to try and win the trick. The winner of the trick uses the cards to build his pyramid. But, sometimes there is a tie and then those players must bid to win the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cards are the pyramids pieces you will need to build your pyramid as well as to win the trick, but there are also the Scorpion cards and the Scarab/Dung Beetle cards that can help win you the trick (and some extra coin), but be careful...if you end up with the most bugs it will cost you a pyramid under construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
