							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron League: Black Stadium</name>
									
			<description>Iron League:Black Stadium is a brutal tactical game utilizing Mechs, miniatures and interactive scenery for action-packed game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Configure your team with giant machines called Iron Mechs with interchangeable arms and weapons and warriors: the hordes of Claws, the heavy Zimman, your mechanic to repair your mechs. You can recruit mercenaries on your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use drums full of gas in your favor, use walls to protect your warriors and be careful of fire squares. Throw the enemy into the air, or throw them at burning drum. Shoot down the Iron Mech pilots and steal their mechs, or destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 4 game Modes: Match, Death Match, Arena and Cooperative. Nuke Tracker is a Expansion full Co-op supplementary to Iron League:Black Stadium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Match: a tactical and ferocious sports game. Your team can be repaired after each goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Match: a competitive, destructive combat, if you survive you win. If your team dies, they cannot regenerate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arena: Inspired by MOBA style video games, if you destroy 2 enemy black holes or steal your enemy's plasma ball, you win. If your team dies, they can regenerate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coop: Survive waves of attacking enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 4 teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team contains 3 Iron Mechs, 3 Claws , 1 Zimman Warrior and 1 Mechanic. Iron Mechs are controlled by pilots with special abilities, but can be taken over by any warrior (mechanics are not warriors). If a warrior takes control of an Iron Mech, he loses his abilities, armor, and special weapons. So, he becomes a pilot but with limitations. There are also 4 mercenaries that can be hired during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
