			<description>Countdown is a mathematics educational game centered around the theme of sending a rocket into outer space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and draw cards based on the dice's results.  Even cards carry addition and multiplication problems that when answered correctly, move the answering player's token forward on the track (which is patterned like our solar system).  Odd cards have subtraction and division questions; answering them correctly moves the player's token backwards.  When a token lands on certain spaces with instructions, the player must carry out what was printed as well (lose a turn, move the token to another space, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player's token reaches Pluto, making him or her the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
