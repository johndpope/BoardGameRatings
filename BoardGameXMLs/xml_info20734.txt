							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corsair Leader</name>
									
			<description>Corsair Leader is based on the Hornet Leader II core game, but with some significant changes.  The game focuses on the Marine F4U Corsairs in the Pacific. The 2 campaigns cover the Solomon Islands campaign that lasted from late 1942 to early 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the aircraft under your command center on the Corsair, but you also get to decide if you want to include Dauntlesses, B-25s, and B-17s as part of your group. Each aircraft has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, the B-17s carry a lot of bombs and are hard to shoot down, but they are terrible versus naval targets and only moderately accurate against all but the largest of land targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also goes more in-depth on the tactical options you have while over target. Each turn, each aircraft can become &amp;quot;Offensive&amp;quot; which gives it an attack bonus, but also makes it easier to be attacked when it gets shot at. Likewise, aircraft can be &amp;quot;Defensive&amp;quot; which penalizes their own attacks and makes them harder to hit. &amp;quot;Slow&amp;quot; pilots can &amp;quot;Rush&amp;quot; their attack at a penalty and attack during the Fast pilot step, and &amp;quot;Fast&amp;quot; pilots can Wait and get a bonus if they attack during the Slow pilot step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the other games in the &amp;quot;Leader&amp;quot; series, Corsair Leader is a solitaire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published in both PDF and Vassal versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
