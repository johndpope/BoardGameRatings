							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trouble In The Gang</name>
									
			<description>From the adventure introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of rather assorted gang members from an up and coming gang are sent on a mission by their boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gang is aiming to live above the gutters and has attracted folks a cut above the usual gutter scum. Now the potential is backing and something better assuming you can find out what the boss wants to know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This being Seattle though troubles sure to be already on the way&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the authors webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for and first run at GenconUK 2002 where 3 tables ran. Since run once at Conception 2003. At least one other person whom I supplied a copy to has also run it after playing at GenconUK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The groups at GenconUK did well, while the group at Conception had a fairly severe case of lead poisoning. However everyone seems to have enjoyed themselves and done quite well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended for the characters provided as there is some background and linkage between the characters. However it could be adapted quite easily for any group of gang level player characters and lower end Shadowrunners could be tasked with the mission by reading the adventure and picking a suitable 'Johnson'. I cannot provide direct advice here though without excessive spoilers. This adventure will probably not run too much over the four hours outside tournament play, my best guess being six to eight depending on how fast you get on with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
