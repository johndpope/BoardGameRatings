			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player can combine a tile in his hand with some more in the table, being the sum 15. If he can do that, he take all the tiles for himself. If he can't make 15, he discards one tile.&lt;br/&gt;After all the players have used his tiles, the scoring phase begins, adding point for haver certain tiles (yellow 7 by example), having three cards of the same color, most red tiles, or other combinations. The first player that reaches 60 points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
