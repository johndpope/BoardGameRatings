Can the lost treasures be found, somewhere within subterranean vaults reputed to be beneath his tomb?  Or does only death and darkness await those that dare to enter The Tomb of Mergal Thar?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures The Tomb of Mergal Thar is a new Adventure Module set within The Forgotten Graveyard, which is located along the western edge of Greyshroud Ridge.
