							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fort Griffin, Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's time to hitch up the horses and load up the wagons; the Dog House Gang is fixin' to ride to Fort Griffin for the inaugural issue of Frontier Towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontier Towns is a support product for Old West role playin' games. The Dog House Gang plans to offer several installments. The first volume is set in Fort Griffin, Texas-with two more volumes set there as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Frontier Towns product will come with a ready-made settin' and stand-alone buildings complete with maps, history, inhabitants, adventure ideas and full interior descriptions. We figure a Judge could take this product right off the shelf and have a town set up in no time. Or, a Judge with more time on his or her hands could pick and choose the establishments that strike a fancy, customizin' them to fit an existin' campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Griffin, Volume 1 has a potent five card draw of fully-described buildings for your gamin' pleasure. You'll get a pair of saloons and a pair of service establishments, along with an ace-in-the-hole: the town Jail. Read 'em and reap:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shannsey's Saloon: Based on the legendary saloon where Doc Holliday met Wyatt Earp, Shannsey's offers a mighty fine gatherin' place for soldiers, buffalo hunters and famous gunfighters. No tellin' who you might meet here, but don't be surprised to see Lottie Deno (&amp;quot;The Poker Queen&amp;quot;) dealin' a hand of Faro.&lt;br/&gt;     Pete Haverty's Livery: You'll probably want to water and secure your horse before you do much else in The Flat. You can count on Pete and Henry Sixkiller to do right by your trusty steed.&lt;br/&gt;     York &amp;amp; Meyers Outfitters: Need supplies before settin' off on the trail? Lucky for you, H.E. Chapin and his staff keep the place well-stocked. If they don't have it, no one does. And behave yourself, Queenie can smell trouble clear across town.&lt;br/&gt;     Beehive Saloon: If you're itchin' for a buzzin' good time, come see why the locals say the &amp;quot;Hive is Alive.&amp;quot; Dancing girls, old-timey piano, dice games, Faro, poker, and plenty of good spirits. Not to mention the likes of Big Nose Kate, Doc Holliday and Mike Fogerty.&lt;br/&gt;     Picket Jail: The Flat might be wild and wooly, but it ain't lawless. Iffin you decide to stir up too much trouble, you might earn a &amp;quot;visit&amp;quot; to Picket Jail, courtesy of Sheriff Billy Cruger and his deputies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that ain't the whole shootin' match, no sir. You'll also get full scale battle maps that you can print out for table-top gamin' sessions (in 15mm and 25mm) and a final chapter containing 35 adventure and encounter possibilities (and a few extra cowpokes) that we've rustled up for your enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
