			<description>Drakons and G&amp;ouml;denors fight for the conquer of space. Due to a  the simultaneous explosion of several stars, the universe collides in only one dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drakons are oviparous and enormous. They gather in developed communities, with high technology. Their strength and aggressiveness is remarkable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G&amp;ouml;denors haven't a special natural strength but a high level of intelligence, becoming one of the most dangerous races in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both races have met, unfortunately, and so have created two forces that will fight to the death for the control of the new world, to conquer a new place to live and improve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drakon's force is commanded by Clain, the Manan, and is composed by two Dux-Manan and Atter-Manan, Arnor and Cowtor which have in charge three expert Mereos: Sunno, Cornex and Artak.  G&amp;ouml;denors have the same forces in their side: Arco(Manan), Daro(Dux-Manan), Rotx(Atter-Manan) and the Mereos(Sazzer, Preto y Malk).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to conquer the opposite military base. It's achieved by getting one the characters to the mountainous enemy base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the characters have different attributes that can be used in combat against enemy creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with only the Manan and will get through the different places by throwing a dice. Your forces could be increased by gathering new soldiers and getting additional powers, all of these using cards, supplied in Oracle squares. Other special squares will grant you access to mountains (Climbing) or get you frozen (Dimensional Door).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To stop enemy forces in their advance to your base, you can attack them with your ground forces, by placing them adjacent or by using the heavy artillery placed in mountains. Artillery will give you the opportunity to fire one of the missiles, trying to knock down opposing forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are additional powers attained through extra cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
