							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragonship</name>
									
			<description>The Dragonship is a ship that travels through time. Its crew finds themselves more or less adrift. They can move through the currents of space-time and inject themselves into various histories&amp;hellip;However, they have lost track of the meaning of any of the events they witness. Are they changing history, or is history changing them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragonship skims endlessly through history, dipping into events here and there. Some crew perish, some new folk are taken on; however, the ship cannot stay too long in the same space-time locale, as stillness takes hold of it and threatens to pin it down forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
