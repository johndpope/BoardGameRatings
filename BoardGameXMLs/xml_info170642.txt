			<description>In COSPLAY: The Game, two to four players compete against each other to try to become a Cosplay Superstar. Using a variety of cards and events, players gather flair for their costumes, then compete in tournaments to advance their rank. The first player to achieve &amp;quot;Superstar&amp;quot; status wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game built from the ground up by cosplayers for cosplayers, you'll recognize many in-game items inspired by and making fun of tropes from your favorite cosplay fandoms. Each player chooses a fandom (video games, anime &amp;amp; TV, steampunk or super heroes) and then works to gather flair for their cosplay before the competition. Flair items range from the ordinary (a &amp;quot;dinosaur egg&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;steampunk gauntlet&amp;quot;) to the outlandish (like the &amp;quot;companion sphere&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;ridiculous oversized hat&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn and play and incredibly portable, it's a perfect game to play when you're stuck in a hotel, at the airport or otherwise looking to have some fun. It's a clever take on the cosplay/convention experience, in playing card form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
