			<description>from the website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet suffering syllogisms! The last legs of layout on this ish were a real gauntlet. As stated previously, I wanted to stop at 76 pages, but there was just too much material that needed to be included. UL #4 clocks in at 84 pages and -- man, let me tell ya -- Open Office Writer was not very happy about it. There are a few errors here and there that I'd love to go back in and correct, but the ODT file is looking crazy when I open it back up. Thank the groovy god of zines that the PDF is functional! I can guarantee that #5 is not going to be as gigantic as this baby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FYI: The cover files are sized 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; -- DO NOT RESIZE THEM when you print 'em out. You may get a warning that the files exceed the printable area -- THIS IS A LIE. Well, sorta. There's nothing that needs to be printed beyond the &amp;quot;printable area&amp;quot; -- it's just blank space around the edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APOLOGIES TO MY BOY MATTHEW SCHMEER -- Classifieds didn't make the final cut, but they shall return in #5!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CORRECTION: On page 25 I claim that the Cththonic Codex comes with dice. It doesn't!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
