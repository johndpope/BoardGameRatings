			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end times, a Silent enemy will arise, and in its wake it shall bring oblivion. This the Gods of Man have seen, and this the Other has told to the Goddess Belisarda. Knowing this, the Gods of Men commanded their vassals, the noble Valinor, to infuse the favored bloodlines of man with the very power of divinity. This peculiar magic of divine beings is called Psionics, and so armed the children of men shall arise to defend Arcanis for defeat brings with it the end of all things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas wielders of magic rely upon careful ritual and the fundamental properties of matter to work their miracles and tricks, a Psion commands the very power of creation through sheer force of will. No obstacle can withstand the focused power of thought from a gifted and trained mind. Within this stout volume, the secrets of Psionics are laid bare for all to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honed by five years of vigorous play testing in the Living Arcanis campaign, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest interactive roleplaying environments, Psionics Unbound refines the Psionics rules for Third Edition Fantasy Roleplaying.
