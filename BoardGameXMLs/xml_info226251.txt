			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this Letter, we take a trip to Argent &amp;amp; Midnight&amp;rsquo;s Circus Esoterica and Extravaganza of the Strange, known by most as the Monster Circus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you brave or foolish enough to step within the carnival, you will find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A Menagerie with monsters such as Flintbeak the cockatrice and Rusty the rust removal monster and more!&lt;br/&gt;    A House of Oddities filled with frightening idols, preserved remains of humanoids and beasts, and other weird relics!&lt;br/&gt;    And of course the stars of the Big Top! You'll meet Mister Smiley, the goblin ringmaster! A hydra choir! Twin choker acrobats! The fortune-telling Living Tapestry! Kursha the Tamer! And Guk the Troll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you might have imagined, being a circus run by monsters, there is some drama within its tents! We have provided a couple scenarios for GMs to run for players interested in helping Smiley run things smoothly! (We won't spoil anything here!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, for GMs interested in spicing up dialogue with the NPCs found within, we've included a Glossary of Circus Terms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
