			<description>The playing area for Das kleine Bankett und andere Abenteuer (&amp;quot;The Little Banquet and Other Adventures&amp;quot;) in most of the game's scenarios is a tad unusual: a circle of chairs, with players starting each round by standing behind a chair. The players represent kids from different countries, specifically brothers and sisters who are accompanied by a pet, and they want to solve puzzles, quests and tasks while meeting and playing with one another. More specifically, some scenarios involve cooperative tasks, while another might have you compete against everyone in a race. Each scenario has been designed to be replayable numerous times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a scenario begins, a golden &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot; will be put into play from the starting point, moving either clockwise or anticlockwise. As soon as the golden ball reaches the first standing player, this player is in charge and can choose to act. Every player has a character card, which depicts his available moves on its backside. Once the player chooses an action, it will likely require other players to move, so the succession of players will change in the circle of chairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After his action, the player sits and hands the golden ball to the next player adjacent to him. The next standing player who receives the golden ball takes his turn, and play continues until all players are seated. At this point you check whether you've met any of the winning conditions of the scenario, such as placing members of your faction near goals or hidden treasures, or handing someone a gift. If you manage to exchange places at the right time with your partners, you can achieve different goals; since each character has different abilities to move others around or place themselves near a goal, players often have multiple solutions on their fingertips &amp;ndash; assuming they can find them in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character also has a loyal pet shown on its card. The pets can be one of two classes &amp;ndash; Growler or Kuddler &amp;ndash; and each class has its own specific move. If needed, a pet's owner can decide to use the action of his pet instead of his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrates with&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Last Banquet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
