							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deeper Dream</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in The Deeper Dream generate eight attributes (Will, Imagination, Innate Power, Solidity, Strength, Toughness, Balance, and Aim) using 3d6 for each each.  Players then distribute 100 percentage points among one to four skills (taking fewer than four skills allows for faster future progression).  Most skills are Dreamworld skills, but some are used in the Waking World.  To determine success in opposed actions, percentage dice are rolled and compared to the appropriate skill statistic.  If no skill applies, a d20 roll may instead be called for to be made against a suitable attribute.  In both cases, the die roll must be lower than the skill or attribute to achieve success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One unique aspect of the game concerns death, which is rarely permanent in dreams.  Instead, characters may lose the ability to dream for several days or suffer other negative effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
