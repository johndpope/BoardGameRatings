			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Site is a story roleplaying game about prisoners being held and tortured at secret rendition sites around the globe. Having already been captured, the prisoners are held in various locations, and denied access to basic human rights. They will be beaten, questioned, and tormented until they finally give in to the demands of their captors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Site is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
