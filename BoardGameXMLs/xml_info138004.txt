							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rope Bridges</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a short time ago the river that cut this canyon into the rocky ground was still flowing at its bottom. Then a nearby volcano violently erupted though. The river has been rerouted by the accompanying earthquakes and the streams of molten rock that are flowing in its old bed since then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crossing the canyon on the old rope bridges spanning its width via two rock pillars was at best perilous before the river far below was replaced by fast flowing lava. Now only the most hardened and desperate even dare considering such a venture. The heat wafting up is downright breathtaking and it has turned the ropes holding up the bridge dry and brittle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
