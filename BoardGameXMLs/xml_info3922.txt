							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Maker 2: Dragonbuster</name>
									
			<description>[This is after what I understood from the English rules here at BGG]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Maker 2 is an entirely different game from the first in the series. In this game, players compete to slay a dragon. The dragon being a powerful creature, players must first hire a strong enough party. But fighters don't come for free and treasure must first be gathered by slaying various monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game feels a lot like old-school console RPGs from the 80's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
