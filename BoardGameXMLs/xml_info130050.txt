							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bluffoons</name>
									
			<description>Combining some luck and a little skill, Bluffoons is a mix of fantastic bluffing games rolled into one great party game. Using dice, cards, mindgames and general skullduggery, players pit their wits, chance their arm and push their luck to the limit in an attempt to be crowned top bluffooner. An unreadable poker face and nerves of steel will also come in handy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffoons: a game of bluff, played by buffoons. &lt;br/&gt;Buffoon: joker, jester, clown, wag, bozo.&lt;br/&gt;Bluff: bamboozle, hoodwink, double-cross, confound, baffle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five first-rate bluffing categories, so everyone will have their own favourite. Sometimes you play a DUEL (one against one), sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s ALL PLAY (everyone plays) and sometimes you play &amp;lsquo;BLIND&amp;rsquo; (with no idea of what you have). So whether you are trying to imply that you have drawn the highest card, establishing if your opponent really has rolled a pair of sixes or double-crossing someone despite agreeing to cooperate, Bluffoons will challenge not only your bluffing ability but also your buffooning potential to the maximum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
