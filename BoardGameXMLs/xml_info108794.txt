			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title includes 4 &amp;quot;Exciting&amp;quot; race games Grand Pree Road Race, Demolition Derby, Drag Race Championships, &amp;amp; The 500 Mile Race. These games share some of the same components, but each game has a unique board, and two of the games have card decks just for them. It appears that none of these games were ever produced separately. All games may be played solo, or with a number of other players based on the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Pree Road Race&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use cars 1 through 12 and move the their cars around a game board track as instructed by a spinner and by use of a deck of cards that comes with the game. Special rules govern how many cars may occupy a space, and which car(s) get to move in the event of too may cars heading toward the same space. First player to pass the finish line wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demolition Derby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 30 cars may be included, although 10 players seems to me the suggested maximum. (This allows each player to control three cars.) Game is played on the Demolition Derby board which features some Safe spots where cars may not be hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cars move by means of a spinner (numbered 1 to 30) to determine which car is moved and a special deck of cards which determines distance and direction of movement. (Some cards allow for a choice about direction.) Since there is a set turn order, a player may end up moving an opponent's car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a car passes onto or over another car, the stationary car takes a Hit. Cars that take three Hits are eliminated from the game and removed from play. A wipe-off scoreboard with a crayon and a felt eraser are included to keep track of Hits. Play continues until only one car remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drag Race Championships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again all 30 cars are used. The game uses the Drag Race board. Before play begins, the 1-30 spinner is used to determine which cars are in which Heats. Play progresses by using the 1-12 spinner which shows which color car is moved, along with the roll of a single die to determine distance. One car advances from each of the 6 Heats. A final round is played to determine the Champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 500 Mile Race&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played on the box insert which shows an oval track with various Sequence Tables printed in the center. Game may be played with up to 30 players, each controlling an individual car. The game starts with the Sequence Marker on Sequence Table &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. Two dice are rolled and the numbers are added together. (The Sequence Table contains results from 2 to 12.) The result of the Sequence Table tells which cars may be moved... these cars are all advanced 3 spaces on the track. In the next turn the Sequence Marker is advanced and Sequence Table &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; is used. The Sequence Marker moves each turn, and goes back to Table A again if the game last long enough. Some Sequence Table results show hazards like Crash, Pit Stop, etc. The 1-30 spinner is used to determine which car is affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four cars abreast stop cars behind them from advancing. However, there are a couple of spots on the board where cars are considered to crash if there are ever four cars on them. (This cuts down on the amount of log jams in a really crowded game.) Play continues until a car crosses the finish line. In the event of a tie, play continues until one car advances ahead of another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The (many) game elements for this title include: one double-sided rules sheet, 30 die-cut pressboard cars, a sequence marker, a double-sided game board (with the Grand Pree race board on one side, and the Demolition Derby and Drag Race boards on the other), a wipe-off scoreboard (for Demolition Derby), a crayon &amp;amp; felt eraser, a 1-30 spinner, a 1-12 spinner, two 6-sided dice, a deck of 20 cards with an image of a tire on the back (for Grand Pree Road Race), &amp;amp; a deck of 20 cards with checkered flags on the back (for Demolition Derby).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No publication date is included with this title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
