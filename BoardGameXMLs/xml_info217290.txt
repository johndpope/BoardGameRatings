							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cities of Altered Earth: Consortium</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located near the Inland Sea, Consortium is the largest city in the world. Nearly a quarter of a billion people struggle to survive in this vast maze of concrete and steel. The impoverished hordes are crammed into enormous habitation complexes while the political elite look down on their empire from above. Consortium is a city of fear, where order is kept through automated gun turrets and even thinking the wrong way could attract the attention of the secret police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consortium is not a place for the faint of heart. Those who have the right combination of cunning and bravery will find that opportunities for adventure abound, those who falter are destined for reeducation or worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF contains:&lt;br/&gt;-History and general layout of the city&lt;br/&gt;-Encounter groups for the police and military&lt;br/&gt;-Information on criminal organizations and outlawed religious sects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A must have for all you Altered Earth fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
