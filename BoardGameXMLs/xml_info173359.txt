							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bank Vault</name>
									
			<description>A shipment of rare gold bullion coins are being transported to your bank for safe overnight keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As employees of the bank, you and your 'team' have special access to the outside of the vault where the coins are being stored.  Each of your team has knowledge of a small part of the combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But plans have changed and betrayal is immenent, your 'friends' aren't so quick to give up their information.  And an alarm has been tripped, and you all have 5 minutes to get the coins and get out...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bank Vault you have 5 minutes to figure out the code to the vault.  The first person to determine the full code is the winner.  The code is a series of four digits, each of a different color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each person at the table knows one of the numbers, and may be willing to share information via quid pro quo. Although you must realize that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    one player must lie when asked any specific questions regarding numbers&lt;br/&gt;    one player must lie when asked any specific questions regarding colors&lt;br/&gt;    and everyone else is telling the truth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
