			<description>Also called, the Deliria Prime Codex, this game is intended to be played either as a tabletop game or as a live action game. It uses a primarily narrative structure with one of several possible challenge resolution mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is subtitled &amp;quot;Faerie Tales for a New Millennium.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a Compact Disc containing:&lt;br/&gt;- Design notes, sketches and biographies.&lt;br/&gt;- Web links and resources.&lt;br/&gt;- Settings and characters.&lt;br/&gt;- Musical tracks.&lt;br/&gt;- Printable character sheets.&lt;br/&gt;- A diceless program for Internet play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We're living in a magical age. All over the world, people have begun to embrace a new and vital era, one in which old boundaries of identity and culture are rapidly dissolving. A sense of wonder pervades our faith, our entertainment, and especially our technology. We're halfway into Faerie, inheritors of an enchanted age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this is not the Faerie of European lore; rather, it's a swirling realm of colors and cultures the likes of which has never been seen before. Nor is it easy; indeed, like any trip to Faerie, it's paved with epic dangers. It is, however, fascinating: influences merge and mingle in phantasmal waves of Old World and New Era, of magic and mundanity, faith and technology. That which has been eternally separate is melding into something new and wonderful. It's terrifying to some, a miracle to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's an age of transformation. A changling time, a goblin market. A world where anything is possible if only we dare claim it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are alive in the age of miracles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Deliria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
