			<description>Each player gets a musical bingo card.  The cards consist of a diamond of whole, half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth notes distributed across the two musical clefs (treble and bass).  Each card either has notes on the lines or notes on the spaces between the lines.  The placement of the high/low notes are staggered and each card has a different placement of the various note lengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caller selects one of the musical note chits, which have a particular pitch and duration.  Players check their boards to see if they can match that pitch and duration.  If they can, they place a marker on the appropriate note.  Play continues until someone can make a run of 5 notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
