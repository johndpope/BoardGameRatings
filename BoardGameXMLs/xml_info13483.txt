							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bargain Day</name>
									
			<description>-From the Rulebook-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players enter the store in the mad rush of Bargain Day by the throw of seven on the dice, which represents the early seven o'clock opening. They gather around the Information Desk to receive information regarding purchases they wish to make; then move through the store, making purchases at the least possible expense with the money provided. Having done so, they must call some other member of the family by telephone to assist in carrying home their purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who shops most economically; that is, the one who has the most money remaining at the end of the game, is the Winner. As prizes are offered for the fastest shopper, the player who reaches the sidewalk in front of the store (in the company of some other family member of the family) is usually the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
