			<description>This game appears to be similar to Parcheesi in certain ways.  The goal of the game is to get all four of your pieces around the track on the board from your starting area to your goal area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player draws a card from the deck.  There are four each of twelve different cards in the deck.  Each card names and describes a location in Williamsburg.  Scattered about the game board are text for each of these locations and how they affect your pieces in the game.  10 of the locations move one of your pieces forward different amounts, 1 location moves one of your pieces backwards and 1 location causes you to lose a turn.  The player determines which of their pieces they want to move after drawing a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various spaces on the track allow you to move your piece forward, backward or swap with an opponents piece when your piece lands on them.  Also on the track are four extra areas that allow you to advance two of your pieces when one of your pieces successfully lands on a specific space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Parcheesi however, you cannot capture other player's pieces.  Opposing pieces can occupy the same space on the board without any penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- Mounted game board&lt;br/&gt;- 48 cards&lt;br/&gt;- 16 pawns (4 each of red, blue, green and yellow)&lt;br/&gt;- Rules sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
