			<description>This is an Icehouse board game in the style of the Frogger video game.  Icehouse pieces represent cars on a road that might run over turtles that are trying to cross the road.  Each player secretly programs a series of moves for their turtles, and then the moves are revealed and resolved.  Hitting traffic will cause your turtle to backtrack.  The first person to reach the other side of the street is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
