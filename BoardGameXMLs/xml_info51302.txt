							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Conspiracy X</name>
									
			<description>The adaptation of Eden Studio's Conspiracy X rpg to the Gurps system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Basic Set, Third Edition Revised and GURPS Psionics are required to use this supplement in a GURPS campaign. GURPS Compendium I and GURPS High-Tech, as well as Conspiracy X's Atlantis Rising, Exodus and Nemesis are also highly recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Conspiracy X combines the rich background of mystery, horror and intrigue found in Conspiracy X, the game of modern conspiracies, with the popular and powerful Generic Universal RolePlaying System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Conspiracy X is much like our own . . . if you could see beyond the lies. The same people walk the same dirty streets. The same animals rummage through the same garbage. The same mindless drivel is shown on the same television stations. Yet something is not right. There is a layer of &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; behind that understood by ordinary people. The &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; world is a facade covering the machinations of alien invaders, conspiratorial plots and supernatural horrors. In the flood of claims, countercharges, theories and stories about &amp;quot;what is really going on,&amp;quot; there are kernels of truth. A number of desperate groups will do anything to keep those truths hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Conspiracy X, players take the role of governmental officials, ranging from FBI agents to CIA spies to NSA codebreakers to Army Rangers and many more. The bond between these professionals is a super-secret organization called Aegis. Aegis was formed in the aftermath of the Roswell, NM alien sighting. It is dedicated to countering alien and supernatural menaces wherever they may arise. Any means are acceptable in the covert war that rages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
