							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Octopus Dominoes</name>
									
			<description>Octopus Dominoes is a color or number matching game for 2-4 children aged 3-7. The octopus lid acts as a starter tile for the game. The 36 double-sided tiles are divided among all the players. The tiles make up the octopus arms. There are two levels. In the beginners&amp;rsquo; game, the players match up the colors. The purple ovals start a new arm. The arm is completed when a hand is placed down. The winner is the first player to lay down all of his or her tiles.  The advanced game is the same, only the players match up the number side of the tiles. An arm will start with a blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
