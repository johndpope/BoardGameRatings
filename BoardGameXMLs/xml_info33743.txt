			<description>French cycling game on the Tour de France. Two versions of the game exist: one promotional version with cupboard cyclist and one commercial and more luxurious edition with a better box and plastic cyclists. The game contains a square board of 32x32cm. and apart from a map of France there is a picture of French Festina cyclist Richard Virenque (ironically the Festina squad was to be expelled from the '98 Tour de France because of a doping scandal)  in the right upper corner of the board. The winner is he who reaches Paris first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
