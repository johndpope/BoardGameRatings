			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player picks a card and tries to successfully bid the highest number combination or cause an opponent to unsuccessfully bluff a number combination.  The last bidder of each round moves its playing piece forward the number of spaces indicated on his card, if his bid is successful.  The player moves backwards that number of spaces if his bid is not successful.  The first player to the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards consist of eight numbers from 1 through 10 (10 is 0) and may repeat. Bidding proceeds as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player #1 says &amp;quot;three-3's&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Player #2 says &amp;quot;four-2's&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Player #3 says &amp;quot;five-2's&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consists of: 1 game board with a hexagon type &amp;quot;maze&amp;quot;, 36 cards, and 4 wood playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
