			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology Unleashed is a compilation of several technology sourcebooks published by Otherverse Games between 2013 and 2014. This massive campaign tool box includes all the content originally found in the PDF editions of The Polymer Path, The Advanced Arsenal, [rpgitem=167576 The Advanced Armory, The Advanced Edge and Advanced Tech, the Modern Grimorie and more. Within is every gun, energy blade, high tech suit of armor, gadget, sci-fantasy spell and cybernetic implant found in the original sourcebooks plus  new surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology Unleashed was designed with Otherverse Games&amp;rsquo; signature campaign settings in mind, built around modern and futuristic settings that blend magic and technology in some unexpected ways. However, these new pieces of gear and campaign elements can be imported into any campaign world, fusing sorcery and technology in some unique new ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology Unleashed differs from Paizo Publishing&amp;rsquo;s approach to technology, as exemplified by their Ultimate Technology sourcebook in several ways. Paizo Publishing treats technology as rare artifacts from an earlier era, or exotic wonders imported into an otherwise low-tech world by a crashed starship or dimensional rift. Technology is expensive, campaign changing and fundamentally limited by rare, hard to duplicate and extremely finite power sources. This sourcebook, on the other hand, treats high tech weapons, armor, cybernetics and props as common-place and products of an evolving, present-day technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
