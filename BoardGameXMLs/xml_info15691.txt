			<description>Traditional tokens are used, however the properties have a local historic flavor to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few cities in the United States have had more of an impact on American history and life than Boston.  From Pilgrims and patriots to her legendary resistance, heroic battles and stalwart ships, Boston served as a hotbed of revolutionary activity and cradle of the thirteen colonies' desire for liberty and self-determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Freedom of thought and the right of private judgment in matters of conscience, driven from every other corner of the earth, direct their course to this happy country as their last asylum,&amp;quot; Samuel Adams, Boston Patriot and Politician On Freedom of Thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come.  Gather family and friends to play this Boston edition of the Monopoly Game and watch historic Beantown come to life.  Be risk takers and deal makers, as were our Boston ancestors.  Trade in landmark properties and become part of the living history that is Boston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monopoly Brand proudly salutes the city famous for its pivotal insistence on freedom and independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
