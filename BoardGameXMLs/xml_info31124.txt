			<description>Zog Off! Ya Thievin' Lil Git! appeared in White Dwarf #117.  It was a clever use of the bits from Trolls in the Pantry along with some cut outs from the magazine.  The goal for each gobbo is to collect sets of food and get them into the pantry.  The trolls are trying to collect ALL the food and get it into the troll cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
