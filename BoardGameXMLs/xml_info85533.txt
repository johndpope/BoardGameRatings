			<description>In Captures, each player has three leopards (the targets) and a cube (the hunter) with one side open. Your goal is to capture as many of your opponent's leopards as possible while being the last player to have at least one leopard in the wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you move your hunter cube to try to catch an opponent's leopard. You catch a leopard when your hunter is on the path of an opponent's cube and the leopard is in its open side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, players tally their points &amp;mdash; 1 point for each captured leopard and 6 points for each leopard still free &amp;mdash; and the player with the highest sum wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
