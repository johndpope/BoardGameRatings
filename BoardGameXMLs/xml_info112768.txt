							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Critical Miss (Issue 4 - Winter 1999)</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;This issue's a little bit later than we'd have liked, but then we never were reliable. 'Fraid a whole load of real-world stuff got in the way - family, work, failed love affairs, love affairs that never were, and so on. But like we pointed out way back in GMing With Nothing - if we had lives we probably wouldn't be roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;      If any of you take a look at my GURPS Character Sheet you'll find it's been updated to reflect the fact that since Issue 3 I've lost around 35 pounds in weight. (Yeh!). Unfortunately, a recent discussion with Tattoo Girl has confirmed that this hasn't in any way affected any of the other disadvantages - but then I guess you can't have everything.&lt;br/&gt;      So you can all read on happily. It takes a potent blend of dysfunctional misery and creative frustration to churn out Critical Miss, and those both seem set to long continue. Guess we're here to stay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
