			<description>Simple roll and move game using a transportation theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions on the box state: &amp;quot;CROSSTOWN GAME -- for 2, 3, or 4 Players -- The object of the game is to be the first player to drive all the way through the town, obeying every sign on which his sports-car stops. (1) Each player uses a colored disk to represent his car. (2) All cars go from START by spins of the dial. (3) Each space or picture on the road counts one space. (4) When a car stops on a picture, the driver must obey the sign found there. (5) After passing the School, when one player's car stops on the same space (not picture) as an opponent's, the player's car moves AHEAD to the next picture and the opponent's car goes BACK to the picture just passed. (See rule 4.) (6) The last space, the one across the railroad track, must be reached by an exact spin. (7) The player whose car reaches this space first WINS THE GAME.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
