			<description>&amp;quot;Move and rotate an object through gaps in walls to score points. Play multiple modes and register your high scores!&lt;br/&gt;ThruSpace is an exciting puzzle game in which you&amp;rsquo;ll move and rotate an object called a keydron through gaps in walls. Putting your keydron through a gap gets you points, but mastering this ability allows you to perform combos (picking up pairs of crystals simultaneously) and tricks (rotating the keydron so that its shadow covers all of the gap before passing through it), which are the keys to achieving high scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refine your skills in multiple game modes (Normal, Endless, Trick Challenge), brush up on the rules in Keydron Tutorial, or watch replay data in Keydron Memories. As the game progresses, the number of keydrons, backgrounds, stages, and levels you can choose will increase. You can even connect to the Internet (broadband access required) and register your high scores in the World Leaderboard to compare your scores with other ThruSpace players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to play, but difficult to master, do you have the skills and reflexes to overcome the increasingly complex challenges of ThruSpace?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
