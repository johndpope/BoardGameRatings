			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 is a football game developed by Team Aquila and published by Sega. It's the third game of the saga after Victory Goal and Victory Goal '96, and is known as Victory Goal Worldwide Edition in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is not licensed by FIFA so cannot use real team or player names, however it attempts to stick as close as possible to the 1996 football season and allow users to rename players should they see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was re-released for Windows PCs in 1997 under the title of Sega Worldwide Soccer PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
