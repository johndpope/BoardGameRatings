			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've played a thousand different roleplaying games before, but what winds up being the same thing time and time again? Your characters are almost always homeless and engage in altercations that usually wind up being life or death matters. Or, as it was simply put in a conversation on gaming: adventurers are usually some sort of transient murderhobo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's the core concept behind Homicidal Transients. You and your gang wander aimlessly and kill things to get their stuff. Sometimes it's just money, sometimes it's a bottle or two of booze, maybe some magic. Any way you cut it, the stuff is yours now, and it's time to move on to the next place that you can get stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original game mechanics are designed to allow for any kind of dice you have. If you need to raid your board games for 6-sided dice, you'll be just as able to play as someone who has a 50 pound bucket of dice to sort through. A whole group at the table could get away with playing using just one pencil, a piece of paper, and one die with few complications. It's that simple to pick up and play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's better than a handful of friends sitting around and pretend murdering fake monsters for their imaginary stuff?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
