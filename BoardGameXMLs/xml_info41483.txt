			<description>This wargame recreates the turning point in the Spanish &amp;quot;reconquista&amp;quot; against the Muslim occupation in 1212. Still it took three more centuries to conquer the remaining kingdom of Granada, but from this battle onwards the Muslim armies weren't in position to defeat the christian kingdoms any longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On one side were the Almohades with their Califfa and his army and his famous bodyguard of chained slaves. On the other were the Kings of Castilla and Navarra with their armies. Sancho &amp;quot;el Fuerte&amp;quot;, King of Navarra, himself cut with his sword the slaves chain in order to reach the Califfa's tent. Still nowadays Navarra's shield is a set of chains on a red field remaining this fact of arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the first modern wargame ever published in Spain by the Spanish company NAC. It's print run was minimum, and it's impossible to find even a picture of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system could be considered &amp;quot;classic NAC&amp;quot; hex-and-counters with combat and movement factors and a dice with no 1 or 6 instead two 3 and two 4. You multiply the dice by the combat factors involved in each side and eliminate the looser side. All other wargames published by NAC in the following year used this system just changing the pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fue el primer wargame publicado por NAC, lo tuve en mis manos a los nueve a&amp;ntilde;os, pero me compr&amp;eacute; un Colditz, cuando volv&amp;iacute; ya no estaba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Si alguien lo tiene por favor haga algunas fotos y las cuelgue aqui.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Siempre lo busqu&amp;eacute; y nunca lo encontr&amp;eacute; por eso dise&amp;ntilde;&amp;eacute; mi juego sobre esta batalla&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
