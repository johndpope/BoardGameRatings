			<description>From Rules:&lt;br/&gt;You return from your latest mission to find your headquarters ransacked.  Every room has been upended, but the work is far too thorough.  This was an inside job.  Now it will take your ingenuity and resourcefulness to track down and stop whoever did this before they escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this dexterity-based deduction game, players are attempting to find the missing plans, which spy stole them, and the transportation they&amp;rsquo;ve used to escape.  To achieve this, players flick their Player Token and attempt to strike face-down Evidence Chips.  By keeping track of which chips are in the play area, they are able to deduce the missing Plans, Spy, and Transportation chips; the first to guess correctly wins the game.  If everyone fails, however, the spy escapes and everyone loses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpyFlick is designed by Lucio Rodriguez, and is scheduled for release (self-published) in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
