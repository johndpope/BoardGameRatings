							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buffalo Soldier</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first all black regiments formed in peace time, the Ninth and Tenth Calvary regiments and five regiments of infantry, the 24th, 25th, 38th , 39th, 40th and 41st, were formed to fight the Indian Wars on 1866. Composed of black soldiers led by white officers, these units were eventually named the Buffalo Soldiers by the Indians for their stamina and courage. Not only did the Buffalo Soldiers face lethal dangers from the Indians and the frontier, they faced a racist society that openly discriminated against them. This 6 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world focusing on the old Wild West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
