			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flowweaver is a fantasy role-playing game about the struggle for the balance of the Flow-a force of nature that exists in everything and infuses the inhabitants of the Tri-Worlds with special powers and abilities. Become a Weaver and intricately weave the Flow. Become a Wielder and forge great Flow weapons. Choose StormFinder and control the weather or slow time as a TimeBender. Phase through solid objects as an Oilskein. These and other Affinities will be needed by the &amp;quot;Callers&amp;quot; -- messengers of the planets themselves seeking your aid. Your adventure will likely take you to each planet that are connected by the Portals; alien chambers built by an unknown race and protected by the Portal Keepers. Flowweaver is compatible with the Flowweaver RPG rules and cards utilizing the same game concept called R.P.C. (Role-playing Cards). Flowweaver-another original game from RandymGames that tests imagination's border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
