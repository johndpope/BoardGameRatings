							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape From Pirate Island</name>
									
			<description>One player leads a Pirate fleet of 6 ships, while his opponent leads the King's fleet of 3 war ships, 2 life boats, and 9 merchant ships. Both sides have reserve forces that may come into play as well. Sea monsters (a giant squid and giant octopus) may be added to increase game complexity. The Pirate player wins by eliminating the King's fleet; the King's player can win via straight force elimination against the prates, successful transit of a merchant ship, or by capturing the Pirate's Treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
