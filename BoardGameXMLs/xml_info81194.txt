			<description>Back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare to embark on magical adventures rich in diversity and danger&amp;hellip;You are entering the Realms of Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fame, fortune, and power.  These are the spoils of victory awaiting those smart and strong enough to survive this incredibly challenging and multi-faceted fantasy adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruit up to eight courageous companions to help you explore an immense and highly detailed magical world.  Guide them as they travel across wilderness, cities, and thirty levels of underground dungeons, all teeming with powerful wizards, mighty heroes, menacing monsters, and of course, shimmering treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your band must fulfill seven different quests, each more perilous&amp;mdash;and potentially more rewarding&amp;mdash;than the one before.  Brawn may conquer monstrous hoards, but only brains can solve the increasingly elaborate and difficult puzzles that block your path to ultimate glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can split up your party into as many as eight different sub-groups.  You&amp;rsquo;re free to switch back and forth among these sub-groups, remaining with any one of them as long as you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is a complex game, considering the sheer size of the world and its labyrinthine catacombs, it is extremely easy to play.  By using either the keyboard or joystick, you can effortlessly switch between a menu-driven fantasy game or text adventure game.  In the latter mode, you can &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; in simple sentences, interact with people and objects, and solve puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
