			<description>Mimikri can be played as two variants of traditional chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first, players know the identity their own pieces but not that of their opponent. Only by studying the opponent's moves, can the pieces be identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second variant, players know the identity of their opponent's pieces but not of their own. Moves are made blindly. If a player moves a piece inappropriately, the opposing player says &amp;quot;no,&amp;quot; the piece is returned to its original position and it becomes the opposing player's turn to move. However, if the move is appropriate, the piece remains in its new position thus revealing its identity. Subsequent moves can be made accordingly. It is now the opposing player's turn to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
