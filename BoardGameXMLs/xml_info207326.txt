			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Satirik - Heroic Quest is a fantasy adventure board game for 2-5 players aged 10 and over, playable for 25-50 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;During each adventure where you play one of 5 brave heroes, you will find magical items that you use only once and equipment that give you permanent bonuses.You will meet companions who can help or hinder you in your quest, you shall fight with the guards unconquered region, but also with other heroes, and unforeseen events will dramatically change the flow of your adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays with moves(throwing dice), one player at a time. Move, attack other heroes and regions,use of objects and drawing prospective card only while in the course of your move. It is also not allowed and move and perform some action in the same turn. If during the movement meet with other heroes, you can attack it, do nothing or make a trade. Trump can exchange items, equipment, regions, etc., but not tasks. Battles are resolved classic throwing two dice (with the would-be certain bonuses and minuses), but you automatically lose if you get two aces,while  with two sixes you automatically win the battle. There are also various other accessories that enrich the game: Treasury, shortcuts, dungeons, sanctuaries, teleport, an abyss ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this wealth of options, the game is very simple and the rules are very easy to learn and leave no room for doubts. Game will even complete inexperienced players quite soon. In addition, Satirik is a very addictive game and it will certainly  hold your attention for a long time. We recommend a game with as many players so you can add more excitement to the party (and last much longer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
