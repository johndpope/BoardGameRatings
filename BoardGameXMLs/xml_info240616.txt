			<description>Boy Scouts is an Australian patriotic game first registered in 1911 by the National Game Company. Subsequent later versions appeared until around the 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple roll and move mechnism along a path starting at the Australian red ensign flag and progressing to a final camp destination 90 moves away. The later version has the flag at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the journey players can benefit or be penalized by landing on certain numbers, such as miss a turn, extra throw, advance or be sent back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to reach camp first is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
