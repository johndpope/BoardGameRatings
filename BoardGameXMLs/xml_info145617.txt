							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A War of Suits</name>
									
			<description>In this loosely based variant of the classic card game WAR, the suits have broken up, teamed up, and are at war with one another. The Clubs and Spades have teamed up against the Diamonds and Hearts. Unlike traditional WAR, cards are not revealed at random. Instead, players are able to choose the card or cards they would like to play in a variety of combinations. As each battle is fought, the losing side loses their cards and victory will come to the player with cards left standing. Trying to keep your best cards together could be a great strategy but beware the Royal Assassins and the Suicide Bomber disguised as the Aces and Joker respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
