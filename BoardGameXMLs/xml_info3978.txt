			<description>Cassa Grande is a Roland Siegers's small and fun game. The idea is very simple, rules are read in two minutes and a game need 10 minutes. The players have the same set of cards at the beginning of the play. Each at his turn plays a card back to front on the table in a virtual tray of 6x6. When all the cards are put, you turn the whole and each books its points. Cards form numbers which are differently read as we are in the North, the South, the East or the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
