			<description>&amp;quot;The educational word game. Fun for everyone from eight to eighty. As seen on T.V.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minute's the Limit is a word game played over several rounds. In this game, players must write down, under each of five &amp;quot;subject titles&amp;quot;, either a place, name, subject or thing that commences with a particular letter of the alphabet. Both subject titles and letters are selected by chance, thus allowing many possible answers. However, each round is timed -- adding further tension and competition to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each word written down that is deemed acceptable scores points for the player. Each unacceptable word causes the player to lose points. The player with the greatest number of points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
