							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curious George Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the Curious George books. Each player takes 7 balloon counters of 1 color, and uses a spinner to advance around the board. The spaces show many of Curious George's adventures. When you land on an Adventure Space, you place 1 of your balloon counters onto the white circle adjacent to it, but only if your color is not already on top of the pile of counters. If you land on a Corner Space, the player whose color matches the corner may place a balloon on any white circle that does not already have his or her color on top. The game stops when someone has placed all 7 balloons onto Adventure Spaces. Each player then takes all piles of balloons with his or her color on top. The player with the most balloons wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
