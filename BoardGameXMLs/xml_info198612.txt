							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grande Temple of Jing Suite</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Immerse Yourself In the Grande Temple of Jing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This piece of original music was commissioned from Erdenstern, a musical group from Germany. Their interpretation exceeded expectations for length and quality, resulting in a stirring piece of music that runs over 16 minutes in length. The piece perfectly captures the magic, mystery, playfulness, and wonder of the temple. The music moves like an adventure of it's own, starting with a single woodwind at the introduction. It twists and turns as it winds through themes of darkness and wonder. Finally, it erupts in a grand crescendo with full orchestral sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This piece is a perfect companion for sojourns into the Grande Temple of Jing, and anywhere else your imagination takes you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
