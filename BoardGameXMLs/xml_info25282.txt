			<description>&amp;quot;Hi Score&amp;quot; was published in the German magazine P&amp;ouml;ppel-Revue 5/86 as &amp;quot;Spiel im Heft&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 6x6 spaces and both players have 18 stones, numbered from 1-18 on the front side and empty on the back side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with an empty board. Each turn, a player places a stone on the board on the same row or column the last stone has been placed. Stones can not be moved to other spaces, but they are (must be) flipped over, if the sum of own stones in a row or column is higher than the sum of the opposing stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when a player can not place a stone on the board. To determine the winner, the numbers on the not yet played stones are subtracted from the total on the stones on the board. The higher total wins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
