			<description>Endless Quest #32&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Imprisoned by conquering King Cradack, you, Redmond Longbow, are forced to strike a strange bargain with the evil king. If you are successful, you will gain not only your freedom but that of your oppressed countrymen. But if you fail, you will meet your doom in the depths of the enchanted forest of Elderwood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to enter the exciting world experienced by players of the popular DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Game. It is a fantasy world filled with enchanted castles and fearsome monsters. Are YOU brave enough to meet its challenges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other ENDLESS QUEST Books, you can combat secret agents skilled in espionage, journey to the corners of the galaxy, or attempt to survive in a future world ravaged by wars. The choice is YOURS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ENDLESS QUEST Book is based on an exciting role-playing game, but you don't need to know the game to enjoy the book. Just make your choices, and accept the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember! Only your choices can lead to success in ENDLESS QUEST Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
