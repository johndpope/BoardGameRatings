			<description>&lt;br/&gt;    From the Instruction Manual*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seek Physique is a game of skill, chance, activity and commitment. It is designed for 2-6 players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players start the game, they [their characters] are not in good physical condition. The object is for each player to attempt to reach and maintain their desired weight (measured in pounds) and to increase their body's ability to use oxygen (measured in VO2 max.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These goals are achieved by moving around the board, answering health-related trivia questions, and performing physical exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
