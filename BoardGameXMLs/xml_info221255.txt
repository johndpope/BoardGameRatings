			<description>From cassette cover&lt;br/&gt;You have been seleted to enter the Earth's most exciting BMX trials. There are six amazing tests of skill. Bea the qualifying scores and stay in the competition to challenge for the world's records.&lt;br/&gt;1. 200 m Race - Race the computer th the finishing line avoiding the rocks, puddles of water and bumps in the track. Beware of wobble at low speeds.&lt;br/&gt;2. Wheelie - Pedal as fast as you can and pull a wheelie at the line. See if you can beat the record by holding it as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;3. Ramp Jump - Approach the ramo as fast as you can, make sure you are in line, then watch yourself soar through the air to qualify for the next test of skill.&lt;br/&gt;4. Slalom - Nothing byr deadly accuracy and speed will allow you to qualify by going through the gates and fences. It will help to use your breaks in this section&lt;br/&gt;5. Bunny Hops - You might have to go a bit slower on this, hop on the bars but be careful you don't collect too many penalty points.&lt;br/&gt;6. Beetle Ride - The final test. You will see the people's wagon in the distance but you will have to build up a tremendous amount of speed to jump over the car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
