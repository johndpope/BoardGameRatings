			<description>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a video game based on the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon film by Ang Lee. Players may play as Li Mu Bai, Yu Shu Lien, Jen, and Lo. The award-winning soundtrack features the Academy and Grammy Award winning music composed by Tan Dun with solos by internationally acclaimed cellist Yo-Yo Ma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action is set in the Qing dynasty of 19th century China. Retiring swordsman Li decides to give his jade sword, 'The Green Destiny' to a nobleman. The sword is stolen soon after. Li goes forth to retrieve it, assisted by his friend Yu Shu Lien. The nobleman's daughter, Jen, keeps encountering both characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is a typical fighting game with attacking and blocking moves, although there are extensive weapons that can be added.  The most noticeable addition is double jumps in the air that captivated movie audiences at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
