			<description>A tactical racing game where you as the coach of your team of racers aim to clutch victory in a fast race through the jungle. The combined score for your team adds up the total victory points so you need to make sure both racers passes the finish line as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game you can build a unique race course using the tiles, use a few for a quick game or use many of them to have a full night of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a heavy game with 32 custom dice for 3 &amp;ndash; 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round all players roll their dice in a common dice pool. The quickest player, decided by initiative tokens, start by selecting a dice and move. At the end of each turn, when all players have selected a dice, the initiative tokens are passed along to the left and a new turn starts. Each turn the tokens are passed along to the left until all dice are gone from the dice pool and a new round starts. During the players turn they can also spend Lava Stones to perform additional actions or make stunty manoeuvres along the course, your number of lava stones are limited so you should use them wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have uploaded the game in TableTopia, not fully customizable, but playable.&lt;br/&gt;If you are keen on trying it out together with some friends, let me know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
