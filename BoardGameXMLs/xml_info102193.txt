			<description>One year ago, King Lion had made the Battle of the Beast God tournament in order to see on who had what it took to challenge and fight him in his own time and opportunity. Nine fighters had entered the competition and each of them had battled in a strong and relentless manner, but in the end...Sho Hayate had proven to be the strongest warrior and that he had won the competition while defeating King Lion (and his master King Leo) in the finals of the tournament. To seek revenge against Hayate and those that caused his downfall, King Lion has organized a second version of the Battle of the Beast God tournament, but this time...there's a new rule. Teams of 2 people must participate in this competition and that they must work together in order to ensure victory or face defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the sequel to Savage Reign. Like its predecessor, it was ported to the Neo-Geo CD and also included in the Fūun Super Combo for the PlayStation 2 (released in Japan only). The European Neo-Geo homecart PAL release was rare, with less than 12 known copies, making it a sought-after item in video game collecting (the Japanese AES version is not rare and is identical except for the packaging and inserts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kizuna Encounter,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
