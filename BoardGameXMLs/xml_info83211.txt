							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GSR: German Street Racing</name>
									
			<description>Five hometown streetrace champions are looking for a new challenge, and founded the official &amp;quot;Deutschlands Streetracing Competition&amp;quot;. The #1 street racers from Munchen, Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Leipzig and Berlin came together to race against each other. Winner of all 5 cities becomes the official &amp;quot;Deutschlands greatest streetracer of 2006&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drift your way through 7 different tracks with different races such as cityrace and dragrace. Make sure you finish first to unlock new cars. Not only will you have to increase your drivingskills, but you also need skills in the garage. Since dragracing is totally different from a cityrace you have to tune your car to get the maximum result for every race. Buy upgrades to tune your car to the max!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
