							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arkel: De Ontdekkingsreis Sinds 1442</name>
									
			<description>A game jointly released by Identity Games and the Reinier van Arkel Group (the oldest psychiatric hospital in the Netherlands) in honor of the van Arkel Group's 565th anniversary. Players bid for control of one of six different ships on the board using a hidden bidding system that simultaneously determines how far that boat may move on that turn. The object is to pick up 'patients' in specific cities and deliver them to your own designated areas - but you have to be careful what you choose to carry because you may not be able to retain control of that boat on the next turn. Safely delivered patients reward players with varying amounts of dubloons and the player with the most dubloons at the end of the game (after there are no patients left in need of transport) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a small deck of 'Arkel' cards which players can acquire during the game and use for different one-off effects such as movement bonuses or cash bonuses. The Arkel cards also include facts and anecdotes about the history of the Reinier van Arkel Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
