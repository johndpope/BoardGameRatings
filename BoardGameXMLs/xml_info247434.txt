							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gleaner Heights</name>
									
			<description>Plant.    Feed.    Sin.    Repeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll be able to enjoy all of your normal farming activities from planting crops, tending livestock, cooking recipes, fishing, and more. You can even forage under the sea for sunken treasures to help fund your farm further! If you fancy yourself a day off, explore the town and participate in one of many festivals to enjoy the company of your fellow citizens. You can even strike up a relationship with one of the fine folks of Gleaner Heights!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't let this peaceful existence pull the wool over your eyes, though. Underneath the rosy atmosphere of Gleaner Heights, there are betrayals and unsettling events to stumble upon. You can choose to help certain townsfolk with their evildoing, or stop them in their tracks with your own plot. Beyond the evil citizens lies an even darker power for you to try to stop and you can use the metals you find in the mines to create armor in order to stand a chance against your foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
