							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the 1974 horror film, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was published by Wizard Video Games which was a small game company trying to carve out a niche market for adult gamers in the early eighties. The player takes on the role of Leatherface who uses a (surprise) chainsaw to kill tourists who are trespassing on his land. Each tourist killed scores 1,000 points. For every 5,000 points scored you get a free tank of gas to keep your chainsaw running. The game ends when you run out of gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
