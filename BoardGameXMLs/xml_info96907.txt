							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">EIC League</name>
									
			<description>EIC League is a tactical combat / RPG crossover that is completely customizable. You add your own dice and playing field to the EIC League rules that you download, and you are ready to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player is assigned the same number of credits (a budget) that they have to spend to buy and customize their units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players design units (either bipeds or tanks), equip them with the 7 ratings they need (body material, attack, defense, power, speed, detection &amp;amp; ECM), then outfit them with weapons, shielding, and special movements. After the units are completed, they pit their team against one or more opponents. The game is like chess on steroids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infinite combinations of weapons, movements and defenses against the other team's weapons movements and defenses makes for a unique playing experience each and every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unit design can take up to 2 hours for first time players, and play time can range anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours. The object of the game is to obliterate the opposition and collect credits for rewards. With those credits, you can buy more units or upgrade your existing units through the roof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy is the key to winning. Do you use a bunch of fast and light units or just work with a couple of super strong slow units, or go with a mix of everything? Depending on what you do and what each opponent does, you can battle for hours or you can make a fatal mistake and have things end very quickly. No two games are alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
