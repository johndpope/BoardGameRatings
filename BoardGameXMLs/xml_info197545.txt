			<description>From Back Cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a simple stream crossing. What could Possibly go wrong? the Goblins of the White Mines are keeping strange company and the problem is bigger then it looked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Felgrom the hill giant discovered,then Bullied, a small goblin mining tribe into serving him food and warmth within their caves. Little did Felgrom realize he had accidentally bullied something more then a simple tribe of goblins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curse of the White Mine is designed as a single session, non-linear adventure. Major setting disruptions are kept to a minimum so as not to intrude on your master plan or the current campaign in progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
