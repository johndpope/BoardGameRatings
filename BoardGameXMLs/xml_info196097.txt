			<description>Heroes of Legionwood is a classical style fantasy RPG set in a world on the brink of annihilation. It is the third exciting instalment in the epic Legionwood saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been 100 years since the world ended. Human civilization has been devastated by a malevolent force known only as the Darkness and only the last remnants of humanity remain. Playing the role of Locke, a young adventurer determined to save his people, you'll discover a world where your choices have consequences and every victory comes with a price.
