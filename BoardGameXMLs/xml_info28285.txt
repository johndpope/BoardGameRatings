			<description>THE CRISIS:&lt;br/&gt;A world famous physicist, noted for discovering a new fuel source, has been kidnapped and is being held hostage in a remote jungle fortress somewhere near the equator. Intelligence sources believe the physicist will reveal the new fuel source to whomever liberates him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MISSION:&lt;br/&gt;As Chief of Intelligence for a world superpower, you control the movements of a special secret agent/army commando rescue team in a daring plot to liberate the physicist and return him to your home embassy. You must outwit and outmaneuver each of your opponents if your mission is to succeed. Careful planning is crucial to avoid setbacks along the way. A word of advice: keep your team together and above all, watch your back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
