							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bacteria Arcade Edition</name>
									
			<description>Inspired by multiple classic arcade games, the basic idea is to stop multiple waves of enemy bacteria from snatching away your last few remaining cells that are located in the center of the screen. However, there are also some bacteria who are intent on destroying you - so you must destroy them first. If you succeed in lasting 60 seconds then you will be rewarded with a further cell to protect on the next wave, and so on...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Conversion to Ouya was particularly easy because I used a cross-platform development system called Gideros  because of this there was virtually no code changes to the game.&amp;quot; says Anthony.&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player simultaneous action: Bacteria&amp;trade; Arcade Edition has up to four-player simultaneous action on TV based video game consoles, but also features a two-player 'cocktail' mode on played like a retro cocktail table arcade game on handheld machines. In multi player mode, players cooperate to save the cells and defeat the invading bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;Two player simultaneous 'cocktail' play mode (press the green button!) - Android/iOS.&lt;br/&gt;Four player simultaneous play mode on Ouya.&lt;br/&gt;Classic 60hz retro arcade game action with addictive gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;Three levels of difficulty: Novice, Arcade, and Insane!&lt;br/&gt;Emergency hyperspace button!&lt;br/&gt;Two different control methods individually selectable per player - Android/iOS.&lt;br/&gt;Keyboard support (cursors, X - fire, Y - hyperspace) - Android/iOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
