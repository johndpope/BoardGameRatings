			<description>Hexmozaix is a set of 12 hexagonal tiles divided into 6 regions, 3 rhomboid regions at 3 alternating corners, and 3 chevron-shaped regions each enclosing a rhomboid. There is one tile for each possible way of coloring the regions with 3 colors such that each rhombus is a different color and each chevron is a different color (including reflections).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are numerous puzzles provided with the set, plus two games. The tiles were created by Charles Butler, the games were presumably created or developed by Kate Jones. The games are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexmozaix. Players (2, 3, or 4) take turns choosing face-up tiles until all 12 are distributed, then play one at a time to the table. Players get points for extending paths of the same color with their tile plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Color-Trax. Similar to Hexmozaix, except that each player chooses a color before the tiles are divided up (it is strictly a 3-player game), and scores only for that color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an additional set of 18 tiles which can be added to both games, Hexmozaix II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
