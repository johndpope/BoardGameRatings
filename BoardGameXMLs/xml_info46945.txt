			<description>A strategy card game set in the fictional world of Project Utopia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deck can consist of character, event, condition, weapon, mission and location cards. Up to four copies of a single card are allowed in a deck. Only  a single starting effect is allowed per player, and this does not count towards the 60 card deck size limit. &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns deploying, fighting, moving and regrouping. Players may use a combination of the 7 main factions to compose their deck: Agents, The Creed, Gangs, Hackers, Utopia Police Department, and Rebels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is released under a Creative Commons-Attribution-Share Alike License.
