			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A beat em up game for one or two players. Unlike most fighters, the game uses six buttons to attack two for your characters weapons or punches and two kicks giving you access to many more moves than most beat em up games. There is also a jump button and a button that possesses an enemy character that you can then control and do different special attacks with. After beating each level you are able to choose an enemy to play as, you will then fight in a one on one battle against a computer, for bonus points, or the second player where the loser loses a credit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese version only has three buttons and removes the fighting sections after each level but it adds unique endings for finishing the game with different pairings of its four characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
