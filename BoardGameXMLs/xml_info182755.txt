							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Epic Tales</name>
									
			<description>Every spring, when the snows thaw and the adventuring season begins, the greatest heroes in the land go forth to do mighty deeds and win great fame throughout the land. In autumn, when the cold winds force the noble heroes home, they return to the king's court and tell of the mighty deeds they have done...sometimes embellishing their stories a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic Tales is a card game in which players put together a hand of cards composed of monsters, items, and treasures, and then boast about the mighty deeds they have accomplished. The goal of the game is to gain the most fame by defeating the most monsters, visiting the most exotic locations, and finding the greatest treasures in the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King's Humblest Servant--the player who boasts the least fame--gets to hear each other hero's tale and decides whether to force them to prove their story or to accept it as they say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are forced to prove your story then you must show how you used your items, companions, and skills to defeat the monsters you boasted of defeating. If you were telling the truth then you win even more fame; if you were lying then you lose fame for each monster you were unable to defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever has earned the most fame after 3 years wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
