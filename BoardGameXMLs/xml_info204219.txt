			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kingdom of the Sun has a strict, class-based society. Status and position are very important. The Kingdom has been ruled by Ular IV for forty peaceful years, but is now facing a crisis of succession. The king has three children - the eldest his heir, has been carefully groomed to become King Elen III upon Ular&amp;rsquo;s death. The second, his only daughter, as was the custom has been trained in priestly duties and was set to become head of the church on her thirtieth birthday. The youngest has been trained in the magical arts, and has been head of the collage of magic for the last three years. All these positions are normally held by the King&amp;rsquo;s three eldest children. A week before the adventure begins, the King and all three children are wiped out in a freak sailing accident on a lake at the royal Summer retreat. Foul play is not suspected. Normally, in this case, the fourth in line to the throne (in this case, the king&amp;rsquo;s eldest nephew) would be instated as heir and the queen would rule until her death. However, the queen is ill, and close to death. As soon as news of the tragedy reaches her, she summons the Lord Chamberlain to her bedside and tells him disturbing news. She says that some years before, after the birth of their first child, Ular had revealed to her that he had been unfaithful, and had fathered a son by another woman some years before. The queen was shocked, and refused to hear more, despite the king&amp;rsquo;s willingness to confess. He managed to blurt out some details despite the queen&amp;rsquo;s protestations. The matter never arose again between them. However, now it becomes important, since a bastard child would be next in line to the throne before the nephew. It is vital that this son, now probably in his early thirties be found or else war may ensue. The queen remembers few details about the nature of the affair since it was so long ago and so very repugnant to her that she pushed it from her memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure was designed for tournament play at Gaelcon '94.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
