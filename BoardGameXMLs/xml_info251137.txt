							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vietnam: Rumor of War</name>
									
			<description>The second game on the Operational Scale Series.  This game covers the American involvement in the Vietnamese War of 1965-1972.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1965, the United States decided to intervene in the ongoing conflict in Vietnam.  This moment shaped the United States more than any other in the 20th Century.  From the battlefield to the home front, the United States faced one of the greatest challenges in its history.  Using the Operational Scale System as seen in Korea: Fire and Ice, OSS: Vietnam will show the conflict in a playable yet historical manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will negotiate the minefield of Publix opinion while attempting to win on the battlefield.  The game covers the American involvement in the war (from 1965-1972) and offers players the options to expand the war in ways that few games on this conflict allow.  The Americans can invade North Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia at their own political risk - as can the Communist player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
