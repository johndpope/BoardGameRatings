							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legend Dominoes</name>
									
			<description>Very rare game from around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature characters and scenes from famous fairy stories. When laid out in a set of four, the bottom of each card can be read, in squence, and providing a pr&amp;eacute;cis of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal out a number of cards and stack the rest in a draw pile (called the Pool back then). On your turn you must add a card to one of the stories (and it must be the correct card in the sequence, not just a card related to that story). If you cannot go, you draw a card from the Pool. The first player to use their last card, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If reversed, the cards can be used as a regular set of dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
