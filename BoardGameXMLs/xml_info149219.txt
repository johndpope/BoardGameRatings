							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crypt Entrance</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crypt lay undisturbed for centuries. Not only was the approach wrought with peril, but the entrance was sealed off from the rest of the world by a heavy stone slab. Its mysteries lay hidden in the dark...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only recently has a bold group of adventurers come to the crypt, pushing aside the massive stone to reveal the entrance below. Who knows what wonders - and what dangers - lie in the depths of the crypt?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crypt Entrance is a focal point in A Hero's Journey, a mini-adventure for level 0 characters by Darklight Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack includes low resolution (50 DPI) and high resolution (200 DPI) images of the entrance in full color. Package also includes images without grid lines for use in third party applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
