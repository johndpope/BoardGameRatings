			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heart of Darkness is a three-part Quest for the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game. It consists of 40 Encounters. Part One takes part in the Bloodsands, a hot and parched desert. Part Two takes place in some sand-blasted hills within the Bloodsands, while part three takes place underground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are sitting in the war chamber of Lord Carse, leader of the fortified outpost known as Crimsonrock. With you are many advisors, as well as Lord Carse himself. Standing behind the Lord is a figure dressed in a hooded light brown robe, his (or her) features completely hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you for answering our message,&amp;rdquo; begins Lord Carse, &amp;ldquo;and thank you for coming as quickly as you did.&amp;rdquo; You nod and smile. &amp;ldquo;We have need of someone brave and daring, such as yourself, to undertake a dangerous mission.&amp;rdquo; You hadn&amp;rsquo;t really expected anything less, so you indicate that you are listening. &amp;ldquo;This is somewhat of a secret, so we trust you will keep this to yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;As you know, this outpost stands very close to the northern edge of the Bloodsands, the great desert that is home to the undead legions. Within this desert is an outcropping of hills and mountains, very tall, that is home to a race of beings whose existence has long been kept quiet. These beings, the Shin&amp;rsquo;via, as they are called, guard a sacred chamber that is home to an artifact of great - and dark - power. This artifact is said to be the heart of a demonic god, and it has the power to unmake life. Not just simply kill someone, mind you, but unmake them completely as if they had never existed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Carse pauses to let this sink in for a few moments before indicating that the brown-robed figure should come forward. The creature lowers its hood, revealing some sort of reptilian face, with beady eyes, sandy coloured scales and a long tongue that flicks in and out like that of a snake or lizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Viash here is an emissary of the Shin&amp;rsquo;via, and he has come with a dire warning,&amp;rdquo; continues Lord Carse. &amp;ldquo;It appears that the undead have learnt of the chambers the Shin&amp;rsquo;via guard and are now marching on them, ready to throw all they have at gaining the Darkheart, as the artifact is known. This cannot be allowed to happen. Will you go and stop this? Do whatever you must, but the Darkheart must remain within the chambers guarded by the Shin&amp;rsquo;via or else all of Arax is doomed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will go,&amp;rdquo; you say. &amp;ldquo;When do I leave?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Immediately,&amp;rdquo; replies Lord Carse. &amp;ldquo;Viash will act as your guide through the Bloodsands. Take plenty of water with you, it would not do for you to die of thirst before completing your mission.&amp;rdquo; You stand and nod and, along with Viash, prepare to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
