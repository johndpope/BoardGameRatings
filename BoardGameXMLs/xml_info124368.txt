							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hedgerows of Horen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had just entered the valley of Horen, home to peaceful farmers so we have been told. Beware were the warnings, as their crops are well protected from the great beasts. No sooner did we set into the valley, following a mountain stream, then we came across a hedgerow, much like those that cross most of France. But this hedgerow was extraordinary in size, perhaps 50 feet high, and equal of thickness in places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
