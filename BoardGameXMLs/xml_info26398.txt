			<description>Eco-Logica is a game for children ages 8 to 14 years old. It let's the child realize that there are certain problems with our environment that threaten the earth. The gameboard carries a drawing of a sad world. During the play the child is stimulated to find the right answers to ecological problems. The goal of the game is to get back a smile on the earth on the board. The game contains a board, a spinning device (with the image of a sad world), 1 die, 6 pawns, 6 cards with ecological issues, 16 chips, 16 cards with illustrations of ecological problems (like some animal species that are threatened to be distinguished), 55 solution cards and a manual of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
