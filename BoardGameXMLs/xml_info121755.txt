							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartoona: Long Necks Expansion</name>
									
			<description>In this zany expansion, Cartoona creatures can become even stranger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes six neck tiles that can be placed in-between a head tile and a front body tile. These neck tiles can be placed even when the head and body have already been connected! They can also be stacked on top of one another for some seriously long necks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neck tiles can also be placed on the creatures of your opponents in an attempt to disrupt single-color creature scoring, or give negative points with the &amp;quot;crick in the neck&amp;quot; tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below are the neck tiles included in the expansion:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One yellow and purple dual-color neck, worth six points&lt;br/&gt;     One yellow crick in the neck, worth -3 points&lt;br/&gt;     One magenta neck with Adam's apple, worth 4 points&lt;br/&gt;     One blue neck with a collar, worth 5 points&lt;br/&gt;     One wavy magenta neck worth 3 points&lt;br/&gt;     One straight magenta neck, worth 3 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four new cards will come with the expansion including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One &amp;quot;remove neck&amp;quot; tile card&lt;br/&gt;     One &amp;quot;steal neck&amp;quot; tile card&lt;br/&gt;     One &amp;quot;-4 pain in the neck&amp;quot; card and&lt;br/&gt;     One &amp;quot;use a neck as any leg or tail&amp;quot; tile card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
