			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swooping through the night,&lt;br/&gt;Our rockets chase the sleigh,&lt;br/&gt;Through the clouds we fight,&lt;br/&gt;Laughing all the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the same night every year, a mysterious red-robed sorcerer flies his enchanted sleigh to a nearby human settlement, dropping various wrapped packages down the chimneys before making his escape. The goblins admire his courage and tenacity, but not his success rate; as far as they can tell, none of the houses have ever blown up, or even burned down. The sorcerer clearly has no experience with explosives, and so the infamous gremlin artificer Grinchie Charfoot has decided it&amp;rsquo;s time for the professionals to take over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Savage Worlds One Sheet adventure for Saga of the Goblin Horde. It provides a simple five-scene framework which can be run with minimal preparation, leaving room for the Game Master to flesh out the story as much or as little as they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
