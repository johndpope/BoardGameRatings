			<description>Winnie the Pooh and his friends are trying really hard to stay on the path while the wind is blowing really strongly. The Players throw a colored die and move the figures on a board that may fall anytime. Therefore the players have to think carefully, which figure to move, for if the board falls the player loses all his honey. The winner is the player who at the end still has any honey tokens after all the others have lost theirs'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
