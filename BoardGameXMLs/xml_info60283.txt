							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rookie&#039;s Guide to Atlantis and the Black Atlantic</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlantis is a word that conjures up mystery and intrigue when mentioned, and like the fabled city of legend, the way station of Atlantis acts as a magnet for explorers, vagabonds and tourists alike. Located in the middle of the Black Atlantic Ocean and protected by only a handful of judges, Atlantis is a port of call for ships, subs and a focal hub of the amazing Trans-Atlantic Tunnel that connects Mega-City One to Brit-Cit. Pirates are always only a broadside away and boardroom dealings and politics work to drain every ounce of willpower from the citizens employed to make sure the station runs properly. Atlantis IS a place where the rich and famous stand above the common man and where it is as simple to drop out of sight as it is to board the Zip monorail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages you will find details of the citizens who live and work on the station, as well as the worst dregs of humanity that prey upon them. Games Masters will find details on the pirates who operate in the Black Atlantic, running pirate campaigns and one-off adventures. The judges of Sea Watch are the last line of defence in Atlantis. They work tirelessly to keep the populace under control and stamp down hard on crime. Choose from a number of new judge Prestige Classes from the members of Sea Watch to Harbour and Ocean Patrol to the investigative Immigration Control Judge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So whether you plan on partaking in a game of Aquaball in the Seaview Park, diving at the Jacques Cousteau Underwater Training Centre, or just waiting for the connection to Brit-Cit, The Rookie S Guide fo Atlantis and the Black Atlantic offers you all this and much, much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Full History of Atlantis - its Creation, Development and Current Politics&lt;br/&gt;     Denizens of the Deep -New Critters&lt;br/&gt;     The Law of the Sea - New Judge Prestige Classes and Piracy Rules&lt;br/&gt;     Entertainment in Atlantis&lt;br/&gt;     A Detailed Tour of Atlantis and its Sister Plexes underneath the Black Atlantic&lt;br/&gt;     New Prior Lives and Citizen Prestige Classes&lt;br/&gt;     New Technology - Equipment ranging from Aquapacks to the Wetbike Lawmaster&lt;br/&gt;     Entertainment in Atlantis The Trade and Commerce of Atlantis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
