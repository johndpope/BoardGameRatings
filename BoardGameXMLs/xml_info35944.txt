			<description>&amp;ldquo;In this game you play a Lensman Ranger with his intergalactic assault scout ship. You must use your Lensman Powers to undermine enemy bases while battling any Morad ships that you encounter . . . When you have successfully infiltrated and brought down all four Morad quadrant bases in the Second Galaxy, you win.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire game is played by randomly selecting cards from a deck containing a variety of Morad ships (frigates, destroyers, and cruisers) and four &amp;ldquo;Quadrent Base&amp;rdquo; cards. You must defeat each ship until you have encountered and successfully infiltrated all four bases. Each ship is rated for power, hull strength, number of weapons/attacks, and weapon strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
