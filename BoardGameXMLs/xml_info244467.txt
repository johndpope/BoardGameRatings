							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">101 Dalmatians Spoons Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A kid-friendly version of the classic &amp;quot;Spoons&amp;quot; party game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastic &amp;quot;bones&amp;quot; are laid in the center of the table, equivalent to one less than the number of players. Each player has a hand of 4 cards; first player draws a new card and discards directly to the next player, who must take that card and discard to the next, etc. When the final player has drawn, s/he discards to a discard deck, and the beginning player draws a new card from the draw deck. As soon as one player has acquired a full 4-of-a-kind set, they discard and then claim a bone from the table, which triggers a mad dash on the part of the other players to grab the remaining bones. The slowest to claim a bone is eliminated from the game each round, leaving a single winning player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version differs from regular Spoons because that one requires players to simultaneously transfer cards to the left while accepting cards from the right, while this version has one player drawing then discarding at a time, and progressing around the table, one player at a time. Furthermore, the rules about being a &amp;quot;pig&amp;quot; and then a &amp;quot;hog&amp;quot; are nowhere in the Disney version,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
