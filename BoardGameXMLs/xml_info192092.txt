			<description>Say what you see in this fast-paced family card game based on the hit TV show. Go head-to-head with your opponent to see who will be crowned Catch Phrase champion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the host, and reveals a card to the other players. They then have to identify the familiar phrase represented by the picture on the card. The first player to identify the catchphrase adds the card to their pile. Each card has a monetary value based on the difficulty of the catchphrase. Once all cards have been revealed, the game is over. The player with the most amount of money is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
