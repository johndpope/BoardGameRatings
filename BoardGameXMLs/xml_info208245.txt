							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oleric Preene</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oleric is a chaotic evil male half-orc with antipaladin levels utilizing the iron tyrant archetype (included along with progression table).  He focuses on powerful defense and fights with his armor spikes and hurled javelins.  His capabilities are greatly bolstered by his armor mastery feats (included) gained as bonuses as he progresses levels.  These are supplemented by bonding a fiendish spirit into his armor for various arcane effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We love our fantasy villains.  We find them in films, on posters, in commercials, on snack foods, and even as action figures.  Our societies flirt and play with villains at a safe distance, and we adore them.  That same sense of awe and wonder can be captured by a player roleplaying an evil character.  It does not work for all gaming groups, but for those able to handle it, the experience can be rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product can serve several purposes.  Some game groups dabble in evil adventures as a one-shot or short run campaign.  Others want to experiment with evil characters and add one or two in to see how it affects the game.  Still others fully embrace evil characters and find they sometimes need replacement characters after a sudden and unexpected character death.  For whatever reason you need a ready-to-play character sheet, this product is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Wicked Wanderers!  In this product, you will discover twenty complete stat blocks for a single PC, level 1 through 20, adhering to the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game rules.  The core format adheres to the standard non-player character (NPC) stat block most GMs are already familiar with minus the Tactics section.  This makes it easier for the GM to assist with finding information and also prepares the player for the day he or she is running games!  The Special Abilities section includes more detailed write-ups of feats and character abilities than a standard NPC stat block to facilitate faster play.  Sources for spells, races, classes, archetypes, and prestige classes from sources other than the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&amp;trade; (PZO1110) are listed in the Sources section and can be referenced in the Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Reference Document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
