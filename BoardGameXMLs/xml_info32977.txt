			<description>From the Rules:  Invasion is a game for two to four players, who have before them a board divided into 13 rows of 13 alternatively white and blue squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is marked to show the starting position of the various pieces within each player's territory.  There are 15 total units in a player's force, 6 Soldiers, 2 Tanks, 2 Cannon, 2 Bombers, 2 Pursuit Planes, 1 Dictator.  These units are all lead miniatures (flats).  Each unit type has a different movement, for example the soldier can move 1 space in any direction, the tank can move 1 or 2 squares in any direction.  A unit is captured by entering its square and in some cases (cannons) the unit capturing can jump over intervening friendly units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to capture the opposing dictator or dictators at which time the captured dictator's entire army &amp;quot;surrenders&amp;quot; and is removed from the board.   When four people are playing then two sides ally and both players on one side must be defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
