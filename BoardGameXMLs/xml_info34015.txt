			<description>From the box:  All of Me is a fun and healthful game for children Ages 4 - 8.  Simple, yet stimulating, it promotes the positive values of life along with color and shape recognition, sequential reasoning, turn taking and even a healthy degree of frustration tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-f-a-kind game, developed by psychologist Dr. Paul R. Gorecki and New Day Enterprises, helps young children develop a healthy attitude about themselves, their emotions and life in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolling the die (a large foam cube), players move about the graphically interesting game board amid colorful children's activity scenes, following directions and gathering cards which clearly display the meaning of Love, Happiness, Sharing, Caring, Honesty and Friendship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may be lucky enough to climb a tree to the &amp;quot;Nest Rest&amp;quot;, glide down the &amp;quot;Water Slide&amp;quot;, or go &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; space, all the while keeping an eye on their &amp;quot;ALL OF ME&amp;quot; goal and their playmates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first child to collect and assemble all six positive value cards on his or her self-character and move on to the &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; space wins.  Yet, because of what the game teaches, and the active excitement and positive feelings it creates, there are no real &amp;quot;losers&amp;quot; ... only winners ... in &amp;quot;All OF ME&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
