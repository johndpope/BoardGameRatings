			<description>This game is pure pre-WWII propaganda aimed at encouraging Germans to enlist in the military. It is a simple roll-and-move affair, with the objective of reaching the final square first while obeying special instructions for each of the illustrated spaces. The game instructions are printed on the underside of the box lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has two sides, each with a distinct game and message. The title side shows the wonderful experiences awaiting recruits to the army, navy and air forces: being taught how to make a bed properly by a kindly drill sergeant, learning how to gamble with cards, eating gourmet food from a field kitchen, meeting pretty ladies at a military dance, and engaging in a variety of sports, drama and musical activities. Along the way, recruits also learn how to shoot, how to march, how to swim a river in full kit, how to climb a mast and how to fly, before marching happily out the gate as their service comes to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second side of the board has a similar roll-and-move game that sends players on a grand tour of a newly expanded Germany. The map shows a Germany that includes Austria and the Sudetenland (with the former borders of Czechoslovakia still outlined), but does not yet extend into Poland. This clearly dates the game to late 1938 or early 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
