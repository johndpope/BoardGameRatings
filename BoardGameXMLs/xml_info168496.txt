							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: The Guild&#039;s Judgement â€“ Lady Justice Box Set</name>
									
			<description>When the Guild created the Death Marshals Department to directly combat the Resurrectionist threat in Malifaux few were willing to lead the Marshals in their grim task. The weapons wielded to combat the undead corrupt their users just as foully as necromancy corrupts its practitioners, and each qualified candidate was unwilling to give up his humanity for the Guild. That is, until a woman stepped forward and volunteered for the command. Her true name remains as much a mystery to the Guardsmen outside of the Death Marshals as the source of her blindness. Whatever took her sight, the rumor goes, blessed her with supernatural senses and also granted her the ability to resist the necromantic influences that slowly corrupt every other member of the Death Marshals Department. Lady Justice is tireless in her hunt for Resurrectionists in the City. She and her Death Marshals are called on the scene when evidence of necromantic rituals, or some chance encounter with the undead, have exhausted the Guild Guard's resources. Once on the trail of a Resurrectionist, Justice does not tire and does not give up until her suspect is in her custody, or is no longer able to pose a threat to the residents of Malifaux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
