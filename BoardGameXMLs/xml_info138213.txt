			<description>Ronnie Peterson (1944&amp;ndash;1978) was a Swedish racing driver known by the nickname 'Super Swede'. He was a two-time runner-up in the FIA Formula One World Drivers' Championship. (Source: Wikipedia)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1974 edition of the game has Ronnie in his Lotus 72 with the number 1 on the front cover. The 1977 edition has him in his six wheel Tyrrell P34 on the front cover. (Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.ronniepeterson.se/subc/eng/p.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ronniepeterson.se/subc/eng/p.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is different from other versions of Formula 1 because it has &amp;quot;Chans&amp;quot;(Eng: Opportunity) and &amp;quot;Dep&amp;aring;&amp;quot;(Eng: Pit) cards, and rather than a dashboard with a speedometer, tire and brake wear gauges, the player boards are gear boxes used to indicate what gear/speed the car is in as well as indicators for &amp;quot;Slitage&amp;quot;(Eng: Damage) and laps. The course is also different than other Formula 1 games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
