			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Mill Valley, a wild west style boomtown in a fantasy setting! Founded by a wealthy young lord with an extra spark of ambition and driven by a combination of hard work and magical sawmills Mill Valley is destined for success.

With them have also come those looking to capitalize on the success in a, shall we say, less reputable manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
