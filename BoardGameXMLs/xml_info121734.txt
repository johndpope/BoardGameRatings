							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mall of America Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>Mall of America Tycoon is a business simulation game in which the player must successfully create and run a mall. The mall is based on the real Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. The player must manage the mall's income, store contracts, and special event days in order to create a successful mall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player starts out with an empty mall, on which they must develop their mall. Options for building include the normal stores and restaurants, but also other items commonly found in malls, such as benches and small plant life. The mall must be developed in such a way that it is profitable, allowing one to add more items. For example, the player can schedule promotions such as the Day of Discounts to draw more people into the mall. Also, a new attraction at Camp Snoopy, the large amusement park in the center of the mall can help attract more people to the mall.&lt;br/&gt;After the player develops the first area sufficiently, another section of the mall is unlocked. There are sixteen sections which need to be developed, and when the last one is complete, the player has won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mall of America Tycoon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
