							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Warlord Class</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot; A powerful leader and support class, the Warlord is also a strong secondary front line combatant. Drawing inspiration from the 4th Edition class and the 5th Edition Fighter Battlemaster archetype, the Warlord specializes in buffing allies, granting temporary hit points, and adding tactical flexibility to any party. As an Eldritch Knight is to a Wizard, the Battlemaster is to a Warlord, superiority dice fuel many of the class&amp;rsquo;s strongest abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained within is a complete 20 level class with three thematically distinct archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brilliant Tactician, a master of unexpected gambits and surprise maneuvers. &lt;br/&gt;The Fearsome Commander, a tyrant that terrorizes those would would oppose you. &lt;br/&gt;The Inspiring Captain, a paragon who brings out the best in those around him. &lt;br/&gt;   Whether you seek a great non magical support option for your party, or inspiration for a flexible and powerful foe to level against the PCs, the Warlord is a valuable addition to your arsenal.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Author Summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
