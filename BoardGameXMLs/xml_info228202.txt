							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Rumours to Hear in a Town or Village</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will often ask around in towns and villages trying to find out useful information. This lists 100 different rumours for them to hear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rumours are aimed at a fantasy setting and are most suited to towns and villages rather than cities, as the last tends to focus more on urban events, but some can still be used in such a setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rumours may or may not be true, at the GM's decision. They can simply be used as background flavour to make a setting seem more alive, to hide important information amongst the dross or perhaps as adventure hooks themselves, if they are fleshed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you see that weird bloke who was in the inn? Tattoos, piercings and sharpened teeth! I can&amp;rsquo;t see anyone who looks like that being up to something good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
