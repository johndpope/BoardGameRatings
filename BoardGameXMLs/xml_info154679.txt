			<description>Greetings, and welcome to the Slime Hunters Guild! It is our job to venture out into the wilds, track down those pesky creatures known as Slimes, and trap them in a manner that allows them to be brought back alive (alchemists, wizards, pet stores...surprisingly, there are many potential and wealthy buyers.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, there appears to be an outbreak of them, which makes a great business opportunity for us! Take these &amp;quot;magic boxes&amp;quot; with you (the dice), and throw them in order to activate their trapping mechanisms. Should they result in the right symbols (roll the correct result), then they shall be baited correctly in order to attract and trap whatever Slime inhabits the area. Can you bring back a higher valued Bounty than the other hunters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4    Dice for trapping Slimes&lt;br/&gt;     32  Slime Cards &lt;br/&gt;    2     Instruction Cards&lt;br/&gt;    2     Score Reference Cards&lt;br/&gt;    1     Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, 4 Slime Cards are drawn and placed in front of the active player. The active player must roll a certain number on the dice in order to trap one or more of them, depending on the colors drawn. If the player is unsatisfied with their dice roll, they may remove one of their dice in order to reroll all of the remaining dice and trap a higher number of slimes for the turn. Gameplay and turns continue this way until the Slime deck is completely gone through twice, then the players reference the Score Reference Card to figure up their scores and determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Slime is worth 1 point on its own, but additional points bonuses are awarded when certain criteria are met, such as collecting 1 of each color or the most of a specific color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
