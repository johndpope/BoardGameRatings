							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Admiral: Flashpoint Orange</name>
									
			<description>In the wake of the Great War, a new arms race loomed. The United States and Japan each trusted in a strong navy to achieve future security and retain political influence. Within three years of the Treaty of Versailles, no less than twenty-five new battleships and battlecruisers had been ordered by the two powers, exactly equal to the number already in commission at the end of the War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 was meant, among other things, to put an end to increased militarization in the Pacific; but by feeding into Japanese resentment and heightening American fears, it could achieve no more than to delay the inevitable conflict. Had things gone differently, it might not have even done that much...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emphasizing simple game mechanics and fast gameplay without sacrificing historical accuracy, each entry in the Grand Admiral line stands alone. However, the core game mechanics remain constant, allowing players to combine ships from different products to create new scenarios and explore any number of &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed as a hex-n-counter board game, Grand Admiral can be easily adapted to tabletop play using any scale of naval miniatures. So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes -- your destiny awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Admiral: Flashpoint Orange includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Grand Admiral rulebook&lt;br/&gt;     150 full-color counters* representing nearly all American and Japanese forces as of 1922&lt;br/&gt;     Data sheets listing 150 individually-named ships, representing over 50 different classes, from destroyers to super-dreadnoughts&lt;br/&gt;     17 by 22 game board &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Requires some assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
