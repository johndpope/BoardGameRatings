			<description>From the rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Golf the Year Round- Rain or Shine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Par-It is a game, played with cards, which is fully as intriguing as regulation outdoor golf.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have 12 sets of cards, representing golf clubs - each with different results on them - hook, slice, sand trap, 4 putt on the green, etc.  You draw a card from the appropriate stack based on the yardage remaining to the hole and keep track of your score on the score card.  Each card drawn represents 1 stroke, added to the number of putts on the green.  They suggest you can even use score cards from your favorite course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of the game has a random card affixed to the lid - so some might say No. 3 Iron Mid Mashie while another might say No. 8 Iron Niblic.  All the same game - Par It&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
