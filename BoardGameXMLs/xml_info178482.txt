Every player places one block of his colour. All of the blocks must be placed in the playing field before the first player begins moving or exchanging blocks.

A player's own blocks rnay be exchanged regardless of the numbering. A player's blocks rnay only be exchanged with those of an opponent when the numbers of both blocks are the sarne, i.e., 4 for 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pyramid:&lt;br/&gt;The placing together of 16 blocks of the same colour in an equal-sided triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strip:&lt;br/&gt;11 blocks of the same colour in a straight line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star group:&lt;br/&gt;Four stars of the same colour extending into one another and containing 16-18 blocks (depending on the form of the group) make up a star group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
