							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Al Emmo and The Lost Dutchman&#039;s Mine</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al Emmo is a stranger in a strange place.  Being middle aged and still single Al makes an incredible journey from New York to the Wild West in an attempt to make his parents proud and bring home a bride.  Arriving at the run down train station in the dead end town of Anozira, Al is disappointed to see that he's been rejected by his would-be mail-order bride.  Not wanting to disappoint his parents and seeing that there's no return train for a week, Al sets out on a mission to find a bona fide woman to call his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
