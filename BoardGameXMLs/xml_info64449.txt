							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">South American Travel and Trading Game</name>
									
			<description>This 1942 production from Parker Brothers features a map of South America with a pictorial display of different goods that can be acquired in various locations on the continent and then moved to other locations for profit.&lt;br/&gt;An interesting bit of trivia about this game is that according to &amp;quot;The Game Makers&amp;quot; by Philip Orbanes, South American Travel is unusual for being one of the few new Parker Brothers titles introduced during US involvement in WW2. George Parker had decided to concentrate on only the company's top sellers (and also to conserve materials). However South American Travel was released anyway because Mr. Parker believed Americans still had a hunger to travel and visit exotic places.&lt;br/&gt;The originally planned metal game pieces were however replaced with cardboard and wood, due to the war effort..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
