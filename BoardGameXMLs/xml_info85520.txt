			<description>A magazine devoted to the game of Advanced Squad Leader. Included were articles about tactics of the game as well as nine scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taming Tulagi features US Marines digging the Japanese out of their caves on Tulagi island in 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throwing Down the Gauntlet pits a Canadian paratroop company against dug in Germans on D-Day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point of the Sword depicts British advanced elements assaulting the Germans in a fortified town on D-Day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Desperate Affair has the lightly armed German paratroopers dropping directly on top of British forces on the island of Crete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going to Church has been reprinted twice since this magazine was released and has been played more than any other scenario in this product. SS troops have to hold a church against advancing Canadian infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shattering the Line shows the twilight years of the Third Reich as hopelessly outnumbered German infantry try to stop the Soviet advance outside of Berlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pinnacle is another cave busting scenario on the island of Ie Shima in 1945. US Army regulars with heavy armored support try to dislodge a well dug in Japanese battalion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castello Fatato has the surrounded Italians attacking a small Russian village during the Stalingrad campaign as the Italians attempt to reach friendly lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Wedge in the Ice depicts the Finnish defense of the Mannerheim Line late in the Winter War against a vastly superior Russian assault force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
