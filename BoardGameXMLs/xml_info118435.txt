			<description>Save the Turtles is a puzzle game for Nintendo DSiWare&amp;trade; where players must help baby sea turtles to hatch and then aid them in their struggle to get to the water, avoiding obstacles (such as predators and debris) and racing against the unforgiving tropical sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes players over 32 of the world&amp;rsquo;s most exotic beaches in a quest to help tiny turtles find their new home on the sea. Players must use the stylus to rub the Touch Screen on the Nintendo DSi&amp;trade; and dig eggs from the sand, then help the little reptiles crack out of them by tapping over the eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the turtles are born, they need to be lined up in thee or more while avoiding crabs, seagulls and litter, so that a sea wave can be summoned and take them safely to sea. The game features four game modes, including both a main campaign and &amp;ldquo;Turtles Forever&amp;rdquo; mode with endless replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
