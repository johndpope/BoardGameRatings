							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Socks!: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Socks! The Game is a 4-6 player card game where you learn the horrible truth about why socks go missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players are the goblins responsible for stealing all those socks that we find missing after a good happy laundry day. The goblins seek to bring these artifacts of power to their employer, in the hopes of ascending to become incredibly important. We are not sure that is what they would get, should they succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with players being handed out action cards, which empower them to collect socks, sabotage others or put them out of action. The objective is to get 5 un-paired socks in one's possession. Should pairs occur, the player is doomed to have to discard them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
