			<description>It's four in a row with a unique twist. You think you know how to play this game, but you've never seen it quite like this!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play four boards at the same time against the same opponent &lt;br/&gt;BUT &lt;br/&gt;You have to play in a different column on each board &lt;br/&gt;AND &lt;br/&gt;The first player to get a line on two boards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These simple, unique rule variations create a brand new challenge to play with friends. You can even customise your counters to put your own mark on the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By playing four boards at a time, there's always something to think about. Even if you are forced to block on one board, you can mount an attack somewhere else!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategy you once knew no longer applies. You can't play in the same column on more than one board, so think carefully about how to play all four boards together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the endgame doesn't go on for ever. The first to get two lines wins, so if one board is grinding to a stalemate, it becomes irrelevant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
