							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blaster Bots</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bored by their trek across the endless vacuum of space, a shipload of killer robots decide to have some fun. Coding themselves to utilize their most deadly weapons, all but one are destroyed in a matter of seconds. Can you survive the Phazo-Oscillating Beam Master or avoid the deadly rays of the Ionified Reflecto-Blaster and Residulating Impulsor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blaster Bots is a quick card game for 3-6 players. Firing Mechanisms, Weapon Effects and Target cards combine to make new, unexpected and sometimes downright mind-boggling weapons. Half the fun is saying the names of the weapons you'll create. The other half is figuring out what they do when they go off. As usual, everything you need to play comes crammed in one small box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
