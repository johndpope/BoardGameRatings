							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apogee</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The force of gravity is hers to command&amp;hellip; Apogee!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 12 Rogue, Apogee is a superhuman elitist who seeks to put meta-humans in charge of the future of humanity. Pitch is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apogee&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;ldquo;Gold&amp;quot; to indicate that her powers are the result of a powerful event that transformed her into a meta-human. With the ability to control the force of gravity itself, she is a potent and implacable threat. Her superiority complex has lead her to declare war on anyone she doesn&amp;rsquo;t identify as &amp;ldquo;evolved&amp;rdquo; enough to deserve her empathy. She has decided the only true future is one led by meta-humans, and in which &amp;ldquo;lesser beings&amp;rdquo; cannot threaten her people any longer. Any hero who seeks to protect normal people from super-beings will find her a compelling nemesis. Scientific-themed heroes will likely despise her tyrannical approach to seizing the future. Finally, heroes who are meta-humans will certainly be concerned that her actions risk turning the rest of the world against them and those like them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
