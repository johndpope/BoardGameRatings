			<description>From the Lock and Load website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steam and Steel is an easy to learn and play 2-player, steam-punk influenced, tactical-level game set in an alternate WWI, where we see that a breakthrough in steam engine technology has brought about a revolution in war. Influenced heavily by H.G. Well's The Land Ironclads, our Steam and Steel depicts armoured units and infantry in the field fighting the massive land battleships with the assistance of mechanized carriers and an array of support weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a IGOUGO move structure but with a reaction phase built-in that allows a half move or attack. Scenarios are based on specific objectives and opposing forces are 'bought' using a points system. The action take place either in wide open spaces - great for armoured clashes, or in more closed terrain that relies on ambush and utilization of cover. The infantry have a variety of support weapons available that enhance their firepower and the ability to use 'dummy' units to create a 'fog of war', The armoured vehicles are powerful but are not essential to victory - us usual the PBI are the game winners. The emphasis is on fun and playability rather than absolute accuracy and detailed mechanics. A true players game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;this game has been cancelled and will not be published&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
