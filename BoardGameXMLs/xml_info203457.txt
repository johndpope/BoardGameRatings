			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Terrors Stalk the Streets of the 18th Century Penal Colonies of Early Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night-time is always a dangerous time to be out on the streets of colonial Sydney and Parramatta. Drunken soldiers and absconding convicts haunt the townships in the hours after curfew. But recently another -- far stranger and more deadly -- force has taken to lurking in the shadows, occasionally striking with deadly result. Perhaps the most vulnerable of anyone are those poor souls from the New South Wales Corps and civilian militia who have the unenviable task of patrolling the streets after dark. Will the Night Patrols find and stop the killer that stalks the street? Or will the dark blight continue to spread?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tickets-of-Leave are small self-contained additions to the Convicts &amp; Cthulhu setting for Lovecraftian roleplaying in the early penal colonies of Australia. Each includes a selection of game elements which can either be used collectively as a thumbnail sketch of a mini-scenario, or can be used in isolation to provide pieces that enhance a scenario of your own invention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ticket of Leave #1 provides details about the Night Patrols that are charged with keeping order on the streets of Sydney and Parramatta. A scenario sketch shows how the Keeper might run an engaging and perilous scenario wherein the investigators are assigned to this unenviable duty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
