			<description>Players take turns playing their cards in an effort to be the first to run out of cards. In addition to wild cards, Zoom cards allow players to play out of turn if they have the correct card. Whoever wins one hand of play creates a new rule to affect all future games. In this way, later games can contain many complex rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
