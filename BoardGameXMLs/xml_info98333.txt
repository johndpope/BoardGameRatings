			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hockey and Tennis are two-player sports games built into the Channel F console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tennis is a traditional Pong style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players control two &amp;quot;tennis players&amp;quot; represented by small colored bars located at opposite sides of the screen. The object of the game is to use your tennis player, which may only be moved up or down, to deflect the ball so that it goes off your opponent's side of the screen, scoring a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Options available in Tennis include four different ball speeds and a timed game. However, Tennis always ends as soon as one player scores 15 points, even in timed mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hockey is an advanced variation on the Pong theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screen is surrounded by a border with goals (openings) at in the middle of the right and left ends. The borders of the play field serve to deflect the puck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player again controls a different small colored bar, in this case representing a hockey player. The hockey players may be moved in eight directions. In addition, the angle of the bar representing the hockey player may be rotated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to deflect the puck into the opponent's goal. In addition to controlling a hockey player, each player also controls a goalie. The goalie is a set of double lines that may be moved up and down in the goal to deflect the puck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique Channel F controller allows the player to simultaneously control all aspects of play - move the goalie, rotate the hockey player, and move the hockey player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Options available in Hockey include four speed settings (which affect the puck and the hockey players) and a timed game. An &amp;quot;overtime&amp;quot; period of one minute may be selected after time expires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
