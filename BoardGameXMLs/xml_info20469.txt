			<description>This low-complexity science fiction simulation game was distributed online in printable electronic format.  Players move their spacecraft around on a hex grid representing an unstable region of space.  Their objective is to collect a full cargo load of valuable &amp;quot;pseudo plasma&amp;quot; and return home.  This is complicated by two factors: everyone is armed with blasters, and the turbulent nebula causes random movement and damage to ships.  In addition to using counters to represent ships and potential hotspots on the mapboard, each player also has a status card where additional counters track ship system condition and repair status.  Optional rules are included for sensor probes, ship enhancement, team play and a few other add-ons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
