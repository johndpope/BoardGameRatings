							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Summon Night: Swordcraft Story 2</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the strange world of Lyndbaum, a sacred land linked to four magical dimensions. In Cliff, a village situated high atop a precipice, lay the ruins where the evil Summoned Creature Goura is confined. The ruins retain a terrible and hideous power, and as such, only a select few are allowed to enter the Chamber of Seals, let alone approach the ruin's entrance. One fateful day, a cheerful youth, having lost a little wager, guides a childhood friend to see the Seal of Goura. However, the true intentions of his friend emerge, and the wicked creature is released! To seal Goura one more time, a long lost sword is needed. The hunt for the Daemon Edge now begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
