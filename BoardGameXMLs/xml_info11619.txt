			<description>In this round up game players travel the range finding and branding cattle. after several have been branded one needs to round up his cattle and take them to the stock yard  however other players can attempt to rustle your steer. of course this is the real fun of the game as players pawns are spring loaded and can shoot small pellets at each other to discourage rustling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
