			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Triside is a paper model to be used in any 28-30mm wargame for inexpensive terrain. Easily builds in a couple of hours, lasts for years, build as many as you like.  Give your game table an intersesting lookout or check-point on the frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model comes with 9 pages of photo guided instructions; 18 pages of the main model; several pages of options; and more pages with alternate skins for the main model.  Choose wood textures for that rugged, outdoorsy look. You can also choose metal textures in four popular &amp;quot;faction&amp;quot; colors.  For ease, the model can also be built without the hillside and spikes for an even quicker build of a fort at ground level.  One PDF and you are able to build a fort on the cheap as many times and in any look as you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
