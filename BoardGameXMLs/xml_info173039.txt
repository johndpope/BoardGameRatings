			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This index provides a brief overview of the places, characters, and terminology found in Spellbook Games publications. It draws from all of our currently-published products, including those distributed for free, and from many products that are written but not yet published. The index is organized alphabetically and provides a brief description of each entry and the product in which it/they appears (will appear). A category-based reference is also provided as an additional user aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This index should be especially useful to Games Masters in matters of research and divination, as Characters seek additional knowledge about persons and places mentioned in-passing in the game. It may aid Games Masters in integrating Spellbook Games products into their personal campaign. The index provides many subjects about which rumors and references can be generated, snippets of information or gossip, or just the right obscure reference. The many powerful Diabolical characters listed in the index provide for enigmatic puppet-masters, off-camera and unseen, but whose wrath could produce interesting in-game consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
