							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: The Butcher&#039;s Guild â€“ The Scarlet Circle</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I remember once we celebrated to see the Master Butcher dethroned, and absent from the pitch. How wrong we were. What came next is even worse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Obulus, Mortician&amp;rsquo;s Guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inheritor of the Master Butcher&amp;rsquo;s throne, Fillet is one of the deadliest individuals throughout the Empire. A peerless duellist, she delights in playing with her opponents; dancing around them as she cuts bloody strips out of their exposed skin before bleeding them dry when she grows bored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like any Butcher team, Fillet&amp;rsquo;s side will punish their opponents mercilessly &amp;ndash; but more frightening still is the command they hold over the pitch. Defensive players dominate the opposition, dragging the enemy around ruthlessly before the more aggressive players utilize unexpected bursts of speed. This team will allow coaches to really take the fight to their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bloody dance of death, this set includes: a ball, 6 player cards, bases, and 6 players: Fillet, Truffles, Meathook, Veteran Brisket, Tenderiser, Veteran Ox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
