			<description>The Rotfather: Contrabando (contraband) is a game in The Rotfather Universe, where rats, cockroaches, frogs and spiders live in an underground society, resembling the 40's NY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative game with an infiltrated saboteur with strong presence of deduction. Players initially receive a random pack of cards that contains a character card and a set of four specific cards. One of them will be the Detective (saboteur) and the others will be Smugglers. In at most 6 rounds, players must then exchange their cards, in order to complete a set of five cards their character needs. They also can buy new ones from the central pile. The goal of the Smugglers is that some of them collects their 5 needed cards. The number of players that need to reach this goal varies by the number of participants. The objective of the Detective is to prevent this number of opponents from fulfilling their goals, for example by holding cards they need or by pushing foward unnecessary cards. In addition, the Detective may terminate the game earlier by stopping the match at any time when calling out and arresting  the player he believes to be the character Al Kane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
