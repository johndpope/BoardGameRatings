			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages you will find the specifics of playing in our campaign setting The Shattered Lands on the world of Khordesh. Players and referees using this document in their own campaign will need the D&amp;amp;D boxed set and the supplies needed to conduct that game, no other rule books or materials are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our intention is to assist the referee with creating a custom tailored campaign milieu for his own players and assumes a working familiarity with the basic rules of OD&amp;amp;D. Our working approach to house-rulings is &amp;ldquo;more rules do not make for a better game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Khordesh Campaign is a gritty, medium magic level world. There are no magic carpet mass transit systems, olde magic shoppes, or unicorn-drawn coaches. Magic is known and reasonably widespread, but not so commonplace your player-characters will take a +1 Magic Sword for granted. Gods are real but relatively uninvolved in the day-to-day lives of the people of Khordesh, preferring to leave their affairs in the hands of their devoted agents: clerics and anti-clerics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
