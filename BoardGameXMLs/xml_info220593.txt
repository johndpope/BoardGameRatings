							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rattus: Boccaccio promo</name>
									
			<description>This promo is not available yet, as confirmed by WhiteGoblins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;The player holding this card may, at the end of phase C, move one of his cubes to the palace area if at least one other player&amp;rsquo;s cube is killed by the Plague. The cube must be taken from a region adjacent to the region where the rat tokens are revealed (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether this region contains rat tokens or not).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game: The player may move the Plague Piece one step in the final counterclockwise round. If the Plague kills another player&amp;rsquo;s cube in this region he can save one of his own cubes from a neighboring region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card combinations: If a player also holds a card depending on plague piece (Chivalry characters or Serf), he must apply the effects of these cards in the same region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
