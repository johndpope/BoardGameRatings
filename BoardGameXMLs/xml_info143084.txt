			<description>In Replicant, players become powerful citizens of a dystopian metropolis. The city is embroiled in a murderous plot involving an oxygen shortage and a tower construction project. As the plot moves to various locations throughout the city, players work to unravel each others&amp;rsquo; secrets while concealing their own. No one is trying to do exactly the same thing. Any combination of players can win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over five to seven rounds, each in a different location indicated by a plot card. On your turn, you may attack, rescue, spy, or build. You aren&amp;rsquo;t alone, so the outcome of actions is determined by secret voting with agent tokens. Each round, you recruit new agents and gain influence. Influence can be used in many ways, including buying items, concealing traits, and bribing other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, replicants take damage for each complete oxygen tower, and humans take damage for each incomplete oxygen tower. You win the game the game by completing both of your agendas and surviving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
