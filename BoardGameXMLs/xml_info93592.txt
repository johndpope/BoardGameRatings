			<description>Abducted cows, giant bacterium pets, crop circle fields and pieces of contemporary intergalactic art are some of goods you can trade at the intergalactic fair known as Pandook! Play a cunning intergalactic merchant, outsmart the other competitors, and win ten years holiday on Earth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pandook!, players combine and discard their merchandise cards to raise the value of their own products and lower the value of other players' goods. Each player also holds action cards &amp;ndash; which they receive through bidding &amp;ndash; that they use to cancel other players' cards, change a card's effect, change the value of goods and more. A player can pass his turn, but then he must pass his Kriptonite stone &amp;ndash; worth something in its own right &amp;ndash; to another player. The winner is the player who earns the biggest money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
