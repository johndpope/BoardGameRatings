							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Age of Steam Expansion: Brazil / Chicago</name>
									
			<description>This expansion is a set of two Steam Brothers maps for Age of Steam. Each laminated color map contains a new Goods display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brazil&lt;br/&gt;This expansion will request players to keep goods they shipped during the game for a special bonus round at the end of the game.  This may give you a nice bonus or penalty depending on which goods you decided to ship.  There is also a new original rule where the track building costs vary depending on the turn you&amp;rsquo;re playing.   The new action Corruption should give you a break during some tough turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chicago&lt;br/&gt;This expansion will request players to deal with strikes in their railroad network.  They&amp;rsquo;ll have to decide if they want to end a strike peacefully or with the new action Repression.  If a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t end a strike, he&amp;rsquo;ll have to suffer tough consequences during the next turns.  The strikes will be tougher to settle as the game advance so players should make sure they have enough money to meet the demands of the unions.  If you use only a portion of the map, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play it with 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
