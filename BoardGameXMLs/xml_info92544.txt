			<description>From the back fo the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For seven long years, an uneasy truce has kept the Clan war machine from continuing its relentless march into the Inner Sphere - but young Clan Crusaders hungry for war now push for an end to the Truce of Tukayyid, and a renewal of the invasion. Building on the momentum of their victory over the Jade Falcons on Coventry, the Great House leaders create a Star League Constitution, resurrecting with a pen what they had failed to accomplish through the force of arms - a new Star League. With the might of all the Houses apparently united after hundreds of years of warfare, the members of this fragile union hatch a desperate plan to end the Clan threat once and for all - the complete destruction of a Clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Roars is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the brutal conflict between forces of the newly constituted Star League Defense Force - made up of a coalition army from every Great House - and the savage Smoke Jaguars. Detailed descriptions and maps follow each wave of this titanic struggle as the Inner Sphere sweeps into the Smoke Jaguar Occupation Zone. Twelve BattleTech scenarios and one BattleForce 2 scenario allows players to actively participate one of the largest conflicts in human history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario pack is effectively the first in a two-volume series, the concluding volume being BattleTech: Twilight of the Clans. The rules specific to this campaign are also useful for self-generated campaigns as they provide detail on such things as installing Clan Tech in Inner Sphere 'Mechs as field upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
