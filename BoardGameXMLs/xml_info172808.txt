			<description>Laugh Riot! is based on a comedy-improv exercise that professional comedians and actors have enjoyed since... like, forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;108 cards supply endless fodder for the funniest stories that you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard, and that you&amp;rsquo;ve ever told.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on a comedy improv exercise called &amp;ldquo;Yes and&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exercise is the foundation for good improv: Agree with what your partner has said, and then add something to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laugh Riot! takes the &amp;ldquo;Yes, and&amp;rdquo; exercise and combines it with a simple and competitive color and suit matching game. There are 5 different types of cards, that are played in different ways, allowing for chaining of multiple cards, forcing other players to draw cards, and skipping other players, making for a fun and friendly competition to win-while also cooperating to tell a funny story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each player&amp;rsquo;s turn, s/he plays one or more cards and uses whatever word is on the card in a sentence that continues the story, and starts with &amp;ldquo;Yes, and.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The humor tends to come naturally by just following the rules of the game. There is no pressure to be funny or creative, and really anyone can tell a funny story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
