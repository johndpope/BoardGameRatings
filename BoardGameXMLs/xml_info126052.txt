			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;You may have been told that knowledge is power, but how much of this do you actually believe? In our world, information is given away for almost nothing. Just spend a few hours on the Internet and see for yourself. But in the world of the Screaming Silence, knowledge is more than power, it&amp;rsquo;s more than gold or fame. In the world of the Screaming Silence, knowledge is only thing worth fighting for...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Screaming Silence are members of Mainstream Society, the Know-nots, who have learned of the existence of the Knows. They wish to take some of the knowledge that the Technocracy keeps for itself, and topple their oppressive Communist government. This is the world that the player characters have been born into, and its a world that rests upon their shoulders. Can the players dislodge the World Government&lt;br/&gt;before it collapses totally in on itself? And can they stop the Technocracy for taking control? Only the players of the Screaming Silence can decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
