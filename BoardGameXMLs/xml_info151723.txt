							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delving Deeper: Monk</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monastic humans who hone their bodies through rigid discipline and devotion to the Martial arts, monks are mystics who devote their lives to mastery of mind and body. Self-denial, poverty, meditation and unarmed combat are used as tools to achieve enlightenment. They journey into the world with the goal of personal growth and a spiritual understanding of human nature. They often join with adventurers, as these special people expose them to a wide range of experiences, and give them ample opportunity to grow, learn, and hone their abilities. Being an adventurer also allows a monk to help the needy and his order through the wealth he will have access to; few monastics will donate wealth as readily as an adventuring monk. The monk is a Martial arts expert and seeker of enlightenment who travels the world to learn more about himself and to perfect his self-discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you prepared to walk the path of the mystic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
