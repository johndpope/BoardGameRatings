			<description>'Thick as Thieves' is a cooperative board game  based on the idea that all players are working together to steal an item from a well guarded museum.  You&amp;rsquo;ll have to work together to infiltrate the system, sneak past guards, and get past the alarms and locked doors.  Be careful though, there isn't always honor amongst thieves.  At any time, if the opportunity presents itself, a player may choose to betray everyone and steal a secondary item they've been eye-balling since before the heist even started!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a thief with different abilities moving silently (hopefully) around the museum at night dodging roaming guards and security cameras.  When they reach a designated location, they attempt a challenge based on an attribute that each character has a varying amount of (Brawn, Brains, Sneak, Charm).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once they succeed in their challenge, players get to choose a card that allows them to trigger a change in the board's circumstances.  They can turn off security cameras, move guards, turn off the lights, unlock doors or turn off alarms. If everything goes smoothly, your team will work like clockwork to steal the one item you're all here for.  If all goes smoothly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only do the players have to work precisely, but they have to work quickly before the next guard shift comes in.  As the game progresses, a deck of cards is pulled changing the position of the guards and moving the clock ever so dangerously close to the end of the game.  Get your item out of the museum before the deck runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
