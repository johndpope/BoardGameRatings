			<description>Players start with their 4 pawns at the 4 corners of the board. They roll the dice and decide to advance with one of their pawns. At the beginning, each player is provided with 10 traffic signs. At the end of any move, a player is entitled to place one of his traffic signs near a space. According to the traffic sign, a pawn can be blocked, forced to move slower or take another route. A player who disobeys a sign must answer a question from the rule book about traffic rules. When all 4 pawns of a player arrive in the central parking lot, that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;board, 120 traffic signs, 2 dice, 16 pawns, catalogue of questions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;produced (but not published) by ASS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
