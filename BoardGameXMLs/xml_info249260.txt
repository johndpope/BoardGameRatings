			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hey wait!!  This is not some boring set of tables about randomly generated caravans!  This is about how world trade creates adventures in fantasy settings.  Adventure!  Conflict!  Bad guys!  You saw the &amp;ldquo;WAR&amp;rdquo; in the title, right?  Well when this much money is up for grabs, people are willing to murder each other, sometimes in large numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you running urban adventures yet?  If you are, here is a great way to turn an urban setting to an open free for all.  If you&amp;rsquo;re not, then here is how you can get it done!  While all of our Small Bites are idea generating machines, this one does more to spell out exactly how to do it.  We are even giving you an example with just enough setting, calendar and enemies to make it a breeze for you to shift it into your game world.  This really is the spot where game masters and world builders can get their juices flowing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Player and Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 17 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 52 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
