			<description>i.hate.everyone is a tasteless party card game, allegedly about social media attention whoring, but mostly about trying to make your friends laugh by coming up with the most hilariously atrocious phrase to fit the current question or fill-in-the-blank. Guaranteed* to provide hours of fun!**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Not an actual guarantee.&lt;br/&gt;        And/or shame.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round one player is the OP. The OP draws 3 Status Cards (which have questions or fill in the blanks) and picks one. Everyone then picks a Comment Card from their hand, and the players take turns reading their cards out. Cards can also have special effects ranging from drawing more cards to having to read it out in a funny accent. Once everyone's read, each player picks up a Like token and hands it to another player. Whenever you stop playing, whoever has the most Likes is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
