							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartoon War</name>
									
			<description>Very odd and obscure little game in which players battle each other using cartoons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player maintains a hand of 7 cards - the cards contain the names of items found in typical - and not so typical - cartoons, like anvils, flying pianos, whales on roller skates, etc. You combine these cards into &amp;quot;attacks&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;defenses&amp;quot; which you then have to draw on a large sheet of paper, which becomes a gigantic, cartoon battleground. The &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; - as much as there is an object other than creating silly drawings and having a lot of laughs - is to combine all 7 cards in your hand into one massive attack or defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game works best with beer, but it almost always a hoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
