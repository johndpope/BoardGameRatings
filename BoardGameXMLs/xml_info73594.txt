			<description>&amp;quot;FIFA 08 (named FIFA Soccer 08 in North America) is the 2008 installment of EA Sports' series of football video games. Developed by EA Canada, it is published by Electronic Arts worldwide under the EA Sports label. It was released on all popular gaming formats in September 2007 in Europe, Australia, and Asia, and in October 2007 in North America. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game feature an improved game engine with superior graphics and different commentators and are dubbed &amp;quot;next-generation&amp;quot; by EA. On all other platforms - including the PC - the game utilizes an older engine. The Nintendo DS version features fewer teams, stadiums, game modes and kits due to the limitations of the machine's storage medium. Commentary comes from Sky Sports' Martin Tyler and Andy Gray on next generation consoles; however, ITV Sports' Clive Tyldesley partners Gray on current generation consoles, and the PC version of the game. On the DS  version of the game, Tyldesley is by himself. It also marks the first time the original Xbox  has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA Football 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tagline for the game is &amp;quot;Can You FIFA 08?.&amp;quot; The theme song is &amp;quot;Sketches (20 Something Life)&amp;quot; by La Rocca, from the album The Truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New features that were not in FIFA 07  include &amp;quot;Be a Pro Mode&amp;quot;, where the player plays as only one player (the player can be changed) throughout the entire match.[3]  However, this mode is not available for goalkeepers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New features for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 include cooperative online play and a change of controls which features the right stick as a way of selecting which player to be on defense. However, this control setting can be changed back to the FIFA 07 configuration as well as other preset control configurations. In addition, the online mode has a new addition with interactive leagues, where players choose a league, a team, and play against real-life opponents. While not an entirely new feature, FIFA 08 includes new trick moves which can be used by using the right analog stick which were for the most part, absent in FIFA 07. In general, the speed of game also has decreased in FIFA 08.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;FIFA_08,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
