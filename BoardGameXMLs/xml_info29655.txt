							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grave Digger</name>
									
			<description>Description from designer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a vampire hiding in the cemetery, and the town council has offered a large reward to the first grave digger who can find the creature and destroy it. The tools you'll need are scattered around the cemetery grounds, but the vampire has summoned several phantoms to break those tools before you can use them.  You also might dig up the wrong grave and miss your chance to destroy the vampire.  But such is the life of a grave digger...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object Of The Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to destroy the vampire by digging up the right grave. You must have three tools (a pick, a shovel and a stake) to dig up and kill the vampire. The phantoms will try to break your tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
