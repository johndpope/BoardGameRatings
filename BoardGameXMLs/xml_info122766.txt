			<description>Wave Rally, also known as Jet Ski Riders, is a 2001 Jet Ski racing game published exclusively for the PlayStation 2.  It was also to be released on the Xbox but was canceled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game provides players with both a Jet Ski and runabout on which to race. Five modes of play are offered: Arcade, Championship, Time Trial, Multiplayer, and Freestyle. The Championship mode awards points based upon the player's final position in each race. The objective is to be the rider with the most points at the end of the season. The Arcade mode forces the player to reach checkpoints within a given time limit in order to continue with the race. The freestyle arena is requires the player to perform various tricks with the aid of waves and ramps scattered around the open area. Tricks are performed using button and directional pad combinations and are judged according to composition, appeal and technical merit, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic waves which vary in frequency and height can help or hinder the progress during the race. Races take place during different times of the day and in variable weather conditions. A cast of eight selectable characters, consisting of female and male riders, makes up the field for each race. Races take place in a variety of real world locations, such as the Maldives, New Zealand, Florida, and Venice. The official Kawasaki and Jet Pilot licenses allow for official watercraft and wetsuits. A two-player split-screen mode is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wave Rally&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
