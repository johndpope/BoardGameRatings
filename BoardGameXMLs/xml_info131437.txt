							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marchland</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb: &lt;br/&gt;On the surface, Marchland looks like the Earth we know - the same cities, borders, and natural features. Like the geography, the people of Marchland are much like those you see every time you leave the house. There is crime, despair and poverty. There is courage, hope, and opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Marchland is normal, even mundane - but look closer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another side to Marchland that most people never see - a darker, more dangerous, and more wondrous side.  A side that the average citizen could never imagine must less experience.  Most mortals remain cloaked in ignorance, separated by a Veil that protects their fragile world-view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are different. You have seen through the Veil, and it is in this shadow world that you dwell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you? You may be an extraordinary mortal who has seen what others choose not to. The blood of the Fae may run through your veins - a gift from some otherworldly ancestor. You may be an urban Witch, casting protective spells from your downtown loft. You may be many things, but there is one thing you are not - average.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being extraordinary sets you apart. You don&amp;rsquo;t stand in the same dim light as your un-awakened friends and coworkers. You've lost your innocence, and the true nature of the world is clear. Whether by birth or by choice, you stand in the middle ground - between natural and supernatural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You stand in the Marchland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
