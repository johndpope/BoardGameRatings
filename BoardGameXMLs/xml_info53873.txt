							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Player&#039;s Secrets of Tuarhievel</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;Before the humans descended on Cerilia, the continent was virtually untouched, inhabited only by those who understood how to live in harmony with nature. Since the human incursion, however, the natives have been forced to realign themselves with their homelands and their neighbors. No group has felt the effects of these maneuverings as much as the elves, who now engage in a daily struggle to keep a hold on their lands, fight off human interests, and preserve their heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tuarhievel, matters have recently gotten worse. Prince Fhileraene has disappeared after being coerced into answering a summons from the Gorgon--but before he went away he transferred his bloodline to his consort, a human female named Savane Mhoried. Many of the elves of Tuarhievel consider this act to have been a betrayal of their heritage, even though the interim regent has promised to pass the bloodline to her yet unborn child as soon as that child comes of age. But in the meantime, the elven nation is in upheaval. The land needs a strong leader to prevent traditional values from clashing with the needs of the nation, lest it be torn apart. Can your character walk the fine line between tradition and necessity to unify Tuarhievel?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BIRTHRIGHT domain sourcebook is designed for players who wish to take part in the rulership of Tuarhievel, either as regent of as the leader of one of the domain's noble families. This information is invaluable to anyone who might wish to approach Tuarhievel as a political ally or embark on adventures in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
