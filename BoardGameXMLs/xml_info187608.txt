			<description>The oldest player begins by taking the top card from the pile and reading the question to the player at his left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the card the mouse, the duck and the elephant each offer a possible answer. Read these three possible answers and always say by whom the answer comes: From the Mouse, the elephant or the duck. You can check the right answer in the back of the card. There, the mouse, the duck or the elephant are displayed with a detailed response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as there are no more cards. The player who has the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
