			<description>Juggernauts is a customizable, non-collectible dueling game for two players, each with his or her own customized deck.  Your deck represents your Juggernaut.  Your opponent also has a Juggernaut. Your goal is to incapacitate your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Juggernaut so your ground forces can infiltrate and overwhelm it before he or she can do the same to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts, you need to download and print out Juggernauts cards and build your deck.  Cards fall into general categories of power generators, attacks, defenses, and miscellaneous effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of a game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pick a standard polyhedral die to be your Juggernaut's Commander.&lt;br/&gt;     Draw cards equal to the number of sides on your Commander, plus three.&lt;br/&gt;     Lay out all but three of the cards in your hand face-down so that each card:&lt;br/&gt;         occupies one square in an imaginary grid, and&lt;br/&gt;         is adjacent to at least one card.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This matrix of cards is your Juggernaut.  Face-down cards are inactive nodes and face-up cards are active nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play during a game is simultaneous; you and your opponent go through the same phases in a turn at the same time.  You  start your turn by gaining 1 power (plus any additional from active cards in your Juggernaut).  You use power to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Activate cards that require Power,&lt;br/&gt;     Increase the effectiveness of an attack or defense,&lt;br/&gt;     Maintain cards you want to keep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you gain power, you roll your Commander to see which card in your Juggernaut's matrix activates.  If you do not have an active card by the end of your command phase (this can happen if your Commander tries to activate a damaged sector, a neutralized card, or a card token), put an alert token on your deck. This means that your enemy&amp;rsquo;s ground forces are approaching. Remove all alert tokens when you activate a damaged sector. If you have three or more alert tokens on your deck at the end of a round, enemy troops have infiltrated your juggernaut and taken control. You lose and your opponent wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, you and your opponent reveal your active cards and resolve them.  Once cards resolve, you discard them, draw cards to replace them, then play cards from your hand to fill in the ones that you discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics are such that large Juggernauts with many-sided Commanders (d 12, d 20) have lots of &amp;quot;hit points&amp;quot;, but are easy to hit with attacks, difficult to get reliable results from, and vulnerable to accumulating alert tokens.  Small Juggernauts with few-sided Commanders (d4, d6) are difficult to hit and produce very predictable results, but have very few &amp;quot;hit points&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juggernauts is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License.
