			<description>Explore the galaxy...in 20 minutes or less!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 22nd century, colony ships were programmed to search for earthlike planets along trajectories calculated to visit stars with the best likelihood of habitable worlds. One such ship with its crew and passengers in cryostasis traveled over 2300 light years before a suitable planet was found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope is a temperate world located in the Glory system on the edge of a vast nebula often referred to as the Purple Void. The nebula is unique in that it contains many unusual star types and other peculiar phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 100 years have passed since the colonists first arrived. It is a new beginning of deep space exploration. Technology has improved and mankind is no longer dependent on slow cryoships and robot probes. This is the setting of Strange Adventures In Infinite Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sail the high sea of stars in your own deep space exploration vessel. Discover exotic star systems; seek out new technologies, artifacts and lifeforms; boldly blow up stuff where no one has blown up stuff before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAIS is different every time it is played. Stars, planets, black holes, nebula mass, alien patrols, items, lifeforms and other encounters are randomized for each new Strange Adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Playing time: 5-20 minutes&lt;br/&gt;     Number of players: solo&lt;br/&gt;     Difficulty: variable&lt;br/&gt;     Replayability: infinite &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full version of SAIS features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     21 different ship types&lt;br/&gt;     69 different weapons, drives, shields, gadgets and artifacts&lt;br/&gt;     18 alien lifeforms&lt;br/&gt;     17 different planet and star types&lt;br/&gt;     7 unique alien races&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
