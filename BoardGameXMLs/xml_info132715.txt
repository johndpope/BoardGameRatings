			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skyrealms of Jorune is an established role playing game with a loyal following in Australia, North America and Europe. The world contains one of the richest, detailed worlds in any fantasy settings. Thanks to the Internet, more people have been able to discuss the game in greater detail than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of PLUS Jorune is to make the world available to more people through the miracles of net publishing. PLUS Jorune is not a product of, nor does it represent, official development of the game, the system or the world of Jorune. Skyrealms of Jorune is a trademark of Skyrealms, Inc., and this version of the game is not intended as any challenge to the copyright, ownership or trademarks to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Skyrealms of Jorune the Sholari will need to have at least one copy of the Skyrealms of Jorune (3rd Edition), published by Chessex. A copy of The Sholari Pack is highly recommended, also available from Chessex. Other Skyrealms of Jorune supplements that may prove useful include The Sobayid Atlas and The Gire of Sillipus. Recommended 2nd Edition materials included the main rules boxed set, which includes the Sholari Guide, Tauther Guide, and Player Guide; the Companion Jorune: Ardoth, Companion Jorune: Burdoth, Earth-Tec Jorune, Shanthas Of Jorune and Playing The Iscin Races supplements for the 2nd Edition of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
