							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Farmyard Cries</name>
									
			<description>A card game with 44 animal cards divided into 7 sets. Each set has a &amp;quot;Mother&amp;quot; card, 1 or more &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; cards, 1 or more &amp;quot;Where Found&amp;quot; cards, and 1 or more &amp;quot;breed&amp;quot; cards. The cards of each set have the same number on them. This number is the points you earn by collecting that particular set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of each round is to collect 1 &amp;quot;Mother&amp;quot;, 1 &amp;quot;young&amp;quot;, 1 &amp;quot;breed&amp;quot;, and 1 &amp;quot;Where Found&amp;quot; card from any given set. The first player to do this wins any given round and receives the points shown on that set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fun part for little children comes in when a player has managed to collect a &amp;quot;Mother&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;breed&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;where found&amp;quot; card for one set. At this point that player &amp;quot;cries&amp;quot; for the young by making the sound of that animal. The idea here is that the mother of the set is calling out for her young. When this happens, any player in possession of &amp;quot;young&amp;quot; cards of that specific animal type must give them to the crying player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to 60 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
