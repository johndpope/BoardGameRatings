			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;M&amp;amp;M Superlink product covering roles and options within a superteam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;A team should work together. The statement might seem absurdly obvious, but it is the single most important lesson a group of superheroes (or supervillains, for that matter) can learn. Many so-called &amp;quot;teams&amp;quot; spend years trying to get a grasp on this elusive principle. Others don&amp;rsquo;t last that long and are broken by internal strife, humiliation, defeat, or some combination of the three. Those who do achieve a measure of appreciation for the idea, however, have another difficult task before them: that of actually putting it into practice. Once the members of a team understand that they have to be more than just a group of individuals on the same side, they must learn teamwork. They must maximize their individual strengths, and use them to compensate for the weaknesses of the entire team. They must become a whole more potent than the sum of its parts. In doing so, they can become unstoppable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
