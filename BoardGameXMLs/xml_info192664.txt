			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return to the Forgotten Graveyard and discover what lurks within the depths of Blackstone Tomb!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolf goblins have been seen coming and going from the Forgotten Graveyard in growing numbers. Tracks of massive wolves have been found in the area. And the savagely-mauled remains of local residents and animals alike have been found in fields and pens. Were they the victims of goblin attacks or has an unknown beast been released from the hidden depths of Blackstone Tomb?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures The Beast of Blackstone Tomb is a new Adventure Module set within The Forgotten Graveyard, which is located along the western edge of Greyshroud Ridge. You can play the adventure independently or combine the adventure with The Forgotten Graveyard, Expedition to Erathor and the expansion pack, Greyshroud Ridge, to create an overland journey, above ground encounters and a campaign.

In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Module is a new, simple way to play fantasy adventures. The organization and presentation of the adventures allows for quick setup, quick play and gives you the ability to focus on the action and &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; while leaving you the option to include tactical action and combat if you desire. Enter a new and exciting world of adventure, full of wonder and surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
