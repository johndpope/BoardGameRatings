			<description>The Crossroads is a classic play of Chinese operas. Ren Tanghui was ordered to protect the banished general Jiao Zan in secret. He stayed overnight at Liu Lihua&amp;rsquo;s inn. Late at night, they confronted each other in a sudden darkness and dangerous hand-to-hand combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crossroads is a brief paper-and-pencil game for two players. In a room of 3x3 grids, players take actions concurrently each round and record them on sheets, then make an announcement required to settle their acts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic acts include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move: Move to an adjacent grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research: Get the last entry and left directions and round numbers in your position in 8 rounds from the opponent. You have to take a Move act next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack: Attack the opponent in your position, if he ends round here and doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an attack action, you win. You have to take a Move act next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pursuit: Move and attack the opponent. You have to stay in the new grid without any actions next round.(3 uses only for each player)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each Move round a player may also take a Challenge, declare his current position and earn points. In a series of consecutive challenges, it&amp;rsquo;s 1 point for the first challenge, 2 points for the second, 4 points for the third, 8 points for the fourth and later ones. After 20 rounds without a successful attack, the player has the most points win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
