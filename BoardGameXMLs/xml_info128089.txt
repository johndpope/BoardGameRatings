							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oink&#039;s Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Contents: 36 cards in 6 sets of six.&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game: To collect six identical cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sort out one set of 6 identical characters per player. Place other cards out of the game. Shuffle and deal six cards face down to each player. The game consists of exchanging cards as quickly as possible. Each player looks at his cards, decides which one he wishes to exchange and places it face down in front of the player to his left. Each player then picks up the card placed in front of him and adds it to his hand before deciding which card to exchange next. To keep play running smoothly, the players should simultaneously say &amp;ldquo;Pass&amp;rdquo; and &amp;quot;Pick Up&amp;quot;. The first player to get six identical cards and shout &amp;quot;OINK&amp;quot; is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
