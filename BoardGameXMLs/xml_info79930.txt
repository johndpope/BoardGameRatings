			<description>Garou: Mark of the Wolves , known as Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves on Dreamcast, is a 1999 fighting game produced by SNK, originally for the Neo Geo system. It is the ninth and final game in the Fatal Fury series, set ten years after the death of Geese Howard in Real Bout Fatal Fury. It is known for pushing the graphical capabilities of the Neo Geo as well as its well-balanced roster of characters and highly technical gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-plane system in which characters would fight from two different planes was removed from the game. The game introduces the &amp;quot;Tactical Offense Position&amp;quot; (T.O.P.) which is a special area on the life gauge. When the gauge reaches this area, the character enters the T.O.P. mode, granting the player character the ability to use T.O.P. attack, gradual life recovery, and increased attack damage. Similar to previous titles, players are given a fighting rank after every round. If the players manages to win all rounds from the arcade mode with at least a rank of &amp;quot;AAA&amp;quot;, the player will face the boss Kain R. Heinlein, which unlocks an ending once defeating him. If the requirements are not met, then Grant will be the final boss and there will not be a special ending. Additionally, through arcade mode, before facing Grant, the player will face a mid-boss which can be any character from the cast depending on the character the player uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Garou: Mark of the Wolves , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
