			<description>Pocket Whoozit? - History &amp;amp; Politics is a trivia game in which players answer questions about individuals pictured on cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 pictures on each card and the player must answer two questions about one of the individuals pictured. Two correct answers give control of the card to the player. One correct answer gives control of the card to the player, but it can be stolen by another player who answers both questions on that player's card and identifies the photo. Once the deck is exhausted scoring is done by giving two points for each two-answered question card controlled by a player and one point for each one-answered question card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
