							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squad Leader Scenarios 81-90</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the Booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Squad Leader, Avalon Hill's game of tactical combat in the second world war, together with its companion games Cross of Iron, Crescendo of Doom and GI, Anvil of Victory, is one of the most popular wargames of all time. Now, World Wide Wargamers, in association with Avalon Hill, offer 10 more scenarios for the Squad Leader series. These varied and exciting scenarios include commando raids, bitter rearguard actions, combat in the snowy wastes of the north, river assaults and much more. Designed by Andy Bagley, Simon Haines, and Courtney Allen, doyen of SL scenario designers, these scenarios have been specially created to capture the fullest excitement of Squad Leader, Cross of Iron, Crescendo of Doom and GI, Anvil of Victory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following scenarios are included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;81: A BRIDGE TOO NEAR; April 21st, 1940; Verdal, Central Norway&lt;br/&gt;82: TO LOSE A BATTLE; May 16th, 1940; Clairfayts, France&lt;br/&gt;83: THE FINAL ATTEMPT; May 22nd, 1940; Cambrai, France&lt;br/&gt;84: LE PARADIS; May 26th, 1940; Le Paradis, France&lt;br/&gt;85: THE FAR BANK; July 7th, Ulla, Russia&lt;br/&gt;86: RAID ON VAAGSO; December 27th, 1941; South Vaagso, Norway&lt;br/&gt;87: THE BRUNEVAL RAID; February 28, 1942; Channel Coast&lt;br/&gt;88: THE BACKWATER OF WAR; May 6th, 1942; Near Kestenga, Northern Russia&lt;br/&gt;89: CHERKASSKOYE; July 5th, 1943; Cherkasskoye, Russia&lt;br/&gt;90: THE BRIDGE AT KANEV; September 23rd, 1943; Kanev, Russia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection of scenarios had a lower standard of production than the original in-box sets. &lt;br/&gt;The actual games tried to set some more novel scenarios. The Raid on Bruneval being particualrly good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
