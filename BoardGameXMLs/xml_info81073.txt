			<description>Welcome to the world of Crimson Skies! &lt;br/&gt;Enjoy an all-new experience in flight combat! Crimson Skies puts you in the cockpit for thrilling dogfights and aerial adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this alternate history, the year is 1937 and the United States is fractured into squabbling nation-states, brought about by the weight of the Great Depression, regional prohibition and mounting isolationism. Giant Zeppelins crisscross the skies carrying both passengers and cargo, and airborne bandits are a constant threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crimson Skies is an arcade flight computer game developed by Zipper Interactive and published in 2000 by Microsoft Game Studios. Although a flight-based game, Crimson Skies is not a genuine flight simulator, as the game is based less on flight mechanics than on action. According to series creator Jordan Weisman, Crimson Skies is &amp;quot;not about simulating reality - it's about fulfilling fantasies.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in an alternate history of the 1930s in which the United States has balkanized into a number of smaller sovereignties, and in which air travel has become the primary mode of transportation in North America. The game centers around Nathan Zachary, an adventurous air pirate seeking to rob the affluent of their wealth and power. Throughout the campaign, Zachary leads his gang of air pirates, the Fortune Hunters, on a quest to gain fame and fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crimson Skies is often regarded as a &amp;quot;cult success,&amp;quot; commercially successful only to a limited extent. The game has received generally favorable reviews; it has been noted for its high-quality voice acting, gameplay, and atmosphere.  Notable technical issues, however, have been known to plague the game, the most notorious of which was the tendency to delete saved game files until a patch was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crimson Skies (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
