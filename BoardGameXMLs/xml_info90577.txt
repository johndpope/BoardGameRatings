							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Admiral: Castles of Steel</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the pivotal years of 1915 and 1916, the future of the world hung in the balance as the Royal Navy time and again failed to deliver on promises of tactical success amid the cold, grey waters of the North Sea. But the strategic situation was much different, as each passing month of the Allied blockade brought the Central Powers closer to defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did the Kaiser's reluctance to commit his beloved High Seas Fleet doom the German people? Was Admiral Beatty the second coming of Nelson himself, or a charismatic, risk-taking glory hound? Might someone other than Jellicoe at Jutland have brought the decisive victory for which the British were so desperate; or, as Churchill feared, might he have lost the War in a single afternoon?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions and more are yours to answer as you sail into battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Admiral: Castles of Steel includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Grand Admiral rulebook&lt;br/&gt;     250 full-color counters* representing forces of the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine&lt;br/&gt;     Data sheets listing hundreds of individually-named vessels, representing 70 different classes, including every major warship present at the Battles of Jutland, Dogger Bank, Coronel, and the Falkland Islands&lt;br/&gt;     17&amp;quot; by 22&amp;quot; game board &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Requires some assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
