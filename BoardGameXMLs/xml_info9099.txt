			<description>Starting player steps out. The rest agree on a Who, e.g. Uncle Sam.  Player comes back and draws cards from the deck which includes questions like &amp;quot;If this person was a type of car, what would he/she be? If this person was a holiday destination, what would he/she be&amp;quot;.  The player may choose whoever they wish to answer.  After all the questions have been asked (e.g. 10 questions), the player must guess the Who.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
