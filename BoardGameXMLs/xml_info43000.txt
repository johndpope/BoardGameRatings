			<description>2 to 4 hunters are trying to reach a rabbit. While the rabbit player can do zig-zag-moves, the hunters can only move in straight lines, changing directions only when they reach the edge of the board. There are some carrot fields; if the rabbit ends a move there, he or she receives a carrot card. When a hunter reaches the rabbit, he or she gets a rabbit card and the next player gets to play the rabbit. The game ends when the first player has collected three rabbit cards. For ten carrot cards, one rabbit card can be discarded (by another player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
