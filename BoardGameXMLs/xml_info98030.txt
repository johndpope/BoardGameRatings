			<description>The world is changing...A massive paradigm shift is taking place with the introduction of new technologies. Historians are already calling this the &amp;quot;New Industrial Revolution,&amp;quot; and the very fabric of society is being reshaped to take advantage of how the world now conducts itself. Bipedal machines known as Trotmobiles have been put to use in a variety of industries: agriculture, construction, cargo transportation... People assumed that these new vehicles would lead to better lives, and to a world where everyone would be rich and happy. However, Trotmobiles are simply tools, and like any tool,  that can be put to a variety of uses; for good or for ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orion City is known as the city built upon a love of Trotmobiles. It's home to the &amp;quot;Trotmobile Battle Tournament,&amp;quot;  which determines the strongest Trotmobile driver in the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main character is a novice Trotmobile rider who comes to Orion City to fight in the tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
