			<description>Silent Hunter 4: The U-Boat Missions is a computer submarine simulation add on expansion pack for Silent Hunter 4: Wolves of the Pacific developed by Ubisoft Romania and published by Ubisoft in 2008. It places the player in command of a German submarine during World War II and takes place in the Pacific theater mainly in the Indian Ocean. The game allows players a variety of play modes including career, single war patrol, including assisted battles/engagements and single battle engagements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the arrival of the German campaign in U-Boat Missions, players gain control over additional strategic resources other than their own submarines. These resources can be used towards the goal of sinking enemy shipping by either helping the player locate enemies - i.e. the scout planes - or by directly attacking them. These strategic support features are available only for the new German campaign in U-Boat Missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New units which were not available in Silent Hunter IV include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Recon plane (from land bases)&lt;br/&gt;    * German auxiliary cruiser&lt;br/&gt;    * German heavy cruiser&lt;br/&gt;    * Japanese carrier group&lt;br/&gt;    * Japanese cruiser group&lt;br/&gt;    * Japanese taskforce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unlocking of these auxiliary units are based on the player&amp;rsquo;s rank, and the rank is achieved based on the number of successful patrols and renown that has been gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Silent Hunter III, which featured authentic German speaking officers and crew to heighten the atmosphere of the game, U-Boat Missions retains the English speaking crew from the main Wolves of the Pacific game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Silent Hunter IV: The U-Boat Missions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
