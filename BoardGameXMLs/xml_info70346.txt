							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ESPN NHL 2K5</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;ESPN NHL 2K5 is an ice hockey simulation made by ESPN Videogames (now 2K Games) and published on the Xbox and PlayStation 2 consoles. ESPN's Gary Thorne on play-by-play commentary and Bill Clement on color commentary calls all the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes an extensive franchise mode where you can perform many team management functions, including hiring staff, managing player contracts, scouting new players and sending players back to minor teams for training. It also includes more traditional game modes like season, playoffs, exhibition and shootout. The game manual is also built into the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2004's edition of the game also introduces an advanced control setting which allows much more flexible control of your player, using the entire control pad rather than only a few buttons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cover of ESPN NHL 2K5, features Tampa Bay Lightning's Martin St. Louis.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ESPN_NHL_2K5,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
