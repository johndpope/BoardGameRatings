			<description>Mad Goblin Racing is a dice game created for the PnP Contest in May/June 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Goblinking has a huge junkyard behind his fortress.&lt;br/&gt;Each year he lets his best engineers search the junkyard, construct vehicles out of them, and race them in the biggest social event in the country - the Kings Race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all too bright but very sneaky the goblins build the vehicles scrambling through the junk looking for wheels, engines, and weapons and adding them together in an conglomerative effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the first to finish a vehicle gets the advantage of tuning it before the race... and winning that will make him famous forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
