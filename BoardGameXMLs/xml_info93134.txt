			<description>Quick dice rolling game, using cartoon characters from the popular German artist Uli Stein. Each player represents one of the five cartoon animals.&lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls six dice, then puts aside three, two or one die. This is repeated twice with the remaining dice. Each of his three rolls he must put aside a different number of dice. After the three rolls, the player representing the animal that is shown most on the six dice can check the other animals that were rolled on his/her scoring sheet. Whenever there are two policemen showing on the dice, however, nobody scores at all. When someone has checked an animal five times, s/he receives a victory point. The first player to collect two victory points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
