			<description>Childrens card game. There are eight full sets of different Teddy cards. A set consists of five cards, a full-size Teddy and four other cards, each a quarter of the related Teddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal 7 cards to each player. The first player must play a full size Teddy card if he has one. If he doesn't, he draws a card. Once a full size Teddy card is on the table, the next player can play either another full size Teddy card or can add a quarter card to any matching Teddy currently on the table. You must play a card if you can but you may only ever play one card per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a set is finished, the player playing the last quarter card on it, scores 1 point. The first player to use all their cards scores 5 points. The winner is the first player to score 11 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
