			<description>You take on a role of a &amp;quot;Mun&amp;iacute;k&amp;quot; (there is no direct translation of the word, assume something like a Mole) and strive to dig out passages underground, finding treasures and resources, with which you can later buy pieces of a very large and Super-Heavy Digging Machine, with which you can outpower all other opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is prepared out of many face-down tiles, which may or may not contain something worth taking. Then the players move in their turns, according to the Attributes of their Moles and the equipment they possess in search for more resources. They can store them in their Storage space and also sell them for gold and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately they want to buy and build the parts of the Digging Machine and the first one that succeeds, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
