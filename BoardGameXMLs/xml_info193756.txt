			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you wield the power of the Etherium Forge to summon ancient Artifacts and Spells to defeat your enemies? Or will you fall, like many before you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherworld: Etherium Forge is a card-and-dice battle game for 2-4 players that lasts around 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a wide variety of possible strategies, but it&amp;rsquo;s always good to plan ahead. How do you want to win the game? Building many small Artifacts and overwhelming your opponent? Using Veilstones to empower a Spell like Elemental Storm? Quietly building a high Victory Pile and hoping to go unnoticed? Try to outthink your opponent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will I Like This Game?&lt;br/&gt;You will enjoy Etherium Forge if you like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Simultaneous turns so you always stay in the action.&lt;br/&gt;     Adding physical and mental dexterity to a card game.&lt;br/&gt;     Using dice combinations to solve mini puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;     A fast game, often about 30-40 minutes with 4 players and still offers a lot of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;     A competitive game that is cutthroat.&lt;br/&gt;     Compact design, good for travel.&lt;br/&gt;     Easy to learn, but difficult to master.&lt;br/&gt;     An affordable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
