The player then progresses from the CHL, AHL, and the NHL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle for the Cup: Just like the NHL series on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, players will be able to Battle for the Cup, in a 1, 3, 5, or 7 game series. &lt;br/&gt;Season: Also like the regular NHL series, Season mode is available as well. You choose from the 30 NHL teams, and try to win the Stanley Cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mini-Games: Free 4 All: In Free 4 All, you can take on three friends and try and score the most goals. 2v2 Mini Rink: This is just an NHL game with 2 players on the ice for each team instead of 5. Shooter vs. Goalie: This is a 1 on 1 battle with you and a friend. The shooter shoots from about the blue line, while the goalie tries to block his shots. Classic Shootout: Also like NHL 11, this mode is a regular NHL shootout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hockey stick peripheral&lt;br/&gt;The new hockey stick peripheral for NHL SlapshotA miniature hockey stick peripheral will be released with the game, allowing (but not requiring) the player to insert the Wii Remote and its Nunchuk attachment and simulate playing with a real hockey stick.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NHL Slapshot&amp;quot;,  available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
