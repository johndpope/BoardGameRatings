			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNPUBLISHED PRODUCT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;it appears this Item will never be published&lt;br/&gt;this Item has been moved to (Unpublished Products)&lt;br/&gt;there should be no product images submitted to this entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For over twenty years these locations, as described in H.P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s Arkham, H.P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s Dunwich, H.P. Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s Kingsport, and Escape from Innsmouth, have been the setting for most adventures for the Call of Cthulhu&amp;reg; roleplaying game. Since their release by Chaosium between 1990 and 1992, there has been no further exploration of Lovecraft Country. But these locations are not the only places where the investigators can encounter the Cthulhu Mythos; there are many Forgotten Corners of Lovecraft Country just waiting to be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Forgotten Corners of Lovecraft Country, Vol. 1, Miskatonic River Press is proud to present two new settings and three scenarios that expand Lovecraft Country for Call of Cthulhu&amp;rsquo;s classic era. West of Arkham and south of Dunwich, along the Aylesbury Turnpike, lies the tiny, sleepy crossroads village of Dean&amp;rsquo;s Corner, the middle of nowhere where nothing ever happens, both a haven and a prison to its inhabitants; and beyond it, the rough and tumble industrial town of Aylesbury, a failed dream of utopia, built on a foundation of social engineering and ancient sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;moved to (Unpublished Products) on August 23, 2016&lt;br/&gt;we assume this was never published due to the death of Keith Herber&lt;br/&gt;who was the founder of the linked publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
