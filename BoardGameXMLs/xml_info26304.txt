			<description>Consists of 2 sets of 3 dice. One set is for the server (marked 'S'), and one set is for the receiver (marked 'R'). Each set has a red, a white and a blue die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Server rolls their dice first. If the serve is good (indicated on the red Server die), then receiver rolls their dice as well and proceed as in paragraph below. If the serve is out (indicated on the red server die), receiver scores a point. The appropriate person (according to the rules of tennis) then takes the Server dice and begins a new point by rolling the Server dice as previous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice are always read in the order Red-White-Blue and alternating between the Server's dice and the Receiver's dice. The dice say things like 'Serve Good', 'Lob Good', 'Return Out', 'Overhead Smash Out', etc. So, first read the red Server die - if the serve is good, read the red Returner die - if good, read the white Server die - if good, read the white Returner die... Continue alternating reading the dice until the ball goes out or all the dice are read and the ball is still good. Score as in tennis. Switch dice when changing server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
