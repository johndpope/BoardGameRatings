							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Summonings: The Uncivilized Guest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Uncivilized Guest is a four hour adventure-style LARP where the player characters have all been invited to a party, and something awful happens and the players need to solve the problem that occurs or, well, die trying. It is an introductory game to the world of Dark Summonings, and no knowledge of the world or the campaigns is needed to play in or run this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game contains a complete GM manual with timeline and NPC sheets, and 12 pregenerated player characters with STATs. Players are welcome to create their own characters using the RTLB, and RTLB: Supernatural sourcebooks. Use the sample characters as examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Dark Summonings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Summonings is a live action roleplaying setting of Occult Adventure set in the year 1926. Occult Adventure isn't exactly horror, although there are strong elements of horror in the genre. There is mysticism and magic and scary monsters and eerie situations, but overall the setting is more of an adventure campaign than a horror campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Summonings uses the Rules To Live By live action system, including both the core book, and Rules To Live By: [Supernatural. There may be some modified rules in Dark Summonings. Rules To Live By is designed to be modified as the GM sees fit. Feel free to modify the rules as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
