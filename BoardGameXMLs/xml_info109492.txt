							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemical Surplus Shop</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world&amp;rsquo;s ultimate goblin entrepreneur is back! His previous business (detailed in Loot 4 Less, vol. 7: Krazy Kragnar&amp;rsquo;s Used Chariots) was closed after a dwarven nobleman perished in a freak houda accident. Now Krazy Kragnar returns with a whole new business plan &amp;mdash; he is the owner and chief salesman of the Alchemical Surplus Shop, a place that buys alchemist fire that&amp;rsquo;s past its use - by date, thunderstones that don&amp;rsquo;t meet military specifications, and refurbished tanglefoot bags in bulk and passes the savings on to the customer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, when dealing with alchemical materials that are left over from, rejected by, or bought at the estate sale of the previous owner, you often end up with some nonstandard merchandise. The Alchemical Surplus Shop would be happy to sell discounted acid flasks and sunrods if they were available, but such items are bought up long before Kragnar gets on the scene. Not to worry, though! Less popular items are usually passed over by merchants salvaging the smoking crater of a failed alchemical bazaar, and their loss is your gain! Kragnar has pulled together new items&amp;mdash;from the cacophonous boompot to the subtle clocktinder&amp;mdash;all available only here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So come browse the shelves, flip through the seasonal catalog, and check out the daily specials. Krazy Kragnar has dozens of alchemical items you&amp;rsquo;ve never even heard of, ready to arm adventurers with the power of almost-magic and challenge alchemists by offering new items for them to craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
