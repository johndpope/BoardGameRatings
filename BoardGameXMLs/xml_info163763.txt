							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bearing A Grudge (Swords &amp; Wizardry)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4-6 Adventurers of Levels 1-3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Two Sisters Trading Post needs some genuine help. Deep in the forest, it is running out of supplies as kobolds, bandits, and even wild animals attack the travelers and traders on their way to and from it. If something isn't done about this soon, then the trading post is going to have to change its name or get into another line of business. Of course, that's assuming that the trading post itself doesn't become a target of some of the attacks...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bearing A Grudge is one of a range of prepackaged modules that are designed to be dropped into play during existing campaigns or adventures, or even to just be used on their own, by discerning Gamemasters everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
