			<description>A party game intended to make &amp;quot;a tremendously successful party&amp;quot; (so says the publisher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host places Key Cards around the house or garden, depending on the venue for the party. For a garden party, it is suggested that you try to place the cards in unusual locations, including 'up a tree'!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each guest gets a card that shows, at the top, the name of a house (the British love giving a name to their house). That is their start point. They must find the Key Card with that house on it and that will tell them the name of the next house Key Card they must look for. When you find a house that you need, you must write down the defect of the house. This will prove that you did indeed find the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to find all 12 houses required, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather hopefully, the publisher says that if you buy extra score cards (called House Agents' Lists) up to 500 people can play! The mind boggles!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
