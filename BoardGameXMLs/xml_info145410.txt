							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baby&#039;s room</name>
									
			<description>Game description&lt;br/&gt;Your baby will be born in nine months, but its room still needs to be decorated. As a player it&amp;rsquo;s your job to help the family make this room as nice as possible. When you start, it&amp;rsquo;s only the mommy and daddy who will work, but after three months the godfather and &amp;ndash;mother will also lend a hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Baby&amp;rsquo;s room is played over nine rounds. Each round the players will place their pawns on available fields and apply the action related to it. Pawns are placed one at the time, e.g. every player places one pawn and after that they place their second pawn, and so on. Whoever scores the most points after nine rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines some well known mechanisms such as worker placement and resource management, and combines this with an interactive element in a 7 Wonders style so that you can use the resources of your neighbours also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game material&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Central game board&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 4 Player boards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 48 Decoration cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 Secret wishes cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 16 Pawns (4 in each color)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 120 Resources (30 per color)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Round marker&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Starting player marker&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
