							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lacuna Part I. The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City (First Attempt)</name>
									
			<description>From the Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game (henceforth called Lacuna, for brevity&amp;rsquo;s sake) pits the players against madmen and serial killer; individuals too dangerous to allow to exist in our reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also a puzzle. A puzzle where some of the pieces may be missing. This is intentional, though not all discrepancies that may appear are the result of careful planning. Some are the result of not enough sleep, too much caffeine and hours of frantic typing. Others are simply there. The Perfection of Imperfection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soemtkimes teh kjeys gert stliuck bduyt yueou cvban sthiill rsrjfad betsdkween tdhe lieness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, there&amp;rsquo;s a great deal in this game that I simply do not wish to share with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is highly encouraged that prospective Game Masters read through the entire game before playing. It is also highly encouraged that prospective players read through the system and character creation sections and let the GM fill them in on any other details on a need-to-know basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not necessary to understand the game in order to play it. If you encounter any &amp;ldquo;blank spaces,&amp;rdquo; fill them in as you see fit. There is an answer, but there&amp;rsquo;s a chance that it&amp;rsquo;s not the one you want. Proceed with caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
