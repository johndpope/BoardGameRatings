							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perfect Match Game</name>
									
			<description>FROM THE BOX:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect four compatible Dexter cards for each section (Head, Body, Legs &amp;amp; Feet) to complete your Perfect Match, i.e. the right head on the right body and so fourth. On the way to meeting your Perfect Match you'll be revealing to the other players the real you. You'll be asking questions about your friends' personalities, as well as answering ones about yourself. You'll really get to know who your playing with as you collect, blind date and swap your way to your perfect match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Congratulation on purchasing your very own Perfect Match game. I had a lot of fun compering hundreds of episodes of Perfect Match on the television show. I hope you have a few laughs and many hours of enjoyment playing your game at home with friends.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Best of luck and of course - I hope you find your Perfect Match&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greg Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the formerly popular and long-running 1980s Network Ten (and later Seven Network in 2002) Australian TV dating game show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
