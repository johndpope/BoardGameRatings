			<description>Drop the Puck is a hockey themed board game. Drop the puck has turn based game play. &lt;br/&gt;On a players turn they take 2 actions with 2 different team members. The turn actions let players move, pass, shoot, steal the puck and perform other hockey related actions. &lt;br/&gt;The shooting and passing require a player to roll a die and beat a number depending on how far away the shot or pass is and how many opponents are trying to block it. Dice are also used to try and block shots, fight, and attempt penalties. Other actions involve moving team member figures on the board. Players also have cards to play that enhance the actions they take on their turn. After taking their turn the player advances their game clock token to keep track of game length.&lt;br/&gt;After 3 periods of play the player who scored the most goals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
