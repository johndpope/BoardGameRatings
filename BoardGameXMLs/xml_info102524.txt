							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pass the Plunder</name>
									
			<description>You've been busy plundering jewels from the islands, but now you have a long sail home, how will you pass the time? You'll be playing &amp;quot;Pass the Plunder&amp;quot;, the fast paced game of skullduggery! Work to move the best booty into your pile and foil your opponents with cards like Rum and Turn About. Simple enough to play with the family; strategic enough to entertain all game enthusiast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game each player is dealt 5 cards. Each turn a player draws a card and must place a card in their plunder pile. Cards must match either the color or the shape of the top card of their current plunder pile. If a Bury Treasure card is played the plunder piles are removed and added into the players treasure pile. But beware of your fellow brethren of the sea, as they may make you skip your turn, steal your hard earned booty, or call on the winds of change to reverse play. Once all cards in the deck have been played the round is over and scores are added up. Cards are reshuffled and play continues until a player reaches 500 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
