			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wellan's workshop occupies the first floor of the two-story building.  The building itself is fairly normal looking, mixing stone and wood where needed.  Each window has red shutters that are pulled closed when the shop is not in use.  There is a fenced in yard for wagons waiting to have a wheel repaired or new wheels put on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF document was distributed in an archive with supporting GIF map images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
