			<description>OBJECT OF GAME&lt;br/&gt;To move one's scorepeg from start to finish on the scoreboard by using the KaBoom! Machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player pumps the machine from one to ten strokes during any one turn; the number of intended pumps is declared before the start of each player's turn and cannot be changed. Players must pump the KaBoom! Machine at least once on their turn - it is forbidden to pass a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the balloon does not burst, the player's scorepeg is moved the appropriate number of holes on the scoreboard. Scorepegs cannot land on occupied holes.  If a player's scorepeg lands on a star on the scoreboard they MUST go again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the balloon bursts at any time, the scorepeg of the player who bursts the balloon is moved back 20 holes.  A new balloon is placed in the KaBoom! Machine and the next player has their turn.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach finish is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
