			<description>Limited Hand Crafted Edition created by Utah Artist Shirley Smithers.  Design in the mid 60's, her family played this game with lots of fun. She published the game just last year with the idea that families that play together stay together.  The game is set back in the 1860's.  You are a Miner or you are an Outlaw.  The object of the game is to have the most GOLD $ by the end. Miners mine and the Outlaws loot and rob the miners.  Different spaces have either consequences or actions.  There multiple gold mines to mine and are limited as to how many times they can be mined. Once mined Miner needs to go to the bank and make a deposit and get more mining supplies, if they can get to the bank without being robbed.&lt;br/&gt;  I am one of those kids who played it in the 60's and it is great fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jef Smithers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
