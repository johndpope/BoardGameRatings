			<description>From the Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Traveling from Nashville through heartaches and pain, the big loser becomes the big winner!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with 200 Happiness Points and take turns rolling dice to move their pawns around the game board.  Landing on an &amp;quot;Emotion&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; space cues the player to draw a card from the corresponding deck.  The board also contains spaces such as &amp;quot;County Jail&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Brightwood&amp;quot; that lead to a die roll and one of six potential outcomes.  These outcomes, most of the other spaces on the board, and the Emotion and Action cards contain either a happiness boost or drop and a country music cliche or song title.  The rules state that &amp;quot;[t]he first player to lose all 200 Happiness Points is the winner, since in Country Music the 'big loser' is also the 'big winner.'&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
