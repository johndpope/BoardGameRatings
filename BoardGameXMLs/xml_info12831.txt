							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goofin&#039; Around with Goofy</name>
									
			<description>This memory game also teaches young children about colors and patterns. Goofy is a cardboard cutout in front of a color wheel. He is standing on his head and the contents of his pockets (the memory cards) have fallen onto the table. A player draws a &amp;quot;pose&amp;quot; card and tries to move Goofy's legs to the correct colors and position. If correct, the player may then turn over two pocket item cards (revealing things like cookies, yo-yos and rubber chickens) and keep them if they match. When all the pocket item cards are gone, the player with the most matches wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
