			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SYNERGY role playing game is designed with spontaneous storytelling in mind. This game provides a rules-light framework that is easy to understand, requires cheep common materials to play, and does not require any preparation time besides the time it takes to create a character. It is not tied to any particular setting or genre and allows each player to contribute equally to the development of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Synergy&amp;quot; is the interaction of two or more people that results in ideas that are greater than what the contributors could do on their own. There is no better title for this game, as it fosters&lt;br/&gt;creativity and cooperation, while ensuring that no one person dominates the game. A good example of this is how the role of Story Manager - the primary storyteller in the game &amp;ndash; is passed around between players through game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope that you take the time to read through these rules, bring together a few friends, and find&lt;br/&gt;out what a great game this is for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
