							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fishin&#039; Holes</name>
									
			<description>Fishin' Holes is a family-style tile and token game designed for people of all ages. Players take turns casting out to explore tiles, then reeling in by claiming tiles with their tokens. The game has elements of memorization, poker-like bluffing, and some risk taking. The goal is to capture the most fish while staying away from hazards like old tires, boots, or weeds. The game contains 60 pond tiles, wooden player tokens and bonus fish pieces, a score pad and instruction booklet. Rules are simple enough for children as young as age 8, but there is enough strategy to make this enjoyable for adults as well. The game works well for 2-5 players and takes about 30 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
