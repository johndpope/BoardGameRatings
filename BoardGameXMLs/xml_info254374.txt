							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pile the Bones</name>
									
			<description>Pile the Bones is a dexterity game using pieces shaped like long bones. Each player places a bone on the playing surface to form a square base, then each player in turn places a new bone on the pile. The player who places the bone that collapses the pile scores one point for each bone in the pile. If a player plays the last bone without collapsing the pile that player reduces their score by 10 points. The player with the least points after an agreed number of rounds is the winner. Alternatively the players may play on individual piles of bones. In this case, there is no bonus for playing the last bone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is packaged in a plastic barrel similar to &amp;quot;Barrel of Monkeys&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
