							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colony 7</name>
									
			<description>Colony 7 is an arcade shooter game by Taito Corporation released in 1981 that is in many ways a combination of two of the most popular shoot 'em up games of the time, containing elements of both Taito's own Space Invaders and Atari's Missile Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main innovation of Colony 7 was its extended weaponry arsenal. This gave the player the choice to change between several different weapons, with each one needing to be purchased separately through the arcade coin slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was re-released by Sega on their game compilation Taito Legends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Colony 7&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
