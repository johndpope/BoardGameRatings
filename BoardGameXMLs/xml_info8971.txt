							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orient Expedition: India (Scorpion Palace)</name>
									
			<description>This game is included in the Lego set 7418 Scorpion Palace, part of the &amp;quot;Orient Expedition - India&amp;quot; series.  The various games can be combined to increase the number of players, and you can even add games from the &amp;quot;Orient Expedition - Mount Everest&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Orient Expedition - China&amp;quot; games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components consist of a board of seven interlocking tiles, a deck of 18 cards and a die (a normal six-sider with the &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; replaced by the Hook).  The rules are in 19 languages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is laid out around the constructed play set (in either the standard layout or a customized one) and the equipment pieces (shovel, pistol, binoculars, spear, satchel and map) are spread randomly on the cross spaces (of which there are 14 on the board); the remaining items start in the Scorpion Palace.  The Challenge (5) and Item (8) cards are spread face up to serve as reference cards.  There are two playable characters and three &amp;quot;bad guys&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To move, the die is rolled and the hero's Speed factor added in.  Items collected add to the Speed, Luck or Strength factors.  A hero can only carry what the figure can actually carry --two hands, maybe a backpack with a loop on its side.  Once the Scorpion Palace (or the Elephant) is reached, challenges are faced.  You choose which factor to use, although some items mean you win the challenge automatically (most items just give a bonus).  A die is added (re-roll Hooks); if your total is less than the Challenge rating, you lose an item and must try again later.  Once a Challenge is defeated, it is cleared for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outside the Palace, when you roll a Hook then the bad guy Sam Sinister challenges you.  The hero picks a skill factor and both him and Sam Sinister add a die (re-roll Hooks and ties).  A defeat again means you lose an item.  A win means you take an item from Sam Sinister!  The other two bad guys are faced the same way, except that they don't move about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elephant (or any other means of transportation, if playing combined game sets) increases movement considerably since you now move one tile per die pip instead of one square (the tiles measure 5 squares across).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a hero reaches the final square with the Golden Shield.  Both heroes add their item values to see who wins.  Jewels are worth 4 each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
