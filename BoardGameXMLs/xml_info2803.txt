			<description>Ave is a game by Valentin Herman for 2-4 Romans, published as a game-kit in 2000 by Fanfor with the intent of developing it into a full game later. Players compete to gain credit for developing a fine Roman city with schools, aqueducts, markets, forums and so on, whilst also controlling Provinces in the Roman empire. The kit comprises the German rules and 17 heavy A4 paper sheets with color with very simple graphics for the boards and tiles which must be cut out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
