			<description>Arxhenge is a castle stronghold and like all strongholds, it keeps something safe, in this case, an enormous cache of treasure. The goal of the games is to enter this immense and mysterious citadel, steal its treasure, and escape with it before your opponent does the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different games with a couple of variations that we play on the unique Arxhenge gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of 'Arxhenge' is a strategy game for 2-4 players. Each player controls a team of five theives and must use strategic thinking to outwit opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Fortunato' is a game where players roll special 'fate dice' to move through the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Merlin's Madness' demands players use their intuition. They must predict their opponent's moves as they attempt to 'Get in, get it, get away, and get out.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arxhenge Game Kit includes:&lt;br/&gt;30X30&amp;quot; game board printed in black on a canvas scroll.&lt;br/&gt;2 stone 'fate dice'&lt;br/&gt;10 molded metal avatars + a golden king.&lt;br/&gt;a drawstring pouch for the game peices.&lt;br/&gt;Instructions for three games, plus tips and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully hand-painted kits are now available!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING!! The Arxhenge Game Kit contains small, sharp objects! NOT RECOMMENDED for children under 8 years without ADULT SUPERVISION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
