			<description>In Immortal Warriors, players take on the roles of warriors cursed with immortality. They fight forever against the hidden evils of the land, playing throughout the ages of history and into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this turn-based game, players roll their dice up to three times in hope of matching the enemy before them, in the guise of a symbol on the card. They are fighting through battlegrounds in different time periods, to face off the boss at the end of each era in a final confrontation. If the boss is defeated, the player is awarded extra battle prowess (in the form of a reserve die) that they take with them to the next era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each foe the player manages to defeat, their score increases handsomely. With each loss the player takes, they are weakened and a die is removed from their pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
