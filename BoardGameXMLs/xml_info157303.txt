			<description>SeaDogs is a fast paced family game for 2-6 players, ages 10 and up. Players take on the rolls of Pirate captains taking part in a competition to gather the most Gold and Treasure.  The Captain with the most Gold after all is said and done is the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sail into a port, and get gold by selling any cargo you have earned from your acts of piracy.  Pillage ports to gain cargo, but once a pirate pillages a port they must move to another Port to take any more actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no honor among Pirates, and it's every Captain for themselves on the high seas.  Players may attack each other and steal Cargo, Gold, or even Treasure that has been found on mysterious islands in the area.  Pirates who take plunder from other players get a Bounty on their heads that goes to the next Pirate to take them down a peg or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sea Dogs has a whimsical style.  The world it takes place in is populated by animals.  The base game focuses on dogs, but who knows what other animals are out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SeaDogs is a quick playing game that is fun for kids and adults.  And it is designed to be kid friendly so everyone has a chance of winning, while still having enough depth that adults can play together and enjoy it as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
