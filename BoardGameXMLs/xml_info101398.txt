			<description>Takeshi no Chōsenjō (たけしの挑戦状 Takeshi's Challenge?) is a Japanese action-adventure video game for the Family Computer (known internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System) developed by the Taito Corporation. The game was developed under the direction of comedian-turned actor and film director Takeshi Kitano (Beat Takeshi), and was only released in Japan on December 10, 1986; according to a Taito Corporation source, 80,000 copies were sold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kitano incorporated many of his unique and controversial ideas into the game. For instance, the player can beat up a yakuza gangster at a pachinko gambling establishment, and take the yakuza's money to exchange for prizes. The player can use a hang-glider to fly over into a strange land called the &amp;quot;Red Country&amp;quot; (an amalgam between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany). The player can gain access to the Red Country if they pass over the four other islands, but a huge mountain blocks the way into the country, and the player will be forced to crash into either the mountain or the ground, resulting in an automatic game over screen. There is also a choice on the password-entry screen (&amp;quot;Punch the old man&amp;quot;) which also results in an automatic game over, even when the player has not even started the game. Other in-game events include: a game over screen where the player's character is given a funeral, singing karaoke at a pub (using the second-controller's built-in microphone), the main character divorcing his wife and paying a settlement, beating up yakuza, or seeing inhumane comments on store signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Takeshi no Chōsenjō&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
