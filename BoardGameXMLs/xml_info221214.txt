							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earth Overclocked</name>
									
			<description>Earth Overclocked is a twin-stick shooter with rogue-like elements, set in a very distorted, unstable version of our world where trees are evil, snowmen have protruding laser blasters, and monsters from popular myths dwell underground. A scientist is trapped here after his time machine explodes while traveling back in time, and he must reassemble his machine to escape before this crazy dimension collapses under its own instability. With only 20 minutes to explore Distorted Earth, defeat boss monsters, and reclaim the pieces to the time machine, the adrenaline rush is real!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately for the Scientist, a variety of powerful weapons can be found hidden in locked chests and sold from menacing black-robed merchants, ranging from simple weapons like shotguns and boomerangs to crazy arsenal such as paintball guns, leaf magnums, and even cheese!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In true rogue-like fashion, death is permanent and means starting over, but Distorted Earth is randomized between playthroughs to give a fresh experience with every new run, and there are over 35 permanent unlockables, including new weapons, game modes, and classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
