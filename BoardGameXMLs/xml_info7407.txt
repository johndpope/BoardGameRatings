			<description>The longer the war lasted, the clearer it became that the Atlantic was the deciding factor, and that if the German U-Boat force could achieve real success in the war against Merchant Shipping, the tables would be turned in Germany's favor. In 1942 the Battle for the Atlantic was moving toward its climax and whole U-Boat packs were fighting bitterly with Allied escort forces. This is a situation in which our convoy, bound from Halifax in Canada to Liverpool, steams into the middle of a U-Boat formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of several titles released by Tabletop Games which were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a map) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used un-cut cardstock counters. Other games in the series include Ballistic Missile, MTB, and Galactic War.&lt;br/&gt; There apparently two versions of this game published copyright 1977. Other version had different cover art, identical contents, and was print jointly by Tabletop Games and Heritage Models, Inc. In the back of this edition's rulebook, it lists other games available as Ballistic Missle, Galactic Warfare, Micro-Napoleonics, Micro-Ancients and Colonial Warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
