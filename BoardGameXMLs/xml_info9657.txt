			<description>Lets get ready to party. But before all the eating and drinking stuff has to be prepared...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 48 tiles (printed on both sides) are laid out in an 6x8 grid. The active player has to switch 2 tiles so that afterwards more tiles with the same picture are next to each other. The number of the connected tiles is the points you score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nice unfortunately overlooked game by W.Kramer. What sounds very simple concerning the rules can become quite brain teasing during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
