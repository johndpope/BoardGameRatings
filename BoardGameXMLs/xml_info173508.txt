							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Cloud and Storm Giants</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Titanic Rulers of the Skies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm and cloud giants are the stuff of legends. Far more sophisticated than their brutish and earth-bound kin, these majestic giants are most at home far above the clouds, where they are rumored to live in giant castles and golden cities miraculously suspended in the air. As legendary as these sky titans are, however, there are a few among them that are even more masterful and impressive than the rest of their race. These are the mythic cloud and storm giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for mythic cloud giant and mythic storm giant, both of which have unique abilities never seen elsewhere. Mythic cloud giants (CR 14) can cause her foes to fly skyward when she strikes them, slamming them back down to the earth for extra damage. Further, she can transform clouds, causing them to become as solid and substantial as rock, and can summon clouds (including magical clouds, such as cloudkill) to nearby places. Not to be outdone, mythic storm giants (CR 17) can hurl thunderbolts at their foes, and wield blades made of pure lightning. As if that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, their dominion over storms extends from the air to the sea, and they can create deadly whirlpools to swallow their foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
