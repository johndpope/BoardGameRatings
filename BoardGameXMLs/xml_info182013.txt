							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Election</name>
									
			<description>Election is a poker style card game where the absurd events of the campaign trail dictate the action. Each player's hand consists of cold hard cash and political strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 decks of cards in Election, the States, the War Chest and the Campaign Trail decks. The goal of the game is to win the most votes. Votes are won by winning Elections, in which a set # of states are up for grabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt 7 cards War Chest cards at the beginning of the game. War Chest cards consist of money, boosts and strategic, &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; cards that allow you to affect the &amp;quot;Elections&amp;quot; and the other players winnings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn players draw from the humorous Campaign Trail deck to find out if their Campaign is going well, in which they can improve their hand, or if it's not and they receive a disadvantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player draws an Election Card, the appropriate # of state cards are drawn and an Election takes place, in which each player plays their highest valued hand. However, &amp;quot;Take That&amp;quot; cards, such as steals, and recounts can affect the results. The winner of the Election wins the States and the votes. After an Election, players turn in their cards (unless they drew the option to retain a card) and everyone is dealt a new hand and continues gameplay until all the States and votes are won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
