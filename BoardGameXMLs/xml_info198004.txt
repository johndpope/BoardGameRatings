			<description>聖剣ガ抜ケナイ (a.k.a. Kiyoshikenga抜 Kenai) is a semi-cooperative battling game in which players simultaneously reveal a card from their hand to collectively try to pull a sword from a stone. You don't want to waste your strength, though! If the total strength is within the winning range, then whoever played the lowest card wins &amp;mdash; unless more than one person played a card of the same value in which case the next lowest person wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you pulled too hard, then the player who played the highest number wins the round &amp;mdash; unless, of course, more than one person did the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever wins the most rounds wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
