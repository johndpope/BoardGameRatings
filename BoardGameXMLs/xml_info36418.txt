			<description>(From the back cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAGIC AT WARP SPEED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the last days of the General War, and the dark days of the wars that followed, come more than 90 new starships to secure your future and desperately seek the bases of the Andromedans determined to destroy you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-RAIDERS, designed for the last days of the General War and often denounced as an expensive folly, these proved decisive during the Andromedan War. Here you will find X-raiders that carry gunboats, X-raiders that carry heavy fighters, and X-raiders with the ultimate mega-fighter squadrons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUILD YOUR FLEET with the &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; X-ships from previous data files: War Destroyers, New Heavy Cruisers, modular Heavy War Destroyers, heavy Scout Cruisers, and swift Frigates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-MAULERS for when you really need to send the very best in total target destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW BASES: X-technology ground bases to improve your planetary defenses. X-technology sector bases since nobody can afford an X-starbase. X-technology base statins for those annoying planetary governors who have the chairman's phone number on speed dial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUPPORT SHIPS: Was it a waste to divert the limited number of X-ship technology to build drone bombardment ships, medium carriers, stasis ships, and penal ships? Find out for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE LOST X-SHIPS: X-ships that were built in small numbers for unique reasons, failed experiments, special missions, or political chicenary: Federation Drone Destroyer and Strike Cruiser, Romulan BattleHawk, Kzinti Escort Frigate, Gorn Commando Cruiser, Hydran Pegasus, Luran Wildcat, WYN Auxiliary Battlecruiser, ISC Medium Cruiser, LDR Military Police, Seltorian CAX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW X-WEAPONS: Particle cannon, shield cracker, and web breaker are all given X-technology!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PARTIAL X-REFITS: Complete guide to how to convert your ship to be the best it can be, when you cannot afford to build an entirely new X-ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTENTS: 216 die-cut counters, 96-page Ship Book, 64-page Starship Guide &amp;amp; Scenario Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
