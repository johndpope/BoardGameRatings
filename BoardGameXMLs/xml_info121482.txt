							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imps Vs Puppies: Hissy Fits</name>
									
			<description>The first expansion to the trick taking game of puppy smashing chaos, Hissy Fits introduces 8 new Imps and the dangerous new Ninja Kittens to the crate decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New character abilities run the gamut from resurrecting dead imps, stopping other abilities from triggering, even reversing the order of strength for the round.  Once upon a time, not winning a round was at least a little safe but the new Ninja Kitten spring from their smashed crates and kill the weakest Imp in the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the additions are specifically designed to make this game tougher and more strategic, obviously players experienced in Imps Vs Puppies need apply.  This expansion requires the base game to be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
