							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">B-24 Combat Simulator</name>
									
			<description>From the SSI Summer 1987 Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B-24 is a flight/combat simulator that challenges you to fly 19 dangerous bombing raids over Hitler's oil refineries at Ploesti, Rumania. You command the lead B-24 Liberator, which will determine the course of action for an entire formation of forty B-24s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But first, you must learn to fly this cantankerous bomber. You'll find it hard enough just to get off the ground or land without crashing. Then, you'll have to deal with fuel leaks and failure-prone superchargers. Two simpler scenarios let you practice taking off, flying in formation against flak and enemy fighters, bombing targets and landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you're ready, it's time to bomb Ploesti. You can fly in real time or up to sixty times faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you take off, check the wind forecast to help you determine how much fuel and how many bombs you can carry. Your first goal is to race to your fighter rendezvous points. The escort fighters will be waiting for you at a specified time and place. Don't be late because they can only stay up for so long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your job is to reduce Ploesti's total oil production below what was accom- plished historically (8500-9500 tons/day). If you succeed, you'll be told how much you would have shortened the war in Europe!
