			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Blood, Cold Steel is a war game simulation of the climactic battle fought near Chawinda, India. On September 1st, 1965 Pakistani forces launched Operation Grand Slam, an offensive intended to secure approaches to Jammu and Kashmir provinces from India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outnumbered Indian frontier forces fought desperate holding actions that successfully held the Pakistanis to limited gains that brought them to the outskirts of their objective, the town of Phillora. On September 15th Indian forces launched their counter-attack,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Riddle, that sought to throw back the Pakistanis and take back the crucial crossroads town of Chawinda. What ensued was the largest tank battle of the post-WWII era to that date, one that would only be eclipsed by the 1973 Yom Kippur War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Hot Blood, Cold Steel is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets&lt;br/&gt;One sheet of 180 single-sided, un-mounted counters (mounted counters can be had for an additional $5.00).&lt;br/&gt;One Players' aid sheet&lt;br/&gt;7 pages of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Ilya Kudriashov. Hot Blood, Cold Steel uses the Blood and Steel design. Players draw formation chits to activate their formations and units, and play is very interactive. A complete game takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete. Although designed for two players, Hot Blood, Cold Steel is well suited to solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
