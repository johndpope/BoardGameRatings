							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Breath of Death VII: The Beginning</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is in conflict.  The tension escalates to global war, and many nuclear strikes are launched.  A nuclear holocaust destroys all life on the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years later, the undead start to rebuild society from the pieces.  During this chaotic time of renewal, you (DEM) get forcibly included in a grand quest to explore the ruins of Langsong and find the ancient treasures.  Naturally the world is full of many perils and dangerous creatures, but you and your companions plan on seeing this through to the end, whether you like it or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breath of Death VII is a short but complex RPG experience that draws from many sources to spoof the genre as it exists.  Done in a style reminiscent of third and fourth generation top-down RPGs, Breath of Death has you, a skeleton who can only communicate through telepathy and charades, traveling the world for fame and fortune.  It uses many familiar conventions but also throws in a few new ones, and frequently adds a comic element to items, characters and set pieces.  It is also notable for being released in the Independent XBox 360 catalog for only $1 (US) or 80 Microsoft points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
