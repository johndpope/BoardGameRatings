			<description>Knuckle Knipper is a game of tension, memory, and frustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each plastic 'Knipper' can be depressed from two sides.  Press one side and 'Ouch' - it snaps shut around your finger.  Press the other side and it refuses to snap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing this game needs 'steady nerves', a good memory, and an element of bluff.  Players make their way from the centre of the board to their home corner by throwing the dice.  The route is of their choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player stops he must depress the side of the Knuckle Knipper nearest his spot.  If it's safe, he may rest easy - if it 'snaps' he loses a finger card.  But he does get to re-set the 'Knipper' secretly so that no one else knows which side it will 'snap'.  That's where the memory comes in.  Players successfully reaching their own corner get a finger card back each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast and furious game of tension is for 2 to 4 players, the winner being the player who is the last with a finger or fingers intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
