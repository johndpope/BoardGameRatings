The rules ensure that villains are scalable threats for heroes of all power levels.&lt;br/&gt;     Might your character develop rainbow powers for just one issue? Or perhaps your powered-armored hero just happens to have a specialized suit of &amp;ldquo;arctic&amp;rdquo; armor that&amp;rsquo;ll be helpful for an excursion in Antarctica. Or how about a hero whose comic has a new writer that alters his capabilities? All this is a big part of the game!   &lt;br/&gt;     Live-action rules!&lt;br/&gt;     Team-ups of different &amp;ldquo;power level&amp;rdquo; characters encouraged and fun for all!&lt;br/&gt;     Character complications embraced as a way to enrich your stories and empower rather than cripple your characters.&lt;br/&gt;     Plug-and-play character templates ready to be customized, getting you in the action right away!&lt;br/&gt;     A lengthy example-of-play section showcasing the flexibility of the system.&lt;br/&gt;     Two short Issues to get your crusade for justice started!&lt;br/&gt;     More than two dozen heroes and villains!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
