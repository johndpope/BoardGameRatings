			<description>English translation of item description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special station the size of a small planetoid. Who was the megalomaniac who imagined this? Do you know how much it's going to cost in sheer resources? And how are we going to hide it from those nefarious rebels so that they don't blow it up before it's finished? The Death Star, they call it. Good name, since they're going to kill us all building it. And that Vader, I get the shivers just hearing his name. They say he's coming to personally supervise all the work. And people have the tendency to die in strange ways when he's around. I don't know, I don't like this new posting. I'd have preferred to stay on at Kashyyyk, as a wookie wrangler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Spanish language playbook and is not available in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
