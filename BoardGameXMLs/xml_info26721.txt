			<description>Marjapussi (Berry bag) is a marriage-style trick-taking card game which is played with a deck containing cards from 6 to ace. It can be played by three individuals or by four players in two parties. The name of the game probably originates from the word marriage - not because it means the same thing but because it sounds similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to reach exactly 12 points, although other kinds of scoring methods exist. Points are not awarded directly from tricks, but from making trumps, marriages, getting the last trick and getting the most 10s and aces among the tricks you've collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that this is the national card game of Finland, although this may be an unofficial title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
