			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unnatural Stories is the second official adventure specially written for the table-top/roleplaying game Drudge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet contains FIVE adventure ideas for Drudge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    In All Out War two combat groups meet on the battle field. The adventure is written for Vietnam war era, World War II or Hundreds' Year War &amp;ndash; but it is easily converted to any similar conflict.&lt;br/&gt;    The Space Station brings an alien problem to the explorers of our Solar System. This is either an easy action adventure &amp;ndash; or a more advanced horror episode with a twist!&lt;br/&gt;    The Assassination calls for the death of an evil dictator &amp;ndash; but can also be converted to a mafia episode. Your choice!&lt;br/&gt;    In Beer Run a trucker makes a bet to smuggle beer between two states. This is another version of the adventure Convoy, included in the core rule book.&lt;br/&gt;    The Mysterious Maze transports a small group of people who never met before, to a weird maze. This adventure includes four different versions that can be expanded upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these five adventures are written without any NPC data or other values or tables. Mainly, this is because most of these adventures should be converted by a Game Master (or in some cases the players) based upon what models and terrain you have access to. Most of these adventures does not use NPC &amp;ndash; but can be expanded to include NPC if GM or the players feel the need for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
