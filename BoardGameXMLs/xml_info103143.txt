			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 19.07 on the 5th of May 1980 John Dellow of the Metropolitan Police signed a document passing control of the Iranian Embassy siege to LT. COL H.M. Ross. He sent in three, four-man teams (Sabre Teams) of 22 S.A.S., the rest is history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many the S.A.S. are the black-clad rescuers of Princes Street depicted by the B.B.C. as the pictures of the last minutes of the siege were relayed live around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We as mere mortals can only wonder at the exploits of this most professional and highly trained fighting force as officially it does not exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simulation is based on the information that is available and is produced by people who have a great deal of admiration for those whom they will never know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
