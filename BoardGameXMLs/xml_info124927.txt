			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vudish, crouched, adopting a cautious posture as he took in the scene before him. Five of his orc warriors lay dead and disfigured around the slight looking human with the strange chain weapon. Clearly this was an opponent to treat with respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a fearsome roar he raised his greatsword to strike, stepping into melee with measured steps. The human reacted with speed that caught Vudish off guard, the chain whipped out and wrapped round the greatsword, yanking it from Vudishs grasp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before he knew what was happening, the other end of the heavy spiked chain crashed into the side of his skull, the cruel barbs tearing his face and crushing his skull, as the world faded into blackness&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swords are for the common grunt, the every day hack and slasher who can&amp;rsquo;t think beyond smashing someone in the face with a barely sharpened chunk of metal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, however, the elegant loops of chain and the crashing thunder of a spiked steel ball are the height of skill and expertise. These warriors devote themselves entirely to the Spiked Chain, preferring it over all over weapons, and drive themselves ruthlessly toward perfection with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
