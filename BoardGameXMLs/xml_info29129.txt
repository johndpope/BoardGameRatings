							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Canal Boat Race</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple roll and move style game based on the British waterways of the 19th Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must negotiate a series of canals to get to the wharf, collect coal and return to the Paper mill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turn to take cards from a pile and move the number of spaces shown on the card. Some cards give specific bonuses like extra movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are the rules for a more complex version of the game called Boatman's Bluff. This uses the same components but adds a bit more strategy to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was published in association with the British Waterways Board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
