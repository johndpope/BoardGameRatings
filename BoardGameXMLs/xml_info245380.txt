			<description>The moles are always digging in the soil and building tunnels. The goal of this card game is to lay down cards as neatly and to build as many tunnels as possible. If a player completes a tunnel, he or she is allowed to clear away the cards and leave them as a reward in front of him or her. The one with the most gained cards in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets twelve cards and two cards that are the beginning of the tunnels. Then each player choses one card and discards faced down. The player with the highest number wins and is the first to place his card. It is important to only place cards to rows and columns in the same color (red, yellow, green, blue) and to place cards in the right number series. To gain points, the player has to complete a tunnel of four cards, which lay down in a row, a column or as a stack. The game ends if all cards are discarded. Additionally there are joker cards, which can be replaced for all other colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
