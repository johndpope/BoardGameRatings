			<description>This is a strategy game for 2-3 players. It takes place on a 6 sided game board with pieces moving on the triangles. Each player has 4 pawns in the form of dice. The triangular fields of the board are molded so that a corner of a die exactly fits in. The die can be moved from space to space with a simple nudge at the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to get your 4 dice across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PREPARATION FOR THE GAME WITH TWO ? The younger player chooses a color and puts his 4 dice into four edge spaces of his side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT DOES A TURN CONSIST OF?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) Each turn must be executed completely. One might not skip a part of the turn. You may not move a die less than its actual movement unless you reach the finish without completing your die roll  &lt;br/&gt;2.)   Dice may not touch. So a die will block 3 spaces. (2 spaces if on an edge.)&lt;br/&gt;3.)   If a player has no legal move, he skips his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME RULES FOR THREE PLAYERS All rules of the normal game for two persons are valid also for the game with three. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally you must follow these rules: 1.) Set up is different . See rules for proper 3 person set up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third and fourth dice of each player may only be moved, when the first and second dice have reached the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
