			<description>In &amp;quot;Malha&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o - O Jogo&amp;quot;, players are challenged to answer correctly questions about... the other players! Each turn, a player reads out loud a card with a question, and secretly choses one out of three options about how he (or she) would react in such situation. After that, it's time for the others to try to guess which was the chosen answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game always have two winners - each player has a separate score with every other player. In the end, the pair that has the highest sum of points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
