			<description>Shattered Throne is the first expansion to the Planet Masters dicegame. This optional set of rules explains how to use the new dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three new alien races with special abilities are available to the players. A new central planet is added to the dice pool and players can now invest in technology advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background story:&lt;br/&gt;The central government on Solium Sphaera has fallen. The planet is in turmoil. Social unrest divides the galaxy. The all consuming technology race between the empires has shattered the symbolic throne. Rivalry between the empires has never been this tense. Fleet sizes are rising. The amount of weapons is growing. The empire with the most advanced technological knowledge will seize control of the central megaplanet Solium Sphaera. He who controls Solium Sphaera reigns the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
