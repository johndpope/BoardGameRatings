							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game – Nightmare Deck: The Drowned Ruins</name>
									
			<description>In The Drowned Ruins, you enter the Temple of the Deceived only to find that you must navigate labyrinthine Underwater passageways to reach the mysterious chest that can only be opened by the key in your possession. Holding your breath as you move between grottos, you are unable to ask for help from new allies whilst trapped in these locations, even as you suffer terrible Forced effects. But you have come too far to give in now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now with The Drowned Ruins Nightmare Deck, you will step back into the temple to explore new locations like the Jagged Cavern and face untold horrors that lurk within the murky depths. You will need to call upon all your strength to keep your head above water. When you're dragged beneath the waves in Nightmare Mode, encounter card effects cannot be canceled, and there is no telling what creeping things may watch you from the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these dark underground chambers, untouched by the sun for countless years, strange and grotesque creatures have thrived undisturbed, at least until now. You may wade through the muck only to have your ankle grabbed by the Submerged Dead or caught in the teeth of a Great Shark! But if you survive the expedition to the heart of the temple, great discoveries await you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 20 cards to swap with specific cards from The Drowned Ruins Adventure pack encounter deck to raise the difficulty of that scenario to nightmare difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a standalone product. It requires a copy of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game Core Set, The Grey Havens deluxe expansion, and The Drowned Ruins adventure pack to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
