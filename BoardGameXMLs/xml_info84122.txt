							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wittstock 1636</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;From the fourth of our attempts to hammer DBR into an historical mould we reach forward to 1636, to the height of the Thirty Years War. Gustav Adolph has been in his grave for four years and the Swedish aura of invincibility has been shattered at Nordigen in 1634. Nevertheless, the Swedes are nothing if not resilient and under one of Gustav's outstanding lieutenants, Johann Baner, they have reconstituted their army and gone back on the offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;John George, Elector of Saxony, has changed sides once again and now marches with the Imperial forces of Melchior Hatzfelt. With a combined army of 20,000 men the two outnumber the Swedes, and Baner has fallen back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Having seemingly disposed of the Swedish threat the Imperials have slackened their pursuit. Whereupon Baner has immediately turned on them, cutting off the joint army from the remaining Imperial troops in the neighborhood, and preparing to attack them near the small town of Wittstock on the river Dosse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario comes with deployment information, army lists, orders of battle, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario appears in Wargames Illustrated #186 (March 2003)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
