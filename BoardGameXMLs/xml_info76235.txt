							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raid On Bungeling Bay</name>
									
			<description>[Wikipedia: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Bungeling_Bay&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Bungeling_Bay&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raid on Bungeling Bay was the first video game designed by Will Wright. It was published by Br&amp;oslash;derbund for the Commodore 64 in 1984 and the NES and MSX computers in 1985. The Commodore 64 version was published in the UK by Ariolasoft, and the NES version was ported by Hudson Soft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from offering a 2D overhead view of terrain which was a bit more complex than in other games, Raid on Bungeling Bay was basically a simple war zone shoot 'em up. The player controlled a helicopter that launches from an aircraft carrier to bomb six factories scattered across islands on a small planetoid occupied by the Bungeling Empire (the usual villains in Br&amp;oslash;derbund games), while fending off escalating counterattacks by gun turrets, fighter jets, guided missiles, and a battleship. There was also a hidden island for the player to reload on. Failure meant that the Bungeling Empire develops a war machine to take over the planet Earth. Players had to attack its infrastructure while defending the aircraft carrier which served as home base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
