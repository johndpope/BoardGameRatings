			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement details twelve wilderness traps that can be constructed from simple materials such as rocks, sticks, grass, and mud. Deadfalls, foot traps, grass scythes, and other simple but deadly traps are presented here with diagrams, descriptions, and d20 statistics. These traps are inexpensive and easy to build, making them ideal for guerrilla fighters, hunters, and bandits. Unlike other traps, a wilderness trap can be constructed in a matter of hours and at a cost of 0 GP! Once built, they are especially difficult to notice, being constructed of logs, rocks and vines, which are quite inconspicuous in the wilds. All it takes to build these traps is a little know-how and some raw materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick this supplement up today and find out how easy it is to add these inexpensive and effective dangers to your wilderness campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
