							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Berlin Class Colonial Destroyer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the eighth entry in our line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Berlin-class is a 1200dT standard short hulled starship design. Designed primarily to provide colonial protection and security, the destroyer has crystaliron hull armor and an internal reinforced structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were ten Berlin-class Colonial Destroyers in Clement Sector when the Conduit collapsed.  All ten of these are currently in service with the Hub Federation Navy. After considering several design proposals the Marinekommando authorized detailed design and construction of the Berlin-class with the ability to carry a reinforced platoon of troops and their support vehicles.  No other national navy has constructed a similar class of ship, preferring to use troop transports with escorts to achieve the same purpose, which makes the Berlin-class somewhat unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Berlin-class ship is ideal for use in a naval campaign where the characters are called upon for multiple roles or a campaign in which the characters are Hub Federation strike troops.  The Berlin can also provide a worthy adversary for pirate and smuggler characters as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 8: Berlin-class Colonial Destroyer comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The Berlin-class is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the Berlin comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Berlin-class could easily be used in any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
