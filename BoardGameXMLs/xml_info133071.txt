			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sudan Battlegame is a fast action game in which the players are frequently making tactical decisions and taking actions. The game does not seek to simulate the Siege of Khartoum or the battle of Omdurman, but rather small unit combat and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scene is the Sudan in the time of Kitchener and Gordon (1880 to 1897). The forces in the conflict during this time had extremely different abilities, methods of fighting, and morale. It varied from the extreme of &amp;quot;crack&amp;quot; British units with rigid discipline to the wild and uncertain Beja tribesmen who relied on ambush, the sword, the dagger, and spear to dispatch opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most battle and wargames, including very complex Pentagon computer simulations, random events are part of the game. The winning player, or team,  is often the one who best deals with risk assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, it is essential that the players have some understanding of chance and probabilities.  This game utilizes both six-sided and 10-sided (percentile) dice to simulate move distances, resolve combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
