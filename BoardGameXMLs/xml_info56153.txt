			<description>Publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waste of Paper role play system is a simple table-top role play system that can be quickly learned, used and adapted to any setting. The W.O.P. system has been made an open game license system because the creative ends people will use it for will help to evolve it and enrich the role play experience of any person who plays it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W.O.P. couldn&amp;rsquo;t be a simpler or easier to use role play system. This game system uses two 10-sid&amp;shy;ed dice. Ideally it uses percentiles, which are a set of same colored 10-sided dice but one has double digits so that when they are rolled together, they create a 1-100 result, otherwise a D100 can be used or two 10-sided dice, one being a different color than the other. That&amp;rsquo;s it, no messing around, no lost dice or scrambling for extra dice around the game table, just two 10-sided dice. You can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every attribute and roll in W.O.P. is based on percentages which is why the only dice used are 10-sided dice. All rolls are also based on opposed rolls. To succeed at doing something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve another person or an active party, the player will be given a target number, and this target number is called Base. A Base determines how difficult something is to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waste of Paper role play system was created by Dillon Langlands and is the copyright of Penniless Canadian Stereotypes 2007-2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
