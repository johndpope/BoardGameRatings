			<description>EtheoryEm is a music theory and worker placement game in which players take control of musicians attempting to earn a seat in the prestigious Ethereum Orchestra.  Each turn, players choose to perform one of several actions, such as Practice (placing, rolling and shifting notes on the chromatic scale), Audition (attempting to secure a chair in the orchestra by completing objective chords and scales using those notes), Tenure (solidifying their seat in the orchestra and improving their influence within it) and Performance (randomly determined action points where the musicians must perform masterpieces to prove their skill and keep their positions).  As the orchestra is ultimately filled, players tally victory points to determine the winner based on the chords &amp;amp; scales successfully completed, their musician presence and location within the orchestra, as well as additional hidden objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
