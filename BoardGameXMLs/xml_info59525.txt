			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience the Adventure for Yourself...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the critically-acclaimed, Eisner-award winning comic-book series, the USAGI YOJIMBO Role-Playing Game brings you the mystery, wonder, and glory of feudal Japan. While the warring states have been brought to peace under the watchful eyes of the Shogun, danger still abounds in the form of greedy bandits, scheming warlords, and even supernatural horror. But a house that heaps evil upon evil cannot stand...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a source-book for the Usagi characters and stories, this game stands apart as a combination of story-telling and role-playing. Start simple, then add more skills, powers, and abilities &amp;mdash; even trade in old ones for new as your character changes and grows to become the hero that you create. Take on the role of a brave samurai warrior, a sly ninja, a wise priest, or even a simple farmer bound for glory. Battle the forces of corruption, despair, and evil. Clash swords with dozens of foes, or duel a single worthy opponent &amp;mdash; simple rules combine with your character's special abilities to make all encounters quick, decisive, and fun. Fight along side Usagi, Tomoe, and Gennosuke as they thwart Lord Hikiji and his minions ... or create all new characters and stories from your own imagination! This game brings all the excitement of Stan Sakai's fantastic blend of Japanese history and legend to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game, you will need pencil &amp;amp; paper, polyhedral dice (four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided, twelve-sided, and twenty-sided), and this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
