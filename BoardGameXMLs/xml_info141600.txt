							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wonders of Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemy Like You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Seen It Before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While alchemy has long been a major staple of the fantasy genre, it has never been a particularly powerful or even relevant ability in 3.5/Pathfinder. The items that can be created with Craft (alchemy) tend not to be worth the effort once one gets past the first few levels of the game (and even before that their value is questionable). The alchemist class has almost nothing to do with Craft (alchemy), and its extracts don&amp;rsquo;t feel alchemical so much as they do like spellcasting by another name. For years, players who wanted a character who toiled away crafting mad concoctions and brewing strange potions had to accept that such activities would never be of any real use in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: The Wonders of Alchemy aims to change all that, by providing a huge assortment of new things to make with Craft (alchemy), and introducing a new approach to the skill that greatly increases its relevance. This book introduces two new kinds of alchemical substances: infusions, which are alchemical concoctions that permanently alter the physical makeup of those who use them, and serums, which are potent alchemical substances that can be pumped directly into a subject&amp;rsquo;s blood, and whose effects can be stacked for greater efficacy, but which carry a risk of negative side-effects if too high a dose is taken. Beyond that, the book contains 50 new alchemical wondrous items (mainly in the form of elixirs, oils, and tonics, but with a few others as well), which can be crafted either through the normal process for wondrous items, or through a new application of the Craft (alchemy) skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve always wished that your alchemy was a little more magical, or if you just want over 100 new poisons, wondrous items, serums, and infusions, this is the book for you. From the creators of Advanced Arcana, Volume I and Secrets of the Witch, this book will ensure you never look at a potion shop the same ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
