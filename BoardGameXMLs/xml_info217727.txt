							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dumb A** the Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Be the first player to answer four cards correctly to win. The game contains 96 question cards (18 Hard Ass and 26 each Who, What, and Where cards) with instructions. The reader announces four items that all appear to have a correlation. Players then choose which item they feel does not belong. Each player gets only one try at answering each card. The first player to yell out the correct answer earns the card. If no player answers correctly, the reader wins the card. The player to the left of the reader becomes the new reader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
