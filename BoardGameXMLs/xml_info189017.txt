			<description>Balkan Gamble explores hypothetical invasions of the Balkans during WW2. There is also a scenario depicting a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia to unseat Tito in 1950.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the same game published in Strategy and Tactics #298, Balkan Gambit, though they share almost the same title (and the same designer). Instead, it uses the Autumn Mist / Summer Lightning / Winter Thunder system where formation are activated by chit-pull which uses an almost-diceless combat with a mission matrix.&lt;br/&gt; Headquarter chits are randomly drawn, and HQs can activate units  for movement and combat. After 12 turns, both sides total victory points, which are gained for occupying cities and for eliminating enemy units (depending on the scenario).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 30 copies of this game were produced, by BTR Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source: designer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
