			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things have gotten hot in Wellstone, maybe a little too hot.  The best thing you can do is lay low, especially after that whole hotel fiasco.  Then this job just lands in your lap.  It's perfect:  it's in Mexico, it's dealing with Wellstone City scumbags, and it's working with a high-level security company with few real ties to the City.  As a matter of fact, it's almost too perfect...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is the sixth adventure of the Wellstone City Chronicles for the Wellstone City setting.  This Savage adventure is 15 pages that takes the PCs out of their normal playground and sets them loose on some biker scumbags that the world would be better off without.  They will be working with a highly trained organization on a direct hit on a fortified ranch 50 miles of the border.  Oh.  And they have an Apache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is geared for 3 to 4 PCs and suggestions are given in the book to help ramp up the difficulty for either advanced characters or more players.  It can be used in conjuction with the other Wellstone City Chronicles, and it can be used in any order with them.  Grab this sixth installment of the Wellstone City modern urban adventure arc today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A new security company that can be used in the future by GMs and Players alike&lt;br/&gt;     Maps detailing the locations, with expanded maps provided by Fabled Environments!&lt;br/&gt;     More connections in Wellstone&lt;br/&gt;     More fame and reputation to be gained as Freelancers instead of tying the PCs down to one of the crime syndicates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
