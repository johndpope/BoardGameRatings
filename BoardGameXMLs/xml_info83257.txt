			<description>Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BECOME THE LEADER OF THE KISS ARMY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow KISS on tour and travel the world collecting merchandise, albums and programs.  You&amp;rsquo;ll even start your own KISS tribute band!  Do you have what it takes to become the leader of the KISS&amp;reg; Army?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel to the different zones on the game board (each zone represents one particular aspect of being a KISS Army member). Collect KISS cards by landing on the &amp;quot;DEMON&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;STARCHILD&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;CATMAN&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;SPACEMAN&amp;quot; spaces. Once you have collected the required KISS cards for a zone, you redeem them for a KISS Army card. Once you collect all 4 KISS Army cards (1 in each zone) you have become the leader of the KISS Army and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
