			<description>Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is a video game based on the Nickelodeon film of the same name. It was featured in a two-pack with Rocket Power: Extreme Arcade Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the 2001 Oscar-nominated computer animated film, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius is a 3D adventure starring the titular whiz kid Jimmy Neutron and his robotic canine Goddard. The evil King Goobot has abducted Jimmy's parents and friends, so the youngster must begin an intergalactic quest to save them. While progressing through various locales inspired by the movie, players will need to solve puzzles using an assortment of gadgets invented by the boy genius himself. Also included are various mini-games to play within an amusement park, as well as hidden movie clips, character bios, and movie trailers to be unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played from a traditional third-person perspective, the game consists of five distinct regions linked together by a main hub. Once players decide on a region, they can enter a portal and then be whisked away to a 3D world. Among the environments players will explore are Jimmy's House, an Asteroid Surface, an Asteroid Interior, Yolkus Prime, and Retroland Amusement Park. Each region spans multiple levels, with the goal in each being to find a number of key items and special prizes and a shrunken head. A secondary goal in some levels is to locate friends Carl Wheezer, Cindy Vortex, Rose, Nissa, and Zachary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies trying to prevent Jimmy from succeeding include giant ants and the blob-like Yokians, with villains Ooblar, Poultra, and King Goobot forming the boss encounters. Jimmy Neutron is not helpless in his first GameCube adventure, so players can run, jump, kick, and use an assortment of inventions. Health can be replenished by finding slices of blueberry pie, extra lives are awarded for every ten neutrons found, and weapons include the Shrink Ray, Inflato Ray, and the Jimmy Bat. Three types of vehicles can also be used to traverse the levels, the Goddard Pogo, the Goddard Sled, and the Goddard Scooter, all courtesy of Jimmy's loyal sidekick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
