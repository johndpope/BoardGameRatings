			<description>Party game.&lt;br/&gt;The host places syllables all round the room. Players are instructed to find three syllables that make up the name of a British town; e.g. Ed-in-burgh. There are 33 towns listed on the host's Key Card, all made up of three syllables.&lt;br/&gt;If you can make a town out of the syllables, you take it to the host who records you with 1 success and he will put the cards back in the box. Then the successful player goes back to the room to see if he can find another town.&lt;br/&gt;After an agreed time, the player who found the most, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
