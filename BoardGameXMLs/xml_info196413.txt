Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A retro jRPG by Zeboyd Games -- creators of Cthulhu Saves the World, Penny Arcade 3, and Molly the Were-Zompire. Cosmic Star Heroine is a 16-bit-SNES-homage jRPG, in the style of Chrono Trigger. The protagonist, Alyssa L'Salle, is a superspy who has party members to help her save the planet as she navigates a sci-fi world with skills, crafting, turn-based combat, and all the sorts of stuff you'd expect from a game that wants to be a modern Chrono Trigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
