							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hannibal Island</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Hannibal Island, the perfect secret getaway resort for every over-privileged upstart that has access to Daddy's bank account, some lotion and Dr. McRaph's private number.  Maybe it's your first time in this tropical paradise. Perhaps you are a veteran of the sun and sea, either way none of you expected to be trapped here.  Dr. McRaph's keys have been stolen, the food supply is dwindling and if you don't get off the island in a few days everyone is going to starve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the key held tight in their grasp, the guilty party watches everyone descend into fits of rage and paranoia.  This is the moment they have been waiting for, a chance to break the taboo without a single witness left to tell the tale.  It is now time for the meat feast!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hannibal Island everyone adopts the secret role of a over-privileged holiday goer or perhaps Dr. McRaph himself.  One player is dealt the role of the Cannibal  it is their aim to murder/eat everyone on the island, while it is everyone else&amp;rsquo;s aim to survive and lynch the cannibal before he/she eats them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannibal Island is a Mafia/Werewolf variant.  Unlike Mafia, the Cannibal does not have to kill every turn and the time limit is set by the dwindling food supply.  Each character has an appetite (how much food they need in a day) and a health value (how many days they can not meet their appetite value before dying) Once players get used to the game extra cards/roles can be added to vary the game play and add more strategy, victory conditions and most importantly fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to work with up to seven players without a moderator or judge, if you have an honest gaming group. With more players the game still requires a judge to assist with the flow of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
