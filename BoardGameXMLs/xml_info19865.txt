							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mitchell: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The adventures of a boozy, puffy-faced detective...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your hearts will pound and your veins will clog when you and your friends play Mitchell: The Card Game! It's fun, easy to learn and as fast-paced as Joe Don Baker himself. Each player becomes one of Mitchell's suspects and tries to keep Mitchell the hell away. Will Mitchell's tireless technique and bottomless hunger find you guilty? Or will you be fortunate enough to fly under his immense, sloppy radar? Only clever card play and a sense of humor will keep you safe... from Mitchell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell: The Card Game features full color cards with images and quotes taken directly from the &amp;quot;Mitchell&amp;quot; episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. A complete set consists of 118 cards, although many are duplicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
