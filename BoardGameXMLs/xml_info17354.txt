							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fanhunter Freak Trivia</name>
									
			<description>It's a Trivia game with geek categories. The questions are about five categories: Cinema, TV, Comics, Games and Fantasy/Ci-Fi Literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move around a round board answering geek questions and when they have answered on &amp;quot;Big Question&amp;quot; in each category they proceed to the inner board, where they advance without rolling dice, one space per turn, answering one question for turn. if they keep answering they proceed to the next space. When they get the final space, they have to answer a question of a category chosen for the other players before seeing the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a very humoristic look and the rulebook is also written in a humorous way (they provide some rules for playing with teams to a maximum of 25 players, and some rules also to play while drinking).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
