			<description>As it enters the tournament rotation, the ISB Headquarters Skirmish Map brings all the excitement and danger of secret reconnaissance to your tabletop along with the twisting, foreboding passageways that riddle the headquarters of the Imperial Security Bureau. Measuring 26&amp;rdquo; by 26&amp;rdquo;, this Skirmish Map features all of the rooms and hallways of the skirmish mission printed directly onto the mat so setup never takes more than seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With plenty of room along the outside borders of the playmat to place your Deployment cards and tokens and easy references for each team&amp;rsquo;s setup zones, this Skirmish Map offers you and your opponent the definitive Imperial Assault skirmish experience. You&amp;rsquo;ll even find additional copies of the ISB Headquarters Skirmish cards included with the playmat, giving you easy access to everything you need to give your strike team the green light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this Skirmish Map features thrilling artwork drawn straight from the Star Wars universe, bringing both you and your opponent deeper into the narrative of the game. On one side, you&amp;rsquo;ll see Davith Elso, a Force user skilled in the arts of deception and stealth. On the opposing side of the playmat, you&amp;rsquo;ll find Bossk, a deadly bounty hunter who&amp;rsquo;s well known for successfully capturing his prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
