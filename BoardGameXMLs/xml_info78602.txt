			<description>Source: Boardgamegeek.&lt;br/&gt;Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manual&lt;br/&gt;- Play solitaire versus the computer or with friends on the same computer.&lt;br/&gt;- Double or triple your score by filling in the most strategic box on the scorecard.&lt;br/&gt;- Use your 'power-ups' wisely and attain the level of Grandmaster. Power-ups can be used once during the game and can help you win or hinder your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerups: Helping Hand, Protection, Lucky Roll, Another Turn, Bad Luck, Massive Bad Luck, Score Blocker and Massive Score Blocker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
