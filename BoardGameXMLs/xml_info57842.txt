			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pestilence and plague... twin beasts that even the most stalwart adventurer fears... Plague threatens the river village of Bhorr's Bend, deep in the forests north of the City-State of Shyff. Dark secrets lie hidden within the doomed village; can the truth cleanse the folk of their dire disease? Can the characters stop the spread of the Plague before the Prince of Pestilence stalks the Sovereign Lands?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for use with four to six characters of 3rd through 5th level, though it can easily be adapted for use with any mid-level to high-level adventuring group. New and complete rules for running diseases in fantasy settings are provided, including descriptions of more than half a dozen new fantasy diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Night of the Rotlord  Kalamar Quest adventure and supplement is designed to provide both a challenging adventure and useful supplementary campaign material. The material within is set in the popular Kingdoms of Kalamar fantasy campaign setting but can easily be used with any fantasy role-playing game setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game adventure and supplement is suitable for use with any fantasy role-playing system, including but not limited to Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, Rolemaster and HackMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
