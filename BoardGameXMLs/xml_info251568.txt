							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One-Minute Washita River: Custer faces defeat and disaster in 1868</name>
									
			<description>The battle of the Washita River in 1868 is one of the most confusing and misunderstood engagements in the history of the United States military. This year will mark the 150th anniversary of these events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Armstrong Custer led the 7th Cavalry in a dawn attack on what he thought was a single tribal village. It was discovered that Custer had struck one of several Native American camps along the river; now the Gallant Seventh faced hundreds of Arapaho, Kiowa, and Cheyenne warriors. Custer barely avoided encirclement as the Indians moved forward in an attempt to defeat the soldiers and complete the disaster by seizing the regiment's supply column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One-Minute Washita River is a microgame attempting to portray the battle with a small map and a limited number of counters. This game is a solitaire challenge. The entire battle can be completed in a minute or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player represents the tribal leaders. Groups of Native American fighting men pour out of their villages to block the advance of the cavalry. Rules cover historical elements like the protection (or possible rescue) of tribal noncombatants, the importance of &amp;quot;counting coup&amp;quot; within the tribal military structure, and the danger of reckless action in the face of an unpredictable enemy. Victory is determined by the safety of the noncombatants, the losses suffered by the Indians, and the damage inflicted on Custer's regiment. The playing pieces for the 7th Cavalry represent units the size of a battalion or a company. The supply column is also depicted. The maneuvers of these army formations are controlled by the game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a companion title in the previously released One-Minute game series that included Waterloo, the Little Bighorn, and the 1967 campaign of Che Guevara in Bolivia. It is a free Print &amp;amp; Play game with a single 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; map, charts, rules, and about two dozen playing pieces or markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
