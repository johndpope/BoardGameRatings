			<description>Within the time limit, recreate the funny faces shown on screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll up, roll up come and see the funny faces. Weird ones, ugly ones all from very strange places. &amp;quot;Hey mum, look at this, looks like dad when he hasn't shaved.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Good grief&amp;quot;, remarks dad, &amp;quot;there's Auntie Maud. And isn't that your mother when she trod on the cat?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Careful dear, I could soon point you out after one of your office parties.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for the family, monstrously funny. A Chamber of Horrors to laugh at. Be sure to watch in the safety of your living room. See these 'munsters' or play the game to try and remember and recreate them. But do not go to your local police station and give a description, they just will not believe you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
