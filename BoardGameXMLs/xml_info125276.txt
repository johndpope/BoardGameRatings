			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shards of the Shattered Universe (SSU or Shards) is an original role playing game from Dreamer's Guild Games (DGG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why should you play Shards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Shards of the Shattered Universe Core Rule Book you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One set of comprehensive rules that seamlessly covers any genre, from pre-historic, through western, horror, modern, cyberpunk, fantasy, to science fiction, or anything else in between!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An open and flexible character system, based on attributes, proficiencies, skills, and perks, without leading your character down predefined class tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast and highly dynamic challenge resolution system, where a single roll of the dice determines all aspects of success or failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card-based tactical combat resolution system, where skillful play of attack and defense cards, along with a healthy dose of bluffing and luck of the dice shape the outcome of battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique magic system that is based on the opposing forces of mythos and spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completely original and fully developed worlds (Shards)! Yeah, for our fantasy setting (to be released as our first expansion)&amp;quot;Taramythica&amp;quot;, we kicked out the tired old &amp;ldquo;been there, done that&amp;rdquo; grumpy dwarves, needy halflings, and annoyingly perfect elves, and gave their lands to the powerful yet stoic Korgs, elusive and feral Fianna, noble but cruel Ellani!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other original Shards currently in development will include &amp;quot;Terra Prime&amp;quot;: a post-modern world in which shadow factions vie for control of earth's resources, population, and political power (it may sound like that other &amp;quot;Shadow... setting&amp;quot;, but ours is fresh and new); and &amp;quot;Taragalactica&amp;quot;: a fully developed galactic-wide science fiction setting, where earth is but a vassal world under the yoke of one of several expansive interstellar empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
