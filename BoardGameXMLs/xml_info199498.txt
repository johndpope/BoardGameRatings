			<description>Atomic Power, Epic Danger!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiation can be scary. You can't see it, smell it, or fight it by any conventional means, but it can be deadly just the same. GURPS Disasters: Meltdown and Fallout helps you bring this invisible threat to your gaming table, and gives adventurers the tools they need to deal with it. Inside this volume, you'll discover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most common types of modern nuclear reactors, plus a few theoretical ones. Learn about reactors' core functionality, fuel sources, durability, security measures, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primer on radiation, including sources and ways to measure it, game effects, updated Protection Factors for various materials, equipment for dealing with radioactive issues (with revised GURPS game mechanics), and a few crazy ways people have used radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens during, immediately after, and long after a meltdown, both in terms of scene-setting descriptions and nitty-gritty game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perks, quirks, disadvantages, and skills that normal humans might have, plus radiation-related advantages for exotic beings. Use the provided suggestions to atomically alter people for cinematic action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ways to use nuclear power in modern, historical, magical, and futuristic campaigns, plus suggested power-plant complications, adventure seeds, and campaign ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bibliography of books, films, and GURPS supplements to inspire you, from factual accounts to wild speculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're looking for realistic dangers for near-modern adventurers, cinematic set pieces for modern-day GURPS Action heroes, or apocalyptic possibilities to kickstart a GURPS After the End campaign, Disasters: Meltdown and Fallout is an inexhaustible radioactive sourcebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
