							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Judge</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My judgement is absolute, and it will be served&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As battle becomes inevitable, the mighty steel-clad behemoth lays down the law, and through magics older than time, justice is enforced upon even the most lawless of lands. Their weapon empowered by the very elements, their tongue weaving ancient arts of pure righteousness, the Judge wades in, ready to protect the most sacred of forces - Justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Judge is a new complete character sheet for use with Dungeon World. With the ability to declare the rules of battle, enforce contracts with their magical seals and weave laws from the air around them, they're also a formidable wall for their party, their mighty shield and immense elemental weapon warding off foes and providing respite for their allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
