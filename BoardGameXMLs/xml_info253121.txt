			<description>Tactical trading and travel game for 2 to 6 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each receives a colored ship owner (character) and the appropriate charge! The locomotion occurs with a W6 in five trades.&lt;br/&gt;The shipowner can buy ships in cash or on credit on his train, the ship arrives at the home port of the corresponding area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various instructions on &amp;quot;telex&amp;quot; cards, which means: &amp;quot;travel&amp;quot; the voyages from port to port and &amp;quot;round trips&amp;quot; the voyages from the home port to a destination port and back to the home port.&lt;br/&gt;Only fully loaded ships can travel, if they are not fully loaded, they will cost you a &amp;quot;mooring fee&amp;quot; every time the player rolls a dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have his charge (you get this in certain fields of the orbit!) Completely, then the color chips are turned with the closed side up.&lt;br/&gt;The shipowner and all his loaded ships move forward after rolling the dice with the thrown number on all their ways.&lt;br/&gt;Ships can be bought or sold in their home port, and the area of use can also be changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A charter ship and the possible meetings of the ships in the same fields bring some additional options in the game.&lt;br/&gt;You agree on the end of the game at a certain time, who then has the highest total amount wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
