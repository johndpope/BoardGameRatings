			<description>In times before the Fackler-Games this must be the most expensive game edition.&lt;br/&gt;It was a personal dream of the author to become true, 1000 were intended to be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of: 1 three-dimensional wooden board, measuring approx. 1 yard square, 62 cherries in 3 colours (1 inch diameter) 62 leaves in 3 colours, 15 bonus-cherries, 42 point-allowance-pawns and 4 coloured birds on trees as playing pawns, all made of wood too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name of the game means &amp;quot;Royal Cherry&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After setting up the game with the beautiful components mentioned above players start to move their birds in the centre field measuring 7 x 6 squares, containing the point-allowance-pawns depicting leaves and cherries in alternate appearance.&lt;br/&gt;The number depicted is the maximum you can harvest from a certain tree (cherries or leaves).&lt;br/&gt;After your move the bird sits in the hole left by the pawn. Next time your move has to start from there, such restricting your further moves.&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to go for the bonus cherries counting points at the end.&lt;br/&gt;You can earn them being the LAST one harvesting a tree or by being the one with the most cherries and leaves harvested from a certain tree.&lt;br/&gt;As the trees have three different sizes, there are different amounts of bonus cherries to gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a game for children, you have to twist your brain for the best moves !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
