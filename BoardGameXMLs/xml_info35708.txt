			<description>The player to complete the most epidemics before a Global Containment card is played wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epidemics are completed by linking 5 infection cards together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: The player to complete the most epidemics before a Global Containment card is played wins the&lt;br/&gt;game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set-Up: each player draws 5 cards and the play begins with the oldest player going first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-Play: Play (1) Infection Card unless another card allows you to play another Infection Card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Example: an Outbreak card allows a second card to be played). Then play one Action Card. At the end of your turn, draw enough cards to fill your hand up to (5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infection Cards: are a person, place, or thing that spreads the epidemic. Each Infection Card has two symbols. An Epidemic grows as cards are placed adjacent to the initial Infection card. Cards can only be placed adjacent to another card if the symbol in the corner facing that card matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: A Rock Star card has the LIPS symbol in both corners. The Big Bear Biker card has LIPS in the lower right corner, so it can be placed on the left-hand side so that the LIPS symbols touch, thereby spreading the infection and growing the epidemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outbreak Cards: are wild cards that allow an additional card to be played. The Outbreak Card DOES NOT count toward the (5) cards needed to complete and Epidemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Cards: are objects or items that either: (1) stop or slow an Epidemic by blocking or killing an infection. (2) enhance or accelerate an Epidemic by making the infection immune to the effects of a block&lt;br/&gt;or kill card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Block Cards: block one side of an Epidemic. If both sides are blocked, the Epidemic is contained, then discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germ War Cards: weaponize a virus making it able to spread on any edge of the Germ War card. The Germ War Card DOES NOT count toward the (5) cards needed to complete and Epidemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Action Cards: are objects or viruses that can be played on anyone&amp;rsquo;s turn. They include the Frysol and Super Germ card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frysol Cards: kill one infection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Germ Cards: nullify the effects of Frysol&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global Containment: ends the game. Note: Can only be played after (3) Epidemics are completed by any (1) player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vapor Bomb: Destroys all Epidemics IN PLAY. Completed Epidemics are NOT destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
