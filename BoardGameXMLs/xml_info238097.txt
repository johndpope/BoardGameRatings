			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game is set in the village of Efurllung of the Barony of Wormwood, lead by the knight Sir Rickard, under Emil Brookfield, inside the County of Worms. This is the eastern, darker, more sinister half of the Border Kingdoms. Players will play Peasants, Bandits, or Faerie...Spell casting will be considered highly suspicious, so there will be a very small number of spell casters in the game, and those that play them will have to play them with great care and awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is unusual in two major respects.  First, character building is involved and more-closely resembles traditional tabletop character creation than &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; LARP character creation.  Second, combat is quite deadly and character death is possibly if not probable.  The game is credited only to &amp;quot;Tim&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chris&amp;quot;, in the document meta-data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
