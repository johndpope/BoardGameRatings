			<description>There are tiles with clouds in the shape of animals, and matching tiles with pictures of those animals. The cloud tiles are placed face down on the game board (&amp;quot;sky&amp;quot;), from the stack of animals, two tiles are flipped open. The player whose turn it is, flips one of the cloud tiles. If it is one of the open animals, he or she will get the animal tile as a point and the cloud remains open for the remainder of the game. If it isn't, it's the next player's turn. But after each move, a player may also move one open cloud tile one square to the right, even on top of other tiles, which then cannot be opened until the wind moves to card on top of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
