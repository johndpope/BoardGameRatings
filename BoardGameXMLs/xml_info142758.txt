							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill The Kings</name>
									
			<description>Solitaire card game, played with a standard 52 card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Kill All 4 Kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Put 4 kings face up on the table; shuffle the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Play begins when you draw the top card from the top of the deck.  You may then place that card beneath a king or place it in reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have 4 reserve spots which any card can be placed in (like freecell).  For each king you kill, you gain another additional reserve spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In future turns, you can either play a card from reserve, or from the top of the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a card is played below a king (or the bottom-most card below the king), it must be either opposite color and lower, same suit and lower, or same value as the card above it (aces are low).  Once a card is played below a king, it cannot be moved into Reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
