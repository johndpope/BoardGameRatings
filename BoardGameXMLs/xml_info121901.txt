			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn-based puzzle game in which the player moves a character on a square grid. The character starts on one end of the grid and must reach the opposit end. Each turn, the game rolls two six-sided dice, and the character can move twice, in any orthogonal direction, the number of squares indicated by the die roll (for example, if 4 and 2 come out, 4 steps to the east and 2 steps to the north). The computer controls monsters who can block the character's path but can be eliminated if the character lands on the same square as the monster. Grid size and number of monsters can be changed at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
