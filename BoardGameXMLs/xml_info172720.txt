							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends and Lies: Headlines and Hoaxes</name>
									
			<description>The world of cryptozoological creatures, strange phenomenon and mysterious locations seem hopelessly entangled with the world of the tabloid press.  This expansion introduces the tabloid headlines that can work for or against cryptozoologists' expeditions for various unknown creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion adds a third draw option to Legends and Lies which is to draw from the Tabloid Headlines which is made up of four face up cards. When cards are drawn from the headlines they are immediately replaced. At the end of each round any cards left in the headlines are added to the Tabloid pile. Headlines and Hoaxes expands Legends and Lies to up to five players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
