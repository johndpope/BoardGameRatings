			<description>From the Publisher's Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;S.E.U.I.S.?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, &amp;quot;soos,&amp;quot; as in &amp;quot;Shoot'Em Up In Space.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before our clever title gets you all excited to start a space slugfest, we'd like to tell you that this isn't just your ordinary shoot'em-up-in-space game.  First, you have to build your ships from a choice of six prototypes to form squadrons, and then make enough squadrons to form a fleet.  Second, we've put lots of planets around; some are yours and others you have to conquer.  Planets that you conquer along the way can be used to build up your reserves for reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, S.E.U.I.S.* is a game within a game.  There is the grand strategic game of fleet against fleet, with all its challenges of planning and deployment.  But when actual ship-to-ship combat occurs, we give you true arcade action that demands quick reflexes and a sharp eye to really - you guessed it - shoot'em up in space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By John Lyon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
