			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;It is 'a tactical game that plays a Formula 1 race.&lt;br/&gt;Established the grid through the roll of the dice, players take turns moving on the track, always throwing the dice.&lt;br/&gt;Overtaking is allowed only in some parts of the circuit, so if we get a greater number of who goes before us but we can not overcome it, we can accumulate the points are not used to do so later (the primordial idea of KERS!).&lt;br/&gt;Along the track there are also boxes of penalty that we are forced to miss turns, forced a pit stop etc....&lt;br/&gt;The race includes the pit stop to change tires every 3 laps.&lt;br/&gt;After the number of laps set earlier in the game (minimum 4) wins who crosses the finish line first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
