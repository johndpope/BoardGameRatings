			<description>It is a time of War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great battles rage and are being fought across all the lands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small groups of rogue soldiers, called Grunts, have broken away from the fighting having heard tales of gold, lying untouched and forgotten, around the war ravaged kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead your team into 4 fantastic locations - where only the most skilled and daring of players will achieve victory against their opponents in the quest for Fortune, Glory and Gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grunts N' Gold is a 2 - 4 player action strategy game where players roll dice and collect and use cards to move and fight there way through the battlefields to get to the Gold. Every team is made up of 4 Grunts and 1 General and the objective is to get your General and 1 of your Grunts into the Gold position and hold off your opponents for 1 turn while you seize it. Weapons can be found and used by collecting loot cards from the battlefield but this comes with the risk of springing booby traps so these must be collected with caution. Greed is bad but Gold is good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
