							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inrah</name>
									
			<description>The Inrah box contains a set of cards similar to Tarot cards. It can be used as a roleplaying supplement (to play out card reading), but also to play Boltan which is a Poker variant. Due to the different number of suits and cards in each suit, the probabilities of hands are different from Poker, so the hand ranking was adjusted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation of box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inrah - the card game from the world of The Dark Eye: 121 playing cards that can be used for the Aventurian card gambling game Boltan and also for fortune-telling. 49 &amp;quot;Great Arcana&amp;quot; show themes from Aventurian mythology, 72 cards in six suits show the houses of the elements (from Ace to Seven, Squire, Knight, Prophet, Wizard and Prince). Includes booklet with interpretation hints and layouts for card reading as well as instructions for different Boltan variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illustrations by Caryad and Mia Steingr&amp;auml;ber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
