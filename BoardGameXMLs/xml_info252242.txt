			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mox, a local shop owner has been attempting to create a new potion that will allow him to speak the name of a creature and have it appear. Unfortunately, it seems he has miscalculated yet again. Every time our addle minded alchemist opens his mouth for longer than a few seconds a random creature spews out. There is an even bigger problem&amp;hellip; he won&amp;rsquo;t shut up. He has managed to contain most of the beasts in his basement but it&amp;rsquo;s up to the PCs, who have been sent by the local adventurer's guild to clear them out and not let anything escape into the city proper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
