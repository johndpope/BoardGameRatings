			<description>All players start with an engine and a track.  Players spin for a number, take the corresponding car and place it behind their engine.  If the corresponding car is at the end of another player's train, the car is removed from the opponent's train and placed on the player's track.  The winner is the first player to get 5 cars on his track behind the engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
