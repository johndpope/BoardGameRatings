							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomodachi Maze</name>
									
			<description>Tomodachi Maze is a small, solitaire, maze game based on the Japanese Momotaro folk tale. Two double-sided cards are included as the play surface. Players start at the center of of the start card and move around the paths until they reach the edge of the card. At that point, you can do one of two things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Flip the card&lt;br/&gt;2) Explore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you do either of these things and the path does not connect, you cannot continue this way and you must go back and try a new path. Continue until you find each of Momotaro's friends and then head off to Ghost Island to finish!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
