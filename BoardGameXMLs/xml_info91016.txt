			<description>Heroes of Armarath is a Spanish game of role and adventures on board. It is possible to play in solitarily or up to with 12 players. &lt;br/&gt;In Heroes of Armarath the players choose between one of 18 heroes who come with the game base and travel across Armarath, a land of fantastic kingdoms. Barbarians, beasts, elfs and many others creatures who give own life to a world full of adventures. What it does special to this board game is that the player is advancing in the middle of a fantastic world where the events and legends are happening parallel, independently of what the player does, but simultaneously they affect the destination of the heroe. The system of game immerses us therefore in an epic history, where nobles and necromantics hit in battles that re-draw the scene, and where conspiracies and disputes between races and clans modify the balances between the good and evil constant.&lt;br/&gt;In each of the events, the players leading the Heroes of Armarath they will try of affecting the destiny of the kingdom acquiring skills, followers and equipments that improve his inventory. The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy who waits in the catacombs of the Armarath, a hard quest that demands a powerful hero.&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the Runebound play-system, but improves many aspects, like the amount of quest-cards (230), object cards (130) and game board (a detailed map of the kingdom of Armarath).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website: armarath.blogspot.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
