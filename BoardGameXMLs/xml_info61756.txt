							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classes of Legend: The Witch</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout myth, fairy tales, and even -- according to some -- real-world history, no variety of spellcaster is as prevalent as the witch. She is a mysterious evoker of strange, and usually dark, forces. Yet the witch has never had any official presence in D20 fantasy role-playing or its many and varied predecessors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lion's Den Press has got you covered. Presented in this PDF is a full 20-level witch class, complete and ready for use in any D20 fantasy game. Containing elements of both the arcane and the divine, the witch carries a unique flavor all its own, yet is fully compatible with the standard rules. We present, as well, new spells and feats, appropriate for use by witches (or those who battle them). Finally, you'll find alternate levels, abilities that you can substitute for normal advancement to focus the witch in a particular direction, and an optional rules-set that transforms the witch into a true creator of charms and talismans, one who can grant her magics to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
