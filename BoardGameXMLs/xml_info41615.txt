			<description>The deck is modeled after the traditional card deck: there are 52 cards, with the suit and rank in the corner, along with a letter and the letter's value (1 to 15, rarer letters higher).  There are also 2 &amp;quot;Intelex&amp;quot; cards which act as jokers/wild cards.  Rules for 4 games are included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Rummy: Deal 10 each for 2 players, 7 each for 3-4, 6 each for 5-6.  In a turn, a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down words, adds letters to others' words, and discards 1.  The player who goes out scores the total of the letters' values in front of him; the others subtract the values of letters still in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Hangman for 4 players.  Deal out the whole deck (without the Intelex cards).  Each player makes a word out of his cards and lays them face down in a row, with his word spelled in order among them.  In a turn, a player repeatedly asks 1 other player if they have a specific letter; if they do, they expose all copies of that letter they have.  The turn ends when a request fails.  During a turn one may also guess what a word is: if wrong, he loses 5 point; if right, he gets the word's score and the guess-ee is out for the hand, which ends when all words are discovered.  One may bluff and have no word; if that is correctly the guesser gets 20 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire: Like Klondike.  Deal out 7 stacks of cards, of heights 1, 2 ... 7, the top card of each face up.  Move cards around to form words and word fragments, removing words as they are formed, exposing face-down cards as revealed, filling blank spots with letters or fragments.  Then go through the deck 3 cards at a time, combining letters as before.  The goal is to use up the whole deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poker: For 2 to 7.  Deal 5 per player.  Each in turn may exchange any or all of their cards for an equal number from the deck, and make their best word.  Highest-scoring word wins.  (Betting and bluffing are mentioned as on option &amp;quot;for added excitement&amp;quot;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
