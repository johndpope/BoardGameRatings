							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Random Armor Generator</name>
									
			<description>Random Armor Generator is a 10 - 30 minute card game in which players pass their hands of cards after selecting one to play to assemble the toughest armor to survive the tournament! Each player begins with 6 cards consisting of armor pieces and weapons that are played one at a time in front of the player, then the rest of the hand is passed either clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on game round) until all but 2 cards have been played. Then each player has the opportunity to swap out one piece of their assembled armor for what remains in the hand they are passed to complete their set. The remaining cards are discarded and everyone compares armor values, which are increased or decreased by certain affects on each card. The player with the highest value wins, simply because they can take more of a beating than the others. Cards are then shuffled and dealt for another round. Play as many rounds as you like, but we recommend 1 round per player +1 round, best out of that number wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
