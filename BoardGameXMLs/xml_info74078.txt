			<description>[From the game box]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You are Hans the Handyman and your job is to clear up all the boxes from the different levels by walking along and climbing up and down the ladders. You don't have to go all the way up or down a ladder, you can get off at any level along it. Pick up the boxes just by walking over them and score points for each one you pick up. Unfortunately for you, the boxes are being guarded by the dreaded Bonzos, who patrol the levels. If a Bonzo cataches you, you'll get splatted! If you are very clever and manage to pick up all the boxes, then you'll go on to the next screen where the boxes are worth more points, but there is an extra Bonzo! Keep going and try to get as many points as you can before you run out of lives. If you get one of the highest scores, you can enter your name into the rankings by typing in the letters and pressing RETURN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck - and beware of the Bonzos!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
