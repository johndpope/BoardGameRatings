							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game on Total Defence</name>
									
			<description>This Singaporean game is intended to be a 'fun way of learning total defence'. It is a simple roll-and-move game in which players move their counter around a track on the board and follow instructions based on the squares they land on. The objective of the game is to obtain one tag in each of the five components of total defence:&lt;br/&gt;Civil Defence&lt;br/&gt;Economic Defence&lt;br/&gt;Psychological Defence&lt;br/&gt;Social Defence&lt;br/&gt;Military Defence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are used as currency in this game. Most of the squares give you more points or the option to buy a total defence tag at 15 points each. In addition there are bonus cards which give you goodies like more points or actions to take(e.g. moving your piece forward a certain number of steps). It's not all sweetness and light though - there are not enough total defence tags available for each player to have a full set and players can go on 'Power Hunts' which allow them to 'hunt' (steal being possibly too strong a word to feature in the game) a total defence tag from another player. Players might also have the misfortune to land on a 'Risk' square, which forces them to travel on an inner track where they might possibly land on squares that make them lose points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game states it is for players aged 10 years to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
