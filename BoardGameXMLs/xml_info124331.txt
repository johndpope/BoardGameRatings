			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the doors of Dani's Emporium found in that beautiful cradle of civilization, Brian's Wing. Within our shelves you&amp;rsquo;ll find all manner of Exotic, Unique and dare I say, Strange, oddities from across the far oceans and even your own back yard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located between Andre's Wax &amp;amp; Oil and Old World Clothier on Seaview Lane, Dani's was opened by her father, Ruppert, in 1881. Ruppert was one of the original porter/guards with the Brian Expedition and was credited with killing the famed &amp;ldquo;black-toothed terror&amp;rdquo; that ravaged the area in the early days of the settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
