			<description>One of the games playable with the Katarenga board and pieces is Battle Stations. This game is invented by the author of Katarenga himself. &lt;br/&gt;In this game you start with an empty board. It consists of two phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stations - You each in turn place a pawn anywhere on the board. &lt;br/&gt;The battle - With all 16 pawns in place, you each in turn capture an opposing pawn following the normal rules of movement in Katarenga. If you can capture you must. If there are multiple capture possibilities, you can choose. If you can't capture, you must pass. You keep on passing until either you can capture again or both players have to pass. &lt;br/&gt;The game is won by whoever has the most pawns left on the board or, in case of a tie, by the second player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest to score one point per remaining pawn followed by the switching of the first player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
