			<description>The best drinking game ever is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt; No swearing, no pointing and no toilet breaks. Respect these 3 laws or you will have to... drink. So keep an eye on your opponents and fill glasses, rise to the tasks (speed, sequences of numbers, general knowledge...). But don&amp;rsquo;t forget the law!&lt;br/&gt; Happy Hour, the game where everyone loses but wants to play again!&lt;br/&gt; This game is for players 18 and over. You are responsible for your own actions and decisions. This game is not intended to be played with alcoholic drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
