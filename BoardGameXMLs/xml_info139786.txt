			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to TGI's The Iron Gauntlet! This is a supplement for use with Hazard Studios' and Zenith Comics' Supers! The Comic Book Role Playing Game, a rules-lite superhero RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Iron Gauntlet: Stats and detailed origins for supervillains The Grey Ghoul, Iron Maiden, Manite, Mammoth, The Sire, and Skana.  Each is the arch-enemy of one of the characters appearing in our previous publication, The Freedom Ring, but each stands on his own as a challenge to your own player character superheroes.&lt;br/&gt;     Violet Revolution!: Full stats and a detailed origin for this super-spinning menace, who serves as a teaser for our next planned project - The Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;     The SUPERVERSE: Yet more seeds of a broader universe to be developed through our on-going line of products.&lt;br/&gt;     Art: Character portraits for each member of the The Iron Gauntlet and Violet Revolution, along with a small art gallery and character standees - all done by our spectacular artist, Russell Boyd.&lt;br/&gt;     Optional Rules for SUPERS!: New optional benchmark rules, along with new Powers, Boosts, and Ads for use in your SUPERS! games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
