			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the digital early access edition of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you purchase this product, you'll receive a PDF of the game in progress as well as every update of the PDF, including the final, complete version of the game. The current version 1.0 is very new! The Early Access version is being provided for fans and early adopters who want to try it before the final version is released in the coming months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Band of Blades is a dark military fantasy game&amp;mdash;forged in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game about the remnants of a mercenary band named the Legion, retreating from a failed offensive and armies of undead. The Cinder King's generals (called the Broken) give chase across the nation of Aldermark and our Legionnaires fight fresh horrors every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are offensives, maneuvers, unwise bargains, desperate gambits, horrifying costs, and the ever-ticking clock as the Legion attempts to make it to Skydagger Keep before the pass is cut off, or the undead slip by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We play to find out if our Legion can outwit, outrun, and outlast the endless hordes of undead while rationing dwindling supplies, risking daring operations, and whether they will make a difference in the outcome of this war. Gameplay focuses on military operations called missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A session of play usually consists of a primary and secondary mission, followed by campaign actions for the Legion and their generals. In Band of Blades, each player takes on two roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is the role of a general of the Legion, either Commanding the Legion to follow specific routes, Marshaling the troops to perform missions, Quartermastering the precious resources of the army, Spymastering the intel gathered in the field, or Lorekeeping the histories of the Legion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second is the role of a rookie, soldier or specialist on one of the missions the Commander picks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forward march, soldier. The Kingdoms of the East are depending on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Early Access edition is a work-in-progress.  Currently, it is distributed as a PDF guidebook with a separate PDF playbook (in color or black-and-white).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
