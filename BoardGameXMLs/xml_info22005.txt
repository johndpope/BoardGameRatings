							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pentagon: The Marble Game of the 70&#039;s</name>
									
			<description>Players set their marbles up on the interior or exterior pentagon.  From there, you attempt to move one at a time taking turns to get to the person's other pentagon (e.g. interior tries to get to the exterior).  You can jump when you are next to another's marble and capture it.  First one to get all their remaining marbles to the inside wins as long as he has as many marbles the other person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nice wooden board and marbles for bits...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
