							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Druhlstone</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standing over the body of Dannam Tull you grieve for the old scholar's demise. Respected by all the Brethren you know that his body should be returned to Das Vallendor, but Tull himself has given you reason to delay his return. In your hand you have a map, and its hand-drawn scratchings give hint to the location of a Druhlstone. Such a prize cannot be ignored. As your torch throws jagged shadows upon the stone walls you try and remember all you have been taught about the curious nature of that elusive talisman. Indeed Druhl were only a myth to the Guild, a magical construct made from the skeleton of a long-dead Dragon and given purpose by a glowing blue gem at its heart. It is rumoured that the gem itself was the desiccated essence of a living Dragon, concentrated in its heart and then petrified by long years below ground. You know that such a prize is worth the risk, and that the chance of finding one worth the delay. Quickly you take Tull's pack and pull from its interior three fresh torches and six standard ration packs. These you take with you before surveying the rockfall that killed the old scholar. At its upper edges you find a shallow opening, one that leads to a long tunnel beyond. This is the way you must go and without hesitation you climb up the rockfall and into the narrow gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
