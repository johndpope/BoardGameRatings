							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Helicopter Race Game</name>
									
			<description>This game by Warren Paper Products Company was released sometime in the 50's and was capitalizing on children's fascination with a relatively new mode of transportation - the helicopter.  The players race along a track spanning a map of the US, starting in California, hitting the Atlantic seaboard, and then racing back to California for the exciting finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is controlled with a spinner.  Pieces include a game board, 4 tokens of different colors that look like a head and shoulders, a spinner, a card board holder for the bits, and the box top and bottom.  Instructions for the game are on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
