			<description>3 to 8 persons can play Pool, a game above consumption and how you can make the most with your money.&lt;br/&gt;You have three different lines around the board. J is the Junggeselle (unmarried man), P is partnership (family) and W is a Wohngemeinschaft (apartment-sharing community). You play the J-line alone, the P-line with another player together, the W-Line with two other players together. Every move must be with one consent, otherwise you have to pay 100 money to the bank.&lt;br/&gt;You start at Friday, the game takes 7 days with 6 sections every day. On the board are chance fields and chance cards. Something you can do alone, other decision you can only do with other players together. In this way you increase or losing your money and the player wins with the biggest money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
