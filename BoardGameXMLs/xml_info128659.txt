			<description>Based on the popular Japanese game show, TORE! is a game where 2 to 4 players compete against each other in challenges and quizzes to try to earn the most golden Pharaoh Statues and win the game.  The expansive board is built up as a three-dimensional play space representing the various chambers of the cursed temple from the TV show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this board game version, the players move together through five of the popular rooms of the TORE! Temple.  First they try to avoid being eaten by the stone monster in the &amp;quot;Stone Idol Chamber&amp;quot; then they must race to avoid being crushed by the closing walls in the &amp;quot;Wall Chamber&amp;quot;.  After that, their task is to not get wrapped up in the &amp;quot;Mummy Chamber&amp;quot; before next trying to escape from the &amp;quot;Floor Chamber&amp;quot; where the ground slowly rises until the hapless player slides off to the their doom.  Finally, in the &amp;quot;Cliff Chamber&amp;quot;, the players must use their wits as they are quizzed one-by-one while portions of the walls begin to protrude, threatening to push them over into the bottomless abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interspersed between these five rooms are additional challenges including quizzes, gambling to win more Golden Pharaohs, and even the ultra-popular &amp;quot;Spring of the Goddess&amp;quot; metal-ball challenge of trying to control and drop a ball into a goal using two ramp-like bars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TORE! is a game of both chance and skill as your brain and ability to stay cool under pressure will help you as much as a lucky die roll. All the while the game maintains the same light-hearted humor from the TV show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game rules (translated):&lt;br/&gt;This game is a three-dimensional board game of trying to find the &amp;quot;Golden Pharaoh Statues&amp;quot; hidden in the cursed temple! Try to escape from the Pharaoh's many challenges while collecting more Pharaoh Statues than your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
