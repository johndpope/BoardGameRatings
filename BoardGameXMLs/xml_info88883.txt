			<description>Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You used to think it would never catch up to you. All your friends who...      passed on (strange how you keep using these euphemisms, even after all this    time)... were swingers, playboys, high rollers. They lived on the fast side of life, and probably thought it would never catch up to them, either. But when   the endless round of parties and social life and high stakes finally paled,    they began to drop off, one by one. Some fell quicker then others, some hung onuntil the bitter end - or what seemed to them like the bitter end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first you felt superior to them - after all, it would never catch up to you. You're not sure when you first started to envy them. Hell, you're not even sureif you do envy most of them. But you know you envy Jon. That feeling comes to  you, clear for the first time, as you sit in the narrow pew, ignoring the      preacher and concentrating on the man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The End                                                                     &lt;br/&gt;Copyright (c) 1996 by Joe Mason.                                               &lt;br/&gt;Release 1 / Serial number 961010 / Inform v1502 Library 5/12   &lt;br/&gt;IF Comp 1996: 15th place of 27 entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
