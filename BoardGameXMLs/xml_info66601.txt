			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When trapped in the dankest corners of a forsaken dungeon, there may be little left to do but pray . . . but for a special class of hero, prayer is enough. Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics covers the powers and possibilities of those who find strength in faith. All manner of religious servants in a Dungeon Fantasy game will find this material beneficial. Included in this supplement are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Detailed descriptions of 15 types of gods, each with special powers they grant to their devotees. Discover the might of death gods, sun gods, and gods of the hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Lenses and spell lists for each type of god, useful for creating clerics, druids, and holy warriors ready to advance their causes. You can even create practitioners of evil faiths . . .&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Sacred artifacts of interest to spiritual-minded dungeon-dwellers, such as holy-symbol weapons, holy water, relics, and more. Learn details of the sacred scalpel or the staff of earthquakes!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;A discussion of morality, spirits, and church hierarchies especially as they apply to a Dungeon Fantasy sensibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're a flamethrower-wielding holy warrior of fire, a druid of a storm god, or a cleric tied to a city, you're certain to find something in Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics that makes you a paragon of power. Pray to the deities then prey on your enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
