			<description>The game consists in collecting and bringing to the holes food which is found in the apartment. To do this, the players move the playing pieces the number of spaces as rolled on the die. Players can move on any route, but in a single turn can only move in one direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is that the player would get the most amount of points. For the points to be valid, the player needs to get to the space where there is pictured a little paw, next to the space where there is food. He takes the piece from the game board and starts on the way back. If the player safely succeeds to return to the hole, he keeps the piece and can leave for the next one. Depending on where the food piece was on the board, it can have various amounts of points (the amount of points is given on each piece next to the picture with the food). Three pieces (with the navy blue background) have the greatest punctual value (6 points), but when carrying it, the player moves one space less then what was rolled on the die. The collected points are added together. The game ends after a player gets the amount of points that was determined upon earlier, or after there are no more food pieces on the game board (the total amounts to 72 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
