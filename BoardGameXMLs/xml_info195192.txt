			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice is a game of story telling, role playing, decision making, and resource management. When you play Ice, no matter your role in the game, your job is to entertain your fellows. Remember this. It will improve your gaming experience. In a game of Ice, one player is the referee and has a number of special duties. The other players are each primarily concerned with operating their character in the shared game world. Both the referee and the other players will sometimes: act &amp;quot;in character&amp;quot; when portraying the behavior of their characters, generate outcome statements during conflict resolution that will guide narration, describe scenes in which one or more player-character appear, provide input to any and all other players about each of these aspects of play or anything else -- typically in the form of &amp;quot;it would be cool if this happened&amp;quot; statements, and manage character resources primarily (but not solely) during conflict resolution. The referee's additional duties include: managing narration, adjudicating statement generation during conflict resolution, interpreting conflict outcomes, and awarding resources to the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice was partially developed under the working title Diamonds Are Forever; the title was change when the working title was used by another submission in the competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
