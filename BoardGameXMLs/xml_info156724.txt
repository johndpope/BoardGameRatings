			<description>Ahoy me Hearties, now listen up, them pesky landlubbers have taken me treasure and i need you to help me get me loot back. You'll have to get some things together in order to get me treasure back: a first mate, a bunch of scoundrels for a crew, a ship, all the parts of a treasure map, and, of course, the jewels and gold coins that make up me treasure. Good luck!! But remember, beware The Kraken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player to collect 1 full set of Captain cards, 1 full set of Treasure map cards, 1 full set of Jewel Cards (which is 1 of each type of jewel, there are 6 different types of jewels in total), and the value of at least 30 gold coins in your Treasure Chest, all the while using action cards to build up your sets and thwart your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn they take two cards and play up to three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
