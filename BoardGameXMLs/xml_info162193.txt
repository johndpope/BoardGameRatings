							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadowdancer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civilized folk have always feared the night, barring themselves behind doors or comforting themselves with bonfires when the shadows grow long, rightfully wary of the creatures that prowl the darkness. Yet long ago, some learned that the best way to conquer an enemy is to embrace it. These were the first shadowdancers. Even today shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness, where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists of deception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Shadowdancer.&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: Rogue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Shadowdancers adventure for a wide variety of reasons. Many adventuring parties find shadowdancers valuable members of their teams due to their incredible stealth and ability to surprise enemies with lightning quick attacks where they&amp;rsquo;re least expected. For this reason, their services are often sought out by those groups in need of scouts or spies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
