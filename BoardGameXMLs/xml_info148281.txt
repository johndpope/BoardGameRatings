			<description>8-Bit Werewolf is played with two teams. Werewolves vs villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Up:  &lt;br/&gt;For 7-11 players use 1 narrator, 2 werewolves, doctor, seer, and the rest as villagers.&lt;br/&gt;For 12-20 add 1 more werewolf, the witch, and hunter.&lt;br/&gt;For 20 plus, use all the werewolves. &lt;br/&gt;Remove the extra villagers and randomly pass out the cards to each player. Players do not share their identity with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game begins the villagers only knowledge is the number of werewolves. The game switches back and forth between day and night. At night the werewolves eliminate one player. During the day the players converse about the murder and force a vote to eliminate one suspect. The game continues to switch between night and day until all the werewolves have been eliminated, or until the number of werewolves outnumbers the villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included Characters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)  Narrator&lt;br/&gt;5)  Werewolves&lt;br/&gt;1)  Doctor&lt;br/&gt;1)  Witch&lt;br/&gt;1)  Seer&lt;br/&gt;1)  Hunter&lt;br/&gt;14) Villagers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The narrator runs the flow of the game and does not participate as a member of either party. The narrator&amp;rsquo;s job is the most important. The feeling of the game entirely depends on their ability to keep the game interesting. It is the narrator&amp;rsquo;s job to tell the story of what happened the previous night. A narrator should make it interesting, share a story that will invoke suspense, horror, humor, and lead to a great debate. While the debate ensues the narrator should keep to themselves unless they need to step in for clarification. A narrator should never do anything to sway a vote or influence any of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seer is a villager that chooses one player to investigate every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctor is a villager, they are allowed to choose one player randomly to protect from the werewolves every night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witch has 2 potions, a Healing Potion and a Death Potion. The potions can only be used once each during the game. One used at night to resurrect someone. One used during the day to kill someone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hunter is a villager who is allowed to take one player with them when they are killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts during the day, it is best to have an odd number of players, to prevent tying votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Flow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day 1: &lt;br/&gt;The narrator invites all players to the game describes the village and allows the discussion to begin. Players begin to accuse each other of being a werewolf. Anyone can accuse any player of being a werewolf and try to persuade others to lynch them. Players are allowed to say whatever they want lie about their roll or bluff all to motivate the mob to join their cause. At any time during the discussion if a majority votes to lynch someone the round is over. The accused player is eliminated and must reveal their true identity. The game then turns to night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night:&lt;br/&gt;The narrator asks all the players close their eyes and tap one hand continuously on their leg to prevent someone hearing movement. The narrator begins by asking the werewolves to open their eyes. When the werewolves open their eyes they acknowledge the other werewolves in their pack. The werewolves picks their victim by silently pointing to the target. The narrator acknowledges that the werewolves agree on who they will kill and asks them to close their eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The narrator moves on and asks the witch to open her eyes. The narrator does this just to acknowledge the role of witch. The witch is not allowed to use her potion until night 2. If the witch decides to use her potion she points to a player she wants to kill during the night. She can also nod her head no if she does not want to use it. The narrator takes note and asks her to close her eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The narrator then asks the seer to open their eyes and they are allowed to point to one player who they believe to be a werewolf. The narrator acknowledges the players guilt or innocence by nodding. The narrator asks the seer to close their eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The narrator asks the doctor to open their eyes. The doctor points to one player who they wish to protect for the night. The narrator asks the doctor to close their eyes then asks all players to open their eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day:&lt;br/&gt;The narrator announces who died the previous night with a short story (It often becomes a contest to see which narrator can come up with the best stories). If the doctor chose the correct player to protect, the player survives the near death experience and continues in the game. If the player dies they must sit silent, they are not allowed to influence the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the narrator speaks a discussion begins and players begin to accuse each other of being a werewolf. Anyone that is still alive can participate. When the majority votes to lynch someone again the round is over. The accused player is eliminated and they must reveal their true identity. The game reverts to night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night continues just as the previous night....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over if the number of werewolves outnumber the villagers or if all the werewolves are lynched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
