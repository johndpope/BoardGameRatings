			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 10-page PDF provides the DM with 12 different tasty dishes he can make available to his players. These meals add a lot of depth to any fantasy campaign and each dish includes a description for a common inn or tavern and a fine dining establishment -- it's amazing how two different social classes can have completely different words for the same meal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are two different eating establishments. Each dish is written to be read aloud to the players and includes information on the waiter, cook, or innkeeper that is the source for the description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
