							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cave Of Stars</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cave of Stars takes it's name from the mosaic ceilings which the Orcs put in place to honour their dark gods. This simple temple acts a a centre of worship for a number of local tribal groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each 1SD product provides you with a map, using a standard 5ftx5ft square grid, which is suitable for a single session of dungeon-based play and ideal for filling in gaps in your campaign or for stringing together with two or three other maps to create a larger scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple Fantasy dungeon data is provided, making the maps more useful to GMs running that game, but the map is unpopulated and no specific game mechanics are included so that any 1SD product can be used with any role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you don&amp;rsquo;t get is the specific room descriptions, background and scenario notes which which are found in a full scenario. You also don&amp;rsquo;t get any monsters, traps or other specific hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you do get is a simple map and some basic data that can help kick-start your own creative processes. The idea is for you to populate the dungeon according to your own needs and desires, not for us to write you a scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1SD range is designed as an aid to the GM in creating their own scenarios so that you end up with something better suited to your players and your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
