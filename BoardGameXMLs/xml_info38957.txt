			<description>Pacific 1942 SunRise is the first extension of the Pacific 1942 Admiral game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out! The Pacific 1942 SunRise extension cannot be played without the basic version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It adds new elements to the basic game and thus makes the game more varied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the Pacific 1942 SunRise extension, it is necessary to know the rules of the basic version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents of the extension: &lt;br/&gt;- Five randomly selected hexagon sextets (i.e. tiles)&lt;br/&gt;- Three extra battalions of the marines, three bomber squadrons and three fighter squadrons&lt;br/&gt;- Six extra prisms, which, in the Pacific 1942 Admiral game, stand for the power and speed of ships. In Pacific 1942 SunRise extension, you will have also another use for them.&lt;br/&gt;- Eight completely new island tiles&lt;br/&gt;- 21 risk cards&lt;br/&gt;- A typhoon triplet consisting of three tiles&lt;br/&gt;- A night card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What does Pacific 1942 SunRise change?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, there is a new goal. To win the basic version, you had to seize four islands in the Pacific. Now, the task becomes even more demanding: You have to push your enemy out of all islands.&lt;br/&gt;In the basic version, a player could seize an island and that was it. In Pacific 1942 SunRise, some islands can be turned into powerful bases. (See more below.)&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the new island tiles, the risk cards represent another extremely important novelty. At the end of his or her turn, every player can decide to take a risk card instead of producing a new battle unit. (The use of these cards is specified below.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight new island tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight new island tiles comprise two sets of four tiles. Every player receives a set of four tiles. The new island tiles are of the following types:&lt;br/&gt;- A tile with a trench.&lt;br/&gt;- A tile with an airfield.&lt;br/&gt;- A tile with a harbour.&lt;br/&gt;- A tile with a fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Risk cards&lt;br/&gt;There are 16 types of risk cards in the game. Before every game, they have to be thoroughly shuffled and placed with their face down. At the end of each turn, instead of production, a player can take one risk card. You can encounter the following risk cards:&lt;br/&gt;1.Minesweeper&lt;br/&gt;2.Rudder hit&lt;br/&gt;3.Typhoon&lt;br/&gt;4.Submarine&lt;br/&gt;5.Paratroopers&lt;br/&gt;6.False token&lt;br/&gt;7.Extra production&lt;br/&gt;8.New ship&lt;br/&gt;9.Lifeboat&lt;br/&gt;10.Reconnaissance&lt;br/&gt;11.Fleet&lt;br/&gt;12.SunRise&lt;br/&gt;13.Open Card&lt;br/&gt;14.Waves&lt;br/&gt;15.Night&lt;br/&gt;16.Last moment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Pacific 1942 Admiral&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
