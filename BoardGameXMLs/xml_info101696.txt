			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sun shines down on the clear, blue waters of the Southern Ocean, that vast body of water which is all that stands between the great continent of Khul and the edge of the world. A ship sails peacefully through these waters, its green sails flapping slightly in the light breeze. The ship is The Lone Dolphin, home of a crew who have dedicated their lives for adventure, glory and the eradication of the evils that infest the high seas. You know all this, for you are the ship's heroic and beloved captain and you have led your valiant crew through many an adventure, but none so great as the one you are just about to embark on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your crew had been returning from an adventure to track down pirates which had fled to the far off Isles of Dawn. With the pirates successfully thwarted and their leader killed, you decided to leave the strange, foreign lands of the Isles of Dawn with their unpredictable inhabitants and return to your home city of Kish, a large city-state on the southern coast of Khul. You are a few days&amp;rsquo; sail from the entrance to the Inland Sea where Kish is situated, when you pass a very small island, maybe not even a square mile in size, and with only a few coconut trees upon it...and one man dressed in rags signalling madly for you to stop and pick him up. Never one to leave a fellow human being in a plight, you order the helmsman to land on the island. Once this is done, you and your first mate, a sturdy fellow by the name of Ali, approach the ragged man. Who knows what adventures this encounter might lead to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
