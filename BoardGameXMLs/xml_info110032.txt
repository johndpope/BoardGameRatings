			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Know, brave wanderers, that we live in the dawn of a terrible new age. Our great-grandfathers&lt;br/&gt;speak of an age undreamed of, a shining time of plenty, when the wilderness was&lt;br/&gt;not so wild to us and the earth was our mother who provided all things. That was before&lt;br/&gt;drought and famine set each tribe at the throats of its rivals. Before the sorcerer-slavers came&lt;br/&gt;across the salt-foamed sea from Atlantis and stole a generation of our people, or the Sea&lt;br/&gt;Wolves turned the coast into a red tide of blood and slaughter. Before the Shenites and Skadians&lt;br/&gt;came with their new gods and strange ways, and before we knew the fear of Ruskar&lt;br/&gt;war parties. More ominous still are the dark storm clouds gathering on spiritual horizons.&lt;br/&gt;The spirits were once our guides and allies, but now, with the coming of the mists, terrible&lt;br/&gt;beasts that have no place in a sane world stalk through the otherworldly vapors. Our future&lt;br/&gt;is pregnant with dangers unimagined. Stay awhile and sit by the warmth of the fire, for it&lt;br/&gt;is a wise youth who will listen to what an aging warrior has lived to know.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- Unknown Elder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hail wise one. Are you ready to master a vibrant new world of swords and sorcery drawn from a tapestry of ancient legend and feverish nightmare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That power is now yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Untamed Lands are your canvas for painting unlimited tales of high adventure, glory and woe.
