			<description>(Original title: Приключения на луне) The goal of the game is to rescue a lost spaceship on the moon and bring it back to the lunar base. It consists of two parts. During the first part, players roll dice to land on different locations on the moon map, collecting points for doing so. Some of the locations may have the lost spaceship. As soon as the lost spaceship is rescued, everyone moves back to the base, collecting additional points along the way. This game is mostly luck but features an accurate lunar map and encourages players to learn lunar locations and some noteworthy lunar missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
