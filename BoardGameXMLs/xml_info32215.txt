			<description>Trick-taking card game of the Pepys Series Card Games, as usual well produced and designed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 44 cards: 12 class cards, 2 helicopter cards and 30 trio cards(depicting various planes in different classes and point value).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to win cards with tricks.&lt;br/&gt;After dealing out the hand further cards are turned up until a class card appears. Players then choose 3 cards from their hands which they believe give a good point value vs. the class.&lt;br/&gt;The packs are revealed simultaneously, winner of the trick is the one with the most point value (helicopters belonging to every class).&lt;br/&gt;The winner also takes all the cards exposed by the other players depicting the class.&lt;br/&gt;When the last class card has been played for the game ends and all the tricks are valued with a special count score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is the same as in the CAR GAME and GIRL from the same publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
