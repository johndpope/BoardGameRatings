			<description>Perfect Earth Explorer is a card game in which 2 players (ages 7+) get to introduce a rich variety of animals to their own Rainforest, which they first have to grow from a diversity of habitats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each game, every player draws an explorer card with a unique mission. Players take turns, which typically consist of drawing a card and playing a card. Players will have to play Rainforest habitat cards before they can start to introduce animals to their Rainforest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain habitat cards allow only certain animal categories to be introduced, whereas other habitat cards will allow any animal to be placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That brings us to the animal cards. We have included 36 animal cards in the game. There are 6 animal categories, each of which feature 6 animal cards. The category is specified with the help of a small icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 of the 36 animals are in fact threatened animal species, indicated by the red circle behind the animal. Each animal card is worth a certain amount of points. Threatened species typically generate more points than common species. But placing an animal in its favorite habitat will also trigger bonus points, etc. To add some charm, we have included short facts on every animal card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one more card type we have to introduce to you. We have included 12 event cards to make the game less predictable and to help balancing of the game. We believe the event cards are also a great way to add some extra emotion to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players introduces a 10th species to his or her rainforest, at which time the point total of both players is calculated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
