			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World is Steeped in Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is everywhere and courses through all things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some claim that Magic is fueled by Ether. Others claim it is a Divine gift granted to those chosen by Providence. Still others claim that Magic is not a gift, but a curse. And some claim that Magic is a tool of the Devil, created to further his Infernal ends on earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of these claims comes close to the Whole Truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic is a Force of Nature, whose Secrets all may uncover with Time and Wisdom. Yet Magic is also a Danger to those unwilling to treat it with the Respect such a Force deserves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the Danger, some still dare to take up the Study of Magic and to use its Power. Even in this Modern Age, new Discoveries are made about the Workings of Magic. New Insights reveal Power many deemed impossible. Those Discoveries can be found here: spells, witchcraft, talismans, &amp;amp; relics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you willing to face the Danger and uncover the Secrets of Magic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Richard Iorio II (Colonial Gothic, Shadow, Sword &amp;amp; Spell: Basic and Shadow, Sword &amp;amp; Spell: Expert), The Grimoire is your guide to the magic found in the world of Colonial Gothic. Between its covers you will find powerful new spells, means to contact the mind shattering Elder Gods, relics of mysterious origins, and tomes of ancient knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
