							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Upgrade Complete 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade complete 2 is a shootemup, once again you have to spend money to upgrade not only your ship, but the music, sound effects, graphics, title screen, just about anything you can imagine and more. This game like the first one has almost no challenge in the gameplay, your ship cannot be damaged and there is no penalty to replay a level. It's more about deciding what kind of ship you want to build, and seeing the various upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
