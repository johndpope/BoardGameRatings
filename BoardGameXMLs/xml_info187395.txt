							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trio of Taverns (Pathfinder Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trio of Taverns, the third installment in the Tangible Taverns line, features not one, but, you guessed it, three taverns.  Give your players the chance to explore what happens when a capable barbarian known for beheading his opponents falls in love with jam making and settles down to open his own shop, or let your players try to seduce a city noble by taking her to the classiest and most romantic tavern in town, or just stick with the basics and let them dance the night away with great entertainment and delicious food, while avoiding the shadier elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instalment of Tangible Taverns brings you three smaller scale taverns each with rumour and event tables, a tavern map, and a description of frequent faces about the establishment (which include names, physical features and personalities for some tavern employees and patrons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all that, more original artwork than ever before, and &amp;quot;More Faces at the Tavern&amp;quot;, featuring NPCs ready to be slotted into the tavern your PCs are visiting, you are all set to have some role-playing fun when your PCs stop off for a drink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the troublesome mischievous creature we are named after, dire rugrat publishing delights in bringing a little excitement to what could have otherwise been a peaceful, though perhaps comparably dull evening at the local tavern. Our line of books, Tangible Taverns, is designed to bring life back to the much visited watering hole, a common setting while adventurers are on the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
