			<description>This is an unofficial fan-made expansion released to the public with permission from Cryptozoic Entertainment, publisher of The Walking Dead Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Streets of Atlanta is a dice-based expansion for The Walking Dead Board Game that expands the core game to a whole new experience. Visit four of six locations, then return to either the camp or the prison. Use new weapons and fate cards to survive the zombie apocalypse &amp;mdash; but beware because if you die, you turn against your fellow survivors. All you'll want is their brains. Good hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Streets of Atlanta allows up to six players to compete with newly designed character cards to match the look of season three of the AMC TV show The Walking Dead.

Are you a good guy or a bad one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Added 18 different types of INCIDENT Cards for unpredictable board incidents (total 20 cards)&lt;br/&gt;This is also a brand new deck of cards. Incident Cards are drawn, if you roll a 1 on the incident die. The card will tell you, what happens to the board, survivors and/or walkers. They may be good or bad. You may change your strategy to some incidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Added Prison Map Tile (Alternate Camp)&lt;br/&gt;You can head back with your 4 Locations to the Camp or try the saver way to the new Prison.
