							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BURPS</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Master (GM) should be familiar with GURPS. This is just a&lt;br/&gt;Character Sheet for the trepidatious player, or for kids. GURPS LITE is a perfect companion to BURPS because it is a quick reference. Use the listings for Advantages, Disadvantages, and Skills. I put a lot of characteristics under Advantages to simplify the game. This means if the player wants to speak more than one language, be gorgeous and have social status, this is all to be bought as Advantages. Generally, Advantages are purchased at the beginning of the game, Skills are bought throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;There are no dodge/parry/damage resistance rolls. Instead, the GM should make up (based on their own dice rolls) the details of how a fight goes. If the kids want more specific results for a fight, look at GURPS LITE to add damage, etc. But I advise the GM to use their judgment on damage to speed up fights. This will be heavy on the GM, but lighter on the players. The GM may allow the player to describe the fight depending on the dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;Shape-shifting can be an Advantage, but Basic Attributes for that shape must be bought-starting from 5, not 10. Then it&amp;rsquo;s another 10pts to add 1 to any Basic Attribute in that shape. I mention this because the first game of BURPS had a boy who wanted to be a&lt;br/&gt;dragon shape-shifter. I let him be able to turn into a dragon- rolling DX for success- but he was pretty weak and stupid until he gained enough points to put into that shape&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
