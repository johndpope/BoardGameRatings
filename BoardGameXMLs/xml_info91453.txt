			<description>Each player has a pool of cards depicting a portion of a scene.  On a player's turn, the player takes stock of their cards with an eye toward matching what they have with the cards that are in the center of the group. The mass of cards depicts a larger series of events, mostly involving kids at play.  As there is only one correct way to piece the cards together, play is similar to putting together a puzzle.  The player to get rid of all their cards first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
