			<description>There once was an era in which the earth was inhabited by gods, humans, and an evil deity from the underworld known as the Demon God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the flag of the holy maiden Vitoria, humans fought against the spirits, or monsters, who worked as the Demon's pawns for ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ndash; God's Era, Year 395.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technique for capturing monsters into a magical tome called a Sealbook was invented by the first royal alchemist, Siegdrad. A new, special class called Libras handled this sealing magic, and they garnered tremendous results in regard to monster suppression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to their efforts, the monsters' population plummeted, and eventually the Demon God herself was sealed away. The world began to operate under the rule of humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then came the King's Era, Year 1. Vitoria had achieved continental unification through the hard work of mankind, and succeeded the throne as First Queen of the Kingdom of Romulea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom of Romulea Founding History &amp;ndash; Chapter 1, Section 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some time has passed. It is now the King's Era, Year 499...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stage is the Royal Library of the Kingdom of Romulea. Here begins a new story...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
