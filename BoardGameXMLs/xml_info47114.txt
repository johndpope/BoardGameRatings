			<description>Hong Kong Action Theatre: Cinematic Action Role Playing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovative RPG put the emphasis on style over performance. Who had the best weapons or skills mattered less than which actor was the bigger star, or whose character was more crucial to the plot. Similar ideas would follow in RPGs like Feng Shui.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher &amp;quot;The world of blazing guns, flying fists, and flashing blades awaits you in HONG KONG ACTION THEATRE! All of the high-octane action, unbelievable stunts, and fast pace of your favorite Hong Kong action films can be found within these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a ground-breaking new style of playing that simulates every aspect of the action film, and produced in association with the Hong Kong film industry, HKAT! is the definitive game of the genre, with more kung fu, more explosions, and more Uzi-toting thugs than you can shake a REALLY BIG GUN at!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the game features full source material for the settings of Hong Kong and China, profiles of industry luminaries such as John Woo, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat and Bruce Lee, as well as over a hundred entries detailing some of the best of Hong Kong action films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advisory: Hong Kong Action Theatre!, like the film genre it emulates, contains heavy doses of violence. To be sure, the violence depicted could in no way be termed 'realistic', but we here at Event Horizon Productions recognize the dangers inherent in the glorification of any form of violence. This product is intended for mature gamers who know the difference between reality and fantasy. Parental discretion is strongly advised.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
