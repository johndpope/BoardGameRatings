			<description>This map is an unofficial fan made expansion. Symbols &amp;amp; Graphics Copyright &amp;copy; 2004-2015 Days of Wonder, Inc. Produced with permission of Days of Wonder, for non-commercial use only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This follows the principles of the Ticket to Ride - Rails and Sails game on a special board with special cards and rules. The object of the game is to gain the most points by travelling various routes and outwitting other players. You will need the train ,ship and harbour pieces and the train and ship cards from Ticket to Ride - Rails and Sails base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an extra set of Tourist cards for the cities, each with a value to be earned by visiting that city. These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 9 bonuses give you extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many new options in the rules: exchange all your cards at the start but keep all the new ones: discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn: earn extra points: and many more. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
