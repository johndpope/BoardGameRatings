							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nebtauy: The Pharaoh Conspiracy</name>
									
			<description>The game brings you back to three thousands and two hundreds years ago, at the court of the great Pharaoh Ramses III, in the ancient Egypt; there you can play as one of the characters (Artisan, Chantress, Embalmer, Noble Woman, Physician, Priest, Scribe, Soldier) who eavesdrop the conspirators plotting to murder the Pharaoh. In order to save him and to gain a never ending grant from him, you will travel through the Theben Necropolis to the Karnak Temple Complex and, in the end, you will enter the Royal Palace to defeat the conspirators! The setting, philological correct, reproduce the real story told in the Judicial Papyrus of Turin, held in the Egyptian Museum of Turin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To cross the Nile and get to the next area you need to get enough power, fame and wealth to gain a level and the pertaining title; you can increase those stats by com pleating a specific quest or by chance, slot by slot, by facing the card(s) you will draw: only if you have the right title you can enter the Temple or the Royal Palace!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you can trade with other characters simply being in the same spot, but beware of the hired assassin hiding among you. At the beginning of the game, each player draw one of the eight tiles from a sack and hide it to others: the bloody tile changes your goal from save to slay the Pharaoh. When the hired assassin meets another character, he/she can choose to kill the other character or to pretend to be like anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
