			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It began with the King's obsession over his prize bull. A gift from the gods, they said. Then came the Queen's visit in the night, followed by days in father's workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine months passed and all seemed forgotten until the Queen gave birth to her fourth child. Some said the baby died, others said it was no human child. Once more, father began his work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumours spread about the construction of a great prison and what would be housed within. Talk continued to spread about the completed maze into which seven boys and seven girls vanished every year. Father refused to speak of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then one day Minos' Sentinels arrived at the door. By order of the King, father was to be imprisoned within the labyrinth of his own creation. He followed in silence, leaving you alone in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find your father, you must enter the baffling labyrinth. All you have is your sling, whatever bits and pieces you could scavenge from your father's workshop, and the plans for what was to be your father's greatest invention: flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
