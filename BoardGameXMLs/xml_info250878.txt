			<description>Rebel nox is a card game with shifting alliances and a hint of social deduction. It is a stand-alone game set in the world of Capital Lux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebel Nox is played similar to a trick taking game with some important differences: Each trick is a fight over a certain location, and each location alter the rules  of the game in some way. Each player is assigned one of two sides (rebels or loyalists), and you must make sure that your side wins the most tricks. Players may switch teams during the game, so you must find out who is on your side, and secretly try to tilt the table to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                &lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game flow: &lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, 6 locations are placed in the middle of the table and each player is dealt 9 cards. If you have a rebel card in hand, you are on the rebel side - if not, you are on the loyalist side (cards are kept secret).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is dealt the 1st rebel card chooses a location for the first fight. Each location influences the game play in a different way.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Some cards have special symbols that affect who wins the fight (e.g. the assassin takes out the highest card), or how much the current fight is worth (flags increase the value of the location).  &lt;br/&gt;Special cards should of course be played to allow your side to win points, and what cards players play may hint to what side they are on. But sometimes players are forced to play suboptimally to follow suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some locations and special cards cause cards to change hands - which may result in players changing sides. After all 6 locations have been won, players reveal their 3 remaining hand cards to show what side they are on. Players are awarded medals for their won locations, and all players on the side that won the most points are awarded bonus medals. If the players on the winning side have a total of at least 35 medals, they win the game. If not, another round is played, until the players on a winning team collectively have at least 35 medals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
