			<description>It is the year 2592. After countless years of war and struggle, the Defense of United Colonies (DUC) has triumphed against the Galactic Ordered Terrorists (GOT). Humanity now has high hopes for this new Era, as everywhere people attempt to rebuild the devastated worlds of the UC. &lt;br/&gt;But its hopes were dashed to pieces as a new enemy, the Horde, rose through the depths of the planet, Telocto, ravishing its colonists, and breaching evacuation ships, got to new planets. In a matter of a few months, over half of the UC&amp;rsquo;s planets were infected. The only known way to defeat them is to glass infected planets, destroying any life support that planet has. On the planet known as Sow, a force of seasoned, grizzled veterans, known as the Condors, attempt one last stand, before they are exterminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condors of Sow is a cooperative game for 1-4 players, as they attempt to complete each mission. Using a token and a pencil for each player you will have three actions on your turn: move, attack, pick up an item, revive player, reload, or overkill move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After players move, The Horde move, by having players mark one dot at the end of a predetermined number lines closest to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this game needs is a player sheet, a map, and a pencil and token per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the use of multiple weapons and tactics. You must use cover, or you will die. Fight hard Condors! Humanity&amp;rsquo;s last hope is you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
