							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All the President&#039;s Zombies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. President, we have zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the center of power in the free world. This adventure focuses on a meeting between the President of the United States and many of his top advisors. They are discussing the development of what seems to be zombies in the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game calls for eight players and one Game Master, playing those advisors and the President. No other game masters are needed for the scenario. The game can be played in two to four hours, depending on how events are paced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This live action role-playing game (LARP) is centered around a meeting of the President of the United States and some of the highest members of his government to decide a course of action on an outbreak of zombies that has developed in the rural South, near Atlanta, GA. The conflict that will drive this event will be the different political agendas that each member of the meeting is trying to put forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
