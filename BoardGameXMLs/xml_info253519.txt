			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call That a Knife? sees a strange woman pulled out of the sea at a port. The woman is wearing tight-fitting armour and has unusual weapons, which she immediately attacks her rescuers with, killing several. The characters hear about this attack and may pursue the woman, who is travelling across the town's roofs, as she tries to escape. The woman speaks no known language; it isn't known who or what she is or why she is attacking everyone who approaches her&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is aimed at d100 systems but is generic enough in nature to be adapted to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter and one is ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
