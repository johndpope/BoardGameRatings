			<description>Wyvern Pass Not is a tile placement-solitaire game for the Decktet. It is an adaptation of a flash game by Sandhill Games Ring Pass Not&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a great mage, represented by the excuse, taming the wyvern; put it in front of yourself in a way that the little fool is standing up. As the mage you need to create a ring of protection before the wyvern breaths fire upon you. Well a wyvern, or a balrog, or whatever please you because the nature of the Decktet you could represent whatever battle, or characters, or universe that please you, well, always when the story to represent must be the creation of a protection against a superior physical or magical power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must create a ring of eight tiles (Decktet cards) in a perfect circle with perfect links to win. Each link is formed by two cards that share a common suit. The player takes the tiles/cards from a drawing pool of four cards. The player can deal new cards onto the drawing pool but this will deplete its maximum number of cards by -1. If the player deplete all his drawing pool, or form a ring with not-working links, he loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules at the Decktet wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://decktet.wikidot.com/game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://decktet.wikidot.com/game&lt;/a&gt;:wyvern-pass-not&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
