							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends and Lore: The Philippines</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a non-canon addendum to Legends &amp; Lore, featuring new deities taken from Philippine folklore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situated in the South China Sea between China, Indochina and the islands of Indonesia, the cluster of islands known as the Philippines have always been a virtual crossroads of cultures. The islands were once inhabited by nation-states, much like the American Indians of North America, and each of these nation-states had their own mythology, their own culture, and their own belief systems. Unlike Greece, Rome, Egypt or Norway, however, the Philippines never really attained a unified culture and thus never gained a unified mythology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
