			<description>Given a learning objective, the learner will be able to classify it in terms of the content/performance matrix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar in several ways to Rummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make a play, the player must hold a minimum of three cards that fit together in the matrix. These may be any combination of &amp;quot;kind,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;level,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; cards. For example, three &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; cards of the same kind or type, two fact &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; cards and a &amp;quot;FACT&amp;quot; card, or a remember fact &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; card with a &amp;quot;REMEMBER&amp;quot; card and a &amp;quot;FACT&amp;quot; card. After three cards have been laid down, any related card can be added to the set. To begin another set, a minimum of three cards is required.&lt;br/&gt;When the &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; pile is used up, the round is over. Each player counts the number of &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; cards they have played (do not count &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; cards) and receives 1 point for each. Players with &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; cards remaining in their hands must subtract 1 point for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     16 &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot; cards (3 each: Fact, Concept, Procedure, Principle)&lt;br/&gt;     12 &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; cards (3 each: Remember, Use, Find)&lt;br/&gt;     33 &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
