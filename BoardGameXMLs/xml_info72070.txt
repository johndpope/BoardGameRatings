							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyber Sneak</name>
									
			<description>Set in the far future, where the innocent are arrested for mere thoughts, one man is making a break for freedom. Players take control of the innocent man and his hacker friend and work together to outfox the automated prison guards and weapon systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single board represents both the physical jail and the equivalent cyber world. As the heros move around the board they collect information in the form of cards that can be played to disable the jails defences, thereby making it easier to reach the goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as fixed on-board obstructions the player has to avoid or deal with game controlled robots that move and patrol the jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
