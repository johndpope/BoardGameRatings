							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Victory&#039;s Vault Volume 2, Issue 07</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Every Item Touched by Victory!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; Lady Nike Wondderra claims to be the keeper of the vaults of the goddess of Victory, and in the pages of Victory's Vault, she offers these items to adventurers and villains alike at remarkable prices!  Each installment of Victory's Vaults includes...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fine selection of weapons of the Era&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique item of armor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vehicle the suit the needs of hero and/or villain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;white elephant,&amp;quot; such as a new animal, a playable Package, some new Special Abilities, or a place to explore and perhaps purchase!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes some notes on how Lady Wonderra pitches these fine items, and the potential benefits (or consequences!) of haggling.  Want more stuff? You can't do much better than to look in Victory's Vault!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for the Victory System; you will need the Core Rulebook to play.  We will also be using material from our supplement Beasts of Victory, you may want a copy for reference.  As always, the items (and/or abilities) in this book can be modified and adapted to your specific needs with the use of the Victory System Equipment Manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
