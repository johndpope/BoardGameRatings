							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supersurf! Championship Sky-Surfing in the World of Judge Dredd</name>
									
			<description>Supersurf is a game of championship-level sky-surfing, or power-boarding, in the world of Judge Dredd. Each player creates a surfer and a custom board, and races to the finish line, braving dangerous obstacles, at great heights and great speeds through one of 2000AD&amp;rsquo;s Mega-Cities. Four &amp;ldquo;Supersurfs&amp;rdquo; have been depicted in the pages of 2000AD. Marlon &amp;ldquo;Chopper&amp;rdquo; Shakespeare won Supersurf 7, held illegally in Mega-City One. Supersurf 10, held legally in Oz, was won by Jug &amp;ldquo;the Wizard of Oz&amp;rdquo; Mackenzie, winner of the undocumented Supersurfs 8 and 9. Supersurf 11, a blood sport in Mega-City Two, was won by Chopper, as was Supersurf 13, back in Mega-City Two &amp;ndash; then being rebuilt as a new Sino-City, and without the bloodbath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Supersurf, surfers are represented by attributes such as Guts, Skill, and Form, which are required to bypass the many obstacles placed throughout the course. The course is  created semi-cooperatively by the players out of straightaway and obstacle tiles and differs each game. Attributes can decrease as a result of injuries, and must be managed like resources. Obstacles of varying types and difficulty levels present different challenges, and players have the options of setting speeds, bumping and jockeying for position, resting and recuperating, flying cautiously or flat-out. With wipe-outs always around the corner, no player is ever out of the game until after the final sprint for the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
