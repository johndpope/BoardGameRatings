							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armoured Clash</name>
									
			<description>Armoured Clash is a game designed to recreate massed armoured battles in the alternate Victorian super science fiction world of Dystopian Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not for the faint hearted, these rules and fast and furious, allowing the very largest and most epic world changing battles from this alternate history to be brought to your gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Armoured Clash, full brigades of gargantuan tanks perform vast advances on deep defensive lines, capture entire cities or raze towns as they wrestle across the continents of a war-torn world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each commander has at their disposal full regiments of steam powered armoured vehicles; all comprised of dozens of colossal iron monsters and thousands of men. These mammoth creations are supported by great zeppelins and other, more esoteric, flying machines, destructive long range artillery and anything else the finest scientific minds of the era can conjure to wage their war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commanders are able to customise their brigade to the task at hand and match their preferred way of fighting through their choice of battalions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armoured Clash is a standalone, comprehensive game, ideal for playing out the greatest land battles depicted in the Dystopian Wars history, from the entirety of the Second Battle of Waterloo as described in Storm of Steel to Operation Bear Trap featured in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule system is suited to any style of play, from highly competitive tournament games to campaigns of linked scenarios between friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepare your forces, make your battleplan, and ready yourself for the Armoured Clash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
