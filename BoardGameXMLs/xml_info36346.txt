			<description>&amp;quot;XXX rated card game. Players score points for sexual exploits they create through card combinations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of over 100 cards which are named for Partners, Places, Positions, Pluses, and Spoilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players draw and discard from a hand of seven cards attempting to play a combination of as many cards as possible. Each combination must have one Partner, one Place, one or more Positions, and one or more Plus cards. However, one opponent may play a Spoiler card to reduce the value of a combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends once the deck runs out. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
