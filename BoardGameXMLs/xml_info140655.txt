							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Pimp Daddy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a Pimp Daddy is all about being seen, being cooler than cool, being the stylish cat rolling through town in a limo with a jacuzzi in the back, your two best hos in the tub with you, and twenty more hos out there walking the streets for you. You want to call yourself a Pimp Daddy, you better live up to the job. You better show up in gold and furs, sporting a diamond grill, Ingram Mac 10 one hand and a tall glass of Crunk Juice in the other. You&amp;rsquo;re going to need a girl for each arm, a good pair of fists and an even better line on your lips at all time, and enough green to buy a small island. The new feats created in this sourcebook are intended to be compatible with the standard rules for D20 Modern, and you can easily integrate them in to your local game. In this Sourcebook there are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Blackmail: Nobody wants you angry, because they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of what you know, and what you&amp;rsquo;ll say.&lt;br/&gt;     Dress to Impress: You wear only big name designers and multi-thousand dollar jewels, and always look your best.&lt;br/&gt;     Local Hero: You are a local celebrity, extremely well known in a specific city or neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;     Sexual Healin&amp;rsquo;: Marvin Gaye said it best. Sometimes you just need a little bit of sexual medicine.&lt;br/&gt;     Street Dealer: Your product is widely regarded as the best shit on the street; your reputation as a drug chemist is unquestioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 6 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Sanctuary: City of Secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
