			<description>&amp;ldquo;Zombies all around us&amp;rdquo; is a CO-OP 1 or 2 player turn based card game using grid movement, dice rolls and a tower defense mechanic.  The game is made up of only 9 cards and 18d6 and has a game time of 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in either a 4/6 room house or 4/6 room tavern.  The players will take turns trying to stay alive through the night for either 18 or 24 turns; represented as hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies have overrun the city and the players have found safety in an abandoned house/tavern.  As the zombies attack, the player must try to build makeshift weapons to destroy the zombies attacking the access points &amp;quot;doors/windows&amp;quot;.  The players can also search to try and find a real weapon &amp;quot;pistol/shotgun&amp;quot; to destroy even more zombies at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the zombies will randomly attack a window or door at any of the 4/6 rooms, with sometimes 2 zombies attacking at once.  When the zombies reach a max of 6 zombies at a door/window and are not blocked by reinforcing the barricades, they break into the house/tavern and takeover the room.  If 2 or more rooms are lost to the zombies the game ends.  If either player dies before the 18/24 turns are up, the games ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a zombie is destroyed they are worth 1 point and 5 points for a super zombie. If the players lose any health they subtract 1 point per health lost.  If a real weapon is found and used a one-time -10 point deduction is made to the total points.  The players are not only trying to survive the night but also reach the highest zombie hit count possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
