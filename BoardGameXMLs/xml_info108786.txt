							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Supplicant</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forged from the resolve of a single tortured soul, the Supplicant is willing to give up everything to become that which they are devoted to destroy. They are a force of divine power bent on the destruction of the zombie hordes which plague Aruneus and have sworn a sacred oath to themselves to fight until the last of the undead are destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet The Supplicant - the latest addition to the World of Aruneus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supplicants are a class that draws from the reserve of the ambient divine power. Through their utter devotion to their cause, they can tap this in a way others cannot. They have two major roles. To move through this world as freely as possible, even in the presence of the undead, causing as much damage to them as possible is their first role. Their second roll is to make survival easier for others left alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Supplicants are a new addition to the world or Aruneus and their numbers are not great. There are thought to be less than two hundred Supplicants currently alive today. Because of their history, they are generally violently opposed to the Order of the White Cloth, and place some of the blame for the zombie apocalypse on the Order&amp;rsquo;s shoulders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the Supplicant can, for a time, make themselves immune to detection from  Contagion Infected Zombies, they are incredibly formidable foes against them. Anyone who has seen a Supplicant take the field single handed against a horde of zombies and emerge alive and unscathed can attest to this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
