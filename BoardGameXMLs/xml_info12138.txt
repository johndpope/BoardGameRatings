			<description>Boxscorepad Baseball is subtitled, &amp;quot;The Original Instant Fantasy Baseball Game&amp;quot; (TM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's very similar to a fantasy baseball league, except that it lasts one game (or series) instead of one season.  Players of Boxscorepad Baseball are called &amp;quot;owners&amp;quot; to distinguish them from baseball players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two owners will watch a baseball game, either on television or in person, or listen to it on the radio.  (You can also check box scores in a newspaper, having chosen players in advance.)  They take turns choosing players from the starting lineups - it doesn't matter which teams their choices are on.  You can have two players from one team and one from the other, for example.  In addition, each owner chooses one player that the other player must take!  No one may take a pitcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded for various hits, stolen bases, RBIs, and runs scored.  Points are subtracted for errors made.  A tie-breaker is provided, as are rules for three- and four-game series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
