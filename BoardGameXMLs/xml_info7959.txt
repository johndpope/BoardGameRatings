			<description>&amp;quot;The world is filled with guys is tights with some power that they think makes 'em better than the average Joe. And every joker in a union suit is lookin' to slug it out to prove they're king 'o the heap. So, whenever two sets of supers meet, they're bound to throw down. Bring 'em on!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each boxed set includes 18 random dice (3 rare, 6 uncommon, and 9 common), plus full-color cards representing street sections, cut-out counters and a rulebook. This expandable game lets you pit the X-Men against their most famous enemies using dice to represent the various mutants and non-mutants. Each die contains symbols representing the powers and strength of each attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
