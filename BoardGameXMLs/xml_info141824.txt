			<description>In OXYGIN, players make words from letters of the same suit, and &amp;quot;Gin&amp;quot; when they have a hand full of words. A bonus is received for playing the longest word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds with players taking multiple turns per round. The first player to begin the game is the player to the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left. A player&amp;rsquo;s turn is comprised of three steps (take a card, discard a card, and declare &amp;quot;Gin&amp;quot; if possible) and once completed, the next player going clockwise has their turn, and so on. This continues until the endgame is triggered for the round by a player who declared &amp;quot;Gin&amp;quot; during their turn. All players reveal their hand and any words are challenged (if needed). The player with the longest word wins the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
