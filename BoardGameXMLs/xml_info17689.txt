			<description>This is a 2 player game. Each player has a frame in which 12 disks are placed (3 each of 4 different colors). The disks can slide across an S-shaped track. There are two junctions where some disks can be slid of the main track in order to change the sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also chips available in the same colors as the disks (green, red, blue yellow). Chips are drawn until the 3rd chip of the same color is drawn. Players then have to change the sequence of the disks (by sliding across the tracks and using the junctions) in order to match the sequence of the drawn chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First one to form the correct order wins the chips. Play continues until all chips are drawn. The player with the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
